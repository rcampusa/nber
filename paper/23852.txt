This paper constructs new estimates of the air pollution and greenhouse gas costs from long-
distance movement of petroleum products by rail and pipelines. While crude oil transportation
has generated intense policy debate about rail and pipeline spills and accidents, important
externalities – air pollution and greenhouse gas costs – have been largely overlooked. Using data
for crude oil transported out of North Dakota in 2014, this paper finds that air pollution and
greenhouse gas costs are nearly twice as large for rail as for pipelines. Moreover, our estimates
of air pollution and greenhouse gas costs are much larger than estimates of spill and accidents
costs. In particular, they are more than twice as big for rail and more than eight times as big for
pipelines. Our findings indicate that the policy debate surrounding crude oil transportation has put
too much relative weight on accidents and spills, while overlooking a far more serious source of
external cost: air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

1. Introduction

        This paper constructs new estimates of the air pollution, greenhouse gas, and spill

and accident costs associated with the long-distance movement of petroleum products by

rail and pipelines. Movements of petroleum products, particularly crude oil, have

received enormous media attention. Almost all of the attention has focused on spill and

accident costs despite the fact that air pollution and greenhouse gas costs are also likely

to be significant.

        Pollution emissions for pipelines and rail differ from one another in three

important ways. First, while emissions from trains occur along the transportation route,

emissions from pipelines manifest at the power plants that generate the electricity

consumed by pumping stations. The distance between these power plants and the

associated pumping stations can be quite large. Second, ground-level emissions, such as

those from locomotives, tend to be more harmful than the same level of emissions

released from tall smokestacks at power stations (Muller and Mendelsohn, 2009). Third,

the existing railroad infrastructure moves goods through population centers. In contrast,

power plants are typically located in less densely-populated areas. This difference

matters for pollution exposure, because the emissions from trains moving through cities

are likely to contact many more people than those emitted at power plants.

        To construct our estimates, we use data on locomotive diesel consumption,

pipeline pumping station electricity consumption, locomotive and power plant emission

factors, and the AP2 integrated assessment model, which maps county level emissions to

costs for counties affected by the emissions. Estimates are constructed for movements of

crude oil from North Dakota in 2014, a year in which roughly half of the crude oil was




                                                                                              2
shipped to refineries by rail and half was shipped by pipelines. Locomotive diesel

consumption is estimated based on movements of crude oil from the Surface

Transportation Confidential Waybill Sample and industry data on average ton-miles per

gallon. Our approach to estimating diesel consumption is similar to that taken by U.S.

Department of State (2014). Pipeline pumping station electricity data is from Genscape

(2014). The AP2 integrated assessment model estimates changes in county-level air

pollution based on changes in emissions and an air transport model. The AP2 model then

uses census data on population and other county characteristics together with peer

reviewed concentration-response functions and valuations of outcomes used by the EPA

in order to construct estimates of county-level damages. We construct estimates of spill

and accident costs from Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration

(PHMSA) regulatory impact analyses.

       Our analysis has two main findings. First, air pollution and greenhouse gas costs

are substantially larger for rail than for pipelines. For shipments of crude oil from North

Dakota to the Gulf Coast in 2014, the air pollution costs and greenhouse gas costs are

nearly twice as large for rail as for pipelines. Second, air pollution and greenhouse gas

costs are much larger than spill and accidents costs. We find that air pollution and

greenhouse gas costs are more than twice as big as spill and accident costs for rail and

more than eight times as big for pipelines. Our findings indicate that the policy debate

surrounding crude oil transportation has put too much relative weight on accidents and

spills, while overlooking a far more serious source of external cost: air pollution and

greenhouse gas emissions.




                                                                                              3
          The comparisons between crude oil movements by rail and pipelines extend to

other petroleum products. 1 In addition to transporting crude oil, the nation’s rail system

moves significant quantities of other petroleum products. These include processed

petroleum products, propane, butane, isobutane, biodiesel and ethanol, all of which can

be moved either by rail or by pipeline. Figure 1 shows data from the American

Association of Railroads on the weekly numbers of carloads or intermodal units shipped

of petroleum and petroleum products show that shipments fell from about 16,000

carloads per week in 2014 to slightly less than 10,000 carloads per week in 2017. Most

of the decline is attributable to declines in the movement of crude oil after 2014. Thus,

while declining crude oil prices have led rail shipments of crude to decline over the last 3

years, movements of other petroleum products still occur in significant quantities.

Further, if crude oil prices rise again, movements of crude oil by rail may increase again

as well.



2. Background

          Figure 2 shows that oil production in the United States increased tremendously

beginning in 2008. One driving factor was the rise of production in the Bakken Field,

which is primarily located in North Dakota. As a result of this rapid increase in

production, in 2014 North Dakota was the third largest producer of oil in the United

States after Texas and the federal offshore region in the Gulf Coast.

          Shippers send oil to the location that provides them with the largest revenue net of

transportation cost (termed “netbacks”). Firms move oil to a rail or pipeline terminal

 The estimates will differ with the specifics of the pipelines used to move the products, but the qualitative findings will
be similar.



                                                                                                                         4
using either truck or gathering pipelines.2 Our analysis focuses on the long distance

transportation of crude oil and excludes these ‘first miles’ primarily because of

difficulties in obtaining detailed data on how oil was moved from the wellhead to a

terminal. 3 Firms can ship crude oil to refineries using a range of modes of transportation,

including rail, pipeline, or some combination of rail, pipeline and water. In this last case,

oil is initially transported by rail or pipeline and is then offloaded to tankers or barges for

shipment to refineries. In 2014, U.S. refineries reported receiving 78 percent of

domestically produced crude oil by rail or pipeline.4 They reported receiving the

remaining 22 percent by tanker, barge, or truck.

          Firms shipping crude oil from the Bakken are likely to use pipelines to the extent

that there is available capacity, because rail is significantly costlier than pipeline per

barrel-mile shipped. For example, Frittelli et al (2014, p. 7) noted that: “Railroad

transport reportedly costs in the neighborhood of $10 to $15 per barrel compared with $5

per barrel for pipeline.” This is consistent with information from Genscape, Petrorail

Report (various dates). Additional oil is shipped by rail to the extent that it is

economically attractive to do so. Shippers may also use rail, because it serves a more

flexible set of destinations with faster delivery times relative to pipelines. Another factor

in the continued use of rail – even when the economics appear unfavorable – is the fact

that some shippers entered into multi-year contracts for rail shipments when the price of

  In aggregate, about 50 percent of oil was shipped from the wellhead by a gathering pipeline (North Dakota Pipeline
Authority 2015). https://ndpipelines.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/kringstad-oil-gathering-slides-11-10-2015.pdf

  We have not been able to determine the extent to which trucking is correlated with moving crude oil by rail versus
pipeline. If trucking for the `first mile’ is positively correlated with subsequently moving crude oil by rail, this will
increase the air pollution associated with rail. If trucking and crude-by-rail are negatively correlated, this will increase
the air pollution from crude-by-pipeline. The Director of the North Dakota pipeline authority did not know whether the
correlation was negative or positive [private correspondence].

oil was high. These “take-or-pay” contracts require them to ship oil by railroad or pay

for unused capacity.

         Roughly half of the oil shipped from North Dakota in 2014 went to refineries by

pipeline and the remainder went to refineries by rail. Of the 266 million barrels moved by

pipeline from PADD2, which includes North Dakota, 1 percent moved to PADD1 (East

Coast), 84 percent moved to PADD3 (Gulf coast) and 15 percent to PADD4

(Intermountain West). In addition, roughly 67 million barrels stayed within PADD2.5

Most of the oil moving by pipeline ends up in the Gulf Coast or the Intermountain West,

because there is almost no crude oil pipeline infrastructure on the East and West Coasts.

Of the 250 million barrels moved by rail from PADD2 in 2014, 54 percent moved to

PADD1 (East Coast), 21 percent moved to PADD3 (Gulf Coast), 21 percent moved to

PADD5 (West Coast), and 4 percent moved to PADD4 (Intermountain West).

Pipelines, Railroads, and Crowd-Out

         A central issue in North Dakota is the extent to which trains carrying crude oil

crowd out the rail transportation of other products. When evaluating the air pollution

effects of crowding out, it is helpful to think about the two ends of the spectrum. The

first extreme is that railroads are operating with excess capacity and so additional rail

traffic has no congestion externality on the rail system. In this case, any additional crude-

by-rail traffic increases the overall air pollution costs from transporting goods by rail. The

other end of the spectrum is that railroads are already operating at full capacity. In this

  Energy Information Administration (nd) data on Movements of Crude Oil and Selected Products by Rail. It is possible
to back out approximate movements of oil by pipeline within PADD2 by taking total production in PADD2 and
subtracting movements to other PADDs by all modes. Further, crude by rail is tracked within PADD2, so the residual is
predominantly pipeline with some small share of water movement. Summarizing, our approximation (in thousand
barrels) of the pipeline movements within PADD2 is calculated as follows: 67,000 = 616,000 (production) – 539,000
(shipments out of PADD2) – 10,000 (crude by rail movements within PADD2).



                                                                                                                   6
case, increased crude-by-rail traffic completely crowds out lower value products. There is

no change in the total rail traffic due to crude-by-rail in this scenario, and thus there is no

change in the overall air pollution costs from transporting goods by rail. In fact, the

crowding out of other products may cause additional pollution, if these products are

transported by other modes such as trucks instead. There are three possible sources of air

pollution: i) railroad-related pollution from increases in rail traffic; ii) any additional

pollution related to system-wide railroad congestion, since slower speeds are associated

with higher fuel consumption; and iii) pollution stemming from products being shipped

by other, more environmentally harmful modes of transportation (such as truck) rather

than by rail.

        North Dakota is heavily reliant on rail to move agricultural goods – 80% of grain

was transported by rail in 2009 to 2012. Agricultural goods such as grain may be “time-

shifted” rather than crowded out. Namely, higher tariff traffic such as crude oil may be

moved first; other lower tariff traffic such as agriculture may be moved as capacity

emerges. Rail capacity concerns materialized in 2013/14. The problem was particularly

acute because of the record corn, soybean, and wheat harvests in that year.

If crude-by-rail crowded out the rail transportation of other goods, we would expect to

see declines in agricultural shipments. Figure 3 shows the monthly total number of

carloads originating in North Dakota, separately for oil, coal, and agricultural products.

We remove seasonal trends in this figure by subtracting the month-of-the-year average

total carloads of each good from the monthly observations. We smooth the resulting de-

trended carloads’ time series using the LOWESS method. This figure demonstrates that

the (de-trended, smoothed) total number of carloads of crude oil shipped by rail from




                                                                                              7
North Dakota markedly increases over time. Consistent with railroads having excess

capacity, we do not see a corresponding decrease in the number of carloads of coal or

agricultural goods shipped. As USDA (2015) noted, despite producers’ complaints

exports of agricultural products also increased over this period.

           Based on this evidence, we assume in our analysis that railroads are operating

with excess capacity. In total, we are estimating a lower bound on the air pollution

associated with transporting crude oil following the Bakken oil production boom,

because: 1) emissions per ton-mile for alternative forms of transportation (such as

trucks) are higher than for railroads, 2) we are ignoring rail congestion effects, and 3) as

we will discuss further in section 3, our main estimates do not include idling, and 4) we

ignore emissions associated with transport from wellheads to on-loading terminals.



3. Data

           The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports monthly and annual crude

oil production for each U.S. state.6 EIA also reports PADD to PADD movements of

crude oil by mode of transportation, and the mode by which crude oil is delivered to

refineries by refinery PADD.

           We have data on the location of rail networks used to transport crude oil across

the United States from the Center for Transportation Analysis at Oak Ridge.7 Using GIS,

we measured the number of miles of track in each county for all rail routes carrying high

volumes of crude oil from North Dakota. Because many lines run along county

                                                                                               8
boundaries, we computed a one-mile wide buffer along each line and used the relative

areas to allocate rail miles to counties.

        Our analysis also draws on confidential waybill data for 2014 from the Surface

Transportation Board (STB). These data are a stratified sample of all waybills; waybills

corresponding to a higher number of carloads are sampled at a higher rate.8 The STB

data include information on the class of goods being carried, origin county, destination

county, major intermediate interchange points (such as Chicago, East St. Louis, and

Detroit), rail carrier, tons shipped, and number of carloads.9

        Table 1a shows routes, route lengths, and barrels shipped across all waybills and

by region. In 2014, trains transported roughly 214 million barrels of crude oil produced in

North Dakota. We map and analyze over 95 percent of this crude-by-rail traffic over 41

distinct routes from North Dakota to refineries across the contiguous U.S.

        We use data from Genscape, on the monthly flow of crude oil through each of the

majority of major pipelines from the Bakken. Genscape (2014) also provides data on

monthly electricity consumption at selected pumping stations for these pipelines. Finally,

this database contains GIS information on pipelines and pumping stations. In 2014,

Genscape monitored 68 percent of the overall volume of crude oil transported from North

Dakota.

        Table 1b shows distance between pumping stations, pumping station power

consumption, pumping station oil flow and number of monitored stations by NERC

region. In 2014, the average distance between pumping stations was 135 miles, power

consumption was 34,885 megawatt hours per year, and oil flow was 88,000,000 barrels

per year. There are 404 monitored pumping stations.



4. Rail Cost per Ton Mile and per Hour for Idling

         To calculate emission costs for rail we rely on four components: 1) gallons of

diesel consumed, 2) the EPA locomotive emissions factors per gallon for a particular

year, which are based on fleet composition for that year, 3) data on movements of crude

oil to identify the location of emissions, and 4) the AP2 integrated assessment model,

which links emissions to changes in air pollution and changes in air pollution to damages.

Diesel Consumed, Emission Factors, and Movements of Crude Oil

         To calculate gallons of diesel consumed, we adopt an approach that distinguishes

between outbound (loaded) trains and empty trains returning to North Dakota.10 Since

trains carrying the weight of crude oil work harder, they consume more fuel and therefore

emit more pollution per mile traveled. For outbound trains, we assume that 480 tons of

cargo (crude oil) is transported one mile for each gallon of diesel fuel burned by the

locomotive.11 For return trains, we assume that the empty trains travel 0.14 miles per

gallon of diesel consumed (U.S. Department of State, 2014).

         We use EPA (2009) projected locomotive emission rates for 2014, which are

based on projected fleetwide composition of locomotives. The emission rates for NOx,

SO2, VOC, PM2.5, and CO2 are expressed in grams per gallon of diesel fuel consumed.

Quantities of crude oil shipped from the STB waybill sample are used to calculate the

number of barrel-miles for each county along the 41 routes. This allows us to compute

10
   Our approach is very similar to the approach used in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) conducted for the
Keystone XL pipeline (United States Department of State, 2014).

   See United States Department of State (2014), Appendix Y and Association of American Railroads (2017).



                                                                                                                     10
emissions by county for movements of crude oil from North Dakota in 2014. We convert

ton-miles of crude oil transported to gallons of diesel burned in each county. This is

translated into emissions using locomotive emission factors for tier 2 locomotives.

Because returning trains travel 0.14 miles per gallon of diesel consumed, converting

emission rates is straightforward for empty trains.

          One thing to note is that basing fuel consumption on average ton-miles per gallon

does not capture the fact that trains are more likely to idle or move at slower speeds in

major urban areas.12 For example, unit trains take an average of 14 hours to travel

through Chicago (CMAP, 2016). Because major junctions occur in urban areas, not

accounting for idling and congestion will bias downward our estimates of emissions in

urban areas and bias upward estimates of emissions in rural areas. As a result, our

aggregate air pollution cost estimates are likely biased downward.

          We separately estimate the emissions from trains sitting idle at: Chicago, East St.

Louis, and Detroit. We estimate fuel consumption rates for trains switching in rail yards

by capitalizing on the reported time (in hours) that trains spent switching and in yards

from the STB. The STB also reports total fuel consumption while switching (STB,

2014). Combining fuel consumption with EPAs gram per gallon emission rates yields

estimates of emissions per hour in rail yards.

AP2 Integrated Assessment Model

          The AP2 integrated assessment model (Muller, 2014) uses an air transport model

to link emissions in a specific county to changes in air pollution in every county in the




12
  Similarly, fuel consumption is higher if the grade on the route traveled is positive, so our estimates will understate
emissions in counties with positive average grades and understate them elsewhere.



                                                                                                                           11
United States. 13 It then translates these changes in pollution into estimates of physical

impacts by first calculating exposures. This step requires detailed population data

provided by the U.S. Census.14 Then, using peer reviewed concentration response

functions, exposures are converted to physical effects: cases of illness, additional deaths.

Finally, these impacts are monetized using standard non-market valuation techniques for

human health consequences.

         Most of the monetary damages are due to increased mortality risk and the social

cost of carbon. For mortality risk, AP2 uses the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL)

approach. In particular, the AP2 employs the EPA’s VSL estimate of $8.5 million (2014

US dollars), which is standard in both the academic literature and in policy analyses

(EPA, 2011). This VSL is the average of roughly 30 revealed and stated preference

studies, each of which estimate a value of statistical life. Importantly, this VSL is applied

uniformly across all exposed populations. Finally, CO2 emissions from power plants and

locomotives are valued at $43/ton (2014 US dollars), which is the social cost of carbon

estimated by the U.S. government (IWGSCC, 2013).

         The AP2 estimates marginal damages as follows. First, the model calculates the

total damage associated with baseline emissions from all sources in 2011 (Muller and

Mendelsohn, 2007; 2009). These damages are calculated using emissions, population,

and vital statistics from 2014, which is the most recent year for which there are

comprehensive emission inventories in the United States (Jaramillo and Muller, 2016).

Then, one ton of one pollutant is added to one source. The model re-computes

13
   See Muller (2011) (especially Figure A2 in the supplemental material) and Jaramillo and Muller (2016) (especially
the discussion in the appendix on pages 2 and 3) for evidence that the AP2 model correctly predicts monitor-level
outcomes.
14
   The model calculates damages from human health effects as well as crop and timber yield loss, and materials
depreciation. However, the vast majority of impacts are due to human health.



                                                                                                                   12
concentrations, exposures, physical effects, and damages with this additional ton of the

pollutant. Since nothing else changes from the baseline scenario except the additional ton

added to baseline emissions at the specified source, the difference between the two model

runs is the marginal damage (in $/ton). The model repeats this algorithm over PM2.5,

SO2, NOx, NH3, and VOCs from roughly 10,000 ground-level and point sources in the

United States. These exposures are translated into physical health effects using peer-

reviewed concentration-response functions.

       Importantly, the $/ton damage of pollutant (p) released from location (c) is a

spatial sum of impacts over multiple counties that receive pollution (r) from a given

                   𝑏
source. Note that 𝐷𝑟,𝑝,𝑡 reflects the total damage in county (r) from pollutant (p) at time

                                                   +1
(t) due to the baseline level of emissions, while 𝐷𝑟,𝑝,𝑡 is the total damage when an

additional ton of pollutant (p) is added to the baseline emissions.
                                           𝑅
                                            +1       𝑏
                               𝑀𝐷𝑝,𝑐,𝑡 = ∑(𝐷𝑟,𝑝,𝑡 − 𝐷𝑟,𝑝,𝑡 )
                                          𝑟=1

Thus, if a locomotive emits a mixture of VOC, SO2, PM2.5, and NOx in a particular

county along a rail route, AP2 accounts for the fact that these emissions disperse into

nearby counties; the damages from the emissions from this locomotive calculated by AP2

occur in potentially many different nearby counties.



5. Pipeline Costs per Megawatt

       To calculate emission costs for existing pipelines, we rely on three components:

1) the location and power draws of pumping stations in megawatt hours, 2) the Graff-




                                                                                           13
Zivin, Kotchen, Mansur (2014) model which translates electricity draws into powerplant

emissions and 3) the AP2 integrated assessment model, which was described previously.

          We use monthly, station-level electricity consumption and pipeline-level crude oil

flows from Genscape (2014).15 We then employ the method developed by Graff-Zivin,

Kotchen, Mansur (2014) in order to link electricity demand shocks to electricity

generation and emission responses. In this method, an electricity demand shock in a

given North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) region yields electricity

generation responses at many different power plants. Each power plant has a distinct

emission rate for each of many different pollutants (in tons per MWh). We use power

plant emissions data from 2010-2012 to estimate emissions rates for each pollutant in

each NERC region; this will likely overstate 2014 emissions due to decreases in the

percentage of U.S. electricity generation from coal-fired sources.16 Emissions of pollutant

(p) due to pumping station (s), are given by:
                                                              𝑃

                                            𝐸𝑝,𝑠 = 𝑒𝑠 × ∑ 𝐼𝑚 𝑓𝑝,𝑚
                                                            𝑚=1

where es is the annual electricity consumed by pumping station s (in MWh). Im is an

indicator function that denotes whether power plant m increases its production in

response to the electricity demanded at pumping station s. This indicator function varies

both at the plant level as well as the NERC region level (based on the location of the




15
   Genscape monitors electricity consumption at 74 of the 404 pumping stations in our database. For remaining
pumping stations, we know location, distance, and flow. We use the electricity demand reported for the monitored
pumping stations as well as oil flows to estimate electricity consumption for unmonitored stations on the same pipeline.

pumping station). Finally, fp,m denotes plant m’s emissions rate for pollutant p; this

pollutant-specific emissions rate varies at the NERC region level.



6. Air Pollution and Greenhouse Gas Costs for Rail and Pipelines

         Table 2 presents our estimates of the average air pollution and greenhouse costs

per million barrel miles and per gallon for long distance transportation of crude oil from

North Dakota to the Gulf Coast in 2014. Figure 4 plots the relative magnitudes per

million barrel miles.17 For movements to the Gulf, the sum of air pollution and

greenhouse gas costs by rail, $1015, is nearly twice the costs by pipelines, $531. Air

pollution damages were much larger for rail than for pipeline ($814 vs. $273). The

greenhouse gas costs were somewhat smaller for rail than for pipelines ($201 vs. $257).

         The air pollution costs per million barrel-miles are the highest for crude oil trains

with destinations on the East Coast, $1,228, because these trains travel through more

densely populated areas. Gulf Coast rail damages are $814, which is slightly lower than

the sample average for rail but is much higher than the air pollution costs from pipelines

of $297. The average damages are significantly lower for routes to the West Coast, $444.

This is because trains headed to the West Coast typically do not pass through heavily

populated areas such as Chicago or Philadelphia. Greenhouse gas damages are solely

based on emissions and not on emissions and population density. As a result, they do not

vary by region.

         The air pollution and greenhouse gas damages per gallon differ across regions,

because the distances traveled vary across routes. The average total damages per gallon

17
  For reference, one unit train with 100 cars carries approximately 75,000 barrels. The distance from western North
Dakota to either St. James Louisiana or Philadelphia is about 1,970 miles. Moving the equivalent of one train over
1,970 miles is 148 million barrel-miles (75,000 barrels x 1970 miles).



                                                                                                                      15
of crude oil moved to the Gulf Coast are $0.025 for pipelines and $0.048 for rail. The

average total costs for rail to the East Coast and West Coast are $0.022 and $0.065.

       As we noted previously, estimates in Table 2 are lower bounds, because our main

estimates do not include idling at the origin, destination, or the junctions and so are lower

bounds. Table 1A presents estimates of damages per train hour and per gallon-hour for

three major junctions – Chicago, East St. Louis, and Detroit. The costs on a per hour

basis are high, because these are densely populated urban areas, so emissions affect large

numbers of individuals. If a train to the East Coast spent one hour idling in Chicago, the

air pollution and greenhouse gas costs per gallon would increase from $0.065 with no

idling to $0.086 per gallon with one hour of idling.

       Table 3 and Figure 5 present a more detailed pollutant-level comparison of the

damages from crude oil transported by rail versus pipeline to the Gulf Coast. It is

important to emphasize that the air pollution damages from pipelines are due to emissions

in counties with power plants rather than counties with pipelines.

       The top panel of Table 3 reports emissions per million-barrel-miles, and the

bottom panel reports damages. Rail emissions are higher for NOx and PM2.5, while

pipeline emissions are higher for SOx and CO2.

       The starkest difference between rail and pipeline is for NOx. Emissions of NOx

are 10-times greater for rail than for pipelines, while monetary damages from these NOx

emissions are 24-times larger for rail relative to pipelines. There are two reasons for this

difference in NOx emissions and damages. First, trains emit very high levels of NOx per

million barrel-miles. Second, each ton of pollutant emitted by trains is more harmful than

the same ton of pollutant from pipelines, because railroads run through cities. In contrast,




                                                                                          16
pipelines use electricity; increased electricity generation may result in higher emissions

from large thermal power plants typically located in rural areas. Thus, population

exposures per ton of pollutant are vastly different for rail versus pipeline. This difference

in exposure highlights that it is critical to model emissions and damages in a spatially

resolved manner.

       It is worth noting that we are currently using 2011 emissions estimates for power

generation. Relative damages are likely to have changed in a manner that suggests an

even larger differential between rail and pipeline transportation of crude oil. For example,

the eGRID database reports that the power generation fleet emitted 0.62 tons of

CO2/MWH in 2010. In contrast, in 2014, CO2 emission intensity is estimated at 0.56

tons/MWH. Even more strikingly is the reduction in SO2 emissions; in 2010 the

emissions rate across all plants was 0.0013 tons/MWH whereas in 2014 this rate was

0.0008 tons/MWH. Considering that CO2 and SO2 emissions at power plants comprise

the bulk of damages from pipeline transport, it is likely that crude-by-rail is even more

harmful, relative to pipelines, today.

       The total estimated damages for oil shipped by rail from North Dakota in 2014 are

greater than $420 million. According to the National Research Council of the National

Academies of Science (NRC), this is more than twice the damage done by the average

coal-fired power plant, annually (NRC, 2010). Our analysis suggests that about 30 deaths

from air pollution exposure were attributable to shipments of crude by rail in 2014.

Crude-by-rail also has additional environmental costs due to factors such as the damages

from future climate change, increased rates of illness, reduced agricultural and timber

production, and accelerated depreciation of man-made materials.




                                                                                             17
          Our work is related to estimates of the pollution attributable to the combustion of

gasoline and diesel. The NRC (2010) estimated air pollution damages of between

$0.23/gallon and $0.38/gallon, in $2007, for 2005 model year autos, trucks, sport utility

vehicles, and light trucks burning gasoline.18 We report that the external costs associated

with transporting one gallon of crude oil averages $0.047 across all of our modeled rail

routes. Thus, the external costs of long distance transportation of a gallon of crude oil by

rail are between 10 and 20 percent of the costs of burning a gallon of gasoline or diesel.

As penetration of pollution control technology in the vehicle fleet continues, damages per

gallon will fall. However, population growth puts upward pressure on per-gallon social

costs. The pollution costs of both transporting and burning motor fuels are essential for a

life cycle analysis of the consumption of these fuels.



7. Spill and Accident Costs for Rail and Pipelines

          The Pipelines Hazardous Materials Administration (PHMSA) conducted a

regulatory impact analysis (RIA) on Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operational

Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains in 2015 (PHMSA (2015)). In particular,

this RIA developed estimates for crude oil and ethanol of the cost of spills and accidents

per carload, which include property damage, cleanup costs, injury costs and mortality

costs. PHMSA (2015) presents a range of social costs that can be translated into barrel-

miles using information on carloads, barrels per carload, and average distance. 19


18
   See NRC (2010), p. 11 footnote 10. For light-duty vehicles from the late 1990s, Parry, Walls, and Harrington (2007)
estimates air pollution damages of $0.52/gallon.
19
   PHMSA (2015) Table EB14, p. 111. Carloads are from p. 82 of PHMSA (2015), distance traveled is from p. 200 of
PHMSA (2015), and barrels per carload are from Energy Information Administration (2013). Average distance for oil
originating in the Bakken is 1,098 miles. The costs are not reported separately for crude oil and ethanol, but the average
cost per gallon used in the estimates ($200) is only slightly less than the estimate for crude oil spills, ($211).



                                                                                                                      18
Translated into costs using information on carloads, barrels per carload, and average

distance, these estimates range from $214 per million-barrel miles at the low end to $966

per million-barrel miles at the 95th percentile; with a median estimate of $381 per

million-barrel miles. There is a high level of uncertainty in these estimates, because the

probability of a very high cost event, such as a crude oil train explosion near a populated

area, is difficult to determine.

         PHMSA’s (2015) preliminary regulatory impact analysis on pipeline safety

contains estimates for 2004-2013 of the cost of spills and accidents for hazardous liquid

pipelines, separately for high consequence areas (HCA) and non-high consequence areas

(non-HCA). “HL [hazardous liquids] pipelines carry crude oil, refined petroleum

products, volatile liquids (such as propane, butane, and ethylene), carbon dioxide, and

anhydrous ammonia.”20 For hazardous liquids, high consequence areas (HCAs) “include

populated areas, drinking water sources, and unusually sensitive ecological areas.”21

Forty-three percent of pipeline miles are in HCA. The annual social costs of spills and

accidents per pipeline mile are $919 for non-HCA and $2,392 for HCA. The estimates

include fatalities, injuries, and property damage and are generally considered to be lower

bounds of true social costs of spills and accidents due to crude-by-pipeline.22 We next

translate PHMSA’s social costs from dollars per mile to dollars per barrel-mile for crude

oil, with the caveat that PHMSA’s numbers are not calculated separately by product

type.23,24 The estimated cost of spills and accidents per million-barrel miles of crude-by-

pipeline is roughly $62.

          The majority of policy concern regarding movements of crude oil by rail and

pipeline has focused on the costs associated with accidents and spills. As noted above,

PHMSA’s central estimates of the costs from spills and accidents for rail and pipelines is

$381 and $62 per million-barrel miles. Firms and insurers pay a share of these costs and

the remainder is an externality. However, even if firms did not internalize any of these

costs, Figure 6 suggests that the total air pollution and greenhouse gas costs for rail and

pipelines to the Gulf Coast are far larger than PHMSA’s spills and accidents cost

estimates ($1015 vs. $381 for rail; $531 vs. $62 for pipelines). Summarizing,

policymakers should consider both the costs from air pollution as well as spills and

accidents when calculating the total social costs of moving crude oil to refineries.



8. Conclusion

          This analysis uses data on crude oil transportation from North Dakota in 2014 to

examine the relative air pollution, greenhouse gas, and spill and accident costs for

movements of petroleum products by rail and pipelines. We find that total air pollution

and greenhouse gas costs are substantially larger for rail than for pipelines. Further, for

both rail and pipelines, the sum of air pollution and greenhouse gas costs is substantially

larger than spill and accidents costs. These results suggest that the policy debate

surrounding crude oil transportation has put too much relative weight on accidents and

   Smith, Christopher (2014), appendix. Computing the weighted average cost for the HCA and non-HCA pipelines
yields a social cost per pipeline mile for crude oil of $1,552. $62 per million barrel miles = (150,609 miles x $1552
/mile)/3,799,753 million barrel miles.



                                                                                                                        20
spills, while overlooking a far more serious source of external cost: air pollution and

greenhouse gas emissions.

       The air pollution and greenhouse gas damages are large. For example, air

pollution and greenhouse gas costs of moving a fully loaded 100-car train of crude oil

from North Dakota to the Gulf Coast are about $150,000 and from North Dakota to the

East Coast are $210,000. The air pollution and greenhouse gas costs of moving an

equivalent amount of oil by pipeline to the Gulf Coast are $78,000. The total estimated

air pollution and greenhouse gas damages for oil shipped by rail from North Dakota in

2014 exceed $420 million. As we noted, our estimates are a lower bound, in part because

we assume a train does not idle. Idling, particularly in major junction cities such as

Chicago, is very costly.

       While the recent downward trend in crude prices has led to marked reductions in

the movement of crude oil, other petroleum products continue to be moved by rail in

large volumes. The issue of the relative costs of moving these products by rail and

pipelines extends to those products as well. The air pollution and greenhouse gas costs of

transporting different petroleum products will vary with the characteristics of the product

and the pipeline. The results presented here suggest that further research on the air

pollution and greenhouse gas costs of transporting these products is necessary.

Appendix

The equation for the estimation of the emission rates in tons per county is given by the
following formula in which county is denoted (c) and pollutant (p):

                   𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑠               𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑠      𝑏𝑏𝑙.
    𝐸𝑝,𝑐 = 𝐷𝑐 (          ) × 0.14259 (      )×(       )
                  𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑦               𝑏𝑏𝑙.     𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛
                            𝑡𝑜𝑛 − 𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑠. −1        𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑠             𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑠
                     × (480              ) × 𝐸𝑝 (         )×(                  )

We estimate damages by county because the ($/ton) marginal damages are calculated by
AP2 at the county level. Damages are then aggregated across all counties with a route.
Finally, we divide damages by barrel-miles, by route, and scale up by 1,000,000 to
compute damages per million barrel-miles.
