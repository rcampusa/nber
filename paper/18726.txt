                                            ABSTRACT

This paper derives a structural relationship between the nominal exchange rate, national price levels,
and observed yields on long maturity inflation - indexed bonds. This relationship can be interpreted
as defining the fair value of the exchange rate that will prevail in any model or real world economy
in which inflation indexed bonds are traded. An advantage of our derivation is that it does not require
restrictive assumptions on financial market equilibrium to be operational. We take our theory to a
dataset spanning the period January 2001 – February 2011 and study a daily , real time decompositions
of pound, euro, and yen exchange rates into their fair value and risk premium components. The
relative importance of these two factors varies depending on the sub sample studied. However, sub
samples in which we find correlations of 0.30 to 0.60 between daily exchange rate changes and daily
changes in fair value are not uncommon. We also show empirically and justify theoretically that a
1 percent rise in the foreign currency risk premium is on average contemporaneously associated with
a 50 basis point rise in the inflation indexed bond return differential in favor of the foreign country
and an 50 basis point appreciation of the dollar

Hot TIP: Nominal Exchange Rates and Inflation Indexed Bond Yields
Richard H. Clarida*

I. Introduction
        Extending Clarida (2012) this paper derives a structural relationship
between the nominal exchange rate, national price levels, and observed
yields on long maturity inflation - indexed bonds. This relationship can be
interpreted as defining the fair value of the exchange rate that will prevail
in any model or real world economy in which inflation indexed bonds are
traded. Fair value is the level of the nominal exchange rate that equates the
known real return to holding a long maturity home currency inflation
indexed bond to the expected real return to holding an inflation indexed
bond payable in foreign currency. We derive a novel, empirically
observable real time measure of the risk premium (expected excess return
on long maturity foreign currency investment in an inflation indexed
bond) that can open up a wedge between the observed level of the nominal
exchange rate and its fair value and we relate our measure of the long
horizon real risk premium to the Fama (1984) measure of the short
horizon nominal risk premium. An advantage of our derivation is that it
does not require restrictive assumptions (e.g. complete markets,
representative agent) on financial market equilibrium to be operational.
        We take our theory to a dataset spanning the period January 2001 –
February 2011 and study high frequency , real time decompositions of
pound, euro, and yen exchange rates into their fair value and risk
premium components.            The relative importance of these two factors
varies depending on the sub sample studied. However, sub samples in
which we find correlations of 0.30 to 0.60 between daily exchange rate
changes and daily changes in fair value are not uncommon. We also show
empirically and justify theoretically that a 1 percent rise in the foreign
currency risk premium is on average contemporaneously associated with a
50 basis point rise in the inflation indexed bond return differential in favor
of the foreign country and an 50 basis point appreciation of the dollar

II. An Equilibrium Implication

        Consider a US investor who, among the many assets he can hold,
can hold inflation indexed sovereign bonds denominated in dollars and
pounds. Let ρt denote the dollar price a zero coupon inflation indexed
bond that pays off 1 dollar in n years multiplied by cumulative realized US
inflation over the next n years. The realized nominal gross return on this
investment, if held to maturity, will be

1)    Rhht,n = (1/ ρt)Pt+n/Pt

where Pt is the CPI. Let ρ*t denote the pound price of a zero coupon
inflation indexed bond that pays off 1 pound in n years multiplied by
cumulative realized UK inflation over the next n years. The realized
nominal gross return to a US investor on this investment, if held to
maturity, will be

2)    Rh,ft,n = (1/Stρ*t)St+n P*t+n/P*t

Where St is the dollar price of a pound. The realized real gross return on
holding a US inflation indexed bond to maturity is

3)     RRhht,n = Rhht,n (Pt/Pt+n) = (1/ ρt) ≡ exp(nrt,n)

Thus, of course, the US inflation indexed bond offers a known, non-
stochastic realized real return rt,n if held to maturity. But what is the
realized real return to a US investor of holding a UK inflation indexed
bond?

4)    RRhft,n=Rhft,n (Pt/Pt+n) = {(1/St ρ*t) (St+n P*t+n/P*t)} Pt/Pt+n = exp(nr*t,n)Qt+n/Qt

where Qt = St P*t/Pt is the CPI real exchange rate. For a US investor the UK
inflation indexed bond is not riskless if held to maturity: even though r*t,n
is known, the US investors bears real exchange rate risk. Notice that this is
not an assumption: it follows from the nature of the stochastic nominal
cash flows to a US investor for holding a UK linker to maturity.



                                            2
      Define exp θt,n as the ratio of expected real return to a US investor of
holding a UK linker versus known real return to a US investor of holding a
TIP

5)    exp θt,n ≡ Et RRhft,n/RRhht,n = (exp nr*t,n / exp nrt,n) Et Qt+n/Qt

where Et Qt+n is the expected level of the CPI real exchange rate in n years.
When θt,n > (<) 0 the expected real return to holding the UK linker exceeds
(is less than) the known real return to holding the US TIP. Equation (5) has
a particularly convenient interpretation when the horizon n is long enough
so that Et Qt+n = Q, the assumed constant unconditional mean of the real
exchange rate defined by long run relative PPP. In this case, multiplying
through by Qt and re arranging we see that:

6)    St = (Pt/P*t ) exp n(r*t,n – rt,n) Q exp- θt,n

or

           ~
7)    St  St exp  t ,n

     Thus period by period, the observed spot exchange rate is the
                          ~
product of the fair value S t - the level of the spot exchange rate that
equates the known real return to investing in the US TIP to the expected
real return to investing in the UK linker - and the risk premium exp- θt,n, the
ratio of the known real return to investing in the US TIP to the expected
return to investing in the UK linker (the reciprocal of the risk premium on
the uncovered UK linker investment). Taking logs of both sides and
letting q = ln Q

8)   st  pt  p *t  n( r *t ,n  rt ,n )  q  t ,n

We see that in first differences we must have

          st   ( pt  p *t )  n ( r *t , n  rt , n )  t , n




                                             3
        A rise in the endogenous θt,n is an increase in the risk premium on a
UK investment which is just an increase the expected excess return a US
investor earns on a UK linker investment compared with the known real
return he earns on a US TIP. Thus from (6) a rise in expected real return on
the UK linker investment must be brought about by some combination of a
rise in UK – US real interest differential and a contemporaneous real appreciation
of the dollar relative to the pound. An appreciation of the dollar relative to
the pound today contributes to a positive expected future excess return on
an inflation hedged pound investment because it sets up the expectation of
a subsequent (real) depreciation of the dollar relative to the pound as is
evident from (6).
        When              the known real return to a US investor in investing in
the US TIP is equal to the expected real return to the US investor in the UK
linker. It is this sense in which is the fair value of the nominal exchange
rate. When the exchange rate is equal to fair value by this definition,
expected real returns that can be achieved by holding inflation indexed
bonds are equalized across countries. Thus our notion of fair value is
related to the level of the exchange rate implied by the ex-ante real version
of uncovered interest parity over a short holding period for nominal bonds.
However as we illustrate below, the two are distinct ways to assess
currency valuation.

An Asset Pricing Interpretation

       We make a minimal number of assumptions to provide an asset
pricing interpretation of Equation (7). We do not assume complete
markets or a representative agent. We do not assume that we know the
model, let alone the parameters, that link the present value of macro
fundamentals to exchange rate valuation. Under our assumptions our
framework is consistent with almost any underlying model in which
inflation indexed bonds are traded. We assume that , in a global financial
equilibrium, there is a functional relationship between the nominal (US
dollar) price today of an asset that delivers a random dollar cash flow at
some date in future (for concreteness , 10 years hence) and no cash flow at
any date other than t +n:




                                        4
                            t  Ft ( N t n ; t ,t n )

where  t , t  n is the conditional probability distribution of the random
nominal cash flow from the asset that pays off in n years. We specialize F
so that

                            t  Et (mt , n N t  n ;  t ,t  n )

So today’s price of an asset with random nominal cash flow in n years is
the conditional expectation of the product of that cash flow and the
random variable mt,n.

Assumption: mt,n is homogenous in the price levels Pt and Pt+n

                                                  Pt
                               mt , n  zt , n
                                                 Pt  n

This is a standard property in many asset pricing models (Cochrane (2001).
For example in Lucas (1982) we have

                                           U ' (Ct  n ) Pt
                            mt , n   n
                                            U ' (Ct ) Pt  n

Again, we do not require a representative agent, complete markets, or
really any additional structure on zt,n . This is an intuitive restriction on
nominal asset prices that says that the real price of the asset today depends
upon the real value of the cash flow it delivers state by state at maturity
and not the price level itself at t+n itself (after , of course, controlling for
factors other than the price level itself that are included in zt,n.).

       With this background, consider how to price a zero coupon inflation
indexed bond that pays off 1 dollar in n years multiplied by cumulative
realized inflation over the next n years.




                                             5

                                           Pt

Or, dividing by ρt

                           1  {exp nrt , n }Et ( zt ,n )


Where rt,n is the continuous compounded known real return on the
inflation indexed bond.

      US investors can also obtain US dollar cash flows by investing in a
UK inflation indexed bond and selling the pound proceeds for dollars in n
years. Let St be the dollar price of a pound and * represent a UK variable.
Let Qt = StP*t/Pt define the real exchange rate and Q its unconditional
mean Q = Et Q ∞ . Then we have

                                                             P *t  n
                  S t  *t  Et (mt , n 1 S t  n                  )
                                                              P *t

Or dividing though:

                                                       Qt  n
                 1  exp nr *t , n Et ( zt , n  1           )
                                                        Qt

      With these building blocks we now derive a structural exchange rate
equation that will hold in any model that seeks to describe a world in
which long maturity inflation indexed bonds trade. Since such bonds
trade in many countries (US, UK, France, Canada, Japan) this should
apply to a large number of models. We see that

                                                Qt  n
                              QEt ( zt ,n 1          )
            Pt exp nr *t ,n                       Q
9) S t 
           P *t exp nrt ,n           Et ( zt ,n )



                                                       6
Comparing with equation (6) we see that θt,n is given by

                                                      Qt  n
                                   Et ( zt , n  1          )
                                                        Q
10)        exp t , n 
                                           Et ( zt , n )

Although not necessary for what follows, we gain additional insight by
looking at the log normal case in which we have equation (11).

11)  t  covt , n (ln zt , n , qt  n  q)  vart , n (qt  n  q)  Et (qt  n  q)

       We note that the first term in the above expression is the conditional
covariance between the stochastic discount factor and real exchange rate
that prevails when the zero coupon inflation linked bonds mature. This
can be interpreted as a risk premium that opens up a wedge between
known real return (to a US investor) of holding a long maturity TIP and
the stochastic real return to a US investor of holding a UK linker. When
this covariance is negative, an unhedged position in a UK linker pays off
less (because of realized real appreciation of dollar relative to the pound)
when the stochastic discount factor is high. Thus a positive theta
corresponds to a positive risk premium on the UK linker. That is, the known
real return on the US linker is less than the expected real return to the US
investor, inclusive of expected appreciation of the pound, of holding a UK
linker when θ is positive. An increase in the expected excess return on the
UK linker will require some combination of an increase in r*t,n - rt,n and a
jump appreciation of the dollar.

       In what follows we shall assume for ease of exposition that expected
deviations from PPP at a 10 year horizon are sufficiently close to zero so as
to be ignored. Importantly, however, researchers who have a view on long
horizon PPP deviations can include that view directly and use it as an
input to the accounting framework we develop below. Thus, in what
follows, we shall refer to θt,n as the risk premium.




                                                     7
       It is worth noting that the complete markets assumption which we
don’t require to derive (7) or (9) would put a number of additional
restrictions on the joint behavior of exchange rates and bond yields, both
inflation indexed and nominal. For example, under complete markets,
Backus et. al. (2001) show that

      St 1 mt ,1
12)        
       St m *t ,1

We see that in our notation this would also imply

       Qt 1 zt ,1
13)         
       Qt     z *t ,1

These are elegant, powerful implications but we do not impose them on
the data or use them to interpret real time exchange rate fluctuations.

III. Comparison with the Literature

      Building on earlier work by Hansen and Hodrick (1980) and Cumby
and Obstfeld (1981), Fama (1984) is the classic study of the risk premium to
holding a long position in a foreign currency nominal bond for one period
(but see also Clarida, Davis, and Pedersen (2009) for a recent analysis of
what can – and can’t be leaned – from a Fama regression). In the literature
(see Engel 2010 for a review and extension) this concept of the risk
premium is usually defined by the first order log approximation

14) rpt ,1  Et st 1  st  i *t ,1  it ,1
where lower case i denotes the short term nominal interest rate. There is
of course a long and proud tradition in the international finance literature,
beginning with Frankel (1978), of empirically relating real exchange rates
to real interest differentials (Shafer and Loopesko (1983) ; Campbell and
Clarida (1987); Clarida – Gali (1994) are early examples). For the most part,
this literature pre dates the widespread introduction of long maturity




                                               8
inflation indexed bonds and of necessity solves forward the real version of
the deviations from UIP equation.

15 )        rpt ,1  Et qt 1  qt  er *t ,1  ert ,1

where ert,1 = it,1 – Etπt,1 is the ex ante short term real interest rate on
nominal bonds at home and similarly abroad. Solving forward and
assuming ln Qt is stationary we obtain (see Engle (2010) for a lucid
discussion and Brunermeier, Nagel, and Pedersen (2008) for an
interpretation of the forward solution for the nominal exchange rate under
uncovered interest parity):

         qt  i 0 ( t er *t i ,1  t ert i ,1   )  i 0 ( t rpt i ,1   )  E ln Q 
                                                                    
16)


Note that convergence of these non-discounted present value equation
requires the unconditional mean of the ex-ante real rate differential μ to
equal the mean of the Fama risk premium λ. Comparing terms we see

17) t ,n  i 0 t rpt I ,1    {n(r *t ,n rt ,n ) i n ( t er *t i ,1  t ert i ,1   )}  q  E ln Qt n
                    n                                          n




where for concreteness we suppose that


            
                
18)                 ( er *t i ,1  t ert i ,1   )  0
                i n t



and similarly for the Fama premium after n periods. We see that our
measure of the risk premium θt,n is the sum of three terms: the n period
sum of the expected Fama risk premiums; the difference (in brackets)
between home and foreign long maturity inflation indexed bond returns
and the expected real returns to rolling one period nominal bonds; and a
Jensen’s inequality term. We can re arrange to obtain an equation
relating the observed long maturity inflation indexed yield differential to
the present value of ex ante (un indexed) real short term interest rates
differentials and the present value of the Fama risk premiums




                                                         9
  n(r *t ,n rt ,n )  i 0 ( t er *t i ,1  t ert i ,1 )   t ,n  i 0 t rpt i ,1  E ln Qt n  q
                             n                                                   n




       There are two approaches that have been used to turn (16) into a
model of exchange rates and real interest rates. Campbell and Clarida
(1987), Clarida and Gali (1994) and recently Engel (2010) estimate time
series models of ex ante short term real rate differentials and use a vector
auto regression to forecast the infinite sum of ex ante real differentials. Of
course the reliability of this approach depends on the linear time series
models being a good proxy for expected future ex ante real interest rates.
An alternative approach (Shafer and Loopesko (1983)) relies on the
expectations hypothesis of the term structure to substitute out for the ex
ante nominal short rate differentials and to rely on surveys or time series
models of inflation to recover an estimate of long term ex ante real rate
differentials.


                ( er *t i ,1  t ert i ,1 )  n( I *t ,n  I t ,n )  i0 (t  *t i ,1  t  t i ,1 )  tpn
             n                                                             n
             i 0 t



 Note that for this approach to work, not only must a model of inflation
expectations be estimated, but one must assume a constant term premium.
An advantage of our approach outlined above is that, under the rather
modest assumption that the pricing kernel is homogeneous in price levels,
we can use observation on inflation indexed bond yields directly to
recover the fair value of nominal exchange rates as well as econometric
free estimates of the risk premium relevant for pricing inflation indexed
yield curves and currencies.

IV. Data

       Our data set is comprised of daily observations on spot exchange
rates, inflation indexed bond yields, and monthly observations on
consumer price indexes for the US, UK, and Euro area for the period
January 2001 through January 2011 and for Japan since December 2004
shortly after inflation indexed bonds were introduced. We convert
monthly CPI levels to daily observations via interpolation. Given the low
and relative stable rate of inflation for these countries over this period, the
approximation of the unobserved daily inflation differential with the
observed per day monthly average inflation differential introduces
measurement error, but this error is small relative to the observed daily
volatility of exchange rates and inflation indexed bond yields.
        Our theoretical model is derived in terms of the yields on inflation
indexed zero coupon bonds. Inflation indexed bonds are typically issued
in coupon form. However, in the US there is a market in which inflation
indexed coupon Tips are stripped of their coupons and trade in zero
coupon form. In our empirical analysis we will use daily data on constant
10 years to maturity yields on zero coupon Tips provided by Barclays. For
the UK, we use the data on zero coupon linker yields provided by the
Bank of England. For the Euro, we use estimates of the zero coupon
inflation indexed yield curve for French and German inflation indexed
bonds provided by Morgan Stanley. For Japan, no data on zero coupon
inflation indexed yields could be found so we use the observed yield on
coupon bearing inflation indexed bonds.
       One final point to discuss is how we calibrate the constant term in
Equation (7) for fair value. This constant term is not important for much
of what we do since we will often seek to account for percent changes in
observed nominal exchange rates in terms of percent changes in fair value
and changes in the risk premium. For these exercises, the constant drops
out. However, in drawing the some of the graphs we will wish to preserve
the levels information, and will select the constant term equal to the
average real exchange rate during the sample period depicted.

 V. Empirical Results

       We now use the framework developed above to interpret the
behavior of the Euro, Pound, and Yen exchange rates over the past 10
years. There are no econometric estimates to present because our
framework (Equation 7) provides day by day a real time decomposition
the change in the exchange into the change in the fair value and the change
in risk premium. Our framework allows – indeed we expect to find –
periods in which shocks to the risk premium are large and die out slowly
while there may be other periods in which exchange rate movements,
contrary to the original Meese-Rogoff (1983) finding that exchange rate
changes are difficult to explain even given even ex post realizations of
fundamentals, are well accounted for by shifts in our measure of fair value
derived above.

      We present our main findings in a series of charts. For each
exchange rate, the charts will help us to identify as well as quantify the
importance of shocks to fair value and shocks to the risk premiums in
accounting for exchange rate fluctuations over different periods as well as
over various horizons of interest. As our sample includes the global
financial crisis and its aftermath (at least through January 2011!), we are
particularly interested to determine and quantify the shifts in risk
premium and fair value that occurred over this period.

       In Chart 1, and in all subsequent charts, the dark blue line depicts
the spot exchange rate, in this case the US dollar price of a Euro, the aqua –
blue line is the fair value defined by Equation 11. The amount by which
the exchange rate EUR exceeds FV measures the risk premium in favor of
the USD that is reflected in the EUR spot exchange rate. This corresponds
to –θt,n. The amount by which the exchange rate EUR falls short of FV
measures the risk premium in favor of the EUR that is reflected in the EUR
spot exchange rate. This corresponds to θt,n.
       Our framework we believe provides a compelling qualitative as well
as a plausible quantitative account of the swings in Euro exchange rate
since 2005. As can be seen from the chart, the broad move in the Euro
from 1.25 in the summer of 2005 to 1.45 in the spring of 2008 is well


                                     13
accounted for, both in direction and in magnitude, by the rise in the fair
value during that period. According to our model, the next move in the
Euro from 1.45 to the ‘brutal’ level of 1.60 reached in the summer of 2008
was due almost entirely an equal move in the risk premium, in favor of the
dollar and thus against the Euro.
       Since the onset the global financial crisis in September 2008,
movements in the Euro have been dominated by fluctuations in risk
premium with fair value fluctuating in a rather narrow range centered at
roughly 1.37. In October 2008, our measure of the risk premium swings in
favor of the Euro (e.g. it appreciated the dollar price of the Euro to such an
extent it set up the expectation of a deprecation and thus capital gain on a
Euro investment). The risk premium swings back in favor of the dollar in
the second half of 2009 as the dollar depreciates in tandem with the Fed’s
quantitative easing programs announced in March of that year. Since 2010,
our framework indicates that the foreign exchange market has required a
positive risk premium to hold the Euro. This period of course coincides
the crisis in the Euro periphery.
       Of course, it is important to confirm that the visual impression
conveyed by the chart is evident in the actual empirical correlation
between the Euro exchange rate and our measure of fair value.

        Chart 2 depicts the correlation (over rolling 60 day windows)
between daily changes in Euro exchange rates and daily changes in our
measure of fair value which of course is dominated by daily changes in
real interest rate differentials between Europe and US inflation indexed
bonds. We see that periods in which the correlation is in the range of 0.3 to
0.4 are not uncommon. We also see that in periods in which shocks to the
risk premium are seen to dominate, the correlation between the Euro and
fv falls to zero or is even negative. One is tempted to identify periods in
which the exchange rate is well accounted for by movements in fv (such
as 2005 to 2008 in Chart 1) as periods in which ‘fundamentals’ mostly
matter for exchange rate determination, in contrast to periods since
September 2008 in which ‘fundamental’ are pushed aside and ‘risk
aversion’ appears to take over. But within the strict logic of our
framework, this temptation would not be justified. Fundamentals may
drive the risk premium as well, but without imposing much more
additional structure on m t,n we can’t really say more. However, unlike
the traditional approach (Fama (1984)) in which an unobserved currency
risk premium must be inferred by extracting the forecastable component
from realized returns on currency carry trades , our framework provides
an econometric free measure of the relevant risk premium given observed
yields on inflation indexed bonds and the spot exchange rate.

       Chart 4 depicts our decomposition of the GBP exchange rate into is
fair value and risk premium components. From 2001 through summer of
2005, the appreciation of the pound from 1.50 to 1.75 is almost fully
accounted for by an equal rise in our estimate of fair value from the
inflation indexed bond market. However, our framework accounts for
the subsequent move up from 1.75 to 2.05 reached in January 2008 almost
entirely by the emergence of a substantial risk premium in favor of the
dollar (i.e. a risk premium that set up expectation of a higher return on a
US inflation linked bonds). This risk premium is eliminated and shifts in
favor of the GBP in September 2008 and has remained in place since.
Since 2009, our estimate of fair value has stayed in a narrow range centered
around 1.65.

       Chart 5 depicts the correlation (over rolling 60 day windows)

measure of fair value Again we see that periods in which the correlation
between daily changes is in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 are not uncommon. We
also see that in periods in which shocks to the risk premium are seen to
dominate, the correlation between the GBP and fv falls to zero or is even
negative. The implies that large shocks to the risk premium in favor of
the pound (or in Chart 1 the Euro) tend to require both depreciations of
the exchange rate relative to the dollar – to set up the expectation of future
appreciation - as well as a rise in the real interest rate differential in favor
of the pound (or the Euro).

       Chart 6 depicts our decomposition of the JPY exchange rate into is
fair value and risk premium components. From 2005 through summer of
2010, the appreciation of the yen from 120 to 88 is almost fully accounted
for by an equal shift in our estimate of fair value. During most of this
period there was also a modest and not very volatile risk premium in favor
of the yen. This risk premium widened in the fall of 2008 but was almost
entirely eliminated by the summer of 2009. Since that time, we estimate
that a risk premium in favor of the dollar opened up as the yen continued
to appreciate notwithstanding a shift in fair value in the direction of a
weaker yen. Our last data point is February 11, 2011. Finally Chart 7
confirms that, if anything, changes in the yen and our measure of fair
value have been more highly correlated than we found for the Euro and
the pound.

V. Regressions of (r*t,n – rt,n) on ∆θt,n and ∆st on ∆θt,n

         Recall in our framework, period by period, we have

19 )                st   ( pt  p *t )  n ( r *t , n  rt , n )  t , n

A positive shock to θt,n is an increase in the risk premium on a UK
investment which increases the expected excess return a US investor
earns on a UK investment.               This must be brought about by some
combination of a rise in UK – US inflation indexed yield differential and or an
appreciation of the dollar relative to the pound. In daily data, we can recover
∆θt,n since every other term in equation (19) is observable (up to the
negligible error in approximating unobserved daily inflation differentials
with the per day monthly average inflation differential). We can thus for

                                                     19
each country regress n(r*t,n – rt,n) on ∆θt,n and ∆st on ∆θt,n to quantify how
much of a change in the risk premium is on average reflected in indexed
bond yields and how much is reflected in the nominal exchange rate.
When we do so, we find that a striking feature in the data is that, for all
three exchange rates, roughly half of a given rise in the risk premium is reflected in
a rise in the inflation indexed bond return differentials in favor of the foreign
country and the remaining half is reflected in an appreciation of the dollar.
These regression results are presented below in the following charts. We
note that while constant terms are included in each regression, none is
statistically significant. In each regression the sample is daily 1/1/2005 to
10/16/2012. We do not make any inference of cause and effect. All three
variables are endogenous. But any macro model of risk and return in the
foreign exchange market in a world with inflation indexed bonds should
endeavor to match these correlations.

VI. Concluding Remarks

       This paper has derived a novel structural relationship between the
nominal exchange rate, national price levels, and observed yields on long
maturity inflation - indexed bonds. This relationship can be interpreted as
defining the fair value of the exchange rate as well as an empirically
observable measure of the risk premium that can open up a wedge
between the observed level of the nominal exchange rate and its fair value.
We take our theory to the data to study high frequency, real time
decompositions of pound, euro, and yen exchange rates into their fair
value and risk premium components and find that the relative importance
of these two factors varies depending on the sub sample studied.
However, sub samples in which, contrary to the Meese-Rogoff (1983)
puzzle, 30 to 60 percent of the fluctuations in daily exchange rate changes
are explained by contemporaneous changes in fair value are not
uncommon. We also find that a striking feature in the data is that, for all
three major exchange rates in our study, on average roughly half of a given rise in
the risk premium is reflected in a rise in the inflation indexed bond return
differentials in favor the foreign country and the remaining half is reflected in an
appreciation of the dollar. We do not make any inference of cause and effect.
All three variables are endogenous. But any macro model of risk and
return in the foreign exchange market in a world with inflation indexed
bonds should endeavor to match these correlations.
       A priority for future research is to investigate the dynamic
relationship between shocks to the observable ∆θt,n and subsequent
changes in the spot exchange rate ∆st+j . We know from Section V that on
average in our sample a rise in ∆θt,n is contemporaneously associated with a
rise in (r*t,n – rt,n) and a decline (appreciation) in ∆st , and we know from
the Fama result that future changes in the spot rate ∆st+j are positively
correlated with the short term nominal differential i*t,1 – it,1. Modeling
empirically the dynamic not just the contemporaneous interaction between
the exchange rate, our measure of the risk premium, and the (macro)
factors orthogonal to risk that account for interest rate differentials
promises to add to our knowledge of risk and return in the currency
market.
