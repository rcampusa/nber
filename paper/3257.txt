           THE IMPACT OF THE 1986 TAX REFORM ACT ON PERSONAL SAVING


                                     ABSTRACT

                                                                    would
     Many critics believed that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86)
discourage saving.  Yet personal saving rates have rebounded since 1987. This
rebound might have been caused by a general decline in marginal tax rates on
household saving.  And we estimate, at least for the 1980s, a positive
                                                        of return.   But the tax

fragile; during the entire postwar period the correlation
rate of return and personal saving is at most zero.

     We also consider three alternative ways by which the Tax Reform Act could
have affected personal saving.   First, the cutbacks in IRA eligibility were
viewed by some as discouraging saving. But conventionallymeasured personal
                                                             We show that this

        The 1986 Tax Reform Act was viewed by some critics as discouraging

saving.t    While marginal rates were reduced,   the preferential treatment

of capital gains was erased and IRAs were largely shut down.     At   first,

the pessimistic view    of tax reform seemed to be borne out by the

statistics; personal saving rates plunged from an already low 4 percent

in 1986 to 1.8 percent in the second quarter of 1987.      But since that

time,    the saving rate has rebounded; by the second quarter of 1989 the

personal saving rate stood at 5.4 percent.

        One of the most difficult tasks in economics is to establish a

causal relationship, and in the case of a structural change as recent as

the 1986 tax reform, the task is particularly difficult. The first

question that must be addressed is, were there large changes in the

incentives to saving under the 1986 tax reform?      We find that the

changes in marginal household saving incentives were substantial.2 For

example.    27 percent of taxpayers, weighted by dividend income received,

experienced a decline in marginal tax rates on dividend income of more

than 20 percentage points.     We also find that the decline in marginal

rates and the increase in the tax on capital gains largely offset one

another,    leaving the effective household tax rate on investments largely

unchanged or even lowered.     Furthermore, investments held for a long

period of time were moat favored under the 1986 tax reform, even when



      For example, in late 1986 Murray Weidenbaum stated that under tax
reform,  "Investment incentives are clobbered... . [The tax billj depresses
saving and investment, and that reduces economic growth." (quoted in the
atipnsl Journal [October 11, 1986, page 2457]).
2     This paper focuses only on household saving incentives, although
the 1986 Tax Reform Act had a major effect on corporate tax incentives.
For reviews see Auerbach (1987) and Bovenberg (l989)
                                        -2-


accrued capital gains comprised a substantial fraction of the total

return.

     The second question is, how do these merginel incentives to aave --

aa aummarized by the after-tax rete of return        -   - affect   saving rates?
The evidence that the after-tax rate of return affects saving is weak,

although for the most pert the evidence excludes the latter part of the

l980s.3     We reevaluate the   evidence,   and first find that simple seving

regressions imply a negative interest elasticity of saving during the

postwar period.      Second,   the Euler equation approach to consumption

implies essentielly no effect of       the reel after-tax return on saving

(Hall,    1988).   But when the sample is restricted to the l980s, both the

saving and consumption regressions show a positive and significant

effect of the after-tax return on saving.         These results either suggest

a fundamental shift in saving behavior during the l980s, or a simple

statistical artifact,

     If the after-tax rate of return has had little historical impact on

aggregate    personal saving, then why should the 1986 Tax Reform Act

(TRA86) be expected to affect saving?         There are three reasons.       First,

TR&86 sharply restricted IRA eligibility to higher income taxpayers, and

IRA contributions fell by 62 percent between 1986 and 1987.             Generally,
microeconozsic studies have been supportive of the view that IRAs

represent new saving, so TRAB6 could have reduced household saving by

restricting IRAs.'     But the evidence from aggregate personal saving


      See Hall (1988), Boskin (1978), Howrey and Hymens (1978), Summers
(1982) and Friend end Hssbrouck (1983).

     See, for example, Venti and Wise (1986, 198?, 1989); FeenberE and
Skinner (1989); Hubbard (1984); for criticisms of these studies see
                                          -3-



suggests   that IRAs,   if   anything,   reduced saving.       Between 1982 when IRAs

became generally available, and 1986 when they were curtailed, personal

saving declined from 6,8 percent to 4 percent; since 1986 the saving

rate has rebounded by 2 percentage points,

     One explanation for the sharply different results between the

microeconomic studies suggesting that IRAs increase saving, and the

aggregate data suggesting that they do not, is the measurement of

saving.    Saving can be measured in two ways; either as the difference

between the flow of income and the flow of consumption -- which is how

personal saving is usually measured         -   - or   as the change in net wealth,

Theoretically, the two measures are identical.               But in practice,   they

are quite different.6 And saving rates calculated as the difference in

net wealth tell a different story of asset accumulation during the

period when IRAs were available;         this measure of saving remained high

during 1982-86,   and dropped off slightly after 1987,             Obviously, many

factors accounted for this increase        in net wealth, such as the stock

market boom, but the point remains that household asset accumulation was

strong during the mid 1980s.        Hence it is difficult to make any

conclusions about the effect of IRAs on saving based only on an

examination of aggregate saving rates, since alternative measures of

saving tell such different stories.

     The second way that TRA86 affected saving behavior was by phasing

out the deduction for personal interest payments and thereby increasing



Gravelle (1989) and preliminary work by Gale and Scholz (1989).
     For recent discussions of this issue, see Auerbach (1985); Boskin
(1988); Bradford (1989); and Hendershott and Peek (1989).
                                      -4-



the net cost of borrowing.     As a result of TRA86, total consumer credit

(excludinghouse mortgages) and revolving credit both fell sharply

between the letter half of 1986 and the first quarter of 1987.          Holding

other fectors conetent,   this would imply thet TRA86 stimulated saving,

since a dollar not borrowed is a doller saved.        But taxpeyers did not

hold their home mortgages constent.     Using e panel of taxpeyers      for the


years 1985 to 1987, we found thet taxpeyers shuffled their reduced

personal credit into home equity lines of credit or increased home

mortgages. Our estimetes suggest that of every dollar reduction in

personal interest payments,    between 67 end 86 cents went back into

increasedhome mortgage payments.      Perhaps this is one reeson why the

ratio of home mortgages to housing value reached 48 percent in 1988, a

sharp rise from the 40.4 peroent retio in 1984 (Federal Reserve Boerd,

1989).   At least for the weelthy taxpayers       n our sample,   the reduction

in personal oredit deductibility had little effect on overall saving.

     The third effeot of TRA86 on the level end composition of household

saving wes the controversial decision to ease the distinction between

long term capital gains end ordinary income.         The top marginal rate on

capital gains rose from 20 percent to 33 percent, while the statutory

rates on ordinary income declined.     Once it became clear that the new

law would raise cepital gains tames in 1987, taxpayers rushed to realize

long-term   gains in 1986.    While a lively debate still continues on

whether increased capital gains taxes raises revenue (Lindsey, 1987,

Cook and O'Hera, 1987, end Auerbech,        1988), a different,   and neglected,

question is how announced changes in the capital gains tax effected

household saving.    The primary impect of TRA86 on saving could have been
                                       -5-



to encourage taxpayers to unlocked their long-term gains and spend them

(Summers,   1989).   Results from the panel survey of taxpayers provide

little support for the view that the capital gains realization in 1986

reduced saving, although we do find evidence that taxpayers shifted

thefr capir,l gains into interest-bearing assets.      In summary, then, the

Tax Reform Act of 1986 had a stronger impact on the composition of

saving and credit than on     he   actual level of aggregate household

saving.




     II.    The Effect of TRA86 on the Marginal Return to Saving

     The objective of TRA86 was to broaden the tax base and lower

marginal rates.      These lower rates were phased in during 1987, and by

1988 taxpayers faced top marginal rates of 33 percent,     with the

wealthiest individuals paying a marginal tax of 28 percent.      For many

             the changes in marginal rates were quite small.    For example,
taxpaers,

in a 1987 study Rausman and Poterba evaluated the overall impact of

TRA86 on marginal rates:



     Our calculations suggest that in 1988, over 40 percent of the
taxpaying population will face marginal tax rates equal to or higher
than the rates they would face under current law. Only 11 percent of
taxpayers receive marginal tax rate reductions of ten percentage points
or more. In part, these findings account for our conclusion that the
tax reform will have relatively small aggregate effects (pp. 101.102).



     Our calculations focus less on the absolute number of taxpayers,

and more on those taxpayers who are actually receiving a large fraction

of interest,   dividend or capital gains income.     Our measure of marginal

tax rate changes weights each taxpayer by the amount of relevant income
that they received in 1986.   Since a large fraction of saving is done by

those whose tax rates are affected most by TRA86, we find substantial

shifts in the marginal tax rates on a "representativ&' or average dollar

of capital income.

     The distribution of these changes may be seen in Figures 1 and 2

(and in Table 1) as calculated by NBER's TAXSIM program.     The TAXSIM

model uses a stratified random sample of 75,400    US,   individual income

tax returns from 1984 weighted to replicate the universe of tax returns.6

Figure 1 shows the distribution of changes in the marginal tax rate on

dividends and capital gains between 1986 and 1988, weighted by dividend

and capital gains income, respectively.   For example, taxpayers who in

total account for 27 cents of every dollar received in dividend income

experienced a decline in their marginal tax rate of more than 20

percentage points.   This number largely reflects those taxpayers

formerly in the 50 percent bracket now subject to the 28 percent

bracket.   But almost every taxpayer experienced a sharp rise in their

capital gains tax; the rate jumped by at least 10 percentage points for

taxpayers receiving 74 cents of every dollar in capital gains.

     The corresponding figures are shown for the marginal tax rates on

interest income and personal credit in Figure 2.    In the first case, the


      The TAXSIM data includes all information (except taxpayer
identification) from the 1040 form and a few items from important
supporting schedules. The very rich are oversampled to provide more
accurate estimates of tax liabilities, with sampling rates of up to one
in three for the highest income levels. To the extent feasible,
complexities of the tax code, including income averaging, the minimum
tax, etc. , are accounted for in the calculation of tax liabilities and
marginal tax rates. The tax return data is as rich in income
information as it is poor in demographic information, Race, sex, and
exact age are pointedly not available.

percentage of taxpayers experiencing a shift in their marginal tax rates

are weighted by interest income received, while in the second case, we

weight by AGI (since total personal credit is unavailable).     There is an

overall decline in the marginal tax on interest, but it is less in

magnitude than that for dividend income because a smaller fraction of

interest income is held by the wealthiest taxpayers.   Only 6.2 percent

of interest income was taxed at the 50 percent marginal rate in 1986,

compared with 25 percent of dividend income in the same year.     Finally,

the reduction in deductions allowed on personal credit, from 100 percent

to 40 percent in 1988, coupled with the lower marginal tax rates in

1988, sharply increased the after-tax cost of personal borrowing.

Taxpayers who together accounted for 61 percent of AGI experienced at

least a 11 percentage point decline in the marginal deduction for

personal interest.

     While marginal dividend tax rates went down and capital gains taxes

went up, what was the overall impact of TRA86 on investments which pay a

combination of dividends and realized capital gains?   The popular view

was that assets which appreciated in value, especially over the

long-term, would suffer under TRA86 because of the higher capital gains

tax rate.   A simple calculation suggests otherwise.   Consider an

investment which retains    and pays in dividends (1-sb) of every dollar

in net business profits.   In the calculations that follow, we assume

that the fixed after-corporate-tax nominal return is r, the holding

period n years, and dividends paid in each year are reinvested in the

same investment,

     Consider a two-year investment purchased for $1; in the first year,
the accumulated value of the investment (after the first-year dividend

has been reinvested) is      I   +   'r + z, where z — (l-Or(l-r)       is the

after-tax dividend rate and r is tha income tax assessed on the
                             J
dividend.     At the end of the second year, the investment is sold, the

capital gains tax is paid, and net of the principal of $1, the investor

is left with

                      ((l+r+z)(l+Yr)-l](l-r)+ (l+Ør+z)z.
The two terms are (i) the accumulated after-tax capital gains, and (ii)

the after-tax second-year dividend,          In general, the realized return n

years in the future, (net of the principal) on en investment of one

dollar is written

     To measure the effect on incentives of TRA8G, we first celculete

the after-tax return K for a representative taxpayer under prior law.

For example, the after tax rate of return        R   on a $1 investment held for

5 years, paying 12 percent, and with a retained earning percentage of 50

percent is $0.44 at a marginal income tax rate                 of 50 percent end a

effect on the rate of return K of a tax reform which taxes cepitel gains

end dividends at the single rate            along the lines of TRA8G,
                                                                 In

     Taxpayers always prefer to pay lower taxes: if the taxpayer's true

marginal rate under TRAB6 is below             r     they are better off; if it is

above, they are worse off.              In the example above,   every taxpayer with a

marginal rate below 32 percent is better off under TRA86.                 Note that we

need not specify the inflation rate or the internal rate of return on

the investment to make this comparison.

     The calculations are presented in Table 2 for a variety of

parameters.       In the first row and first column of results, the reported
          *
value of r    ,   0.35     is the marginal tax rate that would leave the

investor indifferent to the original 50 percent tax bracket with 60

percent exclusion of capital gain; nearly every investor under TRA86

will be subject to marginal rates below 35 percent, and therefore will

be better off.       For longer holding periods, the marginal rate              first

falls to 32 percent, and then .j.g.g.g as the holding period increases

beyond 5 years.          That   is,   even when half of all profits are retained,

and hence subject to capital gains tax, nearly every taxpayer previously

in the 50 percent tax bracket will benefit under TRA86 for long-term

investments.7

    The intuition is that as the holding period increases, reinvested

dividends account for a larger fraction of the overall return.                 Under

TRA86, those after-tax dividends are larger, and hence augment the

overall rate of return5               For a wide range of interest rates and holding



     The calculations presented in the text refer only to new
investments made after 1987.  Old investments which pay ordinary income
tax on capital gains will obviously be disadvantaged by TRA86.
     The timing of the tax collection differs as well; under TRA86 a
larger portion of the tax is collected at realization in year n.

periods, TRA86 benefits household investors previously in marginal tax

brackets of 40 or 50 percent.    We have also calculated        for a 30

percent dividend payout rate       —   .7);   in this case the calculated   1s
are lower, but even the wealthy taxpayer formerly in the 50 percent

bracket and now in the 28 percentSbracket will be almost uniformly

better off under TR.A86.

     While these calculations suggest that conventional saving vehicles

were relatively unharmed at the household level by TRA86, there were a

number of investment categories which experienced sharp increases in tax

liability, auch as real estate and investments generating passive

losses.     It is not surprising that partnership and S corporation net

losses fell by 40 percent and rental property by 23 percent between 1986

and 1987 (Hostetter and Bates, 1989). This evidence suggests that TRA86

was successful in discouraging household saving in these formerly

tax-favored investments,     Nevertheless, for orthodox financial

investments, and particularly those with low levels of retained

earnings, TRA86 generally reduced marginal tax rates on household

saving.     Whether these lower tax rates translated into higher household

saving rates is the topic of the next section.



     III.     The After-tax Rate of Return. Savina. and Conumotion

     The impact of a change in the interest rate on saving is ambiguous.

The substitution effect induces investors to save more in response to a

higher return, but a higher return provides the investor with more

future income for a given level of saving; this income effect may lead

to a reduction in overall saving.       On theoretical grounds, however, the
                                       -11-


lower marginal rates under TRA86 might be expected to increase saving.

First, the tax reform was designed to be revenue neutral, so that the

overall income effect will be nearly zero.           Second, as Summers (1981)

has demonstrated in a life cycle model, the endowment effect --             that   an

increased interest rate will reduce the present value of future earnings

and thus depress current consumption      -   -   tends   to imply a positive saving

elasticity      Yet the empirical evidence for any positive correlation

between the after-tax rate of return and the saving rate is very weak.

Some studies have found positive effects of the interest rate on saving

(Boskiri, 1978; Summers, 1982), but they are not robust to alternative

empirical specifications (Howrey and Hymans, 1978; Hall, 1988; also see

Friend and Hasbrouck, 1983).      As a first step, it is useful to reexamine

the evidence in light of new data from the 1980s.

     We adopt    as our measure   of personal saving the Commerce Department

(NIPA)   saving measure plus contributions to government pension plans,'°

divided by disposable personal income plus the government pension

contributions.    We include government pensions for consistency with the

convention of including private pensions in saving (Hendershott and

Peek, 1989).     There are alternative measures of saving (discussed

below), but we adopt this measure of saving because it addresses a

well-defined question: Are U.S. households generating sufficient saving



     Defined benefit pension plans are a perfect example of "target'
saving, since a higher interest rate will reduce the contributions
necessary to meet future benefit payments. Hence the importance ofT
pension funds in personal saving would tend to reduce the interest
elasticity of saving (Bernheim and Shoven, 1985; Nakin and Couch, 1989).

to finance domestic investment?   If personal (along with corporate

business plus government) NIPA saving are low, then foreign inflows are

nacessary to finance domestic investment.    While the economic effect of

large foreign capital inflows are not necessarily harmful, future U.S.

national income will be reduced as a larger fraction of the return on

U.S. capital flows overseas.

downward.   Since 198?, saving rates have increased, but they still

remain below rates during the 1970s.

     Although our primary interest is in personal saving rates, we

include the three-quarter moving average of private saving (which also

includes the government pension contributions) because, in both theory

and practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between business and

private saving.   First, on theoretical grounds, buainess saving could

substitute for personal saving, since the ultra-rational consumer would

care little whether the corporation in which she owned stock was saving

level.   Second, and more practically, the personal saving rate is a

    Figure 3 may suggest that TRA86 encouraged personal and private

saving, since saving rates rebounded during 1987,   the first year of its

implementation.   But there were many factors that affected saving in

recent years.   To list only three; (i) farm support payments were large

(and not seasonally adjusted) in 1988, and could account for roughly

half of the increase in the saving rate (Koretz, 1989); (ii) strong

automobile sales fell in 1988, leading to a decline in consumer durable

sales and hence a 'rebound" in saving (Koretz, 1989); and (iii) tax

collections were high during 1987 (perhaps as a result of TRA8G   or
payments on capital gains made during 1986) which temporarily depressed

disposable personal income.   In short, one cannot make inferences about

the success or failure of TRA86 by looking at short-term quarterly

changes in personal saving rates.   Nevertheless, the evidence is clear

that while personal saving may have stemmed its downward slide, it still

remains below its level of the 1970s.

    Another approach to measure the impact of TRA86 on saving is to

statistically estimate the impact of the after-tax rate of return on

saving during the postwar period, and then use this structural estimate

to evaluate tax reform.   As a first step, then, we define the after-tax

return to be the return on a 3-month treasury bill less the average

marginal tax rate on interest income, less expected inflation.11 The

expected inflation measure is taken from Hamilton (1985), who used a

Kalman filtering technique to estimate the implied expectations by

financial markets of next-period inflation,        Thete are two advantages of

this method for measuring expected inflation over the commonly used

Livingston inflation survey.    The first is that the Hamilton measure of

expected nflstion is generated every three months, unlike the

Livingston survey which applies over a     6   month period.   The second is

thmt Livingstone surveys do not use all the financial information

available in making inflation forecssts,'2 We extend the Hamilton measure

     Three-quarter moving averages of the personal saving rate and the

reel efter-tex rate of return are shown in Figure 4.       The most striking

relationship between the two is the long-term negative correlation

between the saving rate and the interest rate; interest rates were low

in the 1970s end high in the 1980s, while saving rates were high in the

1970s end low in the l980s.    But within the 1980s, saving rates appear

to be positively correlated with the after-tax reel return.

information, such as money supply changes, would result in inflation

between saving and the after-tax return.   We also include two other

factors to explain saving; the fear of nuclear war as proxied by

'Minutes to Midnight,' a measure that Slemrod (1986) found to be

significant in explaining the postwar saving rate,1' and the quarterly

change in log disposable income to reflect transitory income shifts

absorbed by variation in saving.   Regression (I) shows that a reduction

in the risk of nuclear war has a strong positive effect on saving rates,

but as is suggested by the graph, there is a negative (and significant)

correlation between interest rates and saving rates.

     The same regression using data after 1982, shown in Row (3), yields

different results.   The regression implies that every one percentage

point increase in the after-tax return will increase saving by 0.66

percentage points; this result is somewhat stronger when the other

explanatory variables are excluded.   A transitory income shift is

predicted to have a strong positive impact on the saving rate, while

lower fear of nuclear war leads to less, rather than more, saving.      It

is not clear whether these estimates imply a fundamental shift in saving

behavior during the 1980g.   For example, the growth of money market

funds and interest bearing accounts during the late 1970s could have

forged a stronger link between saving and interest rates, but the

possibility remains that it is simply a statistical anomaly.   But even

for this saving elasticity, large by empirical standards, the implied

percentage points

     Most macroeconomiste have eschewed saving regressions in favor of

the Euler equation approach to estimating the interest sensitivity of

consumption.     The Euler equation approach. as pioneered by Hell (1978)

relies upon the notion that consumption at time t, end planned

consumption    at   time   t+l, will reflect all information known to
individuals at      time   t. Any divergence in period tel between actual               and

planned consumption must be the result of a random surprise                -   -   in
income, for exsmple --       that   occurred in tel.        Furthermore, the interest

rate affects the time-path of planned consumption.                A higher rate of

interest, for example, increases the incentive to defer consumption

until next year.       In sum, the Euler approach implies that consumption in

year t+l is a function of consumption in the previous period and of the

interest rate.       The implied coefficient on the interest rate is the

intertemporal elasticity of substitution.m

     Hall (1988) has used Euler equation regressions to chow that the

after-tax real rate of return has little or no impact on the time-path

of consumption, or equivalently, the intertemporel interest elasticity

of consumption is essentially         zero.   Row     (3)   in Table 3 confirms his

results.   Consumption is defined to be the log change in reel nondurable


15    One can also interpret the coefficient es the inverse of the
relative risk aversion measure (Hall, 1988).

(nonservice) consumption, and the estimated intertemporal elasticity is

only 0.04, with a t-statistic of 0.76.         Fear of nuclear war also has

little effect on consumption, and the adjusted R2 is negative.        One

problem with using quarterly data is time aggregation bias; even if

monthly consumption follows a random walk, quarterly consumption will

not.    Hall suggests a simple correction from Hayashl. and Sims (1983);

the regression using this correction is shown in Row (4), in which the

coefficients are not noticeably different from the previous row.

Finally, to correct for potential endogeneity of the interest rate, Row

(5)    instruments the ax post after tax return with lagged values of the

interest rate and two-quarter lagged consumption changes; results are

unchanged.

       Surprisingly, Euler consumption regressions in the sub-period

1979-1988 shows a strong positive effect of the real after-tax interest

rate on consumption.    Row   (6) presents the regression result without the

nuclear war variable; the estimated elasticity of substitution is 0.26

with a t-statistic of 4.0.     In Row   (7) the elasticity estimate drops to

0.16 after including the nuclear war variable, but the coefficient

remains significant at conventional levels.        The full instrumental

variable procedure in this subperiod led to an insignificant (and

negative) coefficient on the after-tax real return.

       The general consensus in the literature is that positive interest

elasticity estimates, either of consumption or saving, are fragile and

fleeting.    The evidence from the later 1970s, when interest rates were

strongly negative yet saving rates relatively high, lends support to

this view.    Nevertheless, regressions restricted to the 1980s show a

significant correlation betwaen consumption and saving and the after-tax

     andtheeasuramencof5avin
     The 1986 Tax Reform Act should be judged on more than how it

affacted the after-tax rate of return,   In this and the sections that

follow, we will examine how T8A86 affected other policies towards

saving

     The tax reform placed restrictions on Iddividual Retirement

Accounts (IRAa) for single taxpayers with income over $25,000 and

married taxpayers with income over $40,000.   Some critics viewed these

cutbacks on IRA eligibility as a major blow to saving.   For example, a

recent report by the Joint Committee on Taxation suggested that the drop

in the saving rate between 1986 and 1987 was caused by the restrictions

on IPAs (New York Times, 1989).

     There is no question that TRA86 cut back sharply on ThA enrollment,

even for those who remained eligible to contribute (Summers, 1989;

Gravelle, 1989).   There was at least a 35 percent decline in

contributions between 1986 and 1987 for taxpayers at all income levels.'0

Summers (1989) attributes this decline to the fall in aggressive

marketing of IRAs by financial institutions following the eligibility

restrictions in TRA86.T


15     Some part of this reduction may have been caused by the reduction
in marginal rates. The tax subsidy is lower when marginal rates ere
lower, and one advantage of an IRA -- deducting the contribution at a
high marginal rate while working, and paying the tax at a low marginal
rate while retired -- was sharply diminished by TRA86.
'    The tax reform also restricted maximum contributions to 401(k)
                                    -19-



      While there is no question that IRAs contributions fell, there is

still some question whether the lost IRAs reduced personal saving.        That

is,   if taxpayers simply shuffle assets from taxable accounts into IRAs,

then restricting the use of IRAs   will have no   impact on saving --    if
anything, the restrictions will increase national saving by easing the

budget deficit.   But the evidence from microeconomic studies of IRAs and

saving are consistent with the view that IRAs increase saving.

Estimates from Venti and Wise (1986, 1987, 1989) and Hubbard (1984)

imply that a large fraction of IRA saving comes from consumption rather

than other (taxable) forms of saving.      Feenberg and Skinner (1989)

compare the taxable interest and dividend income of taxpayers before and

after the introduction of IRAs, and find no evidence of simple

shuffling.   While some recent studies have criticized the econometric

specification used by Venti and Wise (Gravelle, 1989, and Gale and

Scholz, 1989), and the results of Feenberg and Skinner are consistent

with a more sophisticated form of shuffling, there has been no

aicroeconomic study which supports widespread shuffling of existing

saving into IRA accounts.

      The macroeconomic evidence seems to contradict the view that IRAs

are new saving.   As is shown in Figure    3, the personal saving rate   slid

downward during 1982-86, precisely the period during which IRA

contributions averaged roughly $30 billion per year.     Once IRAs were

restricted in 1987, the saving rate recovered to its current rate of 5.4




plans, although few enrollees were affected by the restrictions.
Salisbury (1989) suggested that 401(k)s substituted for IRAs after
TRA8G.

percent.
           u   Can the nicroaconomic data be reconciled with the aggregate

data?

    One potential reconciliation of this paradox is                to   ask whether

alternative measures of houaehold acrumulation cast a different light on
aaving behavior during the years that IP.As were available. The Federal
Reserve Board compiles      yearly measures of household wealth.              The

Haig-Stmona definition of saving          is aimply the real change in household

wealth over the year, a meaaure which is eaaly calculated from the

Federal Reserve data.       In practice, this mesaure of saving is much

different from NIPA saving, primarily because capital gains are included

in the household balance sheet (ace Bradford, 1989; Hendarahott and

Peek, 1989).     Which saving series one uses depends on what question is

being asked.     As we noted above, our primary concern is whether TRA86

has stimulated the supply of funds for domestic investment, and for this

type of question, the orthodox saving measure (with the government

pension adjustment) is adequate.           But in looking at household purchases

of IRAs, a measure of saving which emphasizes total household wealth may

be more appropriate.        Figure   B   shows annual household saving rates as

calculated for households and nonprofit institutions (Federal Reserve

Board, 1989).      Because there is a great deal of fluctuation in

year-to-year saving rates (caused by shifts both in the value of the

stock market and in the implicit price deflator), we have constructed

three-year averages of saving rates which excludes durables.      Haig-Simon

income is constructed by adding capital gains calculated from the

Federal Reserve balance sheets to disposable personal income.19     The

saving rates calculated in this way differ sharply from the traditional

measures; household wealth declined during the late l970s and early

1980s (in large part because of the laggard stock market), before

recovering in the l980s.   But by 1988, saving rates had stagnated.2°

While it is difficult to pick turning points in saving patterns from

three-year averages, these results are not inconsistent with the view

that IRAs were positively associated with household saving.    Note that

we do not regard these aggregate results as proving in any sense that

IRAs stimulated saving during 1982-86.     Instead, we question whether

aggregate saving statistics can be used to test whether IRAs are a

success or failure in encouraging saving, since the answer depends so

       Phasing out deductions for personal interest payments to reduce

borrowing is one approach to scimulate net saving.                 The transition from

the pre-1986 tax law allowing full deductibility was gradual, wich 65

percent deductible in 1987, dropping gradually to 10 percent deduccible

in   1990,   and corlately phased out thareafter.             The combination of the

partially phased out personal intarast deduction and the much lower

marginal tax rates lad in 1987 to a substantial daclina in the tax

advantage of borrowing.        For example, a taxpayer in the 50 percent

bracket in 1986 would pay only half the gross borrowing rate after

taxes; the same taxpayer in a 28 pertant brackat during 1987 would pay

82 percent of the gross rate after taxes.              In this section we present

evidence from both aggregate and panel data that taxpayers sharply

reduced their outstandfng personal cradit.             Hanca TRA86 was successful

at reducing taxpayers' relianca on personal borrowing,                But TPA86 was

unauccassful at reducing overall borrowing; wa show that for wealthier

taxpayers, much of the reduction in personal credit was simply shuffled

into home mortgage loans, leaving total credit nearly unaffected.2'

      First, consider the aggregate impact of TRA8G on total consumer

credit (excluding home mortgages), revolving credit, and mortgages on

used to finance consumption expenditures as well as reducing other types

1-4 family dwellings (Federal Reserve Board Bulletin).    Figure 6 shows

the four-quarter change in outstanding credit for each of these measures

during 1982-88, with a vertical line in the first quarter of 1987 to

show the transition to the new tax regime.    There is considerable

fluctuation from year-to-year depending on interest rates and other

factors, but the sharp decline in personal credit between the latter

half of 1986 and the first quarter of 1987 is substantial.     By contrast,
home mortgage credit expanded during the period immediately following

TRA86, and thereafter returned to its previous growth rate.22

     It is difficult to make strong inferences based on the aggregate

time-series data, since there are so many factors that affect consumer

credit.    A clearer picture of how TRA86 affected the composition of

consumer debt comes from a panel survey of taxpayers during the years

1984-87.   While there is no public use sample of 1987 tax returns as of

this writing, John Karl Scholz has kindly made available to us a

nonrandom sample of approximately 20,000 largely well-off taxpayers

collected for a different study.   The sample is nonrandom because the

choice of the sample was based on their residence.   The information

available for each taxpayer is essentially the same as for the ordinary

public use tapes.   Our sample of 7165 excludes nonitemizers, individuals

with AGI Lass than $10,000, and ACI in excess of $1 million.    The

average income of the sample was $63,760 in 1985.



22    The ratio of consumer credit to mortgage credit has fallen from
 41 in December 1985 to .36 in December 1988. But it is not clear
whether this change is a temporary fluctuation or permanent trend. In
1975, the ratio was .44, but by 1981 it had dipped to .36 (Federal
Reserve Bank, 1989).

     One advantage of a panel data set is that we observe individual

                                                             for
taxpayers before and after the tax reform, so we can correct

individual differences across taxpayers.    Column I of Table 4 shows a

least squares regression of the change in personal credit interest as a

function of the tax price (i.e.,   one minus the effective marginal rate),

the real change in Act, and marital status.    The tax price exterts a

positive and significant impact on personal credit; a 5 percentage point

increase in the tax price is predicted to reduce personal interest

payments by $570.   For example, a taxpayer previously facing a marginal

rate of 50 percent who after TRA86 faces a 28 percent rate would be

                                                               in 1987.

tests whether the change in personal credit interest had an impact on

changes in home mortgage interest payments.    The coefficient implies

that a reduction in personal interest payments of $1 is associated with

a 67 cent increase in mortgage payments.2' That is, only 33 cents of

                                            reflects a cutback in
every dollar reduction in interest payments

spending.

     There is a potential simultsneity bias when the chsnge in personal

credit is used as an exogenous explanatory variable for the change in

                                                      be affected by
mortgage interest payments, since both variables will

individual-specific unobservable factors.     To correct for this, we

estimate a two-stsge least squares regression in which the change in

personal interest payments is identified oy the shift its own tax price.

Results are shown in Column   3   of Table 4; they imply an even larger (and

                                              each dollar reduction in
significant) shuffling effect of 86 cents for

personal credit payments.

     These results may not be stable with respect to the model

specification.   If the variance of the error term is proportional to

income, then a correction for heteroscedssticity is to weight each

observation by the inverse of the square root of    Ad.   Regressions using

this correction resulted in similar results for the least squares

                                                  for the 2SLS
regression, but resulted in insignificant results

regressions.

     In sum, the evidence suggests that itemizing taxpayers who owned a

house circumvented the restrictions on personal interest payments by

shuffling their consumer debt into home mortgages.      This may be one

reason why the ratio of home mortgages to home market value has risen in

1988 to 48 percent, 10 percentage points higher than the average ratio

during the 1970s (Fedsrsl Reserve Board, 1989).



     VI.    Csoitsl Gains end Saving

     There is 5 some evidence on how cspital gains tax rates affect
                                     -26-



revenue, although there may be little agreement over how to interpret

it.25    But there is little evidente on how oapital gains taxation affects

saving.     One view ia that lower capital gains taxation encourages

saving, and in particular seving in high-risk enterprises such as

venture capital (see Poterbe, 1989). Another view is that temporarily

low capital gains tax retes will reduce saving rates as investors who

realize long-term capital gains are tempted to spend the cash on

big-ticket consumption items rather than reinvest it (Summers, 1989).

In this view, the 1986 Tax Reform had its primary impact on saving rates

before it became effective as investors realized gains just prior to the

1987 capital gains tax increase.26

        We use the Scholz panel of taxpayers to gain some indirect evidence

on what individuals did with their capital gains realized in 1986; did

they spend or reinvest them?     To do this, we compare interest and

dividend inoome before and after TRA86 to see whether large capital

gains are assooiated with a decline in asset income.    This finding would

suggest that the money was spent rather than reinvested.    The test is

not perfect since we are using information only from a subset of the

taxpayer's total assets.    An additional question is whether investors

who realized capital gains in 1986 reinvested them in interest-bearing

assets which, relative to capital gains, are favored under the new tax


25    See Cook and O'Hara (1987), and in particular Auerbsch (1988) for
reviews of recent literature.
26    Note that this story of taxpayers spending their capital gains
because the cash is at hand is not entirely consistent with a model of
rational investor behavior. A rational investor separates investment
transactions to msximize wealth from consumption decisions to maximize
utility; strictly speaking, the decision to realize expected capital
gains should have little effect on conaumption choices.

law.

       Table 5 presents regression results which casts some doubt on the

                                                          The first
hypothesis that those taking capital gains spent thea.
                                                            of imputed
regression (Row 1) uses as the dependent variable a measure

wealth, defined to be interest income divided by the average interest

rate in that year plus dividend income divided by the average dividend

yield.    The null hypothesis that all capital gains are reinvested is

that the 1986 capital gains coefficient should be zero; capital gains

should have no impact on future asset income.    Should the capital gains

tax be paid out of the realizations in the same year, then the

coefficient should be negative.    Alternatively, if the capital gains are

taken on assets which pay neither interest or dividend income, but the

proceeds are shifted into taxable accounts, then the coefficient on

capital gains would be positive.     For example, if private investors

dissolved a real estate partnership and invested the proceeds in bonds,

imputed taxable wealth would rise.

       The regression coefficients in Table S are consistent with this

latter story.    The effect of an increase in capital gains of $1 during

1986 is to increase 1987 imputed wealth by 38 cents.     Thus the evidence

                                                    who took capital
provides little support for the view that investors

gains in 1986 spent them.    Instead, it appears that investors shifted

their assets which previously yielded little taxable income into

interest-bearing accounts or stocks.

       One possible explanation for this result iS that investors park

their capital gains in relatively liquid (and taxable) instruments for a

                                             hence the coefficient of
year or so before choosing a new investment;

 .38   on 1986 capital gains is simply a short-run                        In
                                                   adjustment effect.
 this view the coefficient on 1985 capital gains should be less than the

 coefficient on 1986; in fact it is substantially more.    Phile the 1985

capitel gains coefficient is not significant in the regression in Row 1,

 it is in Row 2 when the regression is
                                       weighted by the inverse of the

square root of ACT to correct for potential heteroscedasticity of the

error term.     Row 3 which uses as the dependent variable the sum of

interest and dividend income yields similar results.

       Rows 4 and 5 in Table 5 enter interest And dividend income

separately as dependent variables.    These regressions suggest that TRA86

had a stronger impact on the composition of saving than on the overall

level of saving.    The interest regression shows that for every dollar of

1986 capital gains, interest income rose by 3.8 cents,     With average
returns on interest-bearing assets roughly double this value, the

coefficient implies that almost half the realized capital gsins were

shifted into interest bearing accounts.     By contrast, capital gains
taken in 1985 had little or no effect on interest income in 1987.

       The regressions explaining dividend income in 1987 (Row 5)
                                                                  suggest
a much different pattern.    Capital gains in 1986 had no effect on

dividends although past capital gains from 1985 affected 1987 dividends.

That is, recent realizations of capital gains do not appear to have been

heavily reinvested in stocks, but instead are placed largely in accounts

paying interest income.

       An alternative explanation for this pattern is that capital gains

are parked in short-ten
                        interest-bearing accounts, so the correlation

between 1986 capital gains and 1987 interest income simply reflects
                                       -29-


short-run adjustment.     To test for this, we regress 1986 interest income

on 1985 capital gains to get a measure, untinged by tax code changes, of

the normal propensity to place capital gems in temporary

interest-bearing accounts (Row 6).       The coefficient is 0.014, implying

that nearly two thirds of the capital gains shift into investments

                                                             shift
psying interest income (l-(l,4/3.8J) represented a permsnent

sssocieted with TRA86.

       In conclusion, we find more evidence supporting the view that

tsxpsyers shifted cspitel    gems     tnto assets favored under TRA8G.   While

our test for the hypothesIs thst investors spent some fraction of their

1986 capital gains on consunption is not strong, there is little

evidence to support it.     Further, the tests are likely contaminated by

other fsctors occurring during this volatile period      n financial
markets, but at least one --    the   stock market rise during most of 1987

--   would have discouraged investments in interest-bearing assets.27



       nclus
       Stimulating the saving rate was never the primary objective of the

1986 Tax Reform Act.     Instead, TRA86 was designed to close down abusive

tax shelters, equalize the tax treatment of different assets, and lower

marginal rates.    Were policies to encourage saving consistent with these

objectives?    We have argued in this paper that TRA86 was successful at

the household level in reducing the marginal tax rates on household

saving, even for long-term investments with much of its return paid in

accrued capital gains.

    Whether one csn detect the effect of these improved incentives on

measured aggregate saving rates is another matter.     Saving is usually

defined as income less consumption.   Small percentage changes in either

income or consumption can lead to large fluctuations in saving rates, so

that attrihuting the 2 percentage point rise in aggregate personal

                                          at best.     Furthermore, the
saving since 1987 to TRA86 is speculative

historical record seems quite clear in indicating little effect on

                                                            the 1980s
saving of the after-tax real interest rate, although during

the real after-tax interest rate was correlated with both saving and

consumption.   Nevertheless, it is difficult to conclude from aggregate

time-series data that TRA86 had any impact   -   negative or positive   -   on

aggregate personal saving.

     If the link between the after-tax rate of return and personal

saving is weak, than has TRA86 affected saving behavior

TRA86 favored some forms of saving over others, and the evidence is

clear that TRA86 did affect the composition of saving.      For example, the

eligibility rules were tightened for IRAs, which lead to a 62 percent

decline in tax deductible contributions between 1986 and 1987.      If IRAs

                                                     then TRA86 would be
represented mew saving, rather than shuffled saving,

viewed as discouraging retirement saving. Yet standard measures of
                                                                   were

                                            since 1987.      Onca again, we
widely available, and an increase in saving

suggest that one cannot infer a great deal from aggregate saving rates,

since an alternative measure of saving from household wealth data tells

an entirely different story in which saving rates were quite strong
                                     -31-



during the golden age of IRAs.

        The 1986 Tax Reform also gradually phased out the deductibility of

interest on personal credit.     Personal credit declined sharply after

1986,   which might by itself be expected to increase net national saving.

But we found strong evidence that wealthier taxpeyers successfully

shifted a large fraction of their personal losn reductions into home

mortgage loans.     This type of shuffling from consumer credit into

housing credit had little mpsct on saving.

        The Tax Reform Act of 1986 also increased the tax on capital gains

in 1981, and by doing so set off a stampede to cash in gains under the

prior law (Auerbach, 1988).    There is little evidence that our sample of

taxpayers spent their realized capital gains; instesd they appear to

have largely reinvested them.     But they did shift e larger fraction of

the 1986 capital gains into interest-bearing accounts to take advantage

of their relatively more favorable tax treatment.

        We have ignored one very important factor, the change in tax rules

for business investment, in evaluating the effect of TRA86 on saving.

Some observers during the mid-1980s predicted declines of up to 200

basis points in after-corporate-tax rate of return owing to the

lengthening of asset lives for depreciation end the repeal of the

investment tax credit (Heusmen and Poterbe, 1987), and this lower rate

of pre-tax return could affect household saving. Yet the after-tax real

return should reflect changes in corporate as well as personal income

taxes, end there is little evidence that the rate of return available to

households has fallen dramatically since TRA86.

        Recent developments in Congress suggest that the tacit agreement to
                                  -32-


resist tinkering with the 1986 Tax Reform may have now been broken.     If

there is a lesson, then, from just a few years experience with the 1986

Tax Reform, it is that the tax code has a stronger and more immediate

impact on the financial composition rather than the absolute level of

personal saving.

Notes: The first column is the gross return on the investment, while
the second is the initial income tax rate r under pre-TRA86 tax law.
                                           y
The third through sixth columns are the marginal tax rates    which
under TRA86 (with full taxation of capital gains) leave the taxpayer
with an equal after-tax return.

Notes: Equation (5) which is starred was estimated using 2SLS. The saving
rate is defined as personal saving divided by disposable personal income
(uncorrected for government pension contributions), and t-statiatics are in
parentheses. Consumption (LCons) is the log change in real quarterly
nondurable nonservice consumption. While the 'true' period of consumption is
arbitrary, we adopt the time-aggregation adjustment of          - .
