The Labor Market Returns to Advanced Degrees

NBER Working Paper No. 26959

JEL No. I21,I26,J24,J31

                                         ABSTRACT

We estimate the labor market return to an MBA, a JD, and master's in engineering, nursing,
education, psychology and social work, and thirteen other graduate degrees. To control for
heterogeneity in preferences and ability, we use fixed effects for combinations of field-specific
undergraduate and graduate degrees obtained by the last time we observe an individual. Basically,
we compare earnings before the graduate degree to earnings after the degree. We find large
differences across graduate fields in earnings effects, and more moderate differences in internal
rates of return that account for program length and tuition. The returns often depend on the
undergraduate major. The contribution of occupational upgrading to the earnings gain varies
across degrees. Finally, simple regression-based estimates of returns to graduate fields are often
highly misleading.

1 Introduction
Graduate education has grown rapidly in the U.S. and other countries. The ratio of new master's degrees

awarded relative to the number of 24-year-olds in the U.S. has increased from 5.5% in 1985 to 14.7% in 2013.

Over the same period, the ratio of new master's degrees to new bachelor's degrees rose from about 27% to

about 37%. A similar pattern has occurred in other OECD countries. For example, in the UK, the fraction

of 24-year-olds with master's degrees rose from about 22% to 27% between 2005 and 2013.
                                                                                                      1

    Many papers report estimates of the earnings dierential between individuals with an advanced degree

and those who stop with a bachelor's degree, but there is very little research studying dierences in earnings

across    graduate degrees, even at the descriptive level. Figure 1 presents average earnings of full-time workers

for the 19 graduate degree types that we focus on in the paper, and Table B1 provides values for a much

more disaggregated set. The degree dierentials are large. For example, on average people with a master's

in education earn $66,174, while MBAs earn $113,177 and medical degree holders earn $164,317. A person

deciding about graduate programs needs to know whether these estimates represent causal eects.                       And

knowledge of the average causal eects is not enough, because returns may depend on undergraduate eld,

ability, and occupational preferences.

    This paper provides estimates of the returns to a broad set of graduate degrees.                 First, we estimate

average returns to specic graduate degrees, such as an MBA, controlling for the main eects of college

major. Second, we examine how these returns dier depending upon the undergraduate degree. Third, and

more tentatively, we present estimates of the experience prole of the returns.

    In order to credibly estimate returns to specic graduate degrees, we must account for the role of pref-

erences and pre-determined ability in the joint determination of eld of study, occupation, and earnings.

Graduate education and ability shift what an individual could potentially earn in each occupation. But in

a real sense, individuals choose their actual earnings by choosing job type based on both preferences and

potential earnings.     This can make earnings comparisons misleading as estimates of the causal eect of a

degree for those who choose it. For example, an individual might prefer a master's in ne arts to an MBA

because she enjoys art and would prefer to work as an artist rather than as a business analyst.                   Absent

graduate school in ne arts, her counterfactual occupation might be a lower paying but arts-related job, not

a business position. In this situation, the dierence in earnings between ne arts graduates and individuals

who do not go to graduate school would understate the labor market value of a ne arts degree.

    The same selection issues complicate estimation of the return to a particular graduate degree for individ-

uals with a given undergraduate degree. MBAs with a bachelor's in education are likely to dier from MBAs

who majored in economics not only in the type of human capital they acquired in college but also in their

preferences, predetermined ability, and occupations before graduate school.

    To address these issues, we use experience adjusted pre graduate school earnings of individuals who later

obtain a graduate degree to approximate what they would have earned had they not gone to graduate school.

One of the approaches we consider is to include person specic xed eects (FE) in a regression model that

includes dummy variables for graduate degrees in the current period. Abstracting from other controls, this

approach identies the return to graduate school using only people with earnings observations both before

and after graduate school.       Its main disadvantage is that for such people the elapsed time between when

the graduate degree was obtained and when earnings are observed is typically short in our data. For this

and other reasons, we rely primarily on a related approach, which we call FE-cg.                Instead of person xed

  1 The   numbers are from Altonji et al. (2016b). Lemieux (2014) and Lindley and Machin (2016), among others, discuss the
implications of the growth in graduate education for income distribution.

eects, FE-cg includes xed eects for whether an individual has obtained a particular college major                      c   and

graduate eld   g   combination by the last time that we observe them. The main advantage of FE-cg is that

it makes full use of individuals with earnings observations only before the advanced degree and the large

number observed only after the advanced degreenot just individuals who are observed both before and

after. Our identication strategy only applies to people who work between college and graduate school, but

they account for 85% of those who obtain graduate degrees.

   Our parameters of interest are the treatment on the treated (TT) eects of graduate eld                 g   for individuals

who majored in     c,   for various combinations of   c   and   g.   An example is the eect on earnings of obtaining an

MBA for engineering majors who get an MBA. The TT parameter is the dierence between two weighted

averages. The rst is the weighted average of potential earnings associated with each occupation conditional

on college and graduate eld, ability, and preferences.                The second is the corresponding weighted average

for the no graduate school counterfactual.            For the rst average the weights are the actual conditional

probabilities of choosing the occupations for those who obtain             g.   For the counterfactual average the weights

are the counterfactual probabilities.      Both sets of weights also depend on the conditional distributions of

ability and preferences of those who have chosen the particular BA and graduate eld.

   Expressions for the OLS, FE, and FE-cg estimators of the TT parameters reveal that OLS will almost

certainly be biased, with the sign of the bias depending on the graduate degree. The reason is that OLS uses

the wrong counterfactual earnings values. We also provide conditions under which FE-cg will be unbiased.

Roughly speaking, the rst condition is that no new information about ability or preferences arrives between

the time when pre graduate school earnings are observed and when the decision to attend graduate school

is made. The second is a set of assumptions that imply a common experience prole conditional on college

major. These include the eect of experience on potential earnings, the eect of experience on the occupation

choice probabilities given ability and preferences, and the eects of learning about ability and preferences on

earnings gains through occupational mobility. We also must restrict the role of occupation specic experience.

   The data are from multiple waves of the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG, 1993 to 2015), and

the National Survey of Recent College Graduates (NSRCG, 1993 to 2010). Some individuals are surveyed

more than one time. The data sets contain basic controls, earnings, occupation, and education histories that

include acquired undergraduate and graduate degrees by eld of study. They are large enough to support

FE-cg estimation of the returns to graduate school for 31 combinations of undergraduate and graduate elds.

These data are a rich and underutilized resource for the study of undergraduate and graduate education.

   The empirical work starts with a descriptive analysis of the links among undergraduate eld, occupation,

and graduate eld.         We document three facts.        First, the link between undergraduate eld and graduate

eld varies substantially across graduate elds.             Second, both undergraduate eld and occupation before

graduate school have strong connections to graduate eld. Finally, the eect of graduate eld on postgraduate

occupation is about twice as large as undergraduate eld.

   We then look in more detail at the pre and post graduate school occupations for a few undergraduate

and graduate degree combinations, such as bachelors in engineering paired with a master's in education,

an MBA or a master's in engineering.          These results show that the distribution of pre graduate school

occupations is shifted toward the occupations that are more common for the particular advanced degree.

They suggest that the counterfactual occupations for engineering majors who get an MBA are dierent from

the occupations of engineering majors who do not attend graduate school. This means that regression models

that in essence compare earnings with graduate school to those without are likely to be misleading.                        The

occupation comparisons motivate, in part, our use of the FE-cg approach.




                                                                2
   The heart of the paper is the estimation of the graduate school returns.      The FE-cg approach shows

substantial dierences across graduate elds in labor market returns. There are too many elds to mention

all of the results here, but a few examples may be helpful. The estimated return (in logs) for law is 0.416

(0.059) and for medicine is 0.549 (0.072), or 51.6% and 73.2% respectively. The return to an MBA is only

0.110 (0.021) or 11.6%, which is far below the OLS value of 0.282 (0.008). The return is 0.103 (0.018) for a

masters in engineering, 0.179 (0.033) for computer and mathematical sciences, 0.227 (0.053) for health related

elds, 0.235 (0.041) for nursing, 0.202 (0.029) for psychology and social work, 0.162 (0.019) for education,

and essentially zero for both the arts and the humanities.    Estimates of the internal rate of return under

assumptions about public school tuition and program length vary less. For example, the values are 0.148 for

law, 0.160 for medicine, and 0.059 for an MBA.

   Specications that allow the graduate degree premiums to depend on years since degree completion

suggest that the premiums increase substantially with experience.      The FE-cg estimates of the average

premium between 1 and 28 years after degree completion is typically at least 5 log points higher than

estimates that assume a constant premium.        For an MBA, the estimate is 0.181.   However, as section 5.2

explains, the experience specic FE-cg estimates require the use of data on people who never attend graduate

school to identify the counterfactual experience prole in the absence of a degree. We suspect that they are

upward biased as a result, although it is also possible that constraining the graduate school returns to be a

constant leads to a downward bias in the average return. Estimates of internal rates of return are closer to

and sometimes below estimates assuming a constant earnings premium because of the eects of discounting

future earnings.

   The treatment on the treated eect for a given graduate eld depends on the college major. For example,

in the case of an MBA the FE-cg estimate of the return (in logs) is 0.098 (0.070) for economics majors, 0.157

(0.065) for business majors, 0.140 (0.102) for psychology and social work majors, but only 0.083 (0.024) for

engineering majors.

   The FE-cg and OLS estimates of the returns dier substantially for many degrees. OLS tends to overstate

the return to graduate elds that attract high paying college majors. Examples are a master's in engineering

and an MBA. OLS also tends to understate returns to graduate elds that attract lower paying majors, such

as a master's in education or in psychology and social work. Simple earnings comparisons of those with an

advanced degree to those without one are misleading.

   Finally, the FE-cg estimates indicate that the extent to which the returns operate through occupational

upgrading versus within occupation varies across degrees.     In the cases of law and medicine, most of the

return is across occupations, which make sense given licensing requirements and occupation specic skills.

But in many other cases, including engineering, most of the return is within occupation.

   Our paper contributes to the vast literature on the return to higher education, and to the growing

literature on the value of particular degrees.   The econometric challenges have a lot in common with the

problem of estimating the return to college major, and other problems in which individuals choose from

multiple unordered options (Heckman et al. (2008)), although we believe they are more severe in the graduate

education case. The literature on the returns to college majors has grown rapidly over the past 20 years, as

Altonji et al. (2012) and Altonji et al. (2016b) document. However, research on graduate degrees is much

more limited. Using NLS72, Altonji (1993) reports regression estimates of the return to the highest degree,

including some college, 10 aggregated college major categories, and 5 aggregated graduate school categories,

with controls for family background, test scores, high school grades, and other 12th grade aptitude measures.

His analysis is for a relatively young sample, and assumes that only the eld of highest degree matters. Black

et al. (2003) report OLS estimates of the return to a few graduate degree types for dierent majors using the

1993 NSCG. Altonji et al. (2016b) report OLS estimates for a broader set of graduate and undergraduate

degrees using the 1993, 2003, 2010, and 2013 NSCG.
                                                             2 Arcidiacono et al. (2008) study the return to an MBA

using panel data on people who registered to take the GMAT exam, a standardized test that is used in MBA

admissions. Sample members are observed up to 7 years after registering for the exam. They estimate that

the return to an MBA for men is 0.094 with basic controls, 0.063 after controlling for undergraduate GPA

and the GMAT test scores, and 0.048 after controlling for individual xed eects. Results for women are

similar. These estimates are lower than what we report, but the short span between MBA completion and

post MBA earnings observation may reduce the estimates.
                                                                   3 Bhattacharya (2005), Chen and Chevalier (2012)

and Ketel et al. (2016) are part of small literature that studies the return to medical degrees.

    To the best of our knowledge we are the rst to provide treatment on the treated estimates of the returns

to a broad set of graduate degrees and to a graduate degree for specic college majors while addressing

selection bias.

    The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data. In section 3 we present basic facts about

dierences in earnings across graduate elds, and how they are related to earnings dierences by bachelor

degree eld and by occupation.           Section 4 examines links among undergraduate eld, graduate eld, and

occupation before and after graduate school.             Section 5 discusses the problem of selection bias and the

estimation strategies we use.        In section 6 we present the econometric specications.             Section 7 presents

estimates of the return to graduate degrees. We conclude in section 8.




2 Data
2.1 Data Sources
We employ data from the NSCG (1993 to 2015) and the NSRCG (1993 to 2010).                           They are part of the

Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) sponsored by the National Center for Science

and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) within the National Science Foundation (NSF). The NSCG 1993 and

2003 are, respectively, subsamples of the 1990 and 2000 decennial census long form respondents who had a

bachelor's degree.      In the 1990s and 2000s, NSF only follows people who have a BA eld, advanced eld,

or occupation that is Science and Engineering related (S&E) in their rst observation in the data system.

We denote this selection criterion by the phrase SESTAT-eligible.
                                                                               4 From 2010 on, the NSCG employs a

new rotating sampling strategy.         The NSCG 2010 includes respondents from previous waves but is drawn

primarily from respondents to the 2009 American Community Survey (ACS). The samples for the NSCG

2013 and the 2015 surveys combine a subset of the interviewees from the 2010 and 2013 NSCG and a subset

of interviewees with a BA degree from the 2010 and 2013 waves of the ACS. The NSCG 1993, 2003, 2010,

2013, and 2015 can be weighted to be representative of the U.S. population with bachelor's degree.
                                                                                                                     5 The

NSRCG 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2008, and 2010 surveys add additional interviewees to the

  2 They   also report individual xed eects estimates based on early work for the current paper.     They are subject to the
concerns that we raise below.
  3 Montgomery     and Powell (2003) use the same data to show that the gender gap is narrower among MBA completers but
does not focus on the return to an MBA. See also Gicheva (2013).
  4 Science   and Engineering include the social sciences but excludes Health-related elds and occupations from 1993 to 2001.
From 2003 on, Health is included.    Throughout the paper, we use BA to refer to both bachelor's of arts and bachelor's of
science degrees and use MA in a similar fashion.
  5 The   NSCG 1993 and 2003 surveys are restricted to individuals who received a BA at least three years prior to the survey
and thus exclude recent college graduates.




                                                              4
data system. The NSRCG samples are restricted to individuals who have obtained a BA or advanced degree

in an S&E eld within three years prior to the survey reference date, and thus, all interviewees from the

NSRCG surveys are SESTAT-eligible.
                                                 6 All waves of the NSCG and the NSRCG are restricted to people who

are under 76 years of age and who live in the U.S. as of the survey reference date.

       We also use information from a version of the NSCG 1993 that is available from the Inter-university

Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). The ICPSR version includes several variables from

the 1990 Census, including occupation based on the 1990 census classication, employment, and earnings and

work hours in 1989. We created occupation categories that are consistent across the census and SESTAT.
                                                                                                                                      7

       We append all waves of both the NSCG and NSRCG and build a panel data set focusing on people in

the US labor market with at least a bachelor's degree. We can track individuals who are surveyed more than

once. The availability of 1990 Census information for NSCG 1993 sample members is an additional source of

panel data observations for both earnings and occupation. In addition to using the 1990 Census information,

we obtain information about occupation in 1988 from an NSCG 1993 question. Finally, most of the surveys

ask two separate questions about earnings. The rst asks about annualized salary at the main employer. It

refers to the survey date. The second asks about the sum of earnings from all jobs in the prior calendar year.

This provides a source of additional panel observations for many individuals.
                                                                                                    8

       The combined dataset also contains detailed information on postsecondary education history, current and

past employment, and basic demographic variables. The latter include gender, race\Hispanic and parents'

education.
                 9   We use 19 aggregated BA categories and 19 aggregated graduate categories in most of our

analyses. Tables B1 and B2 provide the shares of the disaggregated elds in the aggregated categories of the

graduate degrees and BA respectively. The tables report the mean and standard deviation of earnings and

the regression coecients from estimating equation (3) using the disaggregated degree categories.

       A downside of the fact that NSCG and the NSRCG oversample people with STEM degrees is that sample

sizes for many pairs of specic non-STEM majors and graduate degrees are too small to support use of FE-cg

for the interactive specication. We only report FE-cg estimates of the pair specic return (parameter                                 cg
dened below) if we observe earnings prior to graduate school for at least 31 individuals.

       We construct weights to make the pooled sample representative of the US population of college graduates

over the years of our sample, and we use weights unless otherwise noted.
                                                                                               10

     6 In 2013 the NSRCG was merged into the NSCG. The NSCG                 surveys after the merge oversample recent college graduates.
     7 Table B3 reports the shares of the 363 disaggregated elds in         the 66 consistent categories (from column (3) to column (2)),
and the shares of those 66 consistent categories in the 21 aggregated occupations (from column (2) to column (1)). Table B6
uses the 21 categories and Tables 23 and Figure 2 use the 66 category classication.
     8 The    timing of the surveys is such that in a given year only one of two measures is available.         Consequently, the minor
dierences in the means of the two measures are absorbed by the year dummies. Measurement error is likely to be correlated
across the two measures. This will contribute to correlation in the earnings regression error term but will not lead to bias if
the measurement error is uncorrelated with the regressors. Standard errors are clustered at the individual level throughout the
paper. We divided the sample by earnings observation type and produced FE-cg estimates corresponding to the specication in
Table 5. The estimates using the current earnings measure are smaller for 10 of the 19 graduate elds (Table B4). None of the
dierences is signicant at the 5 percent level and t values are under |1.4| in 16 of 19 cases.
     9 We     cleaned the panel data to ensure consistent values for the demographic variables. We also cleaned the data to ensure
consistency of information about the degrees. Specically, we ensure that a given degree that an individual reports in multiple
surveys has coherent information for completion date, location and elds of study.
     10 The   details of how we construct weights are in Appendix B.3.2.         In brief, we aim to study the labor market returns to
advanced degrees that represent the population of people who have a college degree in any eld who are between 23 and 59 years
old who live in the US. The target populations of the 1993, 2003, 2010, 2013 NSCG are individuals with at least a BA degree.
We use the survey weights for each of these samples to estimate the distribution of college graduates across combinations of BA
eld and graduate eld (including no graduate degree) over the four years combined. (We did not use the 2015 sample to avoid
giving too much weight to the population distribution of college graduates from 2010 on.) The NSRCG and the other waves of
the NSCG prior to 2010 are restricted to the SESTAT eligible population. Thus individuals with STEM eligible occupations
and advanced degrees are overrepresented when we pool all of the data. We adjust the weights so that the weighted distribution
of   c, g   pairs in the pooled sample matches the distribution of   c, g   pairs that we estimated using the 1993, 2003, 2010, and 2013
NSCG. Separate weights are constructed for the earnings regressions and the occupational premium regressions that reect the




                                                                      5
    The occupational earnings premiums are constructed using the 2009-2014 waves of the ACS. We estimate

the premiums by OLS using the sample of full time workers with BA degrees who are between 24 and 59 years

old.
    11 The estimates are merged into the NSCG-NSRCG dataset by occupation. The ACS based premiums

are reported in Table B3. We use the occupational premiums associated with the classication in column (2)

as the dependent variable in our analysis of the eects of graduate degrees on occupational earnings.

    We restrict the analysis to individuals with BA degrees who are between 23 and 59 years old in the survey

reference year and who have at most one advanced degree. We exclude individuals who ever obtain a PhD,

who obtain a BA before age 20 or after age 55 or who obtain their advanced degree after age 49.
                                                                                                                       12 We also

restrict the earnings analysis to full-time workers.
                                                             13

    We typically exclude individuals who go directly to graduate school to help ensure comparability between

the people we observe before graduate school and those we observe after. We consider such individuals in

section 7.1.12. In the case of FE-cg, we also restrict the sample to individuals who have an advanced degree

when we last observe them, which we refer to as the graduate degree sample.                           We do this because the

parameter of interest is        TT,   and so it makes sense to estimate eects of control variables and age only for

individuals who ultimately get an advanced degree. However, we cannot impose this restriction when we allow

the eects of advanced degrees to depend on time since the degree. Our main OLS regression sample, which

we call the full sample, contains 858,130 observations, and includes 195,540 individuals who are observed

more than once. The sample used for FE-cg contains 297,530 observations and includes 8,170 pre advanced

degree observations on 4,810 individuals.
                                                   14

    Denitions and descriptive statistics for the key control variables that appear in our regression models

are in Table A1.



2.2 The Timing of the Earnings Observations and Degree Completion
In this section, we provide information about the timing of earnings observations relative to BA completion

and advanced degree completion. Unfortunately, we do not know the start date of graduate school. Conse-

quently, we estimate the start date by subtracting an assumed typical number of years required to obtain

the degree for a full time student. Earnings are treated as prior to graduate school if they are prior to the

estimated start date.
                           15 This restriction and our exclusion of part time workers should eliminate most of

the problem of using earnings measured when people are attending graduate school. Column 1 of Table A2

reports the mean, and 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th quantiles of the number of years from BA completion

mix of surveys that contribute observations. The pooled sample weights for earnings account for the fact that some interviews
contribute earnings observations for two years.     We trim the adjusted weights using 1/10 and 10 times of the median of the
weights of all observations in the combined data.
  11 The   regression controls include a cubic in age interacted with gender, race\Hispanic interacted with gender, and dummies
for whether or not the person has a master's degree, a professional degree, and PhD. Unfortunately, the ACS does not report
eld of advanced degree.
  12 We    code BA based on the primary eld of the rst BA obtained. Thus, we do not account for a second major, or a minor.
One could extend the FE-cg approach to treat BA combinations as an additional type of BA, but we have not done so. We
drop individuals who obtain multiple BA degrees in dierent years. Because of concerns about choice based sampling, we also
exclude the follow up observations of individuals who do not have degrees in S&E elds but are SESTAT-eligible only because
of their occupation choices in their rst observation (0.523% of the person year observations in the pooled sample).
  13 We   code an individual as full-time if she reported working full-time or if she worked at least 41 weeks per year and at least
35 hours per week. We used 41 weeks to accommodate the employment arrangements of many teachers. With the exception of
the 1989 annual earnings measure, we assume that full-time status in the prior year is the same as the survey year when the
earnings measure refers to the year before the survey. We do so because we lack data on full time status in the prior year.
  14 We    round all observation counts to the nearest 10.    The mean, 1st percentile, median, and 99th percentile number of
observations per person in the full sample for earnings are 3.72, 1, 3, and 9. The corresponding values in the graduate degree
sample are 3.88, 1, 3, and 9.
  15 We   assume 4 years for Medicine, 3 for Law, 2 for an MBA, and 1 for all other master's degrees.




                                                                  6
for earnings observations that precede graduate school enrollment. All statistics in the table are unweighted.

The 10th, 50th, and 90th quantiles are 1 (the minimum), 4, and 12. More than 82% of pre graduate school

earnings observations occur between 1 (the minimum) and 5 years before completion of the advanced degree

(column 2). Column 3 reports that the 10th, 50th, and 90th quantiles of time from advanced degree com-

pletion to post advanced degree earnings observations are 2, 9, and 24. The corresponding values are much

lower for individuals with earnings observations both before and after the advanced degree (column 5). The

short period between the advanced degree and earnings is likely to lead the FE estimates to understate the

returns to graduate school if the returns rise with time since graduation. In part for this reason, we place

little emphasis on the FE estimates. Finally, column 4 presents time from BA to advanced degree completion

for those who obtained an advanced degree.              This column does not condition on the availability of a pre

advanced observation. The 10th, median and 90th quantiles are 2, 5, and 12.

    Table A3 presents the unweighted age distribution of the earnings observations. The rst column refers to

the full sample. The 10th, 50th and 90th quantiles are 26, 38, and 53. The 10th, median and 90th quantiles

of the age distribution of the 8,170 pre advanced degree observations of people with a graduate degree by

the last interview are 24, 28, and 38 (column 3).              The mean is 29.4.      These individuals are younger and

have a more condensed distribution than those who only have a BA when last observed (column 2). The

fourth column reports the age distribution of the 289,360 post advanced degree earnings observations from

the graduate degree sample. The 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles are 28, 39, and 53. The observations are

fairly evenly distributed across calendar years.

3 Facts about Earnings Dierences across Graduate Fields
Table 1 displays basic facts about earnings dierences across graduate degrees. The statistics are for people

who work full time, earn at least $5,000 per year, graduated from college at least one year earlier, and are age

23 to 59. All statistics are weighted. Columns 1 and 2 display the mean of earnings and the log of earnings,

respectively. Dierences across elds are large. Column 3 provides information about the role of occupation

in eld dierences in earnings. It reports the mean and standard deviation of occupation coecients given

the occupation distribution for each graduate eld. The values are expressed as deviations from the mean for

the graduate degree sample. Figure 2 graphs the relationship between the occupation mean for each graduate

eld and mean of the log of earnings for each eld. The points are tightly clustered around the regression

line displayed in the graph, which has a slope of 1.36 (0.09).

    Earnings dierences across graduate elds are in part a reection of earnings dierences across the un-

dergraduate majors that lead to them. Column 4 provides information about earnings levels in the college

majors that lead to the specied graduate degree. It reports the mean and standard deviation of the BA

premiums for each advanced degree based on the OLS estimates of equation (3) using the disaggregated BA

and advanced degree categories.
                                        17   Figure 3 graphs average earnings by advanced degree against the BA

premiums. There is a positive relationship, with a slope coecient of 1.77 (0.34). Earnings of those with

advanced degrees in STEM elds such as engineering, biology, and the physical sciences tend to be below the

regression line. These advance degrees pay less than one would expect given earnings associated with the BA

degrees that lead to them. Medicine is a notable exception to this pattern. It pays extremely well but draws

  16 See   Table B5. For the graduate degree sample, the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of year are 1993, 2003, and 2014. The
percentiles of the distribution of years for earnings observations that are post graduate degree are the same. For pre graduate
school earnings observations the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile values are 1990, 2002 and 2009, with a mean of 1999.8.
  17 The   BA premiums are reported in Table B2.




                                                                7
heavily from biology and other life science majors, which are not especially high paying.

   Figure B1 plots advanced degree specic gender dierences in the average occupational premium against

the degree specic gender dierence in average earnings. The gender gaps in earnings are centered around 0.22,

while the gender gaps in the occupational premium are centered around 0.05. The slope of the relationship

is 0.54 (0.53). In the cases of biology and the arts, the earnings gaps are about 0.15, while the occupational

earnings gap is very small. In the case of medicine, the overall gap is large (0.34) even though the occupation

gap is only 0.02. Discrimination, gender dierences in work hours, gender dierences in medical specialty, and

heterogeneity within the medicine category (which includes MD, optometry, dentistry, osteopathic, podiatry,

and veterinary) may all contribute to the gap.
                                                      18

   Figure B2 plots the gender earnings gap for each advanced degree against the corresponding gender

dierence in the mean of the BA premium.               By construction, the gender gap in BA premiums is entirely

due to gender dierences in the mix of BA degrees for a given graduate degree. Only a small portion of the

gender gap among advanced degree holders is due to dierences in undergraduate degree. The slope of the

relationship is 1.19 (0.97), but the gender gaps in average BA premiums within graduate elds are relatively

small.




4 Links among BA Fields, Graduate Fields and Occupations
Here we document three facts about links among education elds and occupation and then look at case studies

of occupation before and after graduate school for engineering and education majors. The evidence indicates

that both specicity of knowledge and heterogeneity of preferences inuence education and occupation paths.

The patterns suggest that comparisons of earnings of those with and without a graduate degree will be

misleading, even controlling for undergraduate eld.

   The rst fact is that the link between undergraduate eld and graduate eld varies dramatically across

graduate elds. Table 4 of Altonji et al. (2016b) reports the ratio of the share of a specied graduate degree

accounted for by a specied undergraduate major to the share of that major of all undergraduate degrees.

If majors are equally represented in all graduate degrees, then this ratio would be 1.0, aside from sampling

error. In reality, the table shows that particular undergraduate majors are heavily overrepresented in certain

graduate programs. For example, the relative share of undergraduate engineering majors among those with

a master's in engineering is 11.0. The relative shares of economics BAs are less concentrated. The highest

value is 4.95 for a master's in social science, and the value is 3.1 for a master's in business, 2.83 for law and

2.2 for health services administration. It is also instructive to compare shares across graduate degree types.

The relative shares for law and MBA programs, which have few prerequisites, are much more even across

majors than the shares for master's in nursing, or engineering, which have many prerequisites.

   The second fact is that both undergraduate eld and occupation before graduate school have strong

connections to graduate eld. We estimate probit regressions for the probability of attending graduate school

in eld     g   as a function of 19 indicators for undergraduate eld and 21 indicators for occupation before

graduate school (not reported). The sample consists of pre graduate school observations on individuals who

eventually obtain an advanced degree. Separate F tests indicate that both the undergraduate eld indicators

and the occupation dummies are highly signicant predictors of graduate eld.

   Third, the eect of graduate eld on post graduate occupation is about twice as large as the eect of

BA eld. To establish this, we regress estimates of the probability of working in occupation               j   conditional on

 18 See   Sasser (2005), Bertrand et al. (2010), Goldin and Katz (2011) and Goldin and Katz (2016) for analyses of the gender
gaps in various professional occupations, including pharmacist and doctor, and for MBA holders.

while the coecient on the probability               of j |g is (0.874 (0.017)).
                                                                               19



4.1 Case Studies of the Relationship among Major, Advanced Degree, and Oc-
    cupation
The regressions provide an overall sense of the relationship among                       c, g ,   and   j,   but it is also useful to take a

closer look at a few cases. Table 2 examines the occupation choices before graduate school and after graduate

school for individuals with a BA in engineering. Cell sizes are small for the pre graduate degree samples in

some instances. In Table 2 as well as Table 3, we only report results for occupation categories containing at

least 10 cases, and in some instances we aggregate occupations. For comparison, the top panel of Table 2 lists

the ve most common occupations for engineering graduates who have not obtained an advanced degree by

age 35.
           20 For this group, the rst four are all engineering occupations and account for 48.8% of all graduates.

The fth is software developer, which is also engineering related. The next three panels of the table examine

the pre graduate school occupations of engineering majors who go on to get an MBA, a master's in education,

or a master's in engineering. Engineers also dominate among pre MBA occupations, but top level managers

account for 6.2%. Post MBA, managerial occupations are the rst, fourth and fth most common.

    Few engineers get a master's in education, so we only broadly characterize the occupations.                                           Prior to

graduate school, about one third of this group work in engineering related occupations and about 25% work

as primary or secondary school teachers. Thus, the early occupations of engineers who go on to a master's

in education are quite dierent from engineers as a whole. After an education master's, about 50% work as

secondary school teachers and another 11% work as postsecondary school teachers. The other three most

common occupations are managerial.

    Engineers who eventually pursue a master's in engineering follow a dierent path.                                       Prior to graduate

school, the 5 most popular occupations are all engineering, and account for 72.1% of the cases. After the

master's in engineering, the 5 most popular occupations are in engineering and computer science. Managerial

occupations are not represented.

    Table 3 provides similar information for education majors who pursue an MBA or a master's in education.

Teaching dominates the most common occupations for education majors who have not obtained an advanced

degree by age 35, although the 4rth and 5th most common occupations are secretary (4.0%) and top-level

managers (2.7%). The number of pre MBA education majors is too small to break out occupations in detail,

but none works as a teacher. Post MBA, the top 4 occupations are all business related. Secondary school

teacher is number 5.

    On the other hand, education majors who pursue a master's in education are overwhelmingly concentrated

in teaching occupations both before and after getting a master's degree. Interestingly, top level manager is

the third most common post master's occupation, with 8.01% of the total. A few of these individuals may

hold high level management positions within the education system, but we lack the industry codes needed

to check.
             21

  19 We    restrict the sample of   j, c, g combination to   the 1,137 cases with at least 50 observations on       c,   at least 50 on   g,   and at
least 15 on occupation for the      c, g pair. The results   are not very sensitive to lowering or raising these restrictions.
  20 We    impose the sample restrictions used in the earnings analysis below. The tables also report average earnings, although
we do not discuss this information in the text, because cell sizes are relatively small in some cases.
  21 The    SESTAT top level manager category includes presidents and provosts. (See note 2 of Table B3). Also, both the SESTAT
occupation codes and the 1990 Census codes include managers in education and related elds as a detailed category. We treat
it as separate from top level manager in the 66 more aggregated categories that we use. See Table B3.




                                                                        9
      These examples show that the pre graduate school career paths of individuals depend on the specic

advanced degree and may be quite dierent from the early career paths of those who do not go to graduate

school. Calculations for physical and related sciences show a similar pattern (not shown). They are consistent

with the regression analysis of the link between occupation after graduate school and undergraduate major

and graduate eld discussed above. For undergraduate engineering majors, we have used information about

whether and why an individual's job is not related to BA eld to shed light on the importance of preferences

and labor market opportunities in determining occupation before graduate school and graduate eld of study

(Table B6). Not surprisingly, occupation prior to graduate school is related to the reason for working in an

unrelated job, and so is average pay. Engineering majors who were working in an unrelated job are less likely

to get an engineering master's and more likely to pursue a business degree.

      Overall, the evidence in section 4 indicates that simple comparisons of earnings of those with an advanced

degree with those without an advanced degree are likely to be misleading. They also suggest that a strategy

of comparing earnings before and after graduate school for those who eventually obtain a specic graduate

degree is likely to be superior to simple OLS.




5 Addressing Selection Bias When Estimating the Return to Grad-
  uate Degrees
In this section we discuss our estimation strategy.               We begin by specifying how earnings are determined

and dening the TT parameters that we attempt to estimate. We then present the OLS, FE, and the FE-

cg estimators and discuss the conditions under which the FE and FE-cg estimators will identify the TT

parameters.



5.1 The Treatment on the Treated Eect of a Graduate Degree on Earnings
First, some notation. Let         i   denote the individual and for now let       t   denote both the calendar year and years

since college graduation. Later we use            ageit   to denote age of    i   in year   t.   The variable       g , g = 0, 1, · · · , G ,
is the index of graduate degree type. Examples are a master's in engineering, a master's in education, and

an MBA. The value           g=0       corresponds to no graduate degree. The variable             Git is   the graduate degree that

i   holds in t,   and the indicator    Ggit indicates that i has a graduate degree               in g in   period   t.   It is shorthand

for   Git = g .   The index    c, c = 1, · · · , C , denotes undergraduate major. We only            consider people who already

have a college degree.          We use the terms major, eld, and degree type synonymously.                                 The index      j,
j = 1, · · · , J , denotes occupation.
   Let wijcgt = wjcgt (Ait ) denote the value of the potential log of earnings that a person of ability Ait with

degrees c and g could expect to receive in occupation j in period t.
                                                                        22 When we use j and g as subscripts

along with t, they refer to occupation and graduate degree status at t. Again, g = 0 corresponds to no

graduate degree. Thus wjc0t (Ait ) is the log of earnings in j for someone who majored in c and had not gone

to graduate school by period t. We suppress transitory shocks that inuence earnings, such as luck in job

search, and assume that these factors are unrelated to choice of cg . We are thus ignoring potential upward

    22 Altonji et al. (2016b) briey discuss the evidence on interactions between occupation and college major in earnings equations,
which is limited. Lemieux (2014) is one of the few papers that use multiple regression to estimate a system of potential earnings
equations for   c, j   pairs. Robst (2007), Yuen et al. (2010), Lemieux (2014), Kinsler and Pavan (2015), Lindley and McIntosh
(2015) and Altonji et al. (2016a) nd that higher earnings for college graduates (1) who report that the skill requirements of
their occupation is a good match for their college major or (2) who work in an occupation that is typical for their major. We
do not know of papers that present such evidence for graduate eld or college degree/graduate degree combinations.




                                                                 10
bias from Ashenfelter's dip (Ashenfelter (1978)) prior to graduate school.
                                                                                                                      23 The vector      Ait consists of all
variables that determine or are correlated with the earnings of a worker in                                              j   given  c and g . The function
wjcgt (Ait )      is not restricted, so the eect of                   Ai   may depend on the combination of                      j , c and g . However, the
function does not include occupational history, so it implicitly assumes that the eect of prior occupation on

earnings does not vary with j and g conditional on c. We return to this issue below.
             Qit inuences preferences for g and choice of j given cg , but does not directly inuence earnings.
      The vector

Some elements of Ait also inuence preferences for g and j . We dene Ait and Qit so that the inuence of

c and g on occupation specic earnings and nonpecuniary preferences are captured by wjcgt (Ait ) and the
occupation choice probabilities introduced below. This denition makes it easier to distinguish between the

causal eects of           c   and   g    on   wjcgt (Ait )    from the correlation that arises because the choices of                      c   and   g   depend

on   Ait    and   Qit .   In the discussion of identication we treat                        Ait      and   Qit    as unobserved by the econometrician,

although in practice we include demographic controls. We abstract from the quality and selectivity of the

college and graduate programs, which we do not observe.
                                                                                        24 We suppress the              i subscript when i is not needed
for clarity.

      We focus on         T Tcgt ,   the average treatment eect of                  g      for   c   majors who eventually go on to obtain               g.   Let

wc0t |Ggt be the mean of what these individuals would have earned had they not gone to graduate school.
Let  wcgt |Ggt be the mean of actual earnings in t for c majors with a g degree. Let pcgt (j |At , Qt ) be the
probability of choosing j in t given At , Qt , c and g . Let dFt (At , Qt |c, Ggt ) denote the conditional density of

A and Q, which reects selection based on choice of c and g , as discussed in Appendix B.1. Then

                                    wcgt |Ggt =                      pcgt (j |At , Qt ) wcgjt (At ) dFt (At , Qt |c, Ggt )                                    (1)
                                                        j      A,Q


                                    wc0t |Ggt =                      pc0t (j |At , Qt ) wc0jt (At ) dFt (At , Qt |c, Ggt ) ,
                                                        j      A,Q


      The treatment on the treated eect is



                                                               T Tcgt = wcgt |Ggt - wc0t |Ggt .

Comparing the expressions for                        wcgt |Ggt    and      wc0t |Ggt    in (1) reveals that             g    aects earnings through two

channels.        First,   g    alters the potential earnings in each occupation                             j.     Second, it alters the distribution of

occupations that people choose conditional on                            c, A and Q.
      We directly observe the sample analog of                          wcgt |Ggt . It is        the average of post graduate school earnings of

people who choose               c, g .   The key econometric challenge is measuring                              wc0t |Ggt ,   which is the counterfactual

earnings in       t    of those who chose            c, g .   The FE and FE-cg approaches, detailed in section 5.2, use earnings of

c   majors before graduate school who eventually obtain                                g   to approximate counterfactual earnings. Basically,

we are replacing              wc0t |Ggt       with   wc0t- |Ggt       after adjusting for age and time eects, where                       t-     is prior to

graduate school.

    23 A   negative transitory earnings shock will lower the opportunity cost of graduate school. As a result, the transitory earnings
component in       t   will be negatively associated with graduate school attendance in                      t.   Prior earnings of those who do attend will
understate what future earnings of graduate school attendees would have been in the absence of graduate school. Arcidiacono
et al. (2008) discuss the issue in the context of their individual xed eects analysis of the return to an MBA. They do not nd
evidence of an earnings dip prior to entering an MBA. Nor do earnings rise for those who previously said that they expect to
enroll in an MBA program but do not do so. However, it is possible that the issue is important for some of the other graduate
degrees that we consider. We lack sucient panel data to assess it.
    24 With   quality measures and enough data, one could extend the analysis to consider program quality by redening c and                                   g   to
be eld and program quality combinations. One could also condition on other information such as undergraduate records and
test scores if it were available.




                                                                                  11
     Consideration of a randomized controlled trial provides insights into the challenge of identifying the causal

eect of graduate education when multiple elds are available, even for those who work before graduate school.

Suppose at the end of the pre-graduate school period (t1 below), a set of economics majors are oered the

opportunity to get an MBA for free.                        The intent-to-treat eect of the tuition subsidy oer on earnings is

identied, and one could identify such eects for each value of pre-graduate school occupation (jt1 below).

But these eects mix gains from an MBA relative to no advanced degree with gains relative to alternative

graduate degrees.                 The counterfactual for the TT parameter would be a complicated mix of alternative

education choices. Without multiple sources of eld specic exogenous variation in incentives, it would be

dicult to make progress using an IV strategy.
                                                                     25 Consequently, while we will point out serious limitations

of the FE-cg and FE approaches, they have the big advantage of providing a way to control for alternative

graduate school options.



5.2 What Do Alternative Estimators of T Tcg Identify?
In this section, we discuss the earnings specications used in the empirical work and interpret the estimators

of   T Tcgt   in light of the model of earnings discussed above. We consider OLS regression, OLS regression with

person xed eects (FE), and OLS regression with xed eects for the                                   c, g   combination reported the last

time we observe an individual (FE-cg). We consider the three period case.                                 The timing is as follows.   We

consider      c   majors who have obtained their degree prior to                     t1   and who choose to work in period     t1   rather

than go directly to graduate school. This choice is in anticipation of the fact that our identication strategy

involves comparisons of earnings before and after graduate school. Our parameters of interest refer to this

population.          We consider the 15 percent of individuals who go directly from college to graduate school in

section 7.1.12. In             t2 ,   individual   i   either works in the optimal occupation or goes to graduate school in the

optimal eld. In              t3 , i   chooses an occupation and works.



5.2.1         OLS Regression

We rst consider the OLS regression of                         wicgjt on a set of dummies for combinations of c and g , without
controls for        j   or   A.   The OLS coecient           on Ggt3 using just the period t3 observations for c majors identies


                                                            OLS
                                                         T Tcgt3 = w cgt3 |Ggt3 - w c0t3 |G0t3 .


    OLS
T Tcgt3 is a biased estimator of T Tcgt3 because both education and occupation choice depend on A and
                                                                                                        OLS
Q. This implies that dFt3 (At3 , Qt3 |c, Ggt3 ) diers from dFt3 (At3 , Qt3 |c, G0t3 ). Consequently, T Tcgt3 diers
from T Tcgt3 for two main reasons. First, dierences in the distribution of A between the c, Ggt3 and the

c, G0t3 populations will lead average earnings to dier for a given occupation. Second, A and Q inuence
occupation choice, and occupation matters for earnings.
                                                                                26 Intuitively, an English major who chooses to go to

law school has dierent occupational preferences and abilities than an English major who does not go to law

school. The law school graduate would have followed a dierent career path in the absence of a law degree.

  25 Similar      issues arise in the estimation of the return to a college major, as discussed in Altonji et al. (2016b) and Kirkeboen
et al. (2016). The latter exploits the fact that in some countries, university admission is centralized and in on the basis of test
scores with program specic cutos. See also Hastings et al. (2013).
  26 Here     we consider OLS when only            t3   observations are used to simplify the discussion of bias, but the argument extends
directly to the case when observations from all three periods are used. We use all periods in the empirical work.




                                                                           12
5.2.2      Person Fixed Eects (FE)

The second specication controls for person xed eects. The earnings gain from                                    g   for a given   c   is identied

from people who are observed working both before and after obtaining g .
                                                                        27 Consider the subset of individuals

who majored in      c,   work in period          t1 ,   obtain   g   in   t2   and work in t3 . They identify




                       FE
                    T Tcgt3       = E [wicgjt3 - wic0jt1 |c, Ggit3 ]                                                                          (2)


                                  =                     pcgt3 (j |At3 , Qt3 ) wcgjt3 (At3 ) dFt3 (At3 , Qt3 |c, Ggt3 )
                                         j       A,Q


                                      -                   pc0t1 (j |At1 , Qt1 ) wc0jt1 (At1 ) dFt1 (At1 , Qt1 |c, Ggt3 ) .
                                             j      A,Q


Comparing the above equation with (1), one can see that dierences could arise from three sources. The rst

is the dierence between           dFt3   and       dFt1 .   The second is the eect of experience on occupation choice. The

third is the eect of experience on occupation specic earnings.

   First consider        dFt3
                            dFt1 . To focus on the selection issue, assume for now that years since college
                                and
                                                           FE
graduation do not aect the w and p functions. Then T Tcgt3 = T Tcgt3 if the distribution of A and Q does

not change between t1 and t3 . Note that the distributions of A and Q do not shift with the attainment of g

because A and Q are dened to be net of the eects of cg . However, other factors may lead to changes in A

and Q (or updating of beliefs about A and Q) in the years after college.

   To see the implications, consider a change in Q that would induce individuals both to move toward

higher paying occupations and to get a degree g , say an MBA. Then w cgt1 |Ggt3 is likely to understate the

counterfactual earnings of someone who obtains an MBA. For example, an education major who starts out

as a teacher but nds she has a taste for business would be likely to move toward better paying business

related occupations even if she were not to pursue an MBA. Her newly found taste for business would also

make her more likely to seek an advanced degree that provides skills that are valued in business, such as an

MBA. The dierences between her earnings as a teacher and her earnings after her MBA would overstate

the causal eect of the MBA.

   The problem is lessened if earnings are available                            after   her preferences have changed but     before      she goes

to graduate school. In this case, her earnings (and occupation choices) prior to graduate school will reect

her new beliefs.

   Assumption A1            (Constant ability and preferences):

                                         dFt1 (At1 , Qt1 |c, Ggt3 ) = dFt2 (At2 , Qt2 |c, Ggt3 ) .

In this case,   wcgt1 |Ggt3     is based on the distribution of ability and preferences that governed the decision to

obtain    g.

5.2.3      Age Proles

Because we do not observe the counterfactual                          wcgt1 |Ggt3 ,     we also need additional assumptions that allow

us to adjust for age.           In our basic specication, we assume that the graduate degree does not alter the

experience prole for        c   majors. This requires three additional assumptions, which we refer to as A2a-A2c.

 27 The   main eects of college majors are not identied. They are absorbed by the person eects.




                                                                                13
A2a concerns the eects of new information about            A and Q. New information arriving between t2 and
t3 could still lead dFt1 (At1 , Qt1 |c, Ggt3 ) and dFt3 (At3 , Qt3 |c, Ggt3 ) to dier even if dFt1 (At1 , Qt1 |c, Ggt3 ) =
dFt2 (At2 , Qt2 |c, Ggt3 ). The new information will induce a change in earnings, as individuals optimize across
occupations. We assume that on average the earnings change from new information about A and Q would

have been the same in the counterfactual case in which the person did not attend g .

      Assumption A2b is that earnings growth within occupation is the same for all occupations conditional on

college major and ability. Assumption A2c concerns the earnings growth from predictable shifts in occupation

with experience. We assume that the contribution of occupational progression to earnings growth for those

who choose         g   would have been the same if they had not gone to graduate school. In appendix B.2, we provide

mathematical statements of the three assumptions.

      The upshot of the three assumptions about experience eects is that                                   c majors who chose Ggt3 would have
experienced the same age prole of earnings had they been forced to                                      choose G0t3 even though their earnings

level would dier. In the empirical work we do report some estimates that allow the experience prole to

depend on graduate degree based on the specication in 6.1.



5.2.4         OLS Regression with Final Degree Combination Fixed Eects (FE-cg)

Our main econometric approach is closely related to the person xed eects approach but allows us to use

data on people who only are observed through                           t2   or are only observed in           t3 .    Either way, we know whether

they obtained          g   by the time they exited the sample. We make an additional assumption, A3, which is that

the distributions        dFt3 (At3 , Qt3 |c, Ggt3 ) and dFt1 (At1 , Qt1 |c, G0t3 )                 of   A   and   Q   do not depend on whether we

observe an         individual in t1 only, t3 only, or both t1 and t3 .

      Consider the estimator
                                                 FEcg
                                              T Tcgt3 = w cgt3 |G0t1 , Ggt3 - w c0t1 |G0t1 , Ggt3 ,

where we have made explicit the fact that all individual in the analysis are observed in                                        t1   prior to obtaining

g   and are known to have obtained                  g    in t2 and thus have the degree in t3 . Under assumptions A1, A3, and the
                                                                                               F Ecg
parallel age trend assumptions mentioned in section 5.2.3,                                  T Tcgt3  = T Tcgt3 .      We call this estimator FE-cg

and sometimes refer to it as the degree combination xed eects estimator. We implement it using regression

with the indicator variables               Cc(i)   for   c, Gg(i)t   for having    g   in   t and Cc(i) Gg(i)     for whether the individual     i ever
                                                                                                                                                  F Ecg
obtained       c   and   g.   People who are never observed to obtain a graduate degree do not contribute to                                  T Tcgt
other than by helping to identify eects of control variables, including age proles. In our main specication,

we exclude them from the sample.



5.2.5         Occupation-Major Specic Treatment Eects

The earnings model assumes that early occupation does not have                                      g   specic or      jt3   specic eects on future

earnings.
         28 We are also implicitly ruling out any eect of j on the nonpecuniary costs of graduate school.
                                                           t1
These assumptions imply that the choice of rst period occupation is separable from future education and

occupation decisions. Separability means that plans to go to graduate school do not directly inuence the

choice of      jt1 ,   given   At1   and   Qt1 .   This is important for our use of pre graduate school earnings to estimate

counterfactual earnings of those who go to graduate school.

      To see the consequences if separability does not hold, consider economics BAs who are considering a

PhD in Economics.                Such individuals sometimes work as a research assistant for a year or two, in part
    28 For   evidence of occupation specic experience, see Poletaev and Robinson (2008), Gathmann and Schönberg (2010), and
Yamaguchi (2012).




                                                                              14
because of occupational preferences but in part because the experience and connections the work provides

are complementary with PhD studies and an academic career. Research assistant positions typically pay less

than the business and nance jobs that economics majors often choose. Individuals who obtained a PhD in

economics would probably have chosen a dierent mix of occupations in t1 if one had eliminated PhD studies

as an option. We suspect violations of separability are likely to be the strongest for PhD studies, which we

do not consider in this paper. But it may be important for an MD degree and is unlikely to hold perfectly.

Violations may lead to an overstatement of returns to some elds.

    One could modify FE to estimate a separate TT eect for each                            c, g, jt1   combination.      One could also

modify FE-cg to estimate the          c, g, jt1 specic treatment eect by controlling for xed eects for each c, g, jt1
combination, provided that          jt1 is observed for all individuals. A halfway house is to control for the main
eect of    jt1 .29   In practice, sample size considerations and lack of information about occupation prior to

graduate school for those who are only surveyed after graduate school limits our ability to condition on early

occupations. But even if one did obtain estimates of              T Tcgjt1 t   for various values of      jt1 , one might be concerned
about using pre graduate school earnings in             jt1   as a measure of earnings in the absence of graduate school

later in a career. We leave this to future research.




6 Econometric Specication
We work with a specication in which the eects of college and graduate school are additive and a specication

in which the return to graduate school depends upon the undergraduate major. The additive specication is


                                           C                                   G

and Cc(i) is a dummy variable for whether i majored in c. We specify age            to be a major specic cubic
                                                                                 it

graduate degree and Gg (i)t is the associated indicator for whether i holds a g degree in t. The control vector

Xit consists of the full set of interactions between gender and race\Hispanic indicators, a gender specic

    The error term uit may be written as uit = ei + it . We further decompose the permanent component ei

into its mean bcg for c majors who eventually get a graduate degree in g and an orthogonal component vi .

That is,

where   Gg(i)   is an indicator for whether     i   eventually obtains a graduate degree in                g,   and   G0(i)   is 1 if   i   never
                                                                                         c

                                                                            c=1 g =0
 29 Note   the FE estimators implicitly control for earnings dierences across individuals in time invariant factors that are
associated with early occupation.
 30 The   year dummies in combination with age will control for cohort eects that are linear in birth year and partially control
for nonlinear birth year eects. We observe undergraduate GPA for about 28 percent of the people in our sample. In preliminary
work, controlling for GPA did not alter our results very much.

Here    cg    is the premium for graduate degree              g   for individuals with a BA in                 c.    The FE estimator again treats

     In the OLS case, the estimates of            c
                                              cg are based on both cross-sectional and panel data variation.

They will be biased by correlations between ei and BA major and graduate degree.

    In the FE case, we can estimate cg only if at least one sample member with c (i) = c is observed both

before and after obtaining g . In the FE-cg case, we can estimate cg only if at least one person with c (i) = c

is observed after graduate school and at least one person who eventually obtains g (Gg (i) = 1) is observed

before graduate school. The before and after observations can be for dierent people.

     A numerical example claries how observations contribute to the FE and FE-cg estimates. We abstract

from age and time eects and other covariates.                             Table 4 presents earnings data for three individuals who

obtained a BA in economics and are known to have obtained an MBA. Barry earned $55,000 before getting

an MBA and $90,000 after, a gain of $35,000. Ebony earned $80,000 after her MBA, but her pre MBA earnings

are not observed. Mary earned $65,000 before her MBA but her post MBA earnings are not observed. The

FE estimate of      Econ, MBA     is the change in Barry's earnings  $35,000. The FE-cg estimate is the dierence

between the averages of post MBA earnings and pre MBA earnings  $25,000=$85,000-$60,000. It makes

use of all 4 of the earnings observations, not just Barry's.



6.1 Allowing Experience Proles to Depend on Graduate Field
We also estimate models in which the potential experience prole of earnings depends on                                             g.   In the additive

case, the FE-cg specication is

  31 Dierences    across cohorts in selection patterns into graduate school might aect the FE-cg estimates, given that the
Cc(i) Gg(i)   xed eects in the model are not interacted with cohort.                       We do not have any evidence on the importance of
this.

      If the return to        g   varies with time since graduate school, then the estimates of                              g     based on equations (3)

g   by about 0.04, and sometimes by more, especially in the FE-cg case.

      The choice of whether or not to include people who never attend graduate school inuences the implicit

control group and the nature of the variation that identies the age prole parameters.                                                      In the case of

OLS, one is assuming that college graduates without advanced degrees are an appropriate control group.

Consequently, we use the full sample, which includes them, when we use OLS whether or not we include

the   xit    interactions. When using FE-cg without the                            xit   interactions (i.e., equation (5)) we use the graduate

degree sample. We exclude college only individuals because the parameter of interest is treatment on the

treated. However, when we allow for                        xit   interactions using equation (8), we use the full sample and assume

that the age-earnings prole (but not the intercepts) for                                      c   majors who never go to graduate school is the

counterfactual prole for                c   majors who do. Those who do not go to graduate school are needed to provide

information about counterfactual age-earnings proles for the ages after most people attend graduate school.

This could lead to upward bias if those who do not go to graduate school have atter age proles or dierent

time trends than the counterfactual proles of those who do. Using the full sample instead of the graduate

degree sample usually leads to larger FE-cg estimates of                                      g    that are usually closer to the OLS estimates.

However, constraining graduate returns to be constant if they in fact rise with                                              xit   might lead to upward

bias in the age proles, because                    ageit and xit are correlated. This                    would lead to downward bias in          g   as an

estimate of the average return                   to g when equation (5)) is used.




7 Estimates of the Return to Graduate Degree
In this section we report estimates of returns to graduate education. In section 7.1 we start with the additive

specication for men and women combined. Section 7.2 presents the internal rate of return estimates that

account for tuition and program length.                              Section 7.3 presents results by gender.                    In section 7.4 we allow

returns to depend on BA eld.

 32 We      have too few observations to allow            g 1   and   g2    to vary with both        c and g .
 33 We      stop at 28 because it is less than or equal to the 90th quantile of                     xit for each   of the 19 graduate degrees.




                                                                                   17
7.1 Results Using the Additive Specication
Columns 1 and 2 of Table 5 report FE-cg estimates of                         g    for the additive specication with age proles

that depend only on          c.   The log of earnings is the dependent variable. They are based on equation (5). We

use 19 aggregated BA categories and 19 aggregated graduate categories in most of our analyses.                                          Column

1 uses the graduate degree sample.                It is our preferred sample for FE-cg.                  Column 2 uses the full sample,

which also includes the college only subsample. Columns 3-6 also use the full sample. Column 3 presents the

corresponding OLS estimates based on equation (3).

   Columns 4 and 5 present FE-cg and OLS estimates of                            g1_28   based on equation (8) which includes                g-
specic interactions with post graduate school potential experience                       xit .       We call this the   g -specic experience
prole specication. Recall that               g1_28    is the average of the return over the rst 28 years after the graduate

degree. To facilitate comparison to the results in columns 1, 2 and 3, column 6 presents the average of                                  ^gxit
over the distribution of          xit   in the graduate degree sample. We typically nd that                  g1_28   exceeds    g , especially
for the FE-cg estimates. In part, this reects the fact that                       g   is a sample weighted average of returns at

various values of    xit .    The sample distribution of          xit   is skewed somewhat to the left. Thus                  g   places more

weight on lower values, although it also places some weight on post graduate experience values above 28,

while   g1_28   does not.
                              34 Columns 7-11 correspond to columns 1-5 but are for the occupational component

of earnings.

   Before turning to Table 5, we note that Tables B1 and B2 report OLS estimates of                                       c   and   g   for 168

advanced elds and 144 BA elds, respectively.                     The tables also report the composition of each of the 19

aggregated BA and graduate categories. To our knowledge, it is the rst time such a disaggregated set of

estimates has been presented. It is a small step toward the objective of providing estimates that can be used to

guide the decisions of individuals, institutions, and the government about investments in graduate education.

The estimates show large dierences across degrees, with substantial heterogeneity within the 19 categories

that we feature.
                   35 However, they should be viewed as descriptive rather than causal. This is especially true

for the graduate degrees, for which we believe selection bias in the OLS estimates is particularly serious.

Regressing the FE-cg estimates for the 19 graduate categories on the corresponding OLS estimates yields a

slope of 0.607 (0.100) and a constant of 0.068 (0.026). Thus the FE-cg estimate tends to be small relative to

the OLS estimate when OLS is large, and vice versa.
                                                     36 The gap between the FE-cg and OLS estimates has

a strong negative relationship with the average for the graduate degree of the BA premiums.
                                                                                           37 The results

are consistent with a theme, which is that OLS tends to overstate (understate) returns to advanced degrees

that attract students from high (low) paying majors.



7.1.1     Medicine

In the case of medicine, the FE-cg estimate of               g   is 0.549 (0.072) and the OLS estimate is 0.687 (0.016). The

FE-cg estimate rises to 0.597 when the full sample is used (column 2). This points to the fact that part of

 34 Tables B7 and B8 report more detailed information about the experience prole of graduate school eects.
 35 For example, for engineering the estimates of ^ range from -0.002 (0.034) for agricultural engineering to 0.249                 (0.015) for
                                                         g
computer and system engineering.
 36 Adjusting   the slope for the eect of sampling error in the OLS estimates makes almost no dierence because the OLS
estimates are very precise. We performed the adjustment under the assumption that the sampling errors in the OLS and FE-cg
estimators are independent, which is approximately true. The bias corrected estimator is the product of the OLS coecient and
the adjustment factor

the dierence between OLS and FE-cg is the use of college only cases to estimate the counterfactual.

   Columns 4 and 5 we report          ^g1_28   using the specication with   g -specic   experience proles. The FE-cg

estimate is 0.658 and the OLS estimate is 0.738. The FE-cg estimate of the return is only 0.072 (0.089) at

one year, but rises to 0.659 (0.085) at 10 years and 0.867 (0.086) at 20 before declining to 0.606 (0.094) at

30 years (Tables B7 and B8). The college only observations in column 4 accounts for part of the dierence

between columns 1 and 4. When we use the specication with the experience interactions to estimate                gx     and

then compute     ^g   as the sample weighted average of     gx   (column 6), we obtain a larger value than when we

exclude the experience interactions (column 2).
                                               38 Consequently, the specication of the quadratic functional

form for   gx   as well as the choice of sample contribute to dierences among the FE-cg estimates.

   Columns 7-11 present a corresponding set of results for the occupational component of earnings.                     The

FE-cg estimate is 0.492 (0.053) and the OLS estimate is 0.478 (0.005). The eects decline by about 0.04 over

the rst 20 years (not reported). This makes sense when one thinks about the careers of medical doctors.

They typically enter residency programs right after graduation, working as doctors but at relatively low pay.

Later, some fraction may migrate to other occupations, such as manager.                 Managers (not controlling for

degree type) are paid less on average than doctors.

   Table B9 reports individual xed eects estimates of            g .   For the log of earnings, the FE point estimate

is actually negative:       -0.054 (0.107).    The FE estimate substantially understates the returns to medicine,

because most of the post graduate school observations that identify this eect are for low values of            xit ,   when

many doctors are in residency programs. For occupational earnings, the FE estimate is 0.577 (0.092) which

is actually above the corresponding OLS and FE-cg estimates. Medicine is an extreme case, but it illustrates

the diculty of estimating returns using individual xed eects when panel length is relatively short and the

payo to the graduate degree takes a few years to be fully realized. Consequently, we place little emphasis on

the FE estimates in this paper. The approach would be valuable in a longer panel, which could be created by

merging the data that we use with administrative earnings records. We hope to pursue this in future work.



7.1.2     Law

The FE-cg estimate of         g   for a law degree is 0.416 (0.059).    It is slightly below the OLS estimate.         The

estimate of   g1_28    is 0.469 (0.056) in the case of FE-cg. Both approaches indicate that the return rises with

time since graduation, as is documented in Table B7. The FE-cg estimates rise from 0.280 (0.060) one year

after law school to 0.542 (0.058) at 20 years.         OLS and FE-cg agree that much of the return comes from

occupational upgrading.

   As was the case for medical degrees, the FE estimate of              g   appears to greatly understate the return

to law.    The value is only 0.117 (0.058), although the FE results indicate that occupational upgrading is

important and are in line with the other approaches. Given the partnership system and the importance of

on the job training in law, one might expect the short time between law school and the earnings observations

in the eective sample for FE to lead it to understate the earnings eect of a law degree while capturing the

occupation related component.

   Overall, the evidence indicates that the TT eect of a law degree is large  about 0.15 per year for a 3

year degree. Of course these estimates do not account for tuition costs, which are substantial especially at

private universities.

7.1.3      MBA and Other Business Related Master's Degrees

Row 4 of Table 5 reports estimates of the return to an MBA. The FE-cg estimate of                g   is 0.110 (0.021).

This estimate suggests only a modest return to an MBA, in sharp contrast to the OLS estimate of 0.282

(0.008).    The FE-cg and OLS values of      g1_28   are larger: 0.181 and 0.308 respectively, reecting the fact

that the return rises with time since graduate school and that     g   places more weight on the earlier years. A

comparison of columns 1 and 2 indicates that the need to include the college only subsample when estimating

g1_28     accounts for about half of the dierence between the FE-cg estimates of     ^g   and   g1_28 .
     The FE-cg estimates show that an MBA improves occupational earnings by an average of 0.016 over the

rst 28 years. The comparable OLS estimate is 0.096. We believe that selection on ability and occupational

preferences leads to substantial bias in the OLS estimates. The high post MBA earnings implied by the OLS

estimates are a reection of relatively high pre MBA market opportunities and business/management related

preferences of many who obtain an MBA.

     The business related master's degree category consists of nancial management (48.1%), business mar-

keting and business management (24.8%), accounting (18.7%), agricultural economics (3.7%), marketing

research (3.4%), other agricultural business and production (0.9%), and actuarial science (0.4%). (See Table

B1). As a group, they are more technical than an MBA degree, and we suspect that they have more spe-

cic prerequisites. The FE-cg estimate of      g   is 0.206 (0.044). This is a healthy return assuming that these

programs take one or even two years if pursued full time. Occupation accounts for about 0.028 (0.013) of

the return. The OLS estimate of      g   is again much larger than FE-cg: 0.342 (0.012). Of this 0.107 (0.004)

is through occupation alone. Like the MBA case, the gap between FE-cg and OLS is narrower for                    g1_28 .
Most of the relative increase in the FE-cg estimate is due to the switch to the full sample.



7.1.4      MA in Health Services Administration, and Public Administration

We next consider two other management and administrative services related degrees. The FE-cg estimate

of   g   for a master's in health administration is 0.273 (0.091). The OLS estimate is similar: 0.302 (0.026).

Occupational returns account for 25% and 42% (respectively) of these eects. The FE-cg and OLS estimates

of   g   for public administration are about two thirds as large  0.193 (0.052) and 0.212 (0.020), respectively.

About half of the return is through occupation.



7.1.5      MA in Nursing

The FE-cg and OLS estimates of       g   are 0.235 (0.041) and 0.313 (0.014) respectively, a large dierence. The

FE-cg estimate of     g1_28   is 0.163 (0.038), which is 55 percent of the corresponding OLS estimate.            FE-cg

and OLS show similar occupation premiums of 0.02 and 0.03. The substantial dierence between FE-cg and

OLS for earnings and the small dierence for occupation suggest substantial earnings related selection among

nurses who obtain a master's degree.



7.1.6      MA in Health Related Fields

The health related category consists primarily of physical therapy (26.9%), audiology and speech pathology

(19.8%), public health (18.9%), other health/medical sciences (18.5%), pharmacy (9.1%), and health/medical

assistant (4.2%). Both FE-cg and OLS show a return of about 0.22, with little variation with          xit .   The FE-cg

estimate suggests that 0.098 (0.022) of the return is through occupational upgrading. This makes sense given




                                                         20
the importance of occupation specic training and licensing requirements in most of the subelds in the

category.



7.1.7      Engineering and Computer Science\Math

The FE-cg and OLS estimates of          g   for a master's in engineering are 0.103 (0.018) and 0.147 (0.005). For

computer science and math, the FE-cg and OLS estimates are 0.179 (0.033) versus 0.204 (0.009). OLS shows

a larger eect operating through occupation. To some degree, OLS misses the fact that people who obtain a

degree in these two elds were in relatively high paying occupations prior to graduate school.

     Table B7 reports the estimates ofgx . In both elds the estimates rise over the rst few years after the
degree.    The FE-cg and OLS estimates of g 1_28 are larger and more similar than the estimates of g . Placing

more of the weight on the FE-cg estimates, we conclude that a master's degree in these two elds yields a

healthy return that comes a number of years after graduate school.



7.1.8      MA in Other Science\Engineering Related Fields

The other science and engineering category is dominated by architecture and environmental design (73%).

The remainder consists of engineering technologies, electrical and electronics technologies, or industrial pro-

duction technologies.      The FE-cg estimate is only 0.089 (0.057).        The OLS estimate is 0.115 (0.013).   We

suspect that returns are higher in the engineering related elds, for which average earnings and the OLS

estimates are substantially larger than for architecture (Table B1).



7.1.9      Biology\Agriculture\Environmental Sciences and Physical Sciences

For master's degrees in biology, agricultural, environmental and life sciences, the FE-cg estimate is 0.231

(0.045).     The estimate for the physical sciences is 0.158 (0.054), which is also substantial.      The estimates

of   g1_28   are about 0.10 and 0.13 higher. Most of these returns are within occupation. In sharp contrast,

the corresponding OLS estimates are only 0.015 (0.011) and 0.053 (0.015) respectively.            Almost all of the

dierence between the estimators is within occupation.             We are surprised by the large dierence between

FE-cg and OLS in this case, especially because it is not associated with a large dierence in the occupational

return estimates.



7.1.10       Education

The results for a master's in education are particularly interesting. Teacher contracts often mandate higher

salaries for teachers with master's degrees. For example, the 2018 salary schedule for New York City species

base salaries of $56,711 for a teacher with 1 year of experience and $105,394 for a teacher with 22 years

of experience.     The corresponding values for a teacher with an approved master's degree are $63,751 and

$112,434.
         40 The implied premium in logs are 0.117 for new teachers and 0.065 for teachers with 22 years

of experience.     Note that the average gain may be larger if the masters facilitates movement into higher

paying administrative or specialized teaching positions. The FE-cg estimate of         g   is 0.163 (0.019), of which

0.028 (0.007) is due to occupational advancement.            The earnings eect seems high, but the fact that a

small component is through occupation seems reasonable given that a master's in educational administration

accounts for 15.7% of the education category, and it pays better (Table B1). When we add the college only

observations and allow the return to depend on          xit ,   the eect rises from 0.109 (0.019) when        xit = 1   to 0.261

(0.019) when     xit = 20.   The increase seems implausibly large.

   In contrast, the OLS estimate is 0.102 (0.006), and it is only 0.045 (0.007) ve years after the degree.

OLS shows a substantial       negative   eect on occupational pay of -0.064 (0.003). We think this reects the fact

that getting a master's in education is an indication that an individual has chosen to continue as a teacher or

to switch into teaching from a higher paying occupation              ^cg .   That is, those who get a master's in education,

even conditional on undergraduate major, have talents and preferences that lead them toward a relatively low

paying (but socially valuable) profession. This negative occupational selection takes away from the positive

and contractually based treatment on the treated eect of a master's in education.



7.1.11      Psychology\Social Work, the Humanities, Not science or engineering related and
            Social Sciences

The FE-cg and OLS estimates of           g   for a master's in psychology and social work follow the same qualitative

pattern as education but are quantitatively more extreme. The FE-cg estimate is 0.202 (0.029), while the

OLS value is only 0.056 (0.009). About 0.087 of the gap is because FE-cg implies a 0.025 (0.017) occupational

return while OLS implies a       loss   of -0.062 (0.004).

   The relative values of the OLS and FE-cg estimates of              g      for a master's in humanities also follow a similar

pattern, although the FE-cg approach indicates a return of only 0.018 (0.062). The small return is associated

with an estimate of -0.076 (0.025) for occupational earnings. One interpretation of this nding is that the

humanities degree enables an individual to nd work in occupations that value the degree, and these are

relatively low paying. Getting a master's in humanities has a modest positive eect within occupation. In

contrast, the OLS estimate is -0.145 (0.014) and is driven by a huge -0.202 (0.008) eect on occupational

earnings.

   The results for master's degrees in the Not science or engineering related category are qualitatively

similar. This category consists of communications (13.2%), library science (39.3%), criminal justice/protective

services (13.9%), and journalism (8.2%). The FE-cg estimate is 0.117 (0.056) while the OLS estimate is 0.064

(0.014). About 0.02 of the dierence arises from the more negative OLS estimate of the occupation return.

   Social science (excluding psychology) is the exception within this group, in that the FE-cg and OLS

estimates of     g   are very similar: about 0.1 for the earnings premium and about 0.03 for the occupational

premium.
            41



7.1.12      Returns for Individuals Who Go Directly to Graduate School

In our data 15% of those with graduate degrees when we last observe them went directly to graduate school

after college. The fraction varies from 1.9% in Health administration to 62.1% for Medicine (Table B10).

It would be useful to know whether our TT estimates also apply to degrees obtained directly after college.

Relevant to the answer is whether those who go directly to graduate school are very dierent from those

who do not.      Table B10 reports that direct goers are 9.65 percentage points more likely to have a college

educated father than those who delay, on a base of 40.54%. We also used the earnings regression coecients

on the race\Hispanic indicators to form a race\Hispanic earnings index for men and for women. The mean

of the index is 0.004 higher for men who go direct and 0.001 higher for women who go direct.                         For most

graduate elds, those who go direct have slightly higher grades (Table B10). The mean advantage is 0.067

 41 The   FE-cg estimate for a master's in arts is too noisy to support a meaningful comparison to OLS.




                                                                22
             42 Overall, these results suggest those who go directly to graduate school are academically and
on a 4.0 scale.

economically advantaged relative to those who do not, but the dierences seem small.
                                                                                      43

    Second, we also estimated equation (5) on a sample that includes those who went directly to graduate

school, with an indicator for go direct added. The coecient on go direct is 0.077 (0.008). The value

falls to 0.043 (0.008) when we use the model with experience interactions (equation 8, suggesting that part

of the gap is because direct goers have more post graduate school experience. Table B11 reports estimates

of equation (5) with a full set of interactions between the              Ggt   indicators and go direct added. We do not

have space to discuss the estimates but they are typically positive and are substantial for some degrees. For

example, the value is only 0.004 for an MBA but 0.107 (0.019) for law and 0.081 (0.013) for engineering.

The values fall when we include experience interactions. Caution is warranted, because the coecients on

the go direct interactions combine the dierence in the return to a particular graduate degree for those

who go direct and those who delay with dierences between the two groups in the                        bcg    heterogeneity terms.

A dierent identication strategy, perhaps based on a rich control set for family background, undergraduate

achievement, and preferences, will be required to identify TT eects for those who go direct to graduate

school.



7.2 Internal Rates of Return Estimates Based on the FE-cg Regressions
Table 6 reports the present discounted values (PDV) of lifetime income net of tuition for each advanced degree,

the counterfactual PDV for people who chose various advanced degrees had they not gone for graduate school

and the percentage gain from the advanced degree. It also reports the calculated internal rate of return                       g
for each advanced eld.

    The estimates are based on the following assumptions. Column 1 shows the assumed duration of each

degree. We use average tuition in 2012 at public institutions, in 2013 dollars (National Center for Education

Statistics (2019)). We assume graduate programs are full-time, and students have zero earnings when they

are enrolled. We assume people start graduate school in the indicated eld at age 27, and retire at age 59.

We set the earnings error term to 0, the parental education variables to their weighted sample means and

the calendar year to 2012. We set the race\Hispanic indicators to non-Hispanic white, but take a population

weighted average over the distribution of gender and undergraduate major for each advanced degree. The

PDV calculation assumes that the interest rate is 0.05.
                                                                      44 The PDV and counterfactual PDVs vary a great

  42 We control for BA eld, advanced eld, and year of college degree. The standard deviation of GPA is 0.41.
  43 Oyer (2006), Kahn (2010) and other studies nd that leaving school during a recession has substantial eects           on early
earnings that persist. Labor market conditions also aect the decision to attend graduate school, an issue that is relevant to
the discussion of Ashenfelter's dip. However, the empirical evidence is mixed (Altonji et al. (2016b)). College graduation year
dummies explain only 0.004 of the variation in the go direct indicator, controlling for a cubic in graduation year (not shown).
This indicates that going direct is only weakly related to labor market conditions at college graduation. Consequently, the eects
of labor market conditions on the timing of graduate school and on pre graduate school earnings seem unlikely to matter much
for our estimates.

deal across graduate degrees.

   For medicine, the percentage gain in PDV (with tuition accounted for) is 41.6%. It is a 4 year degree,

and   ^g    is 0.160.   For law, the values are 28.7% and 0.148, while the percentage gain for an MBA is 1.1%

and   ^g   is 0.059. The internal rate of return is above 10% for all other degrees, except arts, humanities, and

other science and engineering related elds, for which it is negative. A master's in the life sciences has the

highest internal rate of return. Using average private tuition lowers                    ^g   to about 0.13 for medicine, and about

0.13 for law (not reported). It leads to a reduction of about 0.01 or 0.02 for the other elds. Table B12 uses

the model (7) with experience interactions and reports values of                       ^g   that are often lower even though   1-28
is often higher, presumably because later career earnings are discounted. The values are 0.128 for medicine,

0.131 for law, 0.083 for an MBA, and 0.150 for engineering.



7.3 Returns by Gender
Tables B13 and B14 report summary statistics about earnings for men and women, by graduate eld. Table

7 reports FE-cg and OLS estimates of               g   and   g1_28    based upon separate models for men and women. In all

other respects, the specications are identical to the pooled specications that form the basis for Table 5. Not

surprisingly, there is a strong relationship between the FE-cg estimates for men and for women. A regression

of the estimate for women on the corresponding estimate for men yields a sampling error corrected slope

coecient of 0.513 (0.187).
                                   45 The female - male dierence in the simple averages of coecients is 0.042, but

when one weights the coecients using the shares of the advanced degrees in the pooled sample of men and

women, the dierence is only 0.003. It is interesting to note that women obtain a larger return to an MBA

than men do: 0.156 (0.039) versus 0.091 (0.024), although the dierence is not statistically signicant. One

should keep in mind that because the earnings of women are below those of men prior to the advanced degree,

the gain in dollars from an advanced degree implied by the log of earnings model is smaller in some cases

for women even when           g   is higher. A full exploration of gender dierences in the causal eect of graduate

education on labor market outcomes will require a separate paper.



7.4 Graduate Returns by Undergraduate Field
We now turn to estimates of graduate returns by undergraduate eld. In Table B15 we report results for 31

degree combinations with pre advanced observations on at least 31 individuals, but due to space constraints

only consider a subset in the text and Table 8. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 8 report FE-cg and OLS estimates

of the treatment eect for earnings. For completeness, columns 3 and 4 report the FE-cg estimates of                             cg
and   cg1- 28    using the full sample, which includes the college only observations. In column 4 the eect of                   xit
on earnings after graduate school depends on                  g   but not   c,   as given in equation (9). We do not discuss these

estimates, but they are typically larger than the FE-cg estimate of                     ^cg   when the college only observations are

excluded (column 1). They are probably upward biased, while the sample weighted                            cg   parameter estimates

in column 1 probably underestimate the average return per year over the full period after graduate degree

attainment. Columns 5 and 6 report FE-cg and OLS estimates of                           cg    for the occupation premium.

  The internal rate of return     g   of advanced eld   g   is the solution to

                                                          actual             counterfactual

                                                                      24
7.4.1   MBA and Business Related Master's Degrees

The rst 8 rows of Table 8 report the returns to an MBA for various undergraduate elds.           For business

majors the FE-cg estimate is 0.157 (0.065), while the OLS estimate is 0.239 (0.016). For economics majors

the FE-cg estimate is 0.098 (0.070) and the OLS estimate is 0.280 (0.036). One might have expected the

return to be larger for economics majors under the assumption they would benet more from basics in

accounting, management, marketing, and nance that business majors may typically take as undergraduates.

The dierence in the estimates is not signicant even at the 10% level. OLS appears to substantially overstate

the return to an MBA for both majors. In both cases OLS shows a substantial occupation related return of

about 0.065, but FE-cg does not.

   Next we consider STEM majors. The FE-cg estimate of the return to an MBA for biological, agricul-

tural, and environmental sciences majors is -0.107 (0.087). The value for engineering is only 0.083 (0.024).

In contrast, the OLS estimates range from 0.221 (0.013) for engineering to a whopping 0.335 (0.038) for

bio/agricultural/environmental sciences.    OLS appears to vastly overstate the value of an MBA for these

elds, just as it understates the value of a science related master's degree.    We nd the same pattern for

physical science majors.

   The table reports substantial FE-cg estimates of 0.153 (0.076) and 0.140 (0.102) for other social sciences

and psychology. The corresponding OLS estimates are much larger0.403 (0.049) and 0.399 (0.042). It is

interesting to note that we nd substantial FE-cg eects on the occupational returns in the cases of other

social sciences and psychology, but only a small eect for the business related majors. Overall, the results

show substantial heterogeneity across college majors in the value of an MBA, although sampling error is

likely part of the story. The pattern suggests that for some undergraduate elds an MBA can provide the

skills needed to facilitate a transition into a higher level business career.

   The second panel reports estimates for business related master's degrees for three majors. The return

for engineering and economics majors is below the return for business majors, although standard errors are

substantial. The OLS estimates are far above the FE-cg estimates in two of the three cases.



7.4.2   Education

Table 8 panel 3 presents estimates of the return to a master's in education for 7 majors. In some cases, the

estimates are imprecise, because of small cell sizes. The most important estimate is for education majors,

for whom an education masters is common. FE-cg indicates a return of 0.153 (0.028), of which 0.017 (0.009)

is an occupational premium.     The corresponding OLS estimate is even larger: 0.204 (0.008).     In all other

cases, the FE-cg estimate is substantially above the OLS estimate. The gap is particularly large for physical

and related sciences and computer and mathematical sciences as well as for engineering (not reported). OLS

shows a negative occupational premium in all cases.       It is often large, especially for higher paying STEM

elds.

   Overall, the evidence points to a substantial positive return to a master's degree in education, as one

would expect given teacher contracts. OLS seems to be an unreliable guide. The results for the occupational

earnings suggest that the reason is that in many cases those in a given major who pursue a master's in

education chose lower paying occupations prior to graduate school than those who do not. This is not the

case for education majors, which may be why FE-CG and OLS are similar for them.




                                                        25
7.4.3     Other Master's Degrees

The return to a master's in engineering for engineering majors is 0.119 (0.021), of which 0.015 (0.012) is

occupational upgrading. In this case, the OLS estimates are similar. We obtain a healthy return of 0.147

(0.055) to a graduate degree in computer science/math for those who majored in those disciplines.                                       The

return for engineering majors is smaller. The OLS estimates of the returns are about 0.14 in both cases.

   For psychology or social work the FE-cg estimates of                   cg      are about 0.235 for social science majors and for

psychology or social work majors. For both majors, the OLS estimate is about 0.095. Most of the dierence

in the FE-cg and OLS estimates is due to dierences in the occupational returns, which are negative in the

OLS case.



7.4.4     Patterns in the FE-cg estimates by undergraduate eld

Here we highlight how FE-cg estimates of the major specic returns to advanced degrees are related to the

OLS estimates of the BA and advanced degree earnings premia and occupation premiums. We estimate a

series of weighted regressions of the FE-cg estimate of               ^cg    on the OLS estimate for the 113           cg   combinations

for which at least 10 individuals are observed prior to graduate school on the OLS estimates of                                   c   and   g
for the additive specication (not reported).
                                            46 The OLS estimates are probably biased as estimates of causal

eects, but they do capture dierences across elds in the conditional mean of earnings.

   When only       ^c
                        is included, the coecient is -0.204 (0.071), When both                  ^c   and   ^g
                                                                                                                are included, they enter

with coecients of -0.333 (0.095) and 0.480 (0.114) respectively.                         The negative coecient on            ^c   indicates

that the return to graduate degrees tends to be lower for individuals with higher paying majors. Adding the

product of the deviations of       ^c   and   ^g   from their averages across the 19 undergraduate and graduate elds

to the regression indicates that the association of            ^cg   with   ^c    is more negative for graduate degrees with high
                                                                                                                             occ
pay, although the p-value on the interaction term is only 0.107. When the FE-cg estimates of                                 cg       for the

occupation premium are used in place of              ^cg ,   the estimates again indicate that the eect of              g   is smaller for

those with high paying undergraduate degrees, especially for graduate degrees that pay well.




8 Concluding Remarks
Information about the labor market value of alternative graduate degrees is both critical to education decisions

and in short supply. The biggest challenge, in addition to data, is that ability and preferences inuence both

job choice and graduate eld. This makes simple earnings comparisons a poor guide to the causal eects of

the degrees.

   We address the selection problem by controlling for xed eects for whether an individual has obtained

a particular college major and graduate degree combination by the last time that we observe her. Basically,

the FE-cg approach compares earnings before graduate school with earnings after graduate school.

   In the empirical sections we start with a set of facts about the linkages between BA eld, graduate eld,

and occupation. Our main contribution is to provide treatment on the treated estimates of the returns for

19 graduate elds as well as 31 estimates of returns to graduate elds that are for specic undergraduate

majors. The appendix provides descriptive information about earnings premiums for 168 graduate elds. We

provide highlights of the results in the introduction and a detailed discussion in section 7, so here we simply

characterize the results rather than review point estimates.

 46 The   weights are the inverse of square of the standard error of      ^cg .




                                                                     26
    First, the FE-cg estimates dier substantially across elds. Second, we obtain somewhat larger estimates

when we allow the return to graduate school to depend on time since degree completion.                          For most elds

annual returns appear to rise with post graduate school experience. However, we suspect that the experience

specic estimates may be biased because they require the use of data on people who never attend graduate

school to identify the counterfactual experience prole. Third, estimates of internal rates of return, which

account for tuition and program length, vary less across elds.                   They are also less sensitive to including

experience interactions.

    Fourth, the return to a given graduate eld, such as an MBA, depends on the college major. Fifth, the

FE-cg estimates indicate that the extent to which the returns operate through occupational upgrading varies

across degrees. In the cases of law and medicine, most of the returns are across occupations. But in many

other cases, such as a master's in engineering, most of the returns are within occupation.

    Finally, the FE-cg and OLS estimates of the eects on earnings and on the occupational upgrading dier

substantially for many degrees. OLS tends to overstate the returns to graduate elds that attract high paying

college majors, such as a master's in engineering and an MBA. OLS also tends to understate the returns to

graduate elds that attract lower paying majors, such as a master's in psychology and social work. The simple

earnings comparisons of those with an advanced degree to those with only a BA can be very misleading.

    We close with a few caveats. The FE-cg approach requires that experience adjusted earnings observed

prior to the advanced degree must provide an unbiased estimate of what a person would have earned had she

not gone to graduate school, after accounting for dierences in experience. As we explained above, this will

only be true under some strong assumptions. Because the fundamental problem is that we do not observe

counterfactual earnings after graduate school, further progress would seem to require either a more structural

approach or a source of quasi-experimental variation in which a set individuals who are intending to pursue

an MBA, say, are induced at random not to go to graduate school                     in any eld      without altering earnings

prospects in the absence of a graduate degree. This is a tall order.
                                                                    47

    We stress that our estimates are averages across a wide range of institutions. The return to a law degree

may depend on the school. Our approach could incorporate program quality if the data on institutions that

are collected in the NSCG and NSRCG were made available to researchers. We also stressed that our results

are for people who work before going to graduate school. The returns in some elds could be dierent for

those who go immediately to graduate school. Finally, one should keep in mind that our treatment on the

treated estimates may of course be dierent from average treatment eects.                         For example, the estimated

eect for an MBA, say, may be only a rough guide to what the return would be for someone with talents

and preferences that are quite dierent from typical business school graduates. And the treatment on the

treated estimates for medicine and other selective programs are for those who are able to obtain admission

to medical programs.

    Despite these limitations we believe that our paper is an important step toward the goal of providing

information about graduate school returns that individuals can rely on. But we have a long way to go.




 47 Another   possibility is to use geographical proximity to particular graduate programs as a source of variation. Alternatively,
there may be settings in which grades or test scores have a discontinuous relationship with admission to a graduate program at
a particular institution, although we suspect that it will be dicult to dene the counterfactual using such a design given the
large number of alternative programs and institutions.

the two averages, with the shares of the advanced elds as weights. The standard error of the slope is 0.10. The gure shows
that much of the variation in earnings across advanced degrees is associated with occupational sorting.

               Figure 3: Average ln(earnings) of advanced elds by average BA major premium
Note: The gure presents the relationship between the averages of the log of earnings (in 2013 dollars) and the averages of BA
major premium of each advanced eld, using sample weights. The dots indicate the averages. The shaded circles indicate the
share of each advanced eld among all graduate degree holders. The straight line is the tted simple regression line between
the two averages, with the shares of the advanced elds as weights. The standard error of the slope is 0.34. The gure shows
a positive relationship between the log of earnings and the BA major premium.     Therefore, those who choose a high-paying
advanced eld tend to have majored in a high-paying BA eld.

Note:   Weighted summary statistics reported for observations with a BA degree or higher, between the ages of 23 and 59,
inclusive. Standard deviations are reported in brackets. The sample is restricted to full time workers who obtained their BA
degree after age 19. The sample excludes people with PhD degrees now or in the future and people who attend graduate school
directly after college.   The sample also excludes observations of people enrolled in advanced degrees.    Earnings statistics are
based on annualized basic salary of the principal job in 2013 dollars and exclude observations based on annual earnings in the
previous year. Earnings are censored to be more than $5,000 per year, and less than $1,500,000 per year. Column 5 presents the
unweighted cell counts, rounded to the nearest 10, of the regression sample excluding the constructed occupation observations for
1988. Column 6 presents the weighted percentages of each advanced eld of the regression sample using the regression weights.

Note: Tables 2-3 report occupation distributions and average earnings by BA eld and advanced degree eld and status. All
statistics are weighted. The sample excludes observations based on the annual earnings in the previous year. For combinations
with a small cell count, i.e. the most common occupation has less than 10 observations, the specic tabulation is replaced by a
general statement. The top panel reports the ve most common occupations for the BA eld within the subsample of people
who do not have an advanced degree when they are last observed. The lower panels report the ve most common occupations for
each BA and advanced eld combination, separately for pre and post advanced degree observations, on the subsample of people
who have an advanced degree when they are last observed. Column 1 describes each panel. Column 2 reports the rankings of the
occupations, column 3 reports the name of each occupation, column 4 reports the share of each occupation within each distinct
educational background, and column 5 reports the average earnings of the individuals with each occupation and educational
background combination. Table 2 focuses on people with a BA in Engineering.

     Note: The table reports estimates of returns to advanced degrees for a set of additive regression specications. Sample weights are used. Standard errors are clustered by person.
     The dependent variable is log earnings in col. 1-6 and the occupation premium in col. 7-11. The regressions include dummies for each BA eld (OLS only) and each advanced
     degree, as well as parental education, the year, interactions between a cubic in age and gender, a cubic in age and BA eld, and between race\Hispanic and gender.                    The age

     graduate degree sample using equation (10). Cell counts for this sample for earnings range from 2,410 for an MA Arts to 64,810 for an MA in Engineering. Columns 2-6 and
     8-11 use the full sample. Col. 2 and 8 report FE-cg estimates of      g     using (10). Col. 3 and 9 report OLS estimates of       g     using (7). Col. 4-5 and 10-11 report FE-cg and OLS
     estimates of   g1-28 ,   the simple average of the experience specic return    gx   to each advanced degree from 1 to 28 years after degree attainment. They are based on (13), with
     degree combination xed eects excluded in the OLS case. Col. 6 is the same as col. 4 but reports the mean of                gx   over sample distribution of x; see the notes to Table B7 for
     details. The graduate (full) sample has 297,530 (858,130) observations for earnings and 195,540 (581,280) for occupation.

Note: The statistics are calculated from regression coecients underlying the FE-cg estimates reported in Table 5, column 1. For
each advanced degree, we calculate the predicted value of actual income in levels (with graduate education) and counterfactual
income (without graduate education) from age 27 to 59. When evaluating the log earnings model we set the earnings error term to
0, the parental education variables to their weighted sample means and the calendar year to 2012. We also set the race\Hispanic
indicators to non-Hispanic white. For each graduate degree we calculate the population weighted average of predicted earnings
at each age over the distribution of gender and of undergraduate major for that graduate degree. We subtract the tuition of the
graduate degree from people's actual income to obtain net income. We assume graduate programs are full-time, and students
have zero earnings when they are enrolled. The assumed duration of the degree is in Column 1. The average tuition at public
institutions in 2012 from the National Center of Education Statistics is in column 2. Then we calculate the present discounted
value of the lifetime net income, assuming the interest rate is 0.05. Column 3 is the PDV of actual income net of tuition. Column
4 is the PDV of counterfactual income. All monetary values in the table are in 2013 dollars. Column 5 is the percentage increase
in net income 100×((Col. 3-Col. 4)/Col. 4). In column 6, we report estimates of the internal rate of return of each advanced
eld. The internal rate of return is the discount factor that equates actual and counterfactual lifetime net income.

          ( graduate degree sample, which only includes people who have an advanced degree when they are last observed)
     Note: The table reports FE-cg and OLS estimates of returns to advanced degrees by gender for a set of additive regression specications. The control variables include dummies
     for each BA eld (in OLS only) and each advanced degree, as well as a set of demographic variables including parental education, year of the survey, and interactions of cubic in
     age with race\Hispanic and with BA eld. Columns 1, 4 (women) and 7, and 10 (men) report estimates of           g ,   the eects of advanced degrees on earnings and on the occupation
     premium from an FE-cg regression on the graduate degree sample. The specication is equation (10). Cell counts for this FE-cg regression specication are identical to the cell
     counts reported in Table B13 and Table B14. Columns 2, 5, 8, and 11 report OLS estimates of        g     based on equation (7). Columns 3, 6, 9, and 12 report FE-cg estimates for
     earnings and the occupation premium of   g1-28 ,   which is the simple average of return to each advanced degree between 1 and 28 years after degree obtainment. The specication
     is equation (13) and the full sample. A detailed explanation for the construction of these averages is provided in the notes for Table B7.

 ( graduate degree sample, which only includes people who have an advanced degree when they are last observed;                FE-cg with experience prole,
 averaged over 128 years)
Note: Estimates of returns to advanced degree by undergraduate elds are reported. Columns 1-4 present estimates from earnings regressions, and
columns 5-6 present estimates from occupation premium regressions. Columns 1 and 5 present the returns to each advanced degree by each BA eld
from the FE-cg regression. Column 2 presents the returns from the FE-cg regression on the full sample. Columns 3 and 6 present the OLS estimates.
Column 4 presents   g1-28 ,   the average of return to each advanced degree by BA eld from 1 to 28 years of post advanced degree experience. A detailed
explanation of the construction of these averages is provided in the notes for Table B7. Column 7 presents the mean and [standard deviation] of the
annualized basic salary of the principal job in 2013 dollars for people with each combination of undergraduate and graduate eld. Column 8 presents
the individual-level cell count and [observation-level cell count] of pre advanced degree earnings observations for the FE-cg earnings regression (col. 1),
which is the regression with smallest sample among all regressions reported in this table. The individual-level cell count counts multiple observations
of one individual as one. Unweighted cell counts are rounded to the nearest 10. A complete set of estimates of degree combinations with at least 30
individuals is provided in Table B15.

   Appendix B

B.1 The Distribution of Ability and Preferences Conditional on College Major
    and Graduate Education Choice
In this appendix we use a three period model of education and occupation choice to study how selection

inuences the relationship between      dFt1 (At1 , Qt1 |c, Ggt3 ) and dFt3 (At , Qt |c, Ggt3 ).       Drawing on Altonji (1993),

Arcidiacono (2004) and other papers, Altonji et al. (2012) and Altonji et al. (2016b) summarize the theoretical

literature on the choice of eld of study and labor market careers. The theory stresses the following features.


  1. Preferences, innate ability, and knowledge at the start of college shape the expected utility of a particular

      education program. The decisions of whether to attend graduate school and in what eld depend upon

      the same factors, as well as occupational experience.


  2. Individuals learn gradually about preferences and ability, and about the labor market opportunities

      associated with particular courses of study in particular occupations.


  3. Choices are made sequentially with imperfect information about preferences, ability, and labor market

      opportunities.


  4. Education programs and occupations have dierent skills and knowledge prerequisites. The skill and

      knowledge of an individual inuence how much the person learns in a particular program, and perfor-

      mance on the job.


  5. Field of study shapes knowledge accumulation. A program of study shifts potential earnings in various

      occupations. Actual earnings depend on occupation choice, and occupation choice depends on potential

      earnings and preferences.


  6. The eect of past experience in an occupation on potential earnings in other occupations varies.


A key implication is that the choices of whether to attend graduate school and what type of degree to pursue

are inuenced by prior choices, ability, and preferences.

   We now present a simple three period model of occupation choice, graduate school, and earnings that is

consistent with the rst ve features but assumes prior occupation has a neutral eect on the earnings. At

the end of the appendix, we discuss how occupation specic experience alters the pattern of selection. In

keeping with the analysis in section 5.2, the timing is as follows. We consider                   c   majors who have obtained

their degree prior to   t1   and who choose to work in period       t1   rather than go directly to graduate school. The

potential earnings in each occupation in       t1   is given by   wc0jt1 (At1 ).
                                                                             t2 , individual i either works in the
                                                                                       In

optimal occupation or goes to graduate school in the optimal eld. In t3 , i chooses an occupation and works.
            occ
    Let nucgjt (At , Qt , jt ) be the non-pecuniary value of working in j in period t. It depends on At , Qt , and

the j th element jt of the vector t of i-specic i.i.d. occupation specic preference components. The function

nuocc
   cgjt also depends on c and g because the knowledge and experiences gained in c and g may inuence how
satisfying j is for given values of At and Qt .

   We have implicitly assumed that prior occupation choice does not aect the pecuniary and nonpecuniary

ow value of graduate education. The earnings specication assumes that prior occupation does not aect

future labor market opportunities in a way that depends on                 g   or   jt .   As a result, choice of occupation is

separable from future education and occupation decisions.                 Correlation between          jt1   and choice of   g   and



                                                             43
future occupations arises from persistence in                    At , Qt      and the causal eects of                   c   and   g.    We discuss relaxing

these assumptions in section 5.2.5.

     People are indierent to the timing of consumption and income and are risk neutral.
                                                                                                                                        48

     We now work backwards from the third period. The ow value from working in occupation                                                       j   in   t3   is



                                    exp (wcgj   t3   (At3 )) + nuocc
                                                                 cgj     t3   (At3 , Qt3 , j      t3 ) , j   = 1, · · · , J .

The individual chooses the occupation jt3 with the highest ow value, which we denote by                                                 Vcgt3 (At3 , Qt3 , t3 ).
The occupation choice probabilities                  pcgt3 (jt3 |At3 , Qt3 )      are implicitly dened by the above                       t3 choice problem
and the distribution of the transitory occupation specic preference vector                                       t3 .
     In   t2 , i   either works in the best occupation             jt2   or attends graduate school in the best eld. The net ow

value of attending graduate school in eld                   g                  nugrad (At2 , Qt2 , vt2 ) minus the
                                                                is the non-pecuniary component
                                                                                 cg
monetary cost COSTg (At2 , zt2 ). The non-pecuniary value depends on c, A, Q, and the preference shifter

vt2 . The shifter vt2 inuences utility from graduate school but is unrelated to A and Q, and has no direct
inuence on occupation choice. The monetary cost depends on At2 and on the net tuition shifter zt2 . The

vector zt2 captures tuition and grants at nearby schools and the potential for nancial support from relatives.

     Adding the ow value of obtaining a g degree to the continuation value for t2 gives the value of going to

graduate school in eld g :


                         Vcg t2 (At2 , Qt2 , zt2 ) =nugrad
                                                      cg   (At2 , Qt2 , vt2 ) - COSTg (At2 , zt2 ) , g = 1, · · · , G
                                                       + Et2 [Vcg t3 (At3 , Qt3 , t3 )] .
The expectation is over the distribution of                     At3 , Qt3         and     t3   conditional on       At2 , Qt2 .        We do not explicitly

incorporate the fact that graduate school attendance in                               g   is also conditional on availability and admission.

However, one can think of the                 nugrad
                                                cg   (At2 , Qt2 , vt2 )           and the      COSTg (At2 , zt2 )           functions as incorporating

these factors.

     Working in          t2   corresponds to choosing        g = 0.   The ow value of working in                        j   is



                                    exp (wc0j   t2   (At2 )) + nuocc
                                                                 j (At2 , Qt2 , t2 , c, 0) , j = 1, · · · , J .


The value of working in             t2   is

                                                                                    c0jt2 (At2 , Qt2 , t2 )
                                                            j

                                                           + Et2 Vc0t3 (At3 , Qt3 , t3 ) .

Note that          j   does not appear in the continuation value                   Et2 Vc0t3 (A, Q, t3 )        because we have ruled out eects

of   j   on skill accumulation and the evolution of preferences.

     Person        i   attends graduate school in program                g   if   g   is the best available graduate school option and it

dominates working. The optimality conditions are



                           Vcgt2 (At2 , Qt2 , vt2 , zt2 ) > Vcg t2 (At2 , Qt2 , vt2 , zt2 ) , g = 1, · · · , G and g = g                                      (10)

 48 That     is, we are assuming quasilinear utility and perfect credit markets.                    We also assume a zero rate of time preference.
Given quasilinear utility and perfect credit markets, time preference would only inuence choice by altering the weights on the
non-pecuniary components of utility in dierent periods.




                                                                              44
and

                                        Vcgt2 (At2 , Qt2 , vt2 , zt2 ) > Vc0t2 (At2 , Qt2 , t2 ) .                                      (11)


Note that     Ggt3 = Ggt2     because graduate education is obtained in                  t2 .
    The above inequalities for the choice of          g   implicitly dene the conditional pdf              dFt1 (At2 , Qt2 |c, Ggt3 ) based
on the joint pdf of     (At2 , Qt2 , vt2 , zt2 , t2 ) given c. The conditions (10, 11) and the pdf of
    (At1 , Qt1 , At2 , Qt2 , zt2 , t2 , At3 , Qt3 |c ) implicitly dene the conditional pdfs dFt1 (At1 , Qt1 |c, Ggt3 ) and
dFt3 (At3 , Qt3 |c, Ggt3 ). These distributions are central to our discussion of identication in 5.2.
    Finally, we turn to the rst period. People choose the best occupation jt1 given that the value of working

in j , j = 1, · · · , J is



            Vc0t1 (jt1 |At1 , Qt1 , t1 ) = exp (wc0j       t1   (At1 )) + nuocc
                                                                            c0j (At1 )

                                         + Et1 max maxVcg t2 (At2 , Qt2 , vt2 , zt2 ) , Vc0t2 (At2 , Qt2 , t2 )                  .
                                                                 g


The expectation is over the distribution of               At2 , Qt2 , vt2 , zt2 , t2   conditional on     At1 , Qt1 , c.   The above choice

problem implicitly determines the occupation choice probabilities                        pc0t1 (jt1 |At1 , Qt1 ).


B.2 Mathematical Statement of Assumptions About the Age Prole of Earnings
A2a concerns the eects of new information about                      A   and   Q.
    Assumption A2a (Neutral              contribution of updating about At , Qt to earnings trends ):


              pcgt3 (j |At3 , Qt3 ) wcgjt3 (At3 ) [dFt3 (At3 , Qt3 |c, Ggt3 ) - pcgt3 (j |At1 , Qt1 ) wcgjt3 (At1 ) dFt1 (At1 , Qt1 |c, Ggt3 )]
    j   A,Q


=             pc0t3 (j |At3 , Qt3 ) wc0jt3 (At3 ) [dFt3 (At3 , Qt3 |c, Ggt3 ) - pc0t3 (j |At1 , Qt1 ) wc0jt3 (At1 ) dFt1 (At1 , Qt1 |c, Ggt3 )] .
    j   A,Q


The occupation probability function and earnings functions on the left hand side are evaluated at                                    Gt3 = g
while those on the right hand side are evaluated at                  Gt3 = 0.       This is the only dierence.

    The next assumption is that earnings growth within occupation is the same for all occupations conditional

on college major and ability.

    Assumption A2b       (Earnings trends do not depend on occupation): wcgjt (At ) and wc0jt (At ) follow
parallel trends that depend on At1 but not the occupation. That is,

                         E [wcgjt (At ) |c, Ggt3 ] = wcgjt1 (At1 ) + ac (At1 , At - At1 ) , g = 0, 1, ..., G ,

    where   ac (·, ·)   is some college major specic function.

    The nal assumption, A4, concerns the earnings growth due to predictable shifts in occupation with

experience.

    Assumption A2c (Occupational      earnings progression ): Evaluated at dFt1 (A, Q|c, Gg
                                                                                          t3 ), the contribution
of occupational progression to earnings growth for those who choose g would have been the same if they had
not gone to graduate school. To be specic,




                                                                      45
                [pcgt3 (j |At3 , Qt3 ) dFt1 (At3 , Qt3 |c, Ggt3 ) - pcgt1 (j |At1 , Qt1 )] wcgjt1 (At1 ) dFt1 (At1 , Qt1 |c, Ggt3 )
      j   A,Q


  =             [pc0t3 (j |At3 , Qt3 ) dFt1 (At3 , Qt3 |c, Ggt3 ) - pc0t1 (j |At1 , Qt1 )] wc0jt1 (At1 ) dFt1 (At1 , Qt1 |c, Ggt3 )
      j   A,Q


  =         c (A, Q, t3 - t1 ) dFt1 (A, Q|c, Ggt3 )
      A,Q


for g = 0, 1, ..., G and some college major specic function c (·, ·, ·).

B.3 Data Appendix
B.3.1     Construction of the panel data

As described in section 2, we pool all waves of NSCG (1993 to 2015) and NSRCG (1993 to 2010) to build

the panel data set for empirical analyses.             Each raw data set we use is based on a separate survey , so

they unavoidably have various inconsistencies in variable names and values across waves, and across multiple

observations of the same person. We start assembling the panel data from a set of 10 NSCG data les and

8 NSRCG data les, and append and clean the panel data in the following steps.

   Step 1. We modify the variable names in each separate data le to unify key variable names.

   Step 2. We assign values to categorical variables using crosswalks modied from the codebook of each

separate data source to ensure consistent classications. These variables include parental education, marital

status, race, type of each postsecondary degree, major and minor eld of each degree with three dierent

levels of disaggregation (best code includes 144 categories, minor group includes 33, and major group

includes 7), occupation with three dierent levels of disaggregation (best code includes 144 categories,

minor group includes 31, major group includes 7). Table B2 is the crosswalk for BA elds, and table B1

is the crosswalk for advanced elds. In both tables, column (1) is the aggregated classication we dene and

use in most of the empirical analysis. Table B3 is the crosswalk for occupation, in which column (1) and

(2) present an aggregated (19 categories) and a disaggregated (66 categories) classication that we construct

to incorporate the NSCG/NSRCG and 1990 Census occupation codes. We also merge in the BA premiums

and occupational premiums estimated from the ACS through crosswalks between BA eld and occupation

classications in the ACS and the NSCG/NSRCG data.

   Step 3. We hard code a number of cases to ensure the value of time invariant variables are consistent

across multiple cases of the same person in the panel data.                   These variables include birth year, parental

education, primary and secondary elds and the graduation year of the rst BA.

   Step 4. We re-organize the degree information. The raw data organize the advanced elds in the time

order of completion.        It also records two elds of the same degree (i.e.                with the same degree type and

graduation year) as multiple degrees. We re-order the degrees so that they are in time order, and multiple

records of the same degree are collapsed.

   Step 5. We drop people whose educational background implies odd time order. For example, a few people

completed their advanced degree before they have a BA degree.

   Step 6.     We make use of the question about the person's total income in the previous year to expand

the panel data. From each existing observation, we generate an observation of the same person from a year

before the survey. For the prior year observation, we remove any degree that is completed in the year of the




                                                                 46
survey, and modify other age and calendar year. We also drop observations that are prior to the graduation

year of the rst BA.

       Step 7. We dene the regression sample by imposing the following restrictions. First, people have to work

full time. This is indicated by either the dummy variable for working full time in the raw data, or jointly

by working at least 35 hours a week and at least 40 weeks a year. We do not have information about hours

worked or a direct question about full time status for the calendar year prior to the survey. Consequently,

we assume that full time status in the year prior to the NSCG and NSRCG survey is the same as full time

status at the time of the survey. The full time status indicator for the 1989 earnings observation and the

1990 occupation variables is based on 1990 Census questions about usual hours worked per week and number

of weeks worked in 1989.

       Second, people have to be aged between 23 and 59. Third, we drop people with a PhD by the last time we

observe them and drop observations of people who are currently enrolled in an educational program.
                                                                                                                         49 We

also drop people who hold a BA degree before 18 years old and drop people who obtained their rst advanced

degree before age 23 or after age 49. We also drop people who did not work between BA completion and

being enrolled in graduate school. Section 7.1.12 provides a detailed discussion of the last restriction. Lastly,

we drop the follow up observations of people who became SESTAT-eligible solely because of occupation.
                                                                                                                            50

       Step 8. We deate all the nominal earnings to 2013 US dollars.

       Step 9, We dene the weights as described in section B.3.2.

       Step 10. We rescale the occupation premiums based on the ACS (see below) to have a coecient of 1.

We let
           rescale
           occ     = ^ occ , in which ^ is the estimated coecient from w =  + occ .                The value is of   ^ is 0.934.
                                                                                                                     

B.3.2        Construction of Sample Weights

Overview of construction of weights                  We aim to study the labor market returns to advanced degrees

that represent the population of people who have a college degree in any eld who are between 23 and 59

years old who live in the U.S.. The target populations of the 1993, 2003, 2010, 2013 NSCG are individuals

with at least a BA degree. We use the survey weights for each of these samples produced by the National

Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) to estimate the distribution college graduates across

combinations of BA eld and graduate eld (including no graduate degree) over the four years combined. The

NSRCG and the other waves of the NSCG prior to 2010 are restricted to the SESTAT eligible population.

Thus individuals with STEM eligible occupations and advanced degrees are overrepresented when we pool

all of the data. Furthermore, and the NCSES weights for these waves weight to the SESTAT population.

       We adjust the NCSES weights for all waves of the NSRCG and NSCG so that the weighted distribution of

c, g   pairs in the pooled sample matches the distribution of          c, g   pairs that we estimated using the 1993, 2003,

2010, and 2013 NSCG. Separate weights are constructed for the earnings regressions and the occupational

premium regressions that reect the mix of surveys that contribute observations. The pooled sample weights

for earnings account for the fact that some interviews contribute earnings observations for two years. We

trim the adjusted weights using 1/10 and 10 times of the median of the weights of all observations in the

combined data.
  49 Enrollment   is inferred by completion time of the degree. We assume all master degrees, MBA, and other professional degrees
take 2 years, Law takes 3 years, and Medicine takes 4 years. Surveys are conducted in April prior to 2000, and October after.
  50 If   a person does not hold a BA or an advanced degree in a S&E eld, but is included in the database and has follow up
interviews, we say this person becomes SESTAT-eligible because of an S&E occupation choice.




                                                                47
Details         Let   weightis   denote that survey weights provided by NCSES, where                      i   denotes the person and    s
denotes a specic wave of a survey, such as the NSCG 2003.

     Step 1. Standardize weights across NSCG and NSCRG waves. First, we want to preserve the relative

weights within each survey while accounting for varying sample sizes across surveys. We divide the survey

weight by the sum of weights of all observations from the survey and then multiply by the number of

observations.


                                                         -adj               weightit
                                              weightsurv
                                                    is        =            Ns
                                                                                            × Ns
                                                                           i=1   weightis
     .

     Step 2: Estimate the population probabilities of each college major and graduate degree combination.

     In the second step, we estimate the fraction              pbase
                                                                cg     of college graduates in each      c, g cell   over the period of

full sample, where no advance degree (g                = 0)   form a separate cell for each          major c. To     do so, we use the

NSCG 1993, 2003, 2010, and 2013. Each is a stratied random sample of the population of college graduates

to estimate at the time of observation. For these waves of the NSCG, the weights provided by the NCSES

weight the samples to the population of college graduates who have had a BA for 3 or more years.
                                                                                                                                   51 The

NSCG 2015 is also a stratied random sample of the population of college graduates but we chose not to

use it to avoid giving excessive weight to the distribution of college graduates from 2010 on when estimating

pbase
 cg .       The formula is


                                                                Ns               -adj
                                                                i=1   weightsurv
                                                                            is        × 1 {Cis = c, Gis = g }
                                 s{1993,2003,2010,2013}
                       pbase
                        cg   =
                                                                                  Ns               -adj
                                                                                  i=1   weightsurv
                                                                                              is
                                                 s{1993,2003,2010,2013}
.

     Step 3:      Adjust weights for the pooled NSCG and NSRCG samples so that the weighted fractions of

observations in cell c,g in combined sample match                   pbase
                                                                     cg     for all c,g combinations.

     First, we compute the fractions in the pooled sample implied by the unadjusted weights:


                                                      Ns               -adj
                                                            weightsurv      × 1 {Cis = c, Gis = g }
                                  ppooled
                                   cg     =       s   i=1         is
                                                                      Ns               -adj
                                                                s     i=1   weightsurv

     Then we multiply the normalized weights from Step 1 for individuals for whom                                 Cis = c, Gis = g     by

In the empirical analysis the mix of observations depends on the dependent variable in the regression. In

the case of earnings, in many cases a given survey wave contributes an observation on current earnings and

an observation on past earnings. We compute                   pbase
                                                               cg   using only the current earnings observation. However,
      pooled

                                                                    surv -adj
years' earnings. We assign the same value                of weightis          , but in a small number of cases the education

cell is dierent because the individual obtained a degree in the current year.

    51 We   are ignoring the possibility that the mix of degrees across elds is dierent for people who received their college degree
more recently.




                                                                      48
   We construct separate values for the occupation regression sample using observations for which occupation

is available. In section 7 and the notes of gures and tables, we state the sample frame of the analysis without

reiterating that the weights are adjusted for the relevant sample frame.

   Finally, we want to avoid the case in which the importance of one single observation is too small or too

B.3.3   Earnings premium of BA elds from ACS

We pool the 2009 - 2014 American Community Survey to construct a large cross sectional data. We apply

sample restrictions to only include people who are between 24 and 59 years old, working full time, and

earn at least $5,000 a year.   We regress the log of annual earnings on dummies for 172 college majors, a

cubic of age interacted with gender, race\Hispanic interacted with gender, and three dummies for having a

master's degree, PhD, and professional degree, subject to the ACS survey weights. The coecients on the

disaggregated college major categories are the BA major earnings premium from the ACS. We also extract the

population distribution of BA elds from the regression sample. Then we use a crosswalk between BA eld

classication of the ACS and the SESTAT database to merge the premium into the SESTAT data. When

multiple majors in ACS are mapped to a single major in SESTAT, we calculate the population weighted

average of the major premium.



B.3.4   Occupation premium from ACS

We estimate the occupation premiums using ACS data and an approach that is similar to the one used to

estimate the BA major earnings premiums. The regression has the same set of control variables, except that

we now include the 331 occupation dummies instead of college major dummies. We construct an occupation

crosswalk among ACS, SESTAT and the 1990 Census. Section 2.1 describes the use of 1990 Census occupation

in the empirical analysis.

Figure B1: Gender dierences in average ln(earnings) by dierences in the average occupation premiums of
advanced elds
Note: The gure plots the male-female dierence for each advanced eld in the average of the log of earnings (in 2013 dollars)
against the dierence in the average occupation premium, using sample weights. The dots indicate the gender dierences. The
shaded circles indicate the share of each advanced eld among all graduate degree holders. The straight line is the tted simple
regression line between the two averages, with the shares of the advanced elds as weights. The standard error of the slope is
0.53. The gure shows that men are in higher paying occupations than women in all advanced elds except for humanities and
arts, but only a small fraction of the earnings dierentials are accounted for by gender dierences in occupation choices.




                                                              50
Figure B2: Gender dierences in average ln(earnings) by dierences in the average BA major premiums of
advanced elds
Note:   The gure plots the male-female dierence for each advanced eld in the average of the log of earnings against the
dierence in the average BA major premium, using sample weights. The BA premiums are OLS estimates for the pooled sample
of males and females and are reported in Table B4. The dots indicate the gender dierences. The shaded circles indicate the
share of each advanced eld among all graduate degree holders. The straight line is the tted simple regression line between the
two averages, with the shares of the advanced elds as weights. The standard error of the slope is 0.97. The gure shows men
have higher earnings than women in all advanced elds. The gender gap in the BA major premium is scattered around 0.03.
The poor t of the regression line shows that gender dierences in the link between BA eld and graduate eld do not explain
much of the gender gap in earnings.




                     Figure B3: FE-cg and OLS estimates of the Advanced degree premiums
Note: The gure compares the FE-cg and OLS coecients from sample weighted additive regressions of the log of earnings
based on (10) and (7). The gure also presents 90% condence intervals of the estimates. The horizontal axis lists advanced
elds in ascending order of the sample weighted average of earnings of the advanced elds. It shows that OLS underestimates
the returns to low-paying elds (e.g.   humanities, psychology, education, and biology), while it overestimates the returns to
high-paying elds (e.g. medicine, business, MBA, nursing, and other science and engineering related elds).

     Note: Column 1 presents 19 aggregated advanced degree elds that are constructed from 168 disaggregated advanced degrees. For each disaggregated advanced degree, columns
     2-11 present its eld, type (Master or Professional Degree), mean and standard deviation of earnings, mean and standard deviation of occupation premiums, its coecient and
     standard error from a disaggregated additive earnings regression, percentage of the sample, and cell count rounded to the nearest 10. The full regression sample is used, but
     disaggregated advanced degrees with less than 10 observations are removed from the table. The specication is Table 5 column (3), with disaggregated BA and advanced elds.
     Sample weights are used for all statistics except cell count. Standard errors are clustered at the person level.

     Note:   Column 1 presents 20 aggregated occupation categories that are constructed from 66 disaggregated occupations that are available in both Census 1990 (source of
     our earnings and occupation observation for 1990), and the NSCG and NSRCG observations (SESTAT) for 1993-2015.                 Column 2 presents the occupation names of the 66
     disaggregated elds. The 66 disaggregated elds are constructed from 122 occupation categories from SESTAT and 290 occupation categories from Census 1990. Column 3-4
     present the name and data source (Census 1990 or either the NSCG or NSRCG (SESTAT)) of each most detailed-level occupation. For each detailed occupation, Col. 7 reports
     the occupational premium we imported from an earnings regression in ACS 2009-2014. Columns 5, 6, 8 and 9 refer to the "full" earnings regression sample. For each occupation,
     they present the weighted mean and standard deviation of earnings, the unweighted percentage of the sample, and the number of cases. If a disaggregated occupation has 10 or
     fewer observations, the name is left in the table, but all quantitative information is removed from the table. Cell counts are rounded to the nearest 10.
     1 Diagnosing/treating practitioners include dentists, optometrists, physicians, podiatrists, surgeons, veterinarians.
     2 Top-level managers also include executives, administrators (e.g., CEO/COO/CFO, president, district manager, general manager, legislator, chancellor, provost).
     3 Health technologists and technicians include dental hygienists, health record technologists/technicians, licensed practical nurses, medical or laboratory technicians, radiological

     technicians.

Note: The table reports estimates of returns to advanced degrees for additive FE-cg regression specication. The same regression
is estimated on three samples: Column 1 presents the regression estimates on current year earnings measures only. Column 2
presents the estimates on the previous year earnings measure only. Column 3 repeats Table 5 column 1 to show the estimates on
the union set of sample for columns 1 and 2. Column 4 reports the two-sample t-statistics for the dierence between coecients
in columns 1 and 2.

Note: Returns to each advanced degree by years of post advanced degree experience are reported.             We run an additive FE-
cg regression of the log of earnings on BA elds interacted with a cubic function of (age-35), advanced degrees interacted
with a quadratic function of number of years     x   since graduate school completion, and a set of demographics as controls. The
specication is equation (8) on the full sample. Sample weights are used and inference is based on clustering at the individual
level. Then the estimate for the return to a specic advanced degree and a specic value of experience is calculated from the
regression coecients on the advanced degree and the interaction between this advanced degree and the quadratic in years since
graduate school. Column 1 presents the average of        gx   over 1 to 28 years after graduate school completion, weighted by the
distribution of observations in the regression sample. Column 2 presents the corresponding averages, but over all possible years
after graduate school completion, again weighted by the sample distribution of observations. Column 3 presents         g1-28 , the
equally average of   gx   from 1 year to 28 years of post advanced degree experience. Columns 4-8 present the return   gx for x=1,
5, 10, 20, and 30 years of post advanced experience.

Note: Individual xed eects estimates of returns to advanced degrees are reported for the additive specication. Columns 1
and 2 report estimates of   g   for the log of earnings and the occupation premium, respectively. See the note to Table 5 for list
of control variables. Time invariant controls are absorbed by the person eects. Person specic averages of the sample weights
across panel observations are used. Standard errors are clustered at the person level. The estimates are for the full sample.
Estimates for the graduate sample tend to be smaller for earnings and similar for the occupation premium.

Note: Weighted summary statistics and regression results reported for analysis about individuals who go directly to graduate
school. We use the same set of sampling restrictions while relaxing the requirement that people defer going to graduate school.
Column 1 presents the fraction of people who defer graduate school. Columns 2 and 3 present the fraction of people with college
educated father by whether the individuals go directly to graduate school. Columns 4 and 5 present the mean and [standard
deviation] of a race\Hispanic wage index by whether the individuals go directly to graduate school. The race\Hispanic wage
index of each person is the coecient of his/her race\Hispanic category in the FE-cg earnings regression, without restricting
to people who defer graduate school.    Column 6 presents the mean and [standard deviation] of GPA for people who defer
graduate school. Column 7 presents the gap in GPA between people who go directly and people who defer graduate school,
estimated from a regression that controls for advanced eld, BA eld, and year graduated from BA to account for GPA ination.
Since undergraduate GPA is only available for people who entered the SESTAT system through the Survey of Recent College
Graduates, we have GPA for less than 30 individuals who go directly to get a master's in arts. We leave that cell blank.

Note: The table reports estimates of returns to advanced degrees for two regressions. We use the same set of sampling restrictions
while relaxing the requirement that people worked before going to graduate school. In both regressions we allow people who go
directly to graduate school to have dierent returns than those who work before attending graduate school, by interacting the
dummy for going directly with advanced eld. Columns 1 and 2 use the same set of controls as the additive FE-cg regression
(Table 5, column 1).   Column 1 presents the return to advanced elds for people who delay graduate school, and column 2
presents the additional return for people who go directly to graduate school. Columns 3 and 4 use the same set of controls as the
additive FE-cg regression with post advanced degree experience interactions (Table 5 column 4). Column 3 presents the equally
weighted average return from 1 to 28 years after graduated school the advanced degree, i.e.   g1-28 ,   for people who delay going
to graduate school. Column 4 presents the additional return for people who go directly to graduate school.

Note: The statistics are calculated from regression coecients underlying the FE-cg estimates with post-advanced degree experience specic eects
reported in Table 5, column 4. For each advanced degree, we calculate the predicted value of actual income in levels (with graduate education) and
counterfactual income (without graduate education) from age 27 to 59. When evaluating the log earnings model we set the earnings error term
to 0, the parental education variables to their weighted sample means and the calendar year to 2012. We also set the race\ethnicity indicators to
non-Hispanic white. For each graduate degree we calculate the population weighted average of predicted earnings at each age over the distribution
of gender and of undergraduate major for that graduate degree. We subtract the tuition of the graduate degree from people's actual income to
obtain net income. We assume graduate programs are full-time, and students have zero earnings when they are enrolled. The assumed duration of
the degree is in Column 1. The average tuition at public institutions in 2012 from the National Center of Education Statistics is in column 2. Then
we calculate the present discounted value of the lifetime net income, assuming the interest rate is 0.05. Column 3 is the PDV of actual income
net of tuition. Column 4 is the PDV of counterfactual income. All monetary values in the table are in 2013 dollars. Column 5 is the percentage
increase in net income 100×((Col. 3-Col. 4)/Col. 4). In column 6, we report estimates of the internal rate of return of each advanced eld at
public institutions. The internal rate of return is the discount factor that equates actual and counterfactual lifetime net income. In column 7, we
present the average tuition at private institutions in 2012 from the National Center of Education Statistics. In column 8, we report estimates of
the internal rate of return of each advanced eld at private institutions.

        years)
     Note: Estimates of returns to advanced degree by undergraduate elds are reported. Columns 1-4 present estimates from earnings regressions, and columns 5-6 present output
     from occupation premium regressions. Columns 1 and 5 present the returns to each advanced degree by each BA eld from the FE-cg regression. Column 2 presents the returns
     from the FE-cg regression on the full sample. Columns 3 and 6 present the OLS estimates. Column 4 presents       g1-28 ,   the average of return to each advanced degree by BA
     eld from 1 to 28 years of post advanced degree experience.    A detailed explanation of the construction of these averages is provided in the notes for Table B7.    Column 7
     presents the observation-level cell count of pre advanced degree earnings observations for the FE-cg earnings regression (col. 1), which is the regression with smallest sample
     among all regressions reported in this table. Column 8 presents the individual-level cell count of the same regression, which counts multiple observations of one individual as
     one. Unweighted cell counts are rounded to the nearest 10.
