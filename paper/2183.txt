1. Introduction.

     The assumption of rational choice is a cornerstone of modern economic

theory. Rational choice requires that individuals correctly value their

present and future resources, that they make consistent decisions, and that

they obey the axiom of revealed preference. This paper presents the results

of an experimental study of consumption in which subjects were asked to make

consumption decisions under hypothetical economic conditions. The questions

in the experiment are designed to test the assumption of rational choice and

to elicit information about preferences. The subjects' responses suggest a

widespread inability to make coherent and consistent consumption decisions.

Errors in consumption decision—making appear to be substantial and, in many

cases, systematic. In addition, the experiment's data strongly reject the

standard life cycle model of consumption choice.

     The principal specific findings of the laboratory experiment are as

follows: i) Subjects displayed significant inconsistencies in their

consumption decisions; each of the subjects, in at least two pairs of

economically identical situations, chose consumption values that differed by

20 percent or more. From the perspective of the standard life cycle model,

error in decision—making accounts, on average, for roughly half of the

variation in individual consumption choices. (ii) A sizeable fraction of

subjects valued discounted future earnings less than present assets. iii)

Almost all subjects exhibited oversaving behavior, apparently because they

underestimated the power of compound interest. iv) The hypotheses that

intertemporal consumption preferences are either homothetic or uniform across

individuals are strongly rejected. v) Consumption choice is only weakly

correlated with subjects' stated intertemporal preferences.

     In recent years an increasing body of research in experimental economics

has sought to test many of the basic axioms of economic theory. Important
                                        —2-—



experimental studies of rational decision—making include those of Allais and

Hagen (1979), Grether and Plott (1979), Kahneman and Tversky (1979), and

Tversky and Kahneman (1974). Laboratory exeriments have been used to study

market and non—market institutions including competitive markets (Smith,

1967), oligopolistic price setting (Plott, 1982), public goods mechanisms

(Smith, 1982), auctions, (Cox, Smith, and Walker, 1985), and bargaining and

negotiation procedures (Samuelson and Bazerman, 1985). To our knowledge,

however, this is the first experiment of consumption behavior.

     Our   laboratory   experiment tests directly the life cycle model of saving

(Modigliani and Brumberg, 1954; Ando and Modigliani, 1963). A large body of

theoretical and empirical research is based on the life cycle model. Its

influence on research and macro economic policy notwithstanding, tests of the

life cycle model with field data have proven inconclusive for reasons of data

quality, inability to identify the consumer unit, incomplete knowledge of the

consumer unit's information set, and lack of information about financial and

other constraints confronting the consumer. It has proved particularly

difficult to test directly the model's most basic assumption of intertemporal

optimization by consumers. Recourse to experimental testing is, therefore,

attractive because it alleviates a host of data and information problems.

     The experiment was implemented by an interactive computer program in

which subjects key in consumption choices in response to a series of

questions. Forty—nine subjects (MBA students and undergraduates at Boston

University) were paid to participate in the life—cycle simulation. Subjects

were asked what consumption choices they would make if they were single,

faced no uncertainty, had specified levels of future earnings and current

assets, knew their ages of retirement and death, and could borrow and save at

a specified interest rate.
                                     —3--



     The experiment presents subjects with two kinds of decision tasks.     In

Parts I, II, and VI of the experiment subjects are asked to make consumption

and savings decisions year by year over their life cycle (from age 35 until

death at age 75). In the other parts of the experiment subjects made single

year consumption choices under varying economic conditions (asset levels,

earnings, interest rates). With the experiment's data one can examine

whether subjects tend to over— or under—save, whether subjects make identical

consumption choices in economically equivalent (but different) situations,

whether preferences are homothetic, and whether the present value of labor

earnings and current assets, which together constitute the present value of

resources, have an equal impact on consumption spending.

     As experimental economists (see Vernon Smith, 1982) have forcefully

argued, in certain respects experimental data permit more effective tests of

theoretical models than does field data. The advantages of experimental

analysis are those of control and measurement: the experimenter can control

perfectly the exogenous economic environment and can measure all relevant

economic variables without error. Since field data is subject to measurement

errors and lack of controls, it may be difficult or impossible to determine

from nonexperimental data whether changes in behavior are due to differences

in preferences or economic circumstances as opposed to non—optimizing

behavior.

     The countervailing criticism of the experimental approach, of course, is

that individual behavior in laboratory experiments may differ from real world

decision—making. Vernon Smith (1982) uses the term aparallelismn to denote

the extent to which the laboratory setting mimics the real world. In our

view, the parallelism issue in our experimental setting is a matter of

degree. Certainly our experimental setting is far simpler than the real
                                     -4-


world setting. However, parallelism need not be diminished (indeed, it may

be enhanced) by simplification as long as the main factors affecting behavior

 in actual practice are captured in the design of the experiment. Though

simplified, the description of the life—cycle setting contained in the

experiment certainly resembles the kind of consumption and saving choices

faced by individuals in their own lives.

     Granted that the settings are parallel, it is obvious that both the

analytical resources available to the individual and his
                                                            decision—making
incentives may differ between the experiment and the real world.      In making
real world consumption and saving choices individuals have more time and

incentive to consider their decisions and to revise them.    They also have the

option to avail themselves of expert advice and observe the behavior of their

friends and relatives. On the other hand, real world intertemporal

optimization problems are far more complex than those presented in our

experiment. They involve a variety of uncertainties and financial

constraints, problems of joint utility maximization in the case of families,

and significant problems of information updating.   Furthermore, our own

casual empiricism suggests that individuals do not freely discuss their

saving decisions, that the number who consult accountants and other

professionals on these matters is relatively small, and that many individuals

make their decisions without significant analysis. Thus, in providing

responses to the experiment's questions, subjects may be acting quite

similarly to the way they would act if actually faced with the comparable

situation in the real world. Hence, experimental analysis may shed

considerable light on actual consumption and saving decisions.

         The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a summary

and review of the testable implications of the life cycle model of
                                            —5—


consumption under certainty. Section 3 describes the design of the

experiment and the subject population, and Section 4 presents the main

results. Section 5 summarizes the findings and indicates our plans for

additional experimental research on consumption.



2. Testable ImDlicptions of the Life Cycle Model Under Certainty.

      The life cycle model under certainty posits that an individual chooses

his consumption spending over his lifetime to maximize a concave utility

function:


(1)         U —   U(Cl,...,Cd)   subject to


            d      j
(2)         ECjwR5—Ai/R1+H1
            j—1 s—2


where Cj is consumption at age j, d is the age of death, R5 —        l/(l+r5)   where

r5 is the interest rate at time s, A1 is initial assets, and H1 is the

present value of labor earnings (human wealth) as of age 1.

      The fundamental presumption of this intertemporal optimization problem

is that the individual's life—time consumption and savings decisions are made

without error. Thus, in an experimental setting that imposes constraint (2).

a subject should make consumption decisions in precise accordance with life—

cycle predictions. two      implications,     stated as hypotheses, follow

immediately from the general model.



      Hypothesis i: The individual should exhaust his resources at the time
      of his death (there are no left—over assets).

      Hypothesis ii: An individual's consumption choice in a given year
      depends directly on the present value of resources and is Independent of
      the mix of assets and the present value of life—time labor earnings.
                                              —6—



In addition, if consumption at each age is a normal good we have:

        Hypothesis iii: An increase in the present value of resources leads to
        increases in consumption at each age.

      If the utility function is homothetic and time separable, utility can be

written as:



(3)            U —v(C1) + fiv(C2) +       +



where   fi   — l/(l+6),    and 6 is the individuals time preference rate. In this

case, the individual's optimal consumption expenditure at age j can be

expressed as:


                              d   $
  (4)          Cj —   FVRj/t S    w Rih(Rj/$)]
                             s—j i—j+1


where PVRj is the present value of resources at age j • and where the function

h( ) is the marginal rate of substitution between consumption at different

dates, i.e.,



(5)           C5..1/c5 —




From (4) and (5), one sees that the assumption of separable utility implies

the following strengthening of hypothesis iii:


       Hypothesis ilib: With the time path of the interest rate held constant,
       consumption in a given year is proportional to the present value of
       resources as of that date. Equivalently, the average and marginal
       propensities to consume are equal and independent of the level of PVRj.

       Hypothesis iiic: If the interest rate is constant an individual's
       average and marginal propensities to consume are increasing functions of
       age.
                                           —7—




Hypothesis       iiic holds since when the interest rate is constant the right—hand

side divisor in (4) is a smaller sum the larger is the initial age j at which

the summation       begins.
           Finally, in the case that the utility function is of the isoelastic form



(6)             v(C5) — c5l—A/(l_A)



expression (5) can be rewritten in logs as



(5')            log(C51/C5) — —1/Alogfl + 1/AlogR51.



In this instance, one can regress the log of the ratio of consumption in

adjacent periods on a constant plus an the log of R5..1 and, thereby, estimate

ft   and   A.




3. Descrittion of the ExDeriment.

       The life—cycle experiments were conducted at Boston University in three

sessions using paid student volunteers as subjects. The majority of subjects

were MBA students; the others were undergraduate business majors and graduate

economic students. There was no time limit for completing the computerized

questionnaire. Most subjects took about an hour and a half to finish; some

finished within an hour, and some took as long as two      hours.   Collaboration

of any kind and the use of calculators were prohibited. Sixty students

completed the questionnaire. However, eleven questionnaires were excluded

from the analysis either because they contained key punch errors or because

the subject failed to complete one or more sections. Therefore, the results

to be discussed are based, in most cases, upon 49 sets of responses.
                                     —8—


     It was strongly and repeatedly emphasized at the beginning of the

experiment that subjects do their best to respond to all questions on the

basis of what would make them most happy given the situation described.

Furthermore, subjects were told that if they were conscientious in expressing

their true preferences they would receive a bonus at the end of the

experiment. In Parts I and II of the questionnaire, subjects were reminded

that they should attempt to spend all of their earnings over their lifetimes.

The Appendix reproduces the experimental questionnaire as well as the

instructions.

     The questionnaire's basic economic setting can be summarized as follows.

The individual in the experiment has just turned 35 and will live to his 75th

birthday on which day he dies (with certainty). In his job he earns an

annual salary of $25,000 until he retires on his 65th birthday —   that   is, he

works for thirty years and is retired for ten. The individual can save or

borrow as much money as he wishes at 4 percent interest. Subjects were

instructed that in the questionnaire setting there is no inflation,

deflation, or taxes, no dependents to support, no current or potential health

problems, and no uncertainty about the future. All durable goods are rented

by the year. Finally, it was assumed that annual consumption expenditures

occur and the labor earnings are received on January 1st of each year and

that the individual's birthday is also January 1st.

     The computer questionnaire consists of eight parts soliciting annual

consumption spending choices for various combinations of age, assets,

interest rates, future earnings, and retirement ages. In total, each subject

makes 145 such choices. Part I asks the subject to specify his desired level

of consumption spending for each year from age 35 to 75. In this section,

the subject receives no feedback concerning the level of assets accumulating
                                     —9—


 (at 4% interest) in his savings account. Part II solicits the same

information, but updates the subject's asset position before each annual

consumption decision is made.

     In Parts III through V subjects are asked to make consumption choices

for four ages — 35, 46, 55, and 69 — under
                                           varying economic conditions.       li-i



Part III subjects report consumption choices at these ages at different

levels of assets (with future earnings unchanged). Part IV varies the

individual's retirement age (with the level of assets and annual earnings

fixed). Part V varies the stream of earnings (with assets and the age of

retirement fixed.) In Parts VI and VII subjects report consumption decisions

under varying interest rates. Finally, Part VIII asks subjects to rank in

order of preference five life—time consumption profiles.

     In all parts, except Part I, subjects were prompted to make their

consumption decisions sequentially, i.e. although they were allowed to modify

a current response, they were not allowed to return to modify previously

given answers. In addition, subjects were prohibited (and prevented by the

computer program) from returning and changing any previously completed part
of the experiment.

     Several economic situations were repeated more than once to permit tests

of consistency in the subjects' choices. For example, in Part III subjects

were asked to choose consumption spending at ages 35, 46, 55, and 69 given

the same amount of assets and same lifetime earnings they had at those ages

in Part II. In this, as in other cases of exactly identical circumstances,

subjects were not alerted to the fact that the circumstances were identical.

Other pairs of situations, while not precisely the same, presented the

subjects with the same present value of resources (assets plus the present

value of future earnings) at the same age, but differed in the relative
                                     —P10—



contribution of assets and earnings to total resources. In addition, several

pairs had the same level of assets and present value of labor earnings1 but

differed with respect to the life—time profile of earnings.

     Subjects were asked to make nine consumption decisions at age 35. three

pairs of which had the same present value of resources. For age forty—six,

there were thirteen decisions, including four pairs with the sane present

value of resources. For age 55 there were nine decisions, including four

pairs with the same resources, and for age 69 there were seven decisions,

including one pair with the sane resources.

     Listed below is a brief summary of the eight parts of the consumption

experiment.



Part I—Annual Consumption Choices Without Feedback

In this section the subject is asked to choose the level of annual

consumption spending for each year from age 35 to age 74, inclusive (40

choices in all). The subject is allowed to modify his consumption choices

until he is satisfied with them, but throughout he receives no information

about his accumulated balance in his savings account.



Fart TI—Annual Consumption Choices With Savinzs Feedback

Again, the subject reports his annual consumption expenditure for each year

from age 35 to age 74, inclusive. In contrast to Part I, however, the

subject is informed of the accumulated balance in his savings account at the

time he must make his next year's consumption choice. Consumption choices

are made in chronological order —   that   is, the subject is not permitted to

change an earlier consumption choice.
                                                  —11—



 Part   Ill—Consumption with Specified Assets at Selected Ates

 Here the subject is presented with sixteen age/asset pairs and is asked to

 choose the level of consumption spending at that age given the specified

balance in hit savings account. The following are the age/asset pairs.




                     Age

            35       46           55          69

*Assets in D were set equal to accumulated assets at the same    age in Part II.



Part IV—Cortsumntion With         Different   Retirement Ates

This section varies the retirement age and assets. The subject is asked to

choose his consumption spending at age 46 assuming the following retirement

ages and asset levels.



         Assets      Retirement Ate

A.        500000             72

B.        100000             56

C.        100000             61

Part V—ConsumDtjon With Different Lifetime Earnings
In   this part subjects are presented with ten different earnings

profile/asset/age coabinations and asked to choose consumption expenditure in

each case.

                                                  Age



                                    35          46         55     69

*The three numbers are the annual earnings in the three decades of work: ages

35—44, 45—54, and 55—64, respectively.



Part VT—Consumption At Different Interest Rates

Here the subject chooses consumption at age 46 given assets of $90,000 at

each of S interest rates (0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8%).



Fart VTI—Consun,ption With Chanzinz   Interest Rate
The subject is asked to choose his consumption spending in each year between

age 45 and age 75, with the annual interest rate varying according to the

chart below. The subject initially has $50,000 in his savings account at age

45, and his asset balance is updated each year.

Part VITI—flankine Different Lifetime Consujnr,tion Profiles

The participant is asked to rank, in order of preference, five different

lifetime consumption profiles each of which is financially feasible, i.e.

exactly exhausts his resources at age 75. The profiles assume that the

individual begins his working life at age 35 with no initial assets and earns

$25,000 of labor income each year until retirement at age 65.

       1. $21,841 per year, every year.

       2. $16,008 at age 35, growing by 2% per year thereafter.

4. Exverimental Results.

        This section presents first some general features of the data, many

of which accord with predictions of the life cycle model. One central

feature of the data is the extent of heterogeneity in consumption choices.

Next we discuss the extent of inconsistent choice and explore the degree to

which consumption errors are systematic. Subsection c considers the evidence

on normality and homotheticity and presents more formal tests of the standard

life cycle model. Subsection d considers the extent of over—saving.

Subsection e examines the correlation between actual consumption choices in

Part II and Part Viii's preferred options among a group of alternative

feasible consumption paths. The final subsection indicates what rates of

time preference and intertemporal elasticities of substitution might be

inferred from these data.

a. Summary of ConsumDtion Behavior

     Figure 1 displays the average level of consumption chosen by the 49

subjects at each age in Part II (with savings feedback). The dotted lines

represent a band of oneS standard deviation in consumption responses at each

age. The large size of these standard deviations indicates considerable

diversity of consumption choices. Table 1 reports the data depicted in

Figure 1. Listed is the average consumption profile as well as the

coefficient of variation, the minimum and maximum responses, and the levels

of consumption at the 25th and 75th percentiles of the consumption

distribution.

        The average consumption expenditure rises throughout the course of

the life—cycle. Average consumption spending first exceeds $25,000, the

amount of annual earnings, in the first year of retirement. The growth of

average consumption is slow prior to retirement and very substantial after

retirement; the ratio of average consumption at age 44 to average consumption

at age 35 is 1.11. In contrast, the age 74 to age 65 ratio is 2.01. This

end of life rapid growth of consumption appears to be the result of over—

saving. Although their asset balance is updated year by year. subjects do

not appear to appreciate fully the amount of assets they are accumulating.

Thus, in the last years of their life, they play "catch up".

        There are sizable differences in saving behavior across subjects.

The coefficient of variation averages nearly 20 percent from age 35 to 57 and

increases steadily and substantially thereafter. Another measure of

dispersion is the ratio of the 75th percentile consumption choice to the 25th

percentile consumption choice. This ratio is 1.33 at age 35, 1.16 at age 45,

1.16 at age 55, 1.75 at age 65, and 2.50 at age 74. A third measure is the

ratio of the maximum to the minimum consumption choice. This ration is 2.60

at age 35, 1.67 at age 45, 2.00 at age 55, 5.56 at age 65, and 104.00 at age

74. This increase with age in the dispersion of the consumption distribution

suggests that not all subjects over—saved; some may have under—saved and

those that oversaved may have over—saved in different degrees.

        Table 2 presents summary data on subject consumption choices for the

representative ages 35, 46, 55, and 69 as reported in Parts Ill—V of the

experiment. Recall that in these parts of the experiment each subject is

asked for consumption choices at particular ages given an exogenously

specified level of assets, a time path of future earnings, and a retirement

age. The interest rate is 4 percent throughout these parts of the

experiment. The Table lists

average APCs and MPCs as well as key percentiles of the APC and MPC

distributions at the four ages. Table 2 also indicates APCs for benchmark

cases corresponding to lifetime consumption paths with —2%, 0%, 2%, and 4%

constant yearly growth.

           As predicted by the Life Cycle Model, the average APCs increase with

age (Hypothesis iiic). The dispersion of APCs, measured by the ratio of the

15th to the 25th percentile is largest at age 69, where it is 1.37. This is

somewhat surprising; one might expect less difficulty and more similarity in

consumption choice after retirement because the present value of future labor

earnings need not be computed.

           The average MPCs are similar in magnitude to the average APCs,

however, the dispersion of MPCs is much greater.         The median MPCs are

smaller than the median APCs at each age; at ages 55 and 69 the differences

are sizeable.

            The variation across subjects in APCs appears to be systematic. A

 total of 17 of the 49 subjects recorded APC's
                                                    above the Table 2 averages for
 all 4 ages; 14 other subjects exceeded the average in 3 of 4 cases. At the

 other extreme1 15 subjects recorded consumption below the average in three or

 more cases. In short, the population of subjects appears to be divided into

 two    distinct   groups of "big" and "small" savers.

 b. Inconsistencies and Errors in Consumot ion Choice

           Hypothesis ii states that individuals should make the same

 consumption choice when facing the same present value of resources and the

 same interest rate. We tested this hypothesis by constructing in Parts TI—V

 17 pairs of situations in which subjects faced identical economic resources

 (at a 4% interest rate). Table 3 lists the percentage difference between

each subject's chosen consumption expenditure for each economically

equivalent (EE) situation. Percentage differences are computed in this Table

with the second minus the first case in the numerator and the first case in

the denominator. To illustrate, the first column compares the subject's

consumption choice in Part II at age 35 to his later choice made at the same

age and given the same economic circumstances in Part III question d. The

percentage errors of all subjects are listed in ascending order for each EE

pair.

           For all but three of the 17 EE cases in Table 3 the average absolute

error exceeds 20%. Clearly, this constitutes stong evidence of widespread

consumption inconsistency and strongly contradicts hypothesis ii. Moreover,

consumption errors are widespread across the subjects. As documented in

Table 4 each of the 49 subjects made at least two large consumption mistakes
— an error in excess of 20% in absolute value. Thirty—seven of the 49

subjects made 5 or more large consumption errors in the 17 cases. Thirty—

          A closer examination of Table 3 and the summary                information   in Table

3a indicates that many of the consumption errors are systematic. Consider,

for example, the age 35 comparison of Part Ill—C with Part V—C. In Ill—C the

asset level is $130,000, while it is $65,000 in V—C. Since total resources

are equal in the two    cases   the ratio of the present value of earnings to

total resources is greater in V—C. In addition, the timing of labor earnings

differs. In Ill—C the earnings path is a constant $25,000 until retirement.

In V—C it is $20,700 from age 35 to age 44, $31,000 from age 45 to age 54,

and $42,500 from age 55 to age 64. Taking Ill—C as the base, the median

percentage change in consumption between Ill—C and V—C is negative 25

percent. Of the 30 subjects who answered these two questions (V—C was added

after some initial experiments were conducted), only 3 had nonnegative errors

(i.e., they increased their consumption from Ill—C to V—C). Some of the

errors are quite sizable; 3 subjects reduced their consumption choice by more

than 50 percent although they were in exactly the same economic choice

situation.

          The age 35 comparison of Ill—B with V—A also involves an increase in

the earnings—resource ratio. Again, the median percentage errnr is negative;
                                     —24—


it is negative 20 percent. In this case 10 of the 49 subjects reduced their

consumption by 50 percent or more in switching from the Ill—B circumstances

to the V—A circumstances. The age 35 v—B and Ill—B comparison is quite

similar; here the earnings to resource ratio falls, and while the median

error is zero, the mean is .29, with 12 of 49 errors in excess of positive SO

percent. Overall, in 8 of 10 type 2 cases in which the earnings to resource

ratio changes, the average error has the opposite sign of the change in the

earnings to resource ratio.

        In the age 35 comparison of V—A and V—B the earnings to resources

ratio is unchanged. Compared with V—B, earnings in V—A occur earlier in the

life cycle. Again, there seems to be an undervaluation of future earnings.

In this case the median consumption error in switching to V—B is positive 25

percent, and 20 of 49 subjects increase their consumption by 30 percent or

more.




c. Normality. }iomotheticity. and Repression Tests of the Standard Life

    Cycle Model

        The standard life cycle model assumes that preferences are homothetic

and time separable implying that consumption at a given age is proportional

to the present value of resources (hypothesis iiib). Thus, the elasticity of

consumption at each age with respect to the present value of resources should

equal unity. To test the standard model we calculated income elasticities

for each subject between each pair of observations of consumption at specific

ages. In this analysis we treated pairs of observations with identical

resources as a single observation with the level of consumption equal to the

average of the two choices.

        For each subject there are 10 income elasticities at age 35, 28 at
                                              —25—



age 46, 10 at age 55, and 15 at age 69. Table S indicates for each age the

distribution of elasticities across all subjects by the size of the

elasticities. The fraction of elasticities that are negative are .30 at age

35, .25 at age 46, .43 at age 55, and .25 at age 69. These fractions are

sizeable and raise serious doubt about the validity of the normality

assumption. It is particularly surprising that normality is violated so

frequently at age 69; at this age the subjects are retired and need consider

only their assets. A number of subjects repeatedly violated normality. For

example in their age 55 responses 17 of the 49 subjects have negative income

elasticities in a quarter or more of the possible cases; 7 of these 17 have

negative income elasticities in half or more of the possible cases.

              The negative income elasticities obviously contradict the

homotheticity assumption. Moreover, the positive elasticities are also often

far from unity. Indeed, at age 35 only 13 percent of the calculated

elasticities fall between .75 and 1.25, and at age 46 it is also only 13

percent; it is only 9 percent at age 55; and it is only 19 percent at age 69.

             Another test of the standard life cycle model is provided by

estimating a regression equation at each age of the form:

       (7)              C—a+7R+u,
where K denotes the present value of lifetime resources, and u is an error

term. Finding a significant regression intercept leads to a rejection of the
                                     —26-.




 homotheticity assumption. Separate regressions were estimated for each

 subject at each of the ages 35, 46, 55, and 69.    The number of observations

 (i.e., resource and consumption pairs) for the regressions at these ages are

 9, 13, 9, and 6 respectively.

         The results of these regressions show that
                                                      a significant minority of
 subjects displayed non—homothetic consumption behavior.    At age 35, the
hypothesis of a zero intercept was rejected at the 5 percent significance

 level in 10 cases (of 49), at age 46 in 24 cases, at 55 in 4 cases, and at

 age 69 in 8 cases. The age 46 regressions contained the largest number of

observations (16 compared to the next largest number 10). Of the 196

estimated constants (49x4), 36 intercepts
                                             were significantly positive while

only 10 were significantly negative. Thus, for the bulk of non—proportional

subjects, the predicted APC falls with income.

        An additional test of homotheticity was conducted
                                                            by including a
quadratic term in the value of resources as an independent variable in the

regressions. Of a total of 196 regressions the coefficient on squared

resources was significant (at the 5 percent level) in 24 cases. Thus, there

appears to be evidence of some nonlinear consumption behavior.

        Retaining the linear specification, a test that consumption is

independent of the mix of resources (hypothesis ii) can be conducted
                                                                       by
estimating regressions of the form

(8)        C— a+o1A+o2E+u,
where A denotes the subject's accumulated savings to date, and E denotes the

present value of his future earnings. Of course, the irrelevance of the mix

of resources implies that ci should equal 02. We estimated (8) separately

for ages 35,46, and 55 (at age 69 future earnings were zero). Table 6

presents a summary of the distribution of assets and earnings coefficients.
                                           —27—



          In 85 percent of the cases (124 of 147 regressions), the earnings and

assets coefficients are both positive as predicted by the life—cycle model.

The coefficient on assets exceeded that on earnings in slightly more than

half of the 147 regressions. In total, 41 of 147 (or 28%) of the regressions

displayed coefficients that are statistically different from one another at

the 5 percent level. In these 41 cases the coefficient on assets exceed that

on earnings 25 times. Finally, there is only a single, insignificant asset

coefficient (which is negative), but 16 negative earnings coefficients 8 of

which are significant. It appears from these results that a significant

minority of subjects undervalue earnings relative to assets, while a somewhat

smaller minority overvalue earnings. Table 6 summarizes these findings and

presents the age—specific results.

          Tables 7a — 7d consider whether nonhomotheticity and the resource mix

are significant in pooled regression analysis. The Table displays the

coefficients of four regression models estimated for the four key ages with

the data pooled across all subjects. Model A explains consumption only in

terms of total resources. Model B differs from A by the addition of an

intercept. Model C modifies B by entering assets and earnings separately.
                                     —28—



Model D adds the squares of assets and earnings and the product of assets and

earnings.

        The model B intercepts in each of the four Tables, 7a through 7d, are

highly significant. Thus these pooled regressions reject the homotheticity

hypothesis. The model B coefficients on resources also contradict the Life

Cycle Model's prediction that the marginal propensity to consume increases

with age. Although all are insignificant, the coefficients at ages 35, 46,

55, and 69 display no strong positive correlation with age.

        Given that an intercept belongs in the relation between consumption

and resources, is it also the case that earnings and assets enter with the

same coefficient? i.e., do subjects value equally a dollar in assets and a

dollar in human wealth? According to F tests of model B vs. C, reported in

Table 8, the assumption of equal valuation of assets and earnings is strongly

rejected for the pooled age 35 data, but accepted for the pooled age 46 and

pooled age 55 data. In the age 35 model C regression, the assets coefficient

is over seven times greater than the earnings coefficient. These results may

reflect an inability of subjects to discount properly far distant earnings

streams; i.e., at ages 46 and 55 the future earnings streams extend for a

shorter interval than at age 35.

        The results on model C reinforce a view of undervaluation of future

earnings. The APC is negatively related to the earnings to resources ratio

at each of the three ages 35, 46, and 55. The earnings to resources

coefficient is highly significant at ages 35 and 46. Hence, the larger the

share of the present value of earnings in total resources, the smaller the

average propensity to consume.

        One   may also   question whether higher order powers of assets and

earnings help explain consumption. As indicated in Table 8 (In the C vs. D F

test) these additional variables are jointly significant for the age 35 and

the age 46 regressions. Table 8 also reports the results of a Chow test,

assuming model B, indicating whether it is appropriate to pool the data.

Pooling the data is very strongly rejected for each of the four ages; i.e.,

there is very significant heterogeneity in individual model B regression

coefficients.

        A final way to evaluate the performance of the standard life cycle

model is in terms of R bar square. If the model is correct, the R bar

squares in the regressions of consumption against resources (Model A) should

be unity. This is far from the case. Table 9 reports the distribution of R

bar squares from subject—specific regressions for several of the models of

Tables 7a — 7d for each of the four reference ages. For a large
                                                                percentage
of subjects the standard time—separable homothetic model, model A, explains

only a modest fraction of the total variance in consumption choice. For

example, at age 46 one half of the R bar squares are below .5; 30 percent

fall below .25. The R bar squares for models C and D are somewhat higher,

but even for model D at least a third of the R bar squares at each age are

less than .75.



d. Evidence of Over—Savin2

        Perhaps the most severe challenge to accurate choice is posed in the

year—by—year consumption decisions of Parts I and II. Recall that in Part I,

subjects make their year—by—year decisions without feedback (i.e. without any

information concerning the accumulated balance in their savings account). In

Part II, subjects received this feedback year—by—year. Clearly, the

information provided in Part II better conforms to the information available

in wreal world" consumption and saving decisions. Our         objective   in studying

the non—feedback settings was to gain insight into subjects' abilities to

discount and also to compare consumption choices with and without asset

feedback.

          In Part I the overwhelming majority of subjects left significant

positive asset balances at the conclusion of their lives. While the average

value of age 74 consumption chosen is $25,709. the average value of assets

unspent at age 75 is an astounding $250,000.          Overall, 36 of 46 subjects
                                      —33-.



 (three subjects' responses to Part I were invalidated by key punch errors)

 left balances at age 75 in excess of $50,000; nearly two thirds of the

subjects left assets in excess of $200,000, and over one third left assets in

excess of 5300.000.

        Table 10 lists the amount of assets not spent by the end of life in

Part I in ascending order in the first column. The second column considers

the subjects in the same order as the first column and indicates the level of

consumption at age 74 chosen by the subjects in Part I. The third column

gives the ratio of the first to the second column. The forth column

expresses the present value of the amount of end of life unspent resources as

a percent of the initial age 35 present value of resources. The
                                                                  average
ratio of unspent end of life assets to age 74 consumption is 13.97, and the

median ratio is 13.26. In total, 28 of the 46 subjects who answered Part I

failed to spend 10 percent or more of their lifetime resources; 9 of the 46

failed to spend 20 percent or more of their lifetime resources; and 2 of the

46 failed to spend 30 percent or more.

        Further suggestion of oversaving comes from comparing the age

consumption profiles of Part I with those of Part II. Figure 2 displays the

two profiles of one of the subjects. Note that the Part I profile is

generally below the Part II profile. In the initial working years the two

profiles closely track one another. In later years, after observing a

significant amount of accumulated assets in Part II, the subject rapidly

readjusts his consumption spending upward.

        Though consumption behavior varies markedly across subjects, the

general characteristics of Figure 2 are quite similar for many subjects. For

36 of 48 subjects, Part II consumption profiles exceed Part I profiles for

all but a small number of years. A quantitative measure of the relative

consumption behavior with and without feedback is provided by
                                                                comparing

accumulated savings at a given age. At age 69, 44 of 48 subjects had

significantly smaller asset balances in Part II than in Part I. In Part II,

the average level of age 69 assets was $250,000; in Part I it was $350,000.

        With the benefit of asset feedback in Part II, subjects exhibited

what might be termed "adaptive" consumption behavior. However, even in Part

II it is clear that subjects did not succeed in choosing optimal consumption

profiles. Rather they appear to oversave in the early stages of their

working lives and then engage in rapid spending especially during their last

10 to 15 years. To illustrate this point, we calculated for Part II the

number of years of age 64 consumption that could be financed by the subject's

age 65 assets. If the individual's aim was to have constant consumption over

the last decade of life, then his age 65 assets would be sufficient only to

finance 10 years of the age 64 consumption level. In fact, for a significant

minority of the subjects age 65 assets are sufficient to finance their age 6L4

level of consumption for many more than 10 years.

        Table 11 presents the Part II consumption choices of subjects in the

last 10 years of life. The Table's first column lists in ascending order the

level of assets at age 65; the second column presents the corresponding age

64 level of consumption; the third column presents the largest level of

consumption over the remaining ten years, age 65 through 74. The forth

column gives the number of years of consumption at the age 64 level that

could be financed with age 65 assets.
                                      —36—


         A total of 29 of the 49 subjects had assets at age 65 that could

 finance 10 or more years of their age 64 level of consumption; 9 had

 sufficient resources to finance 20 or more years of age 64 consumption; and 5

had enough assets at age 65 to finance 30 or more years of age 64

consumption. Those subjects who could finance 20 or more years of age 64

consumption realized at some point in their remaining 10 years of Part II

that they had sizeable amounts of assets at which point they dramatically

adjusted upward their consumption. A comparison of columns two and three of

the Table indicates that the high savers (those for whom column 5 exceeds

20), for at least one of their remaining 10 years, chose a consumption level

that, on average, equaled 6.5 times their age 64 consumption.



e. Comparisons of Actual Consumption Choices with Expressed Preferences

        Recall that in Part VIII subjects were asked to rank in order of

preference five feasible consumption profiles: a constant profile, profiles

with 2%, 4%, and —2% annual growth, and a step function with $23,000 in

annual consumption prior to retirement and $10,000 thereafter.   A natural

question is whether the life cycle consumption paths chosen by subjects in

Part II are consistent with their preference rankings reported in Part VIII.

In principal, one would like to have precise information about each
                                                                      subject's
utility function. But the difficulty in eliciting such information makes

that approach impractical. Instead, we compare a given subject's actual

constamption choice with his preference ranking of the Part VIII alternatives.

        Table 12 indicates the fraction of subjects listing each profile as

their first or second ranked alternative. Three quarters of all subjects

listed the 2% growth path as their first or second choice. The constant path

is next in popularity, followed by the 4% growth path. The great majority of

subjects also displayed "single peake& preferences, choosing as their second

profile choice a profile close to their first choice.

        It is interesting to compare the Part II profiles chosen by subjects

with their consumption profile rankings. A useful measure of the closeness

of these choices is the average annual absolute percentage difference between

the Part II profile and the most preferred Part VIII. For those whose first

choice in VIII is a constant profile the mean percentage deviation is 15

percent; for those with first choice profiles of 2%, 4%, —2%, and the step

function the mean deviations are 21 percent, 25 percent, 37 percent, and 46

percent. These mean percentage differences are quite large.

        A second comparison of consumption choice with Part VIII expressed

preferences is summarized in Table 13. The second row of this Table lists

the number of subjects whose actual Part II choices came closest in terms of

mean percentage error to their top ranked choice in VIII. The third row

lists the number of subjects whose consumption choice more closely resembles

their second ranked profile in VIII, and so on. It is clear that many

subjects failed to choose profiles that came closest to their ranking in

VIII; only 19 of 48 subjects chose in II a profile that came closest to their
                                           —39—

f. Estimates of Time Preference Rates and Intertemnoral Elasticities of

     Substitution

           The time preference rate and the intertemporal elasticity of

substitution are key parameters in standard analyses of the supply of savings

and the efficiency gains from tax reform (see, for example, Summers, 1981 and

Auerbach and Icotlikoff, 1987). Estimates as large as 18 percent for the rate

of time preference have been reported by Hausman (1979), but most estimates

appear to center around 1.5 percent (Lawrence, 1986). In the case of the

intertemporal elasticity of substitution, the majority of estimates range

from .2 to .5 (Auerbach, Kotlikoff, and Skinner, 1983). These parameters

have often been estimated assuming homothetic, time separable preferences.

While our data reject such preferences, it is still useful to determine

whether estimates of these parameters based on experimental data are in

accord with those based on actual data. If they were substantially different

one would presumably be more skeptical of the quality of these experimental

data.

           We can calculate these preference parameters using the data from Part
                                     -.40—




VII which asked subjects to choose a time path of consumption in the presence

of time varying interest rates. Estimation of (5') based on the pooled data

yields an estimate of .376 for the intertemporal elasticity of substitution

and .018 for the time preference rate. The standard error of the elasticity

of substitution is .578; given the estimate of the elasticity of

substitution, a standard error in the intercept of (5') implies values of the

time preference rate ranging from —.042 to .081.

        The individual estimates of (5') are, however, significantly

different from the pooled estimates. The F test determining whether

individual coefficients in the regression of equation (5') equal the pooled

coefficients is significant at the .003 percent level.

     Estimating (5') separately for each subject yields only three

significant estimates of the intertemporal substitution elasticity. A total

of 24 of 49 substitution elasticities are negative; of the remaining 25

elasticities only 3 are less than .5; 15 exceed 1. Of the 49 estimates of

the rate of time preference, 4 are negative; 18 are between zero and .03; and

5 exceed .10.



Section 5. Consumytion Choices and Demographic Characteristics

        One way to exhibit differences by demographic groups in consumption

choices is to regress APCs against characteristics. Table 14 reports the

coefficients from such regressions for ages 35, 46, 55, and 69 where all the

data in Parts II through V which assume a 4 percent interest rate are pooled.

The demographic variables include dummy variables for males, italian, jewish,

catholic, asian, hispanic, and black and others. There are also dummies for

the income position of the subject's parents. "Poor Parents" and "Rich

Parent" are dummies for subjects with parents who they consider to be in
                                          —41—


 lower income and upper income
                                   groups, respectively. "Exp to be Rich" is a
 dummy for subjects who expect to be in high income groups later in life. The

 excluded group is female, white protestants, with middle income parents, who

 do not expect to be in the high income group. In addition to these dummy

 variables, "age is the subject's age and "yrs coP' is the subject's number

 of years of college.

         The combined set of demographic variables
                                                      are highly significant in
all four regressions, thus adding further evidence about consumption

heterogeneity. The specific results suggest that males consume
                                                                    significantly
more than females, that asians, italians, and blacks consume less than white

protestants, that jews consume more than white protestants, and that those

with more years of college consume less than those with fewer years of

college. The significant asian dummies are not surprising, but the

coefficients on the dummies for italians, blacks, and Jews are rather

surprising.

        The last three dummy variables in the regressions are also quite

interesting. Subjects with poor parents consumed significantly more and

those with rich parents significantly less than those with middle income

parents. One may speculate that rich parents have imbued their children with

stronger saving ethics than poor parents. The insignificance of the "Exp to

be Rich" dummy suggests that subjects were able to abstract from their own

personal circumstances in responding to the experiment. If such abstraction

were quite difficult, one would expect this coefficient to be significantly

positive.

        A second interesting question is which subjects are more likely to

make consumption mistakes. A pooled regression of the absolute percentage

errors from Table 3 (   but   redefined with the smaller consumption value in the
                                          —42—



denominator) on the explanatory variables of Table 14 produced significant

positive male and jewish coefficients, and a significantly positive

coefficient on "Poor Parents". In addition, the coefficient on "Yrs of Cot"

was significantly negative.

Section 7. Summary and Conclusion

          A variety of findings in our life cycle consumption experiment raise

serious questions about the life cycle model's ability to describe

consumption choice. In their life cycle consumption choices many subjects

repeatedly made substantial errors; they chose quite different levels of

consumption in identical economic situations, and they over—saved, typically

by very sizeable amounts.        These errors are often systematic and appear to
                                    —43—


reflect a widespread inability to discount properly future earnings streams.

Many subjects clearly undervalue future earnings streams, while a smaller

number overvalue future earnings. Given these errors it is not surprising

that the standard life cycle model typically explains less than half the

variance in consumption. In addition, the experiment's data significantly

reject the hypotheses that intertemporal consumption preferences are either

homothetic or uniform across individuals. Indeed, differences in preferences

appear to be substantial and are correlated, in part, with demographic

characteristics.

        These findings have important policy implications. If large segments

of the population undervalue future income streams, then policies, such as

social security and tax cuts, will alter saving because they change the

timing of income. Thus a fully funded, actuarially fair social security

system that provides future benefits in exchange for current payroll taxes

will depress consumption and increase saving if future benefits are

undervalued. Alternatively, a cut in current income tax receipts coupled

with an equal present value increase in future income tax receipts will

stimulate consumption and lower saving.

        The findings also suggest that Keynesian models which place greater

emphasis on current relative to future income streams may better describe

actual consumption choice. But the Keynesian model, while perhaps a better

descriptive tool, is probably too naive, just as the life cycle model appears

to be too sophisticated. What is needed is a better model of choice in the

context of bounded rationality.

        We believe that experimental research on consumption choice can

provide a set of empirical regularities that will instruct the development of

models of bounded rationality. In addition, experiments incorporating policy

consumption mistakes by examining directly whether subjects can discount and

correlating mistakes in discounting with mistakes in consumption choices. A

third area of future experimental research is consumption choice under

uncertainty.

                           CONSUMPTION EXPER IMENTER

                                     Introduction

We are inferested in learning how people make
to                                                  saving decisions. We are going
   ask you how much you would choose to consume in the
                                                       following hypothethical
circumstances.

Genera]   Circumstances
You are age 35, unmarried, and about to start your first job. You will work on
this job until you retire at age 65. Each year you must decide how much money
to spend on consumption and how much money to save. When you retire your
salary will cease. After you retire you will live for 10 more years and die at
age 75.


Your   Specific Circumstances
(1)    You are single and will never get married. You have no children,
       parents, or other relatives to care for. You are going to spend all of
       your money over your lifetime on your own consumption.

(2) You face no uncertainty whatsoever about the future. You will live for
     certain until age 75. You will be in excellent health and never have to
     pay a cent for medical or dental care. You will work full time until
                                                                          age
     65 when you retire.

(3) Any money you save is deposited in your savings account and earns 4
     percent interest per year. You may borrow money at any time in which
       case you must pay 4 percent interest on your borrowings.

(4) There is never any inflation or deflation in your economy; i.e., prices
     never change.

(5) There are no taxes in your economy.
(6)    All events in your life occur on January 1. You were born on January 1.
       You get paid——in advance——for the coming year's work on January 1. You
       will retire on January 1. You receive interest on savings or pay
       interest on borrowing on Jan. 1.  In addition you make all your
       consumption expenditures for the year on January 1. You will die on
       December 31st, 2026. the day before you turn 75.

(7) Consumption expenditures include purchases of food and clothing, payment
     for vacations during the year, payment for utilities for the year, and
     rental of housing and durable goods.

(8) You always rent by the year housing as well as all durable goods like
     cars, refrigerators, furniture, stoves, televisions, air conditioners,
     etc. On January 1 of each year you pay all of the rent for the coming



                                         —1—
year. There are no movinp costs, hassle costs, or any other costs of
your renting a bigQer house or apartment or, for example, of renting a
snaller car or hic2er dishwasher.

 General

         This questionnaire has eight parts and should take from one to one and
 a half hours to complete. We recognize the
                                             experiment is somewhat lengthy but
 ask that you try to be as conscientious
                                         as possible throughout. Please take
 your time and try to answer every question thoughtfully,
                                                          on the basis of what
 would make you most happy given the situation described to you.
                                                                   We suggest
 that after you complete Part IV you take a five minute break. At that time,
 please help yourself tothe refreshments we have provided.

        If you have any questions whatsoever
                                             during the experiment, please
stop and speak to one of the proctors. We strongly
at all in doubt.                                    discourage guessing when



Summary of Your Facts of Life

1. You begin working at age 35 with no savings.

2. You retire at the end of your 64th year, so 64 is the last year you work
and earn a salary. (The only exception to this is Part IV, which varies the
retirement age.)

3. You die, with certainty, at the end of your 74th year, so 74 Is the last
year in which you can consume.

4. With the exception of Part V, you always earn a $25,000 salary each year
until you retire,

5. The interest rate is always 4% (except in Part VI and VII). Your savings
account will earn interest at that rate; you may always borrow as much as you
wish at that interest rate.

6. INTEREST COMPUTATION: Your
1.04 times the sum of your assetsassets on January 1 of any year are equal to
                                   on January 1 of the preflous year plus your
earnings on January 1 of the previous year less your consumption on January 1
of the previous year. Thus, if assets last January 1 were $10,000, earnings
were $25,000, and consumption was $23,000, then assets this January 1 would
equal 1.04 times ($10,000 + $25,000 — $23,00Q). 1.04 x $12,000 —
                                                                   $12,480.

Operating the Computer

• In responding to any question, type only numerals, no commas, dollar signs,
   decimals, etc.

• With the exception of Part I, Part VII, and Part VIII, entry of an answer
   requires two steps. First, you key the number you wish to enter and press
   the return key. Second, once you have looked at the number you have typed
   on the screen to make sure you've typed it correctly, type the ampersand
   (&—shift 7) to confirm the entry. The computer will then accept the
   answer and move on to the next question.

• If you wish to correct an entry after you have hit return, but before you
   have confirmed it with an ampersand, simply retype the number and hit
   return again.

• If you wish to correct an entry before you have hit return, use the
   backspace key (<—, upper right on the keyboard) to begin the number   again
    or to rekey part of the number.
• After you have typed the ampersand to confirm an entry, there is no way to
    correct it—so CHECK EACH ENTRY    CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU CONFIRM IT.

• If the word 'TEXT' lights up after you have hit the return key, but before
    you have confirmed with an ampersand, retype your entry.
•   At the end of the Background and Introduction screens, and at the end of
    Parts I, VII, and VIII, you must type the ampersand to advance to the next
    screen. IMPORTANT: Sometimes it will be necessary to type the ampersand
    several times, so if you've typed it and, within a second or two, have not
    advanced to the next screen, type it again.

• IMPORTANT: Q Part    II, if you accidentally confirm a number that was typed
    incorrectly,stop immediately and tell a proctor.
• On Parts I and VII, you may change any entry you wish by moving to the
   entry with the up or down arrows (to the far right of the keyboard). To
    move all the way to the beginning of these screens to review all of your
    entries, press the HOME key (next to the up arrow). DO NOT PRESS THE HOME
    KEY ON ANY OTHER PART OF THE EXPERIMENT,

PART I—ANNUAL CONSUMPTION (Press      down arrow to page down.)
Today is   January 1, 1987 and you have just turned 35. This is
your   first day of work. You receive $25,000 today, payment in
advance for working over the year. You will continue to work f
the next 30 years earning $25,000 each year. On Jan. 1, 2016 y
will be 64 and will start your last year of work and receive yo
last paycheck. Your last day of work is December 31, 2016.
After retiring you will live for 10 more years and die on Decem
31. 2026.

You   have no initial savings. Below is a list of earnings
you receive at each age over your lifetime. At each age please
fill in the total amount of money you would choose to spend on
consumption during that year.

Before you fill in your consumption choices, we want to make su
you understand how interest on your savings or borrowings is co
Since the interest rate is 4 percent, your assets on January 1
year are equal to 1.04 times the sum of your assets on January
the previous year plus your earnings on January 1 of the pre-
vious year less your consumption on January 1 of the previous y
Thus, if assets last January 1 were $10,000, earnings were $25,
and consumption was $23,000, then assets this January 1 would e

PART 11—CONSUMPTION WITH KNOWLEDGE OF MONEY IN SAVINGS ACCOUNT

We are now going to repeat the previous question, but this time
before you tell us how much you wish to consume in a given year
we will tell you the amount of savings you have at the beginnin
of that year. If you are in debt at the beginning of a
particular year your savings will be negative. Keep in mind th
while you are free to borrow money from the bank, you cannot en
up in debt at the end of your life. Also recall that
                                                      your year
earnings are $25,000 per year until you retire at the beginning
of your 65th year and that you will die when you reach age 75.

(After reading, type '&'         to   begin Part II.)

You are 35 years old. You will earn $ 25000 per year until age 65.
Your savings in your bank account is $        0.
How much do you wish to spend on consumption this year?

    AGE        MONEY IN SAVINGS CONSUMPTION         INTEREST  LABOR

 PART III—CONSuNyfloJq WITh SPECIFIED SAVINGS AT SELECTED AGES
 We are now going to ask you to imagine
                                        you are a particular age
 and have a certain amount
                           of money in your savings account.
 Please tell us how much you would
                                   spend on consumption at that
 age, given the savings indicated. The questionnaire will ask y
 to respond to 16 different age/savings
                                        combinations. Be sure t
 read BOTH age and savings before
                                  responding. Remember, you wil
 continue to work until age 65
                               earning $25,000 per year.

 (After reading, type '&' to begin Part III.)


 You are 35 years old. You will earn $25000 per year until age 65.
 Your savings in your bank account is $ 43500.
 How much would you consume at this age?

                              type 'U to confirm.)




PART IV—CONSUMPTIQN WITH DIFFERENT REflREMENT AGES

Next we want   to find out how much you'd spend on consumption if
your retirement age were different from 65. We will ask you wh
would consume at age 46, with $100,000 in your savings account,
are to retire at some specified retirement age. We will ask yo
4 different retirement ages.

As   usual, your earnings will be   $25,000 per year   until you reac
given retirement   age.

(After reading, type 'U to begin Part IV.)




You are 46 years old. You earn $ 25000
                                       per year until retirement.
Your savings account balance:   $500,000.

PART fl—BUILD YOUR OWN CONSUMPTION PATH

You have 20 "points" to distribute amongst the age ranges to
show the relative amounts you'd like to consume at various times
                                                                 in
your life. For example, if you wish to consume the same amount in
every year, put '5' in each column. If you'd rather consume more
while you're young, and less while you're old, enter larger numbers
first, then smaller numbers. The program will translate the
numbers you type into consumption in each age range. You can modif
your numbers until you're satisfied with your lifetime consumption
path. Remember, you can type any numbers you like provided they
add up to twenty. (NOTE: You still earn $25,000 per year until
retiring at age 65.)

(Type '&'   to   begin Part IX.)


Allot your twenty points to the four decades of your life. You
still earn $25,000 per year until retirement at age 65. Below
the numbers you type will appear a translation of your points into
consumption for the decade. ONCE YOU'VE ENTERED YOUR POINTS, TYPE
'!' FOR TRANSLATION. YOU MAY DO THIS AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WISH.
WHEN YOU ARE FINALLY SATISFIED WITH THE CONSUMPTION PATHS YOU RAVE
CONSTRUCFED, TYPE '&' TO FINISH THE EXPERIMENT.
