            Monopolistic Competition, Credibility and the Output Costs

               of Disinflation Programs      an Analysis of Price Controls

                                          ABSTRACT

           Brazil, Argentina and Israel all used price controls as part of

disinflation programs in 1985—1986. In each case they were intended to break

an "inertial" component of inflation. This paper focuses on a specific

mechanism through which inflation inertia can emerge: the interaction between

lack of credibility of government monetary policy announcements and the price

setting behavior of forward looking firms. We show that this interaction can

lead to inertia extending well beyond the price setting period; that is

important since the price setting period is likely to be short in high

inflation economies.

          We    develop an open economy macromodel in which firms set prices
before uncertainty about government monetary policy is resolved. Lack of
credibility    is then shown to lead to output losses during a disinflation

program. We demonstrate the effects of price controls and show that their

temporary use can be defended on welfare grounds. The paper analyzes asset

price behavior during disinflation programs with and without price controls

and the influence of credibility problems. We discuss nominal and real

interest rates, the stock market and exchange rates. Finally we show that if

past government policy has any information content about future government

policy, cheating on current announcements of tight policy buys current

employment gains during the price control period at the cost of higher
inflation afterwards. Sustaining low inflation after the price control        period

thus   requires restrictive monetary policy during the price control period.

 1. Introduction

         Brazil, Argentina and Israel all used price controls as part of

highly visible disinflation programs in 1985—1986. The controls were intended

to break an "inertial" component of inflation, and hence planned as temporary

measures. Like previous experiences with price controls, the result to date

have been mixed. Israel has succeeded in lifting most of them without

triggering a resurgence of inflation; Brazil and Argentina failed in repeated

attempts to do likewise. This experience raises many questions to which the

existing literature does not provide an answer. It is clear there are

microeconomic costs, but what are the macroeconomic benefits, if any? Under

which circumstances do price controls help in bringing down inflation and when

do they just suppress it temporarily? How should they be set up? And taken

off? What is the proper supporting role of fiscal and monetary policy during

the period controls are in force?

         The literature on price controls is very scant. Possen (1978)

superimposes wage—price controls on a standard model with competitive behavior

by each actor, and adaptive expectations. Blejer and Liviatan (1987) use a

similar set up, but with inflation itself adjusting only slowly ("core

inflation" moves gradually) and argue controls substitute for the need for

restrictive demand management during the transition period towards lower

inflation.

         Both papers exogenously introduce some form of inertia in the

inflationary process, in line with most policy makers' rationale for the use

of such controls (cf Arida—Lara Resende (1985)). The concept of inflation

inertia and its connotation of price setting behavior naturally leads to the

question of whether one should consider non—competitive market structures in

analyzing the effects of price controls. Helpman (1986) provides evidence
SV—046/SVD/05—21—87                  — 2 —




that   this should indeed be done. He analyzes the output and trade balance

response to price controls, first under the assumption of competitive markets

and then under the assumption of monopolistic market structures. He

demonstrates that the actual output response in Brazil and Israel is at

variance with the predictions of the competitive model, but seems to accord

well with what comes out of the non—competitive model. Dornbusch and Simonsen

(1986) and Simonsen (1986) also assume non—competitive markets. They explain

inflation inertia as a consequence of coordination failure between wage and

price setters in the economy after an observed change in monetary policy. The

role of wage—price controls is clear in such a world: the government through

such controls resolves the coordination failure.

          This paper also focuses on the role of price inertia. Like Dornbusch

and Simonsen (1986) and Simonsen (1986), we do not assume inertia

exogenously. However we will focus on a different mechanism through which

inflation inertia emerges: the interaction between lack of credibility of

government monetary policy announcements and the price setting behavior of

forward looking firms. We show that this interaction can lead to inertia

extending well beyond the price setting period; that is important since the

price setting period is likely to be short in high inflation economies. In

Section 2, the paper develops an open economy macromodel (a variant of the one

introduced in Svensson and van Wijnbergen (1986,1987)) in which firms set

prices before uncertainty about government monetary policy is resolved. Money

demand is based on interest sensitive cash—in—advance requirements like in

Lucas (1982) and, especially, Svensson (1985, 1986). Consumers have rational

expectations and use intertemporal welfare optimization to decide on

consumption patterns, savings rate and portfolio allocation. We use the

capital asset pricing model to work out asset prices and interest rates.
SV—046/SVD/05—27—87                  — 3 —




          The model is used in Section 3 to show how lack of credibility can

lead to output losses during a disinflation program. We demonstrate the

effects of price controls and show that their temporary use can in fact be

defended on welfare grounds. Section 4 analyzes asset prices during the

control period, and the influence of credibility problems. We discuss nominal

and real interest rates, the stock market and exchange rates. We finally

address the question of the appropriate stance of monetary policy during the

price controls. We show that, if past government policy has any information

content about future government policy, cheating on current announcements of

tight policy buys current employment gains during the price control period at

the cost of higher inflation afterwards. Sustaining low inflation after the

price control period thus requires restrictive monetary policy during the

price control period.



2.   Analytical Framework

2.1 The Model

         There are two countries, home and foreign. Each country is

completely specialized in the production of home and foreign goods,

respectively. There is production of differentiated products, but at this

stage it is sufficient to consider two aggregate goods only. In period t (t =

—1, 0,1, ...)   world per capita production of each good, Y and
     respectively, is costless up to an exogenous stochastic capacity level,

     and t.   When output falls short of capacity, there is underutilization of

resources. V



1! Underutilization   of resources can be interpreted as unemployment under
     some simple labor market assumptions (for example fixed coefficients in
     production and a fixed labour supply).
 SV—046/SVD/05—27—87                                 — 4 —




             The (worLd per capita) supply of home and foreign currency in period

 t, M and Nt, respectively, is given by



     (2.1)                =
                              wM1        and 11* =
                                                     w*N*11.


 w (w*) is the gross rate monetary expansion of home and (foreign) currency.

             y, y* and at are serially independently distributed. Their

 probability distributions are the time—invariant functions F(y)i Ft(y)

and 11*. There are only two possible values for w: a high expansionary value,

    and a low value                   w's distribution function, H, then takes the

following form:



                                  0
                                          Oi<WL
    (2.2)           H (cii)    = 1'H      WL

                                  1



            The home and the foreign consumer have identical preferences:



    (2.3)                                                0 < s 1.
                    EtZ_tBttu(cht, Cf),


Et is the expectations operator conditional upon information available in

period t; u(cht, cf) is a standard concave instantaneous utility function of

consumption ch and cf of home and foreign goods, respectively, in period t.

           The home consumer enters period t with stocks of six different

assets: home and foreign currency, Mt_i and Nt_I, shares in home and foreign

firms, Zht_1 and zft_1 and claims to transfers of home and foreign currency,

xM_1 and
 SV—046/SVD/05—27—87                    — 5 —




            In   the beginning of the period the consumer Learns current capacities

and monetary expansions. After that, the goods market opens. On the goods

market the consumer can buy home and foreign goods. He must pay for home

goods with home currency and for foreign goods with foreign currency. J

Hence he faces the liquidity constraints



    (2.4a)         Phch   Mt_i + (w —1) Mt_ix.rt_i and



    (2.4b)
                   PIcf          + (w* -1) 1*


            Since nominal goods prices are sticky and do not adjust to the

current state of the market, there will be excess demand in some states and

excess supply in others. When there is excess demand consumers will be

rationed. Thus the home consumer also faces the rationing constraints. 2/



    (2.5)          chY and

         After the consumer's transactions on the goods market, that market

closes and the asset market opens. On the asset market, dividends on shares

are distributed, and the consumer can trade assets and liabilities according

to the budget constraint:




1/ In the terminology of Helpman and Razin (1984), this is the S—system,
    where the sellers nationality determines the transactions currency. They
    also consider the B—system, where the nationality of the buyer determines
    the transactions currency.

2/ We exploit that in equilibrium either none or both consumers will be
    rationed, and we assume that in the latter case they receive identical
    rations.

period t+l with new stocks of his six assets and liabilities, N, NtJ Zht

 Zft, 'ht and 'ft•
            The home consumer will maximize expected utility (2.3) subject to the

sequence of Liquidity, rationing and budget constraints (2.4)           (2.6). The

foreign consumer will maximize the same utility function, with the same

constraints, only his variables are denoted by "p',          like      ct M, N.
            The solution to this problem solves the dynamic programming problem:



    (2.7)        max                  v(w,M,N,M*,N*,s) =     u(chcf) +

                 tiNt,   N, M, N
subject to the constraints (2.4—b). v is a value function and s the state

vector (y, y, w, w). w is wealth inclusive asset returns at the time

asset markets are open.

               Before describing the solution, consider the pricing problem of

firms. Home (foreign) firms produce differentiated home (foreign) goods in

monopolistic competition along the lines of Dixit and Stiglitz (1977). They

set prices in their own currency, and, for some reason left unspecified, must

do so before the current values of w*, y,y* and, in the case of uncertainty

about w, w are known. Hence own—currency goods prices                       ht÷l and   will

depend on period t information only. For convenience we use the inverse price

level, M =              and     ir
                                     =   l/P.   Firms set prices such as to maximize their

stock market value; the solution to this price setting problem is given in

Appendix B. Absence of money illusion and of serial correlation in the

process generating output y implies a functional form for the resulting price

setting function:



       (2.8)                =
                                 kI(M, w),              = 1cI(i       wf)


with   k, k* independent of period t+l actual output (See Appendix B for the

determination of k and k*). A subscript E refers to expected value and primes

to variables in period t+l.

               We consider a perfectly pooled equilibrium, where the home and

foreign consumer hold identical portfolios and consume identical quantitities

of the goods. Thus the market equilibrium conditions for the goods, money and

other asset markets are



    (2.9a)           ch =   c        =
                                           s'     Cft =     ch
                                                                  =




   (2.9b)           Mt =   M     =   'N     =     = N*,     and

Equilibrium first of all requires all liquidity and goods market constraints

to be satisfied, so:

(2.lOa) uses (2.5a), (2.8) and the equilibrium conditions (A.1) (cf Appendix

A.l).         and Vh are the Lagrange multipliers of the liquidity and capacity

constraints respectively. Furthermore, the marginal utility of home goods

equals the marginal utility of wealth in terms of home goods U), unless

binding liquidity constraints (uh > 0) or capacity limits (vh > 0) drive a

wedge between the two:

         The marginal utility of wealth measured in home goods, A depends

 The multiplicative term (WE/w) drops out in the absence of expectational

 errors. The impact of such errors is obvious:



                  ax
                a(WEIW)



 Overestimating money growth increases the marginal utility of wealth. This is

 because overestimating money growth leads to unanticipated tight money, and

 lower prices tomorrow than    previously   anticipated. But lower   prices   tomorrow

 for given prices today raise the marginal utility of a nominal unit of wealth,

 AIMS since it coimnands more resources tomorrow. Since i      is    predetermined,

 A goes up as a consequence.

           A set of expressions similar to 2.10 holds for foreign variables.

The variables and equations can be decomposed into two groups, one

corresponding to home and one to foreign variables. Front (2.10) we can solve

for the endogenous variables                        as functions of y, w, and w,
                                  ch, A, uh and

and consumption of foreign goods cf. From the corresponding equations for
                                              * *  *
foreign variables we can solve for cf, Xf hf and Vf as functions of y*
 * *1
          and   cf.

           Finally we need to address the way firms form expectations about

future monetary policy. In Svensson and van Wijnbergen (1987) current shocks

contain no information value about future shocks. Here we want to focus on

disinflation programs: after a period of high inflation and high money growth
 (w =          the government announces restrictive money growth targets
        wa),
 (w =
        WL) at the time firms need to make pricing decisions. We will explore

the case of complete credibility and the case of incomplete credibility. The

latter implies that firms assign a positive probability y to the possibility

              The formation of         could be based on Kreps—Wilson (1982) type

 Bayesian updating formulas (see Backus and Driffil (l985a,b) for an

 example). Alternatively, a signaling equilibrium might exist where a

 government, by appropriately low choice of u)L can make sure that the

historicaLly inherited value of TH (applied to period t) will switch to 0 or 1

depending on the monetary policy followed during the price control period:

see Persson and van Wijnbergen (1987) for such an approach. In this paper we

are concerned more with the consequences of credibiLity problems rather than

their cause; we therefore simply adopt the Persson—van Wijnbergen (1987)

setup.            therefore has a value determined by past history. Beliefs about

the post—control period (y) will then depend on whether actual monetary.

policy during the controls coincides with the announcement of tight policy

 (IlL
        or not. Existence of such a signaling equilibrium requires that            is low

enough to make it optimal for the expansionary government not to follow it, in

spite of the credibility gains it would get by doing so; but high enough to

not make it too costly for the "tight" government to use 10L as signal

(Persson and van Wijnbergen (1987))].



2.2 Interest and Exchange Rate Determination

             One over one plus the nominal interest rate equals the present value,

measured in money terms, of a sure unit of nominal money paid out next period

(after goods markets close; bonds yield no liquidity services):



        (2.12a)      1/(l+i) =                     or i =
                                 BEA'w'M/(AJM)              E1iT/(EX'1r4)
 SV—046/SVDIO5—27—87                            — 11     —




 The second equality is derived using equation (A.3d).

 The nominal interest rate hence equals the ratio between expected future

 liquidity services of money, Epw, and the expected utility of future nominal

 wealth, EA'ic. The interpretation is straightforward: both money and a

 nominal bond have an end of period value equal to one unit of money. During

 the holding period, money alone yields liquidity services, valued at
                                                                                 Eut.
 To offset that advantage, bonds need to pay interest of equal value, so market

 clearing requires iEX'ir1 =
                                    Euh1r, which yields (2.12). Similar expressions
hold for i. Note in particular that current prices                (tiN) do not influence i.

            Real rates can be derived from the present value of a future unit of

wealth measured in terms of home (foreign) goods to derive the own rate of

interest for home (foreign) goods:



     (2.13)        l/(l+r) =     BEX'/x;    1/(1+r*) = $EX*hIX*




           Consider finally exchange rates. Most high inflation countries that

went through a disinflation programs used some form of nominal exchange rate

fixing, at least initially (Bolivia 1986 is an exception). However, those

countries also has extensive black markets in which foreign assets were traded

freely. We therefore assume a floating rate system; the emprirical

counterpart of the exchange rate is thus the black market rate.Y




!'   To completely dismiss the official rate as an inframarginal set of trade
     taxes and subsidies with no real impact other than distributional is
     clearly overly simplistic. An analysis of dual exchange rate systems
     would however be outside the scope of this paper. Kiguel and Lizondo
     (1986) provide a recent survey.

           The nominal exchange rate in asset markets is the rate at which a

 domestic currency denominated nominal unit of wealth can be exchanged for a

 foreign currency denominated unit of wealth. Hence

           However, since liquidity and capacity constraints may drive a wedge

 between the marginal utility of consumption and the marginal utility of

wealth, this is not necessarily the exchange rate that would obtain if markets

for domestic and foreign money would be open during the goods market.!' If

such markets would open up, it is easy to show that the following would hold

for   this "goods market" exchange rate:

                    u        P
      (2.15)
                    uh       Pf

2.3 A Simple Graphical Representation

each country's commodity market,a' depending on the realization of capacity

and monetary expansions. In the first regime, the capacity constraint is

 binding and hence                  =   y.          In this regime, the liquidity constraint is not

 so this regime, labeled L in figure 1, is to the NE of W in fig. 1.

            In the third regime, there is excess capacity AND excess liquidity,

 so both 11h and Vh equal zero. Home output is demand determined in this

 regime:

 In this regime, labeled U in fig. 1, there is a true effective demand failure:

neither capacity nor liquidity constraints are binding. This happens if

monetary policy is very restrictive (a low). Thus inflationary expectations

are low and the return on money commensurately high. This regime is to the SE

of W in fig. 1. Svensson (1986) shows that this regime will never obtain if

a is known      to   firms when they set prices for the next period.



3. Price Controls, Credibility and the Output Costs of Disinflation Programs

           We will use the machinery developed in section 2 to analyze the

employment costs of disinflation programs, the impact of credibility problems

and the role for price controls. Consider an economy where the price level

and the money stock have been growing at a high rate                        w. Then, at the end of
period t—1, the government announces a disinflation program that relies on a

reduction in the growth rate of money, down to a low rate                            The impact of

credibility works through firms' price setting behavior. The government

either follows its announcement, so                        is actually realized, or it reneges on
 SV—046/SVDIO5—27—87                     — 15 —




 its announcement. For simplicity we assume that in that case the pre—

announcement high money growth rate           is implemented. The firms' assess-

ment of the probability that this happens is H Expected money growth is



    (3.1)
                  WE = TH WH + (li) WL


The impact of credibility can then be assessed by comparing the case of

   a 0 with what happens when    TH >   0.
         Consider the case of         = 0 first. Then the government announcement

is believed; assume the government aLso follows through. Hence WE a

This is equivalent to case where firms actually know monetary policy before

setting prices; hence, as shown in section 2 no real variables will be

affected by the slowdown in money growth. Firms will offset the drop in w by

an increase in K (fall in future prices). In terms of the diagram, the

liquidity constraint line rotates down (figure 2).

  more expected output losses than would have obtained otherwise, in spite of

  the presence of monopolistic firms. Private welfare is also unaffected:

Appendix B, we show that, under the additional assumption of a uniform

            Comparison with figure 2 shows the problem a lack of credibility

 government not following its announcements,                  The basic problem is

 straightforward: lack of credibility causes the real money stock to be "too

 low" on the transition path between the policy announcement and the period at

 which government credibility is established. It is the interaction between

 monopolistic price setting and credibility that causes the output losses

 during disinflation programs.

             An important point to note is that the time period during which this

problem will persist is NOT the period during which prices are fixed, but the

time it takes for          to fall to zero. This may be a substantially longer; in

high inflation countries prices will often be adjusted at high frequency, but

if information about government fiscal and monetary policy becomes available

only gradually, WE may exceed WL and unemployment may remain high for a period

of time well in excess of the price setting period.

             Fig. 3 can also be used to show what price controls can do to

alleviate this problem. Before we do so one prior point. In models like the

one presented here controls can also be used to permanently improve on the

full anticipation equilibrium, because the monopolistic competition market

structure results in socially suboptimal output levels in some states of

nature. A proper analysis of such a policy would however also need to take

into account the microeconomic costs such a policy would entail. The symmetry

assumptions made in this paper prevent a satisfactory analysis of 9uch costs

which are related to the relative price distortions controls unavoidably

introduce. We therefore do not consider their possible permanent use here but

impose that they are used for transitional purposes only.

         Price controls take the pricing decision out of the firmst hands; in

terms of fig. 3 they rotate the K line (see fig. 4).21 The government now

sets K, say at Kc. If Kc is set below the no—controls solution                       controls

will never bind; if           is set above              the LL line rotates down and expected

output increases because of the controls whenever they are binding. It is

clearly possible to set prices such that the full credibility solution is

reproduced: this involves setting K equal to KL, rotating the liquidity

constraint line as indicated in fig. 4. Transitional umemployment losses are

avoided when binding price controls are imposed in that manner, basically

because price controls allow a higher real money stock during the transition

period towards full credibility.

         Welfare will clearly improve (see Appendix A.2 for proof):

 uC(ch, c1) > U Price controls therefore increase welfare if credibility

problems cause transitional unemployment without such controls.

         The argument for government intervention in the case of mistaken

beliefs has also been made by Calvo (1986). The nature of the welfare Losses

in his example is different, however. There consumers underestimate the true

intertemporal terms of trade because they mistakenly expect a trade reform to

be reversed. Hence too much expenditure is shifted towards today, and a wedge

opens up between the intertemporal terms of trade and the intertemporal rate

of substitution in consumption. The associated welfare costs are proportional

to the intertemporal substitution elasticity, in standard "Harberger triangle"

fashion. Mistaken beliefs do not lead to underutilization of resources

however, contrary to the example provided here. Finally, the result that

under monopolistic competition price controls incrase output also emerges in

the analysis of Helpman (1987), although not through the same mechanism.

Credibility plays no role in his paper.



4. Asset Prices, Intertemporal Inflation—Unemployment Trade Offs and the
    Appropriate Conduct of Monetary Policy During Price Controls.

         Asset prices depend crucially on firms' beliefs about government

policy in the next period, t÷1, and onwards. This can, for period t+l, again

be summarized in the parameter '4.   '4 >   in turn, will be based on prior

information as summarized in   y, supplemented by any new information about

the government that has become available during period t. Clearly, the

particular way in which    will be updated depends on the incentive structure

the government faces, the particular informational asymmetries that exist, and

so on.

           Cheating on announcements by announcing WL but implementing
                                                                       WH
 leads to employment gains in period t; after all, prices were set based on the

 expectation WE C w. However, since the same incentive problem arises next

 period, firms will subsequently increase           above        and set next period's

 prices accordingly. In that sense price controls lead to an intertemporaL

 trade off between current unemployment and future inflation.

           The informational asyruunetry arises because firms need to set prices

 after monetary policy is announced, but before its realization can be

 observed. This could lead to uncertainty about actual policy if firms have

 incomplete information about the government's preferences. For example firms

 could be uninformed about the government's rate of time           preference.   A more

 impatient government may   be   more inclined to sacrifice future inflation for

 current employment gains by cheating on its monetary policy announcements for

 the price control period (?ersson and van Wijnbergen (1987)).

          In such circumstances it is possible that         a   signaling equilibrium

exists, as argued in Section 2.1; then          would switch to zero or one

depending on whether w in the price controls period coincides with the

announced value      or not. This is explored further in Persson and

van Wijnbergen (1987), and simply assumed here.



4.1 Interest Rates, Exchange Rates and the Stock Market During Disinflation

         To determine the behaviour of asset prices during disinflation

controls consider first the marginal utility of wealth, A. Since both

expected monetary expansion and expectational errors influence A, we need to

distinguish the case where the government implements its announcement (w —
                                                                                        WL)
and the case where it cheats: w =            Call the two cases L and H

Table 4.1.

Because of credibility problems, an announced disinflation program that is

actually implemented raises the marginal utility of wealth: XL >
                                                                                    XFC

The opposite happens if the government cheats on its announcement and actually

implements w11: XH < XFCH < 1FCL

          This has implications for both real interest rates and stock market

behaviour during the control period. Stock market valuation is inversely

proportional to the current marginal value of wealth: share prices give the

value of claims on future output in terms of current utility of wealth:


                        EA'(Q1 +      Y')
                                A                Bh/X
 SV—046/sVD/O5—27—87                                  — 23   —




 Hence the result that stockmarkets will be depressed during a disinflation

 program that is actually implemented, but buoyant if the government cheats and

 follows expansionary policies instead:



        (4.7)                >     +          = 3iY'r.. < BhIXfl   =



The intuition is straightforward: a high current marginal utility of wealth

lovers the relative value of future claims on output with respect to current

wealth and hence depresses the stock market. The reverse happens after an

unanticipated monetary expansion, as when the government cheats on its

announcement and implements w instead.

               A more conventional presentation draws on real interest behaviour.

Real rates equal the expected rate of decline in A (cf Section 2.2); Table

4.2 follows from (2.14) and Table 4.1.:



                      Table 4.2: REAL INTEREST RATES DURING DISINFLATION




                                                                                   ,

               This is an important result: during a disinflation program, real
interest rates will be high if the disinflation program is in fact

implemented, and low if the government cheats and plays
                                                                       WE
                                                                            instead.   Note that
 SV—046/SVD/05—27—87                       — 24   —




 this   is a more fundamental result than the often—heard claim that credibility

 problems only raise ex—post but not ex—ante real rates, since inflationary

expectations exceed inflation. r is the return on an indexed bond, so

 inflation surprises do not affect it. Cheating by implementing a more

expansionary policy than announced will thus lower the real interest rate and

shift consumption forward into the current period.

           Consider next the nominal interest rate. This is non—trivial since

simple relations between real and nominal rates and inflation break down in

the presence of monetary policy uncertainty (Svensson (1985)). Applying the

asset pricing equ. 2.13a and Table 4.1 yields Table 4.3:



              Table 4.3: NOMINAL INTEREST RATES DURING DISINFLATION




              ______________      L          FCL      FCH       H

              l+i =

                      8EX'JT.1


Table 4.3 shows that, contrary to real interest rates, nominal rates of

interest are not affected by credibility problems during the period of

controls. This is because current surprises in the level of the moneystock

affect the future price level, but this influences the future liquidity

service of money in the same way it affects the marginal utility of wealth.

Hence the relative attractiveness of money and bonds is not affected by such

surprises and hence neither is the nominal interest rate.

           For similar reasons, the asset market exchange rate is not affected

by credibility problems either. The exchange rate results are straight

forward: expansionary policy leads to a depreciating rate, and tight policy

to an appreciating rate:

            The conmiodity market exchange rate will be affected by credibility

 problems and the associated tightening of liquidity constraints:

raise    WE. In addition, for y >            output and thus home consumption is equal

to what consumption would be in the case of disinflation with full

credibility. Hence uh will not be affected for those realizations of y.

However, with credibility problems liquidity constraints start binding

earlier: between        and y home consumption in the no credibility case (NC)

falls short of what it is in the full credibility case (FC). Hence in that

constraints binding in both the NC and the FC                 case, u will exceed u.
The resulting decline in demand for home goods takes pressure off commodity

markets and off the goods market exchange rate. This will reduce the

 The results are intuitive: if monetary policy does not deviate from its

 announced values, with which the controls are compatible (u =
                                                                  wL) the
 marginal utility of wealth equals what would obtain under a fully credible

 implementation of          Since price controls remedy the problem of a too low

 real money stock on the transition path towards credibility, they also prevent

the high real interest rates that we showed characterize the no—controls

disinflation programs (see section 4.1 and tabLes 4.2 and 4.4). Hence an

important result: a disinflation program, combined with price controls set to

be compatible with the announced tight money policy, will work if the

restrictive policy is indeed followed. It will work in the sense that

mistaken beliefs will now not cause intertemporal distortions and the

associated high real interest rates and transitional output losses that

restrictive policies alone would cause in the presence of credibility

problems.

            Cheating on the announcement (i.e. announcing   WL and setting the

price controls accordingly, but implementing WH) would cause deviations from

the full credibility results. Table 4.4 shows that the resulting increase in

the real money stock during the transition period lowers X during that

period. Cheating will thus also cause a temporary fall in the real interest

rate (cf. table 4.4) and art increase in expected output. However, because of

the signaling function of actual monetary policy,
                                                     y will   now switch to one

and inflation in the post—control period becomes therefore unavoidable.

Cheating on the announcement—cum—controls package therefore indeed buys

current employment gains at the cost of future inflation losses.

         The results are very different for nominal interest rates. As we saw

in section 4.1, current prices do not influence nominal interest rates (equ.

4.lb); the nominal interest rate equals the ratio between expected future
SV—046/SVD/05—27—87                                     — 28    —




liquidity    services and the expected utility of future nominal weaLth. Using

2.12 and 2.13b it becomes obvious that the results from table 4.3 apply

independent of the imposition of price controls. Price controls will affect

real interest rates, not nominal rates.

           Consider finally exchange rates. Clearly price controls applying to

the goods market in period t will not affect the exchange rate obtaining while

the asset market operates afterwards. Thus, the results from the previous

section apply: expansionary policy during the control period set                             to one

(lead to expectations of future expansion) and hence the exchange rate will

fall (depreciate):

         Since these rates are free market rates, their empirical counterpart

is probably the black market exchange rate. Expansionary policy during the

control period could therefore lead to a rising black market premium, while

controls with tight policy should lead to a fall in that premium.

5.   Conclusions

         The notion of price inertia naturally leads to an imperfect

competition framework. In this paper, we focus on the interaction between

lack of credibility of government policy announcements and the price setting

behavior of forward looking firms in monopolistic competition. We show that

this interaction can lead to inflation inertia extending well beyond the price

setting period. The latter is important, because the price setting period is

likely to be short in highly inflationary economies.

         We do this within the framework of an open economy macro model in

which firms have to set prices before uncertainty about government policy is

resolved. This model is used to analyze the precise nature of output losses

during a monetary stabilization program, and the potential role for price

controls in avoiding them. We show that with full credibility, the monetary

disinflation will not cause output losses, in spite of price setting by

firms. If firms, assign a positive probability to the government not

implementing its announcements, however, output losses will arise. The basic

problem is straightforward: lack of credibility causes the real money stock to

be "too low" on the transition path between the policy announcement and the

period in which government credibility will finally be established. It is the

interaction between monopolistic price setting and credibility that causes the

output losses during disinflation programs.

         If the government does not renege on its announcements, money will be

lower than anticipated, and hence the real money stock too tight. The ensuing

tightening of liquidity constraints lowers consumption and raises the marginal

utility of wealth. This effect dies away as credibility improves and the gap
 SV—046/SvD/O5—21—87                — 31 —




 between actual and anticipated money disappears (in this paper the information

 structure is set up such that that only takes one period). The temporary

 impact on the marginal utility of wealth also explains the behavior of asset

prices during the transition period. The stock market valuation of home firms

measures the value of claims on future output plus future resale value in

terms of current marginal utility of wealth; hence the result that stock

markets will be depressed during a disinflation program that is incompletely

believed but actually implemented. Similarly, real interest rates will be

high during a disinflation program plagued by credibility problems but

actually implemented. The real interest rate on an indexed bond equals the

rate at which the marginal utility of a real unit of wealth, A, declines over

time; thus a declining A impLies a high real rate of interest. This is a

more fundamental result than the often heard claim that credibility problems

raise the ex—post real rate but not the ex—ante one, because inflationary

expectations are higher than actual inflation. But we have derived the result

for an indexed bond, which is not affected by such inflation surprises.

         We finally discuss nominal interest rates and the exchange rate.

Nominal interest rates are not affected by surprises in the level of the money

stock: the nominal interest rate equals the ratio between the value of future

liquidity services of money and the marginal utility of a future unit of

nominal wealth, and a money stock level surprise affects both the in the same

way. Thus there is no impact of credibility problems on nominal rates. They

will be high when actual monetary policy is expansionary and low when it is

not, irrespective of credibility problems.

        For a similar reason, there will be no impact of credibility problems

per se on asset markets exchange rates (i.e. the relative price of a unit of
  SV—046/SVIJ/05—27—87                  — 32   —




  foreign   and domestic currency traded when asset markets are open).

  Expansionary policy will depreciate the exchange rare, and contractionary

  policy appreciate it, irrespective of credibility problems. This is not the

  case with the commodity market exchange rate however. The latter is the rate

 that would obtain during the time commodity markets are open if there were

 continuous trading in home and foreign currency. We show that for that

 exchange rate concept, the rate will appreciate because of credibility

 problems for those output realizations where liquidity constraints become

 binding.

            All these intratemporal and intertemporal relative price effects

 carry true economic welfare losses; they cause wedges between rates of

 substitution and terms of trade available in commodity and asset markets.

 Price controls avoid these problems by taking the pricing decisions out of the

 firms' hands. Thus anticipations of reneging on tight money announcements

will not be passed on in prices that will then be too high if the government

in fact does not renege. As a consequence there will be no output losses

during a disinflation program with properly administered price controls, and

no increase in the marginal utility of wealth,
                                                   credibility problems

notwitstanding. Hence high real interest rates will be avoided.

            However, we also show the importance of restrictive policies
                                                                           during
the price control period. If price controls are compatible with the announced

monetary disinflation program, and actual monetary policy does not deviate

from its announced values, the relative price distortions mentioned are

avoided, but exploiting price controls to relax monetary policy beyond its

announced values reintroduces them.    Moreoever, we show that if current actual

monetary policy has any information content about future monetary policy,
SV—046/SV0f05—27—87                 — 33 —




expansionary monetary policy during the price controL period Leads to the same

anticipatory price setting problems after the control period that these

controls were designed to resolve. In that sense, credibility and price

controls together introduce an intertemporal trade off between current

employment gains and future inflationary costs. Sustaining low inflation

beyond the period of price controls thus requires restrictive monetary policy

during the price control period.

    APPENDIX A:




    A.l Derivation of the Equilibrium Equations

             We consider a perfectly pooled equilibrium, where the home and

    foreign consumer hold identical portfolios and consume identical quantities of

    the goods. That is, they hold the same per capita share of world asset stocks

    and consume the same per capita share of world output of each good: haLf of

    world quantities. Then the market equilibrium condition for the goods, money

    and other asset markets can be written

             Introduce the notation

In a stationary stochastic rational expectations equilibrium the endogenous

variables in period t will be functions of the-state variables in period t,

  APPENDIX B: The Price Setting Problem

            We consider a continuum of firms defined over the unit interval, each

  producing a unique differentiated good indexed by j, 0 S         j   1. Home
 preferences for differentiated goods are described by a CES subutility

 function separable in the home and foreign aggregates with corresponding CES

 prices indices,        and         It follows that per capita demand for home

 product j is:



                                            h
           (3.1)        Chi =
                                "hJh             Ch.



 Actual output is the minimum of capacity and demand:



           (3.2)      Y. =     mm
                                    Cy, Chi).



The home currency stock market value of firm h is:




                                          (ç + P.
           (3.3)      hJ = 9E(A'it                      11)1 ATM



using   the asset pricing equation (A.3e) from Appendix A. This can be

simplified using (2.lld):



          (3.4)            =        E   (Y./w)/6



with 8     11(1+6).

          Consider first the case where the firm actually knows that a will

equal say w. Then (2.20) can be written as:
 SV—046/SVD/05—27—87                                —    42 —

                                                                               Kc4 (!!U)
                                                                                     h
                                                                                                   dF)

 The expression between parentheses equals Ey'. Equation (2.21) immediately

 shows one important result: if w' is known in advance, expected output

 depends on Kw', but not on w'. Maximizing the stock market valuation

 requires that the following holds:


                                    Pt.
         (8.6)                      ij

Simple manipulation of (2.22) shows that firms set the price such that the

elasticity of demand equaLs minus one. The price influences that elasticity

because it determines the probability of excess capacity. Without excess

capacity, the elasticity is zero; with excess capacity it equals                                    the

first order condition, once syuinetry across firms has been imposed, implies a

choice of h• such that the output weighted expected value of the demand

elasticity equals one:

                         5

                              WE


        Consider next the case of policy uncertainty. We take a simple case,

in anticipation of the analysis of disinflation programs in the next

section: monetary expansion can be either high or low and the firm attaches

probability y to the possibility of an expansionary monetary policy:


        (8.8)       Pr(w' =              =              Pr(w'   =
                                                                    WL)
 SV—046/SVD/05—27—87                       — 43     —




In   appendix C we show that, for a uniform distribution of y over the interval

 (o, ),    firms will   set prices as if        =
                                                                + (lYH)     L obtains with
                                                    TR   (LIH


certainty. Therefore, for this particular demand structure, policy

uncertainty itself does not affect the probability of unemployment:


                        F(y)            F(y)                         fly)

     and   are the output realization levels at which the liquidity constraints

become binding in the restrictive
                                        (WL) and expansionary (w11) case

respectively (cf.figure 1 in section 2.3).

 APPENDIX C: Monetary Policy Uncertainty, Price Setting and Unemployment

               Define Ks as the value of K for which the firm's first order

 condition hold if monetary expansion,                     w, is known to them before they set

 prices:

 By construction,            WE equals the expected value of W in the monetary

 uncertainty case:

The FO condition in the uncertainty case then equals:

           I   will show that for a uniform distribution of y over (Y, y), ItE

satisfies C.). It wilt be convenient to reproduce figure C.l.

           First, the FO condition can be simplified; if                     ra is known with

certainty, C.l becomes

Similar simplification is possible for

Assume   (c.1): K XE,

                         y = 0 for notational convenience.

                (c.1—3) imply:

Hence the numerator of C.4 equals N.C3 under those conditions. Therefore, X

solves the FO conditions for the uncertainty case too, given (c.1—3), if

Consider the first term first:

 Similarly   for the restrictive money realization:


                        (1—y )                1_I F(1Cw)                1        F(y)

                                            = (1111) KE (1/2 +
                                                                       (KEwL))

Adding (8.9) and (8.10), and using (b.2), then yields:



                           =
                                TH
                                     1E (1/2 +        - 1E    WH)/Y)


                                 +          KE (1/2 + (;: —



         (c.l1)             =
                                 KE (1/2 +6;     — Kw)/y)


Hence LHS = RHS and      solves the FOC of the firm in the monetary uncertainty

case too. Given (c.l—3) therefore, the existence of policy uncertainty does

not in itself affect the probability of
                                                  unemployment.
