The Behavioral Economics of Smoking

NBER Working Paper No. 6444
March 1998

                                            ABSTRACT

       Evidence that economic principles may be employed to predict the rates at which cigarettes

are consumed is presented from several laboratory experiments. In these experiments, cigarette-

deprived smokers were required to make a effortful response to earn cigarette puffs. Changing the

number of responses required per puff is conceptualized as a price manipulation. Our experiments

demonstrate that these price increases decrease cigarette consumption and that price elasticity of

demand increases with increases in price. When data from 74 different smokers, participating in 17

different experiments, in our laboratory were analyzed, five demographic variables were related to

rates of earning and smoking cigarettes in the lab: 1) males smoked more than females; 2) less-

educated individuals tended to smoke more than better-educated smokers; 3) higher rates of smoking

were observed in individuals with high Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire scores; 4) light drinkers

were found to smoke more than heavy drinkers; and 5) unemployed subjects smoked more than

employed individuals.     Demographic effects on price elasticity did not accord as well with

econometric data. Finally, we discuss the ability of behavioral-economic laboratory experiments to

model cigarette smoking in the natural economy, and the validity of using these laboratory results as

a means of assessing the likely effects of public-policy initiatives. The results from one such

experiment are presented that suggest the economic concept of inferior goods may be informative in

understanding nicotine-replacement products and the likely effects of differential pricing of cigarettes

and these replacement products.
