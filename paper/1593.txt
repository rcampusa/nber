             Optimal Time—Consistent Fiscal Policy
                   with Uncertain Lifetimes


                             ABSTRACT



       This paper studies optimal fiscal policy in an economy where

heterogeneous agents with uncertain lifetimes coexist. We show that

some plausible social welfare functions lead to time—inconsistent opti-

mal plans, and we suggest restrictions on social preferences that

avoid the problem. The normative prescriptions of a time—consistent

utilitarian planner generalize the 'two—part Golden Rule" suggested

by Samuelson, and imply aggregate dynamics similar to those arising

in the Cass—Koopmans—Ramsey optimal growth framework. We characterize

lump—sum transfer schemes that allow the optimal allocation to be

decentralized as the competitive equilibrium of an economy with

actuarially fair annuities. The lump—sum transfers that accomplish

this decentralization are age dependent in general.

                                         Introduction
           This paper studies the idea of         optimal   fiscal policy in an economy

riare h'eterogenous generations with uncertain lifetimes coexistS A

groinq iterature studies the effects of SQCjCl security and government

debt issue in economies of            this   type, but it stops short of describing

;rv    intartemporal      social welfare function that might justify the use of

fical        tool;.   Our primary concern is therefore the dynamic resource

allocation chosen by a utilitarian planner who weighs the welfare of

both    existing and future         generations. The basic model of the individual

comes      from Yaari (196S).
           Specification    of an    intertemporal    social   welfare function   is

compilcated by the possibility that optimal plans are dynamically incon-
sistent in tne sense of Strotz (1956). This possibility arises in any

model with overlapping generations. Below we show that sonic plausible

social welfare functions lead to time—inconsistency1 and suggest

restrictions on        social preferences       that avoid the problem.




      We  are grateful for helpful discussions with Andrew Abel. Financial
       support was provided by the National Science Foundati on and the
       Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

       For   recant applications of uncertain—lifetime models to fiscal—
      oo1icy questions, see Abel (1985. Blanchard c1925)1 and Eck'stein,
      Ei chenbaum, and Pci ed (1983) among others. Open—economy aspects of
      BIanchards (1985) model are studied by Buiter (1934)1 Frenkel and
      Razin c1984) • and Giovannini (1984). Early applications of 'i'aari s
       (1965) setup include Merton (1971) and Tobin (1967).
        An intertecnporal welfare aflaiysis   alonq   the lines of that

presented here has been      veinped by Samuelson (1967, 1968) in the

corite<t of Diamond's (1965)   deterministic    overlappinq—qe'erations model

with capital. However, special assumptions made by amuelson obscure

the potential for time incons:stency. It is therefore noteworthy that

the normative prescriptions o our time—consistent utilitarian planner

generalize those suggested by Samuelson. Moreover, the aggregate

dynamics implied by an optimal plan are qualitatively similar to those

crivi      hy r:c     Ii) knnrn;nc (19A>, nd Rmsy H97P)            in   rnndc
with    identical3 non—overlapping generations. We characterize lump—sun

transfer scheme; that allow the optimal allocation to be decentralized

through a competitive economy with actuarially fair annuities.

         An important finding of the paper is that the above—mentioned

transfers are in general age dependent. It follows that the aggregative

fiscal policies studied in the recent literature will usually fail to

achieve the optimal allocation. If first—best fiscal policy tools are

unavailableq however, the door is opened to the type of general—

equilibrium time inconsistency studied by Kydland and Prescott (1977>,

Calvo (1978), and others.

         The paper is organized as follows. Section I reviews the

individual's problem and the competitive equilibrium of an economy in

which there is no uncertainty at the aggregate level. Section II takes

up utilitarian planning and the time—consistency problem. In section III

the allocation chosen by a time—consistent utilitarian planner is

characterized. Section IV discusses lump—sum redistribution schemes that




       Phelps and Riley (1978) study the Rawlsian 'maximin' case. Abel
       (1984) uses .Sarnuelson's criterion to evaluate steady—state welfare
       in overlaping—generations models with money.

librium. Section        V   is a brief summary of the result;.


                   1.       C;ompetitive Equilibrium with Annuities

       To make the paer self—contained, this section briefly reviews the

interteinporal alloctian problem of an individual with an uncertain

lifetime who purchases actuarially fair annuities. While the conclusions

merely repeat those of Yaari (1965), the presentation of the problem is

slightly different and hopefully more transparent. The section conclude;

by describing the economy's aqgregate dynamics in perfect—foresight

equilibrium.

        An individual born at time v (his 'vintage) is uncertain about

the length N of hi; life. Let F(.) denote the cumulative distribution

function of the random variable N, so that F(n)            ProbCN     n). Of

course, F(O) = 0 and lie            F(n) = 1. Implicit in our notation is the

assumption that the distibution of N does not depend on vz in addition

FL)    is   assumed to be continuous and piecewise differentiable with an

associated     probability density function +L) satisfying F(n> =
                                                                          SF(s)ds.
Individuals maximize the expected value over possible lifespan; of a

discounted integral of future instantaneous utilities. The time—t

utility of a vintage—v individual is a function u(.) of consumption

c(v,t).4 If      denotes the constant subjective discount rate, expected

lifetime utility for an agent born on date v is


(1)    U(v)
               Sf(n){SVu[c(v,t))expEt_vHdtHn.


      The function u(.) is assumed to be bounded, strictly concave, and
      twice continuously differentiable. Notice that u(.) is assumed to be
      independent of v. Only consumption paths c(v,.) that are piecewise
      continuous and right—hand differentiable are considered. To ensure
      interior solutions, the usual Inada conditions are imposed.

        After integrating by parts, (1) can be written in trie form

                                        F(t-v)3exp[-(t-v)3dt,

where 1 — F(t—v) is just the probability that an individual born on date

v is alive on date t.

        Define p(n) to be the instantaneous death probability faced by an

individual of     age n:

(3.    p(n) =   4(n)/El    —   F(n)).

Because 4(n)     = F'(n)       and NO) = 0, (3) implies


.4)    I —Fri) =exot—L.o(s)ds].


The objective function (2) therefore takes the form


(5)    U(v) =   uEc(v,t))exp{-StE+p(s-v)Jds)dt.

As in Yaari (1965), the possibility of death leads to a higher subjec-

tive discount rate on future utility.

        Assume now, as in Blanchard's (1985) model, that a new cohort of

individuals is born each instant and that there is no aqgregate uncer-

tainty ever though each individual's lifespan is stochastic. If the size

of    each newly—born cohort is normalized to unity, there are exactly 1 —
F(t—v) individuals of vintage v alive at any time t             v and this

cohorts size declines at rate p(t—v). Those within a given cohort are

a;suied to be identical in all respects.

         Individuals are prohibited from dying in debt, and can borrow only

if they simultaneously buy insurance against that contingency. There

exist    insurance :ompanies that buy and issue annuities which pay holders
the age—dependent yield r(t) + p(t—v) at time t but expire in the event
                                           —5-.-




of the owners deatr.       Because there are no bequests, those with positive

nonhuman      alth will choose   to hold it exclusively in the fora of an-

nuities, which pay a rate      exceeding the sarket real interest rate while
the owner live;. Borrowers effectively insure themselves against ac-

cidental death by issuing annuities to the insurance company. In short,

insurance companies intermediate between all borrowers and lenders and

also hold the private sectors net marketable assets, which in the

present context will coincide with the capital stock. Under the assump—

tions of the preceding paragraph, and with costless free entry into the

insurance industry, the insurance premium p(t—v) is actuarially fair and

the insurance company makes zero profits. The instantaneous effective

borrowing rate faced at time t by an individual born at time v is thus

r(t) + p(t—v)   ,   where r(t) is the real interest rate and p(t—v) is the

actuarially fair insurance premium.

         The lifetime problem of an individual born on date v may now be

stated    as follows: choose a consumption         path              so as to ma<i—
                                                          mc(v4t))
mize (5> subject to


(6) c(v,t)exp{-ftEr(s)+p(s-v))ds}dt                 a(vv).


In (6), a(v,t) is the overall time—t wealth of an agent of vintage v.

Wealth is the sum of of the      present    discounted value of wages (human

wealth, the present discounted value of expected future transfer pay-

ments from the government, and capital.

         The Lagrangian for the problem can be written


L =   iuEc(v,t)]expE-(t-v)3      -
                                     pc(v,t)expt_itr(s)ds}expE_!tp(s_v>ds]dt,



      It is easily verified that the solution to the individuals problem
      is time consistent.

where        is a Lagrange aultiplier. (Terms that do rot       involve   c(.,.> have

been disregarded.) Maxim:ation of L with         respect c(v,t) yields the
necessary condi ti an

for all t. Let D be the time—derivative operator. Differentiating (7)

with respect to time, we obtain


(8) Dcv,t =         -u'Ec(v,t)]/u"[c(v,t)))Er(t)       -



An optical individual consumption plan obeys (8) while forcing the

budgat constraint (6) to bind. Note that the death probabilities do not

affect the time derivative of consumption along an optimal path (al-

though they do affect the level of consumption through (6>).

         Turn next to the implied dynamic behavior of the economy's ag—

gregates in perfect—foresight equilibrium. If each agent is endowed with

one unIt of labor, the labor force at any time t is a constant,

Aggregate output V cay then be written as a function Y(K) of the

economy's capital stock K.6 The usual one—sector assumptIon fixes the

consumption price of capital at unity. If C(t) denotes aggregate con—

sucnpti on,



(9)     C(t) =   5tc(v,t)expE_rtp(s_v)dsJdv

and if the government consumes no goods itself, the economy's capital




      The underlying production function is assumed to be homogeneous of
      degree one in capital and labor, to exhibit diminishing returns to
      each factor, and to obey the Inada conditions.

stock evolves according to


(10)   DK(t)    =   Y[K(t) 3     —   C(t)

       In perfect--foresight equilibrium, the expected real interest rate

r(t) must equal the marginal product of capital Y'(K(t)] for all t.

Combination of (B) and (9) shows that the time derivative of aggregate

consumption is


(11) DC(t) =        c(t,t)   -
                                     !tp(t_v)c(vt)expE_ftp(s_v)ds]dv
           -    {Y'[K(t) ]_)ft         Cu'tc(v,t) )/u[c(v!t) 3)expE-J'tp(s-v)ds)dv


in equilibrium. The first two terms on the right—hand side of (11) sum

to the difference between the consumption of the newly born and the

overall consumption of those who die at time t. The third term is just

the sum of the individual consumption changes dictated by the Euler

equation (B).

       The steady state is defined by DC                    DK     0. Without simplifying

assumptions, it is quite difficult to characterize the steady—state

allocation for this competitive economy. For example, if p(n) is a

constant p as in Merton (1971) and Blanchard (1985), and if u(c) =

               (R > 0), then it is easy to see that the steady—state real

interest rate rc =       y/(KL)        must satisfy rC              pR. (KL is the steady—

state capital stock in the competitive model when there is rio government

intervention.)

       The system becomes quite simple under Blarichards (1985) addi-

tional assumptions that R =                 1   (so that u(c) =   log(c)   ) ,   that   cohorts are

born without nonhuman wealth, and that all individuals of any age have

the same human wealth

               Sw(s)expt—,fEr(z)+p]dz)ds,
                                                  —8—


where w(t) is the real wage             at   t. When R      1, the consumption function

takes the form c(v,t)                (+p)Ca(v,t)]. The (constant) population is just

l/p and becaise aggregate human wealth (t) therefore equals h(t)/p and

aggregate noniuman wealth equals the capital stock K(t)                        (11) becomes


(13) DC(t) =      ('+p>h(t)      +   {V'EK(t))——p}U'+p)EH(t)+K(t)]
                          {Y'   [K(t) )—E}C(t)     — p (+p)K(t)

needed to support optimal growth paths as competitive equilibria. We

next discuss the meaning of "optimality1 and the implied intertemporal

resource allocation for a centrally—planned economy.



                     II. Time—Consistent Utilitarian Planning

        In this section we describe the objective function of a

utilitarian planner whose preferences admit time—consistent optimal

plans. The planner is utilitarian in the sense that his welfare objec-

tive is a weighted sum of the utilities of                  all   generations, including

those not yet born.

        Samuelson (1967. 1968) ,             building   on a suggestion of Lerner (1959),

was the first to study utilitarian planning in an economy with finitely—

lived overlapping generations. In the model of Samuelson (1968), a

generation lives for two periods and a new generation is born each

period until a known date T in the future. Thus, the last generation is

born on date 1—1.. If an individual born on date t enjoys lifetime

utility uEc(t,t),c(t,t+1)J, Samuelson's planner maximizes


       5(0) TIt[(tt) ,c(t,t+1H,
                                             —9—


subject to constraints discussed below, on date 0. The parameter

c(0,13 gives the rate at which the planner discounts future generations'

utility (wth 3            1   the Ramsey case). lthouqh Saniuelson assumes a

finite horzon, he characterizes a hypothetical steady—state allocation

satisfying first—order conditions for maximization of S(0).

           The welfare criterion 9(0) generally yields time—inconsistent

proqrams if the planner is constrained only by the initial capital stock

K(0) and the saving—investment relation K(t+l) —          K(t)   =   Y[K(t))   —
                                                                                   c(t,t)
—
    c(t—1,t)        In other words, for s ; 0, the consumption plan

{c(t,t),c,t+1)) maximizing 9(0) subject to resource constraints

does not maximize B(s) if followed from time s onward. The reason for

this is that the .Bamuelson criterion does not attach an appropriate

eght to tre welfare of the old generation alive at the start of the

plan. In each periods, maximization of B(s) requires that consumption

by the old be zero, even though this was not planned when 5(s—l) was

max i   ni z   ed


          Samuelson (196) in effect avoids time inconsistency by placing an

additional constraint on the planner: the requirement that the consump—

tlDn of the old in period s, c(s—1s), be taken as given. If this

predetermined consumption level for the old is interpreted as the level

envisioned in the previous period's optimal plan, the planner is forced

to pursue a time—consistent program. However, Samuelson does not offer

this interpretation, and no suggestion is made regarding social institu-

tions that might impose a time—consistency constraint.

          The welfare criterion introduced here avoids time inconsistency by

explicitly and appropriately accounting for the welfare of cohorts

already alive at the planning period's start. No dynamic—consistency

constraint is placed on the planner's actions. The social welfare func—
                                         — 1 0—




tion proposed in S;muel;on (1967)        also     avoid; time—inconsistency without

side constraints, but only under restrictive assumptions on individual

preference; that ;as. onie of the isues discussed below. (Samuelson

(1967) assumes that u[c(t,t),c(t,t+1)]             vCc(t,t) + vtc(t,t+l)], so

that individuals do not discount future utility.) It is noteworthy (but

not surprising) that the optimal plans explored below entail intertem—

poral and intergenerational allocation rules which generalize those

derived oy Samuelson (1967, 1968).

      Our planners objective is the sum of two components. First, there

is the lifetime expected utility of the generation; to be born as

measured from the moment of birth. Second, there is the expected

utility, over the reaainder of their lifetimes, of those cohort; cur-

rently alive. The remaining expected utility of a cohort currently alive

is. like that of a cohort to be born, measured from the perspective of

its birthdate. If it is assumed in addition that the planner discounts

generation; at a rate p > 0, the social welfare function is


(14) W(0)          (5uEc(v,t)]exp-ft[S+p(s-v))ds)dt)exp(-pv)dv

               + SU(.JuEc(v,t)]exp{_itEC+p(s_v)]ds)dt)exp(_pv)dv


at time t =   0.   W(0)   has   an alternative interpretation. Its first com-

ponent may be viewed as a weighted integral of instantaneous utilities

actually enjoyed by members of future generations, discounted to the

date of birth at the "risk—free" rate S.            (Recall that there is no aq—
        uncertainty.> The second component is the weighted integral of

utilite; to be enjoyed by living members of the current generations,

also discounted to their birthdates at rate C. The planners maximiza-

tion must be carried out subject to an initial capital endowment K(0)

and the constraint (10), which is repeated here (after substitution from
(9)) for converiience


(1) DK(t) =Y[K(t)] -      .ftc(v,t)expC_ftps_vds]dv.

          It may appear unnatural to discount the utility of those already

alive ack to their birthdates, rather than to the present. After all,

the planner is concerned with their welfare from the present (time t =

0) onward. However, this discounting scheme is necessary for the time

consistency of optimal intertemporal allocations. Unless those alive and

those to be born are treated symmetrically, the planner has an incentive

to   cha9e the consumpti on previ ously planned for unborn eneraUors once
they come into existence.'

        To appreciate the time inconsistency problem consider the

"natural social welfare function


(14') V(0) =
                (u[c(v,t))expC-!tU+p(s-v)]ds}dt)exp(-pv)dv            +


             S°(u[c(v,t)Jexp{-5[+ps-v             3ds)dt)exp[jUp(s_v)ds3exp(_pv)dv.


In (14'      the expected utility of the surviving members of current

generations is measured from the perspective of time 0. If it is           as-
sumed for simplicity that p(n) is a constant p, then for I > 0,


      V(0)     V(T) + J1(T)   +
                                  J7(T)   +   +




     An apparent alternative to (14) would treat current and future
     generations symmetrically by discounting all utility back to time 0.
     But this is equivalent to raising p to p +   in (14).
 8
     As noted above, Samuelson (1967) studies the maximization of a
     social welfare function similar to (14) in an overlapping—
     generations model with deterministic two—period lifetimes. However,
     he assumes a finite planning horizon, no individual time preference,
     and no generational preference on the part of the planner. In
     Bamuelsons framework, therefore, ' = 0, which would imply no dis-
     tinction between (14) and (14').

The         quantities ti a Q2 are predetermined as of time                  T, but J1(T) and

              are not. It follows        that a plan maximizing       V(O)   given   K(O) will

not in general maximize V(T) given the resulting K(T). The reason for

this is that any plan optimal at time                     must maximize V(T) +                ÷
                                                                                      J1(T)

V(T) +
                  J1(T)
                           +   J,(T).   planner with preferences described by (14') will

therefore be time inconsistent. Prriving at T with capital K(T), he will

prefer to maximize V(T) and so will deviate from the plan that maximized

V   (0)

              Yet another alternative to (14), particularly appealing when the

instantaneous death probability is a constant p, is to treat all those

alive at time zero as if they had just been born i.e., as if they were

all of vintage zero. It is easily verified that this 'egalitarian"

scheme, like (14'), generally yields a time—inconsistent optimum. The

exception occurs when p =                , so   that the planners objective is identi-

cal to a special case of (14), that in which consumption is optimally

equal across cohorts at any time.

              The time consistency of plans maximizing W(0) subject to the
constraints can be seen by noting that for T           0



           W(0) =   W(T) + R,   +



where


              =
                   r(5u[c(v,t> ]exp{tE+p(s_v)   dsidt)exp(-pv)dv,


           R2 = SU (J u[c(v,t)lexp{-!tU+p(s-v) lds}dt)exp(-pv)dv.


      and R.. are predetermined as of time T. It follows that any plan

maximizing W(0) iven K(0) must maximize W(T) given the implied value of

K(T,. Otherwise there would exist a plan yielding the same values of

KtT)   ,
           R1, and R2, but a higher value of W(T) . And this would contradict
                                                   9
the assumed optimality of the initial plan.

           An implication of our analysis is that the credibility of a plan-

ner will depend on the way he weights generations utilities. This

complication is not found in the Cass—Koopmans framework with nonover—

lapping generations. There, it is a matter of indifference whether the

planner discounts instantaneous utility according to the time at which

it    is   enjoyed or the generation that enjoys it. Here the distinction is
              10
cruci al.


       It should now be clear that there is a time—consistent analogue of
       the Samuelson criterion 3(0) which embodies the discounting conven-
       tion incorporated in our welfare measure W(0). That criterion is
       CuCc(—l,—1),c(—l,0)J/} +3(0), which is maximized at time 0 given
       the (predetermined) consumption level c(—l,—1) enjoyed in their
       youth by those currently old.
 10
       If one were to insist that optimal plans should be time consistent,
       our findings would give some guidance regarding admissible social
       welfare functions. This is reminiscent of Koopinans (196) discus-
       sion, where its is shown that a nonnegative planner's discount rate
       is required to ensure the existence of an optimal plan when popula-
       tion s growing. Note that our analysis would be unchanged if the
       discount rate applied by the planner to generation v at time t were
       expC—p(v—t)] (as in Cass and Koopmans) rather than exp[—pv].

                       iii. The Optimal lIocation over Tise

         The intartemporal resource allocation chosen by a time—consistent

utilitarian planner is studied in this section. That optrnum is qualIta-

tively    similar   to the one arising in the familiar Cass—Koopeans—Ramsey

qrowth problem with identical nonoverlapping generations, but here the

generational discount factor p determines the long—run marginal product

of capital, as suggested by Samuelson (1965).

         It is easiest to salve the planners problem of maximizing (14)

subject to (is) by the method of optimal control (rrow and Kurz, 1970).

4fter changing the order of integration, (14) may be written in the form


 l6 W(0) =             ulc (v,t) ]exp[-Stp(s-v)ds]exp[ (S-p)v]dv}exp   (-St)dt.


Equation (16) yields yet another interpretation of the planners objec-

tive. W(0)    is    just the discounted integral, over   all   future dates, of a

weighted sum of instantaneous utilities of those currently alive. The

planner applies the individual subjective discount factor S in weighting

the aggregate utility enjoyed on different dates. IR adding up utilities

enjoyed on a given date by agents of different ages, vintage is dis-

counted at the net rate S - p.11

         Let (t) denote the costate variable for the problem of maximizing

(16) subject to (1). Then the associated Hamiltanian is written




    The criterion (16) may be viewed as a discounted sum of static
    'Senthamite" social welfare functions again, see Samuelson (1967),
    Observe that even if u(.) is bounded the summands in (16) can be
    unbounded if the nenerational discount factor p is sufficiently
    large. In general, therefore, an optimal plan need not exist: one
    needs to assume that the welfare weight attached to previous gener-
    ations does not grow 'too quickly" relative to the rate at which
    members of those generations die and S. This problem can be avoided
    by postulating a finite age n such that F(n) = 1. Existence of an
    optimum is assumed in the discussion below.

         + (t){YCK(t)] - tc(v,t)expC_!tp(s_v)d5]dv].

         Necessary conditions for an ptimal plan are

(18) u'(c(v,t)3expE(—p)v] =           (t)
plus the equation of motion for the costate,


(19)    D7(t) = (t) U      — Y' [K(t) 3).


Equation    (18) implies that at any time t consumption evolves across
cohorts according to the equation

(.20) c(v,t)/v = —{u'Cc(v,t)3/u1tc(v,t)])( — p).

By (18) and (19), the consumption of a given cohort evolves over time
according    to


(21) c(v,t)/t =          —{u'Ec(v,t)/uEc(v,t)flCy'[K(t)]   —


         What is the meaning of equation (20)? 4s was noted earlier, the

difference        —
                      p can be viewed as the net rate at which the planner

discounts a given cohort's welfare according to its age. if an alloca-

tion is optimal, there must be no incentive to shift consumption between

cohorts at any time t. But this implies that the rate at which the

marginal utility of consumption changes as age rises (i.e., as v falls)
                  —
must equal            p. This is what equation (20) states. The case p =
yields   the '1egalitarian" plan mentioned in the previous section, under

which all individuals have the same consumption level at any point in

time.

         The intertemporal allocation condition (21) is identical to the

condition (8) achieved by the competitive economy. This, incidentally,
                                           —16--



can be used to show the Pareto efficiency of               the       market allocation

since population growth is zero and the marginal product of                          capital       is

always positive). What is the rationale for (21) in a planning context?

For an agent 'of vintage v, the sum           +    p(t—v) is the instantaneous

expected—utility cost, at time t, of          pcstponing consumption. If the
government shifts one unit of a given c.ohort's consumption into the

future, the instantaneous return on the investment to those left alive

is Y'EK(t))        + p(t—v) because the proceeds are divided among a smaller

group. Since the net return available to the government equals that

offered by the insurance company, the rate at which a cohorts marginal

utility changes aver time must equal               +   p(t—v)    —    Y'[K(t)]   —
                                                                                     p(t—v)    =


— i'[K(t)),        as in the competitive allocation.

         The solution to the planning problem is quite general, in that no

special assumptions about the form of the instantaneous utility function

u(.) are required. To make the nature of the solution more transparent,

it is    useful to analyze first a special case. We then show that the main
iaplications of this special case also hold in general.

         Assume temporarily that u(.) belongs to the constant relative risk

aversion class, 'so that —cu/u'            R. Then conditions (20) and (21) yield

a simple characterization of the behavior of aggregate consumption C(t)

along an optimal path. Differential equation (20) now has the solution


22)     c(v,t)     =   c(t,t)exp[U'—p)(v—t)/RJ.

Aggregate consumption at time t may therefore be expressed as


(23)    C(t)   =   c(t,t).ItexpC_(1/R)!tU_p+Rp(s_v)lds}dv

(cf. (9)). The convergence condition iintexp{SCp__Rp(s)3ds} = 0 is

imposed to ensure that (23) is well defined. Without this convergence

condition an optImal plan would not exist (see footnote 11).

       Differentiation   shows that the coefficient of c(t,t) in (23) is

constant cier time. Thus, aggregate consumption and the consumption of

the newly born are proportional, so that


(24> DC(t)/C(t) =   Dc(t,t)/c(t,t).

Combining (21) and (22), we find that


(25> Dc(t.t)Ic(tqt)      (1/R)Y'[K(t)] — P).


Epuatians   (24) and (25) now show that the central planner will cause

aggregate consumption to evolve according to the rule


(26) DC(t)1C(t) =   (1/R){Y'EK(t)3    —
                                           p3.


This   is identical to the condition that would govern the evolution of

aggregate consumption in the standard Cass—Koopmans—Ramsey

representative—agent planning model with discount rate p.

       Equations   (15) and (26) describe the aggregate dynamics implied by

utilitarian planning. These dynamics may be pictured with the aid of

figure 1. Aggregate consumption equals ouput along the UK = 0 locus so

the capital stock is stationary there. On the DC = 0 locus aggregate

consumption is stationary (although individuals consumption levels may

change over time). The system is saddlepoint stable as usual, with a

unique path 55 converging to the steady state equilibrium E*. 55 yields

the optimal initial aggregate consumption level C(0) associated with any

given initial capital stock K(0). The optimal steady—state capital stock

K* is determined by the condition


(27. Y' cK) =
                                         -18—


and thus depends only on the production function and the rate at which

the planner discounts according to age. Optimal steady—state consumption

is of course given by


(28) C* =     ((K*).

It is noteworthy that condition (27) is the same as that derived by

Samuelson (1968) in a model where the planner is constrained to pursue a

time—consistent plan. Indeed conditions (20) and (21) also have

                         rn 4rmrwrn-L
        The main results    of the   constant relative risk aversi on case can

be generalized. In particular the steady state described by (27) and

(28) is independent of the instantaneous utility function u(.), and the

consumptions of all cohorts rise or fall inonotonically along the transi—

tion path. While it is no longer possible in general to express the

economy's dynamics in terms of aggregate consumption and the capital

stocks an alternative two—variable representation can be developed.

        These assertions are established as follows. Use necessary condi-

tion (18) to write c(v,t) as


(29) c(v,t)         (t)exp[(p—)v]), $1           0.

Recall that aggregate consumption is given by equation (9). After a
change of variables from v to n =       t   —   v (i.e., from 'vintage' to "age")

(9) becomes


       C(t) =
                  !c(t—n,t)expC—fp (s)ds]dn,

so that upon substitution of (29) we have


(30)   C(t)   =    4C?(t)exp[ (p-)t]expt-(p-)n]}exoE-.fp(s)ds]dn.
                                               —19—


Define q(t)        (t)exp[(p—)t]. Then (29) and (30) imply that aggregate

consumption can be written as a declining function of q(t), CCT)(t)].

       Equation (15) may now be expressed in The form


(31) DK(t) =       YEK(t)) — Ctq(t)].

Differentiation af q(t) and application of (19) show that


(32)   Dq(t)   =   q(t)C   —   Y'CK(t)]}   +   r(t)(p —   = q(t)Cp   —   Y'[K(t)]}.

Equation (32) is identical to the dynamic equation for the costate

variable in the standard representative—agent model with time—preference

rate p.

        The phase diagram for the system in r?(t)         and K(t> described by

enuations (31) and (32) is shown in figure 2. Because C(q*) = K*, where

q* is the steady—state value of q, aggregate consumption and the capital

stock converge toward the stationary values C* and K* defined by (27)

and (2B). The qualitative behavior of consumption is the same as in the

constant relative risk aversion case of figure 1, both in the aggregate

and at the cohort level.



                                IV. Optimal Fiscal Policy

        The goal of this section is to show how fiscal policy can be used

to decentralize optimal utilitarian plans in the competitive economy of

section 1. Because the competitive equilibrium without government inter-

vention is efficient1 only lump sum taxes need be used to generate the

optimal plan as a competitive equilibrium. However, the tax an in-

dividual pays will in general vary according to his age and calendar

time. To keep the analysis simple we consider only balanced—budget

fiscal policy. Equivalent policies could involve government debt issue,

     L



         K
but this is not discussed explicitly below.

        To make the main points it is sufficient to work with a special

case ot the model, that studied by Blancard (1985). It is therefore

assumed once aoain that the instantaneous death probability is a con-

stant p, that the instantaneous utility function is logarithmic, and

that individuals are born with human wealth only. The last paragraphs of

section I discuss individual and aggregate behavior in this case when

there is no government intervention, and the reader may wish to review

them before proceeding.

        Given an initial capital stock K(O) ,             the optimal plan generates

paths CK(t) for capital and {C(t)}.3 for aggregate consumption.

These in turn yield paths for the shadow real interest rate r(t) =

'I'EK(t)),   the shadow wage w(t) =           p'YCK(t)]   —
                                                              K(t>Y'CK(t)J)4   and the

shadow present value of per capita wage income h(t) (given by (12), and

the same for all agents alive at time t) . To decentralize the optimal

intertemooral allocation, the government must endow each agent at birth

with a transfer stream inducing the desired consumption levels when the

shadow price paths Cr(t)}0 and CW(t))ç3 are expected. Let T(v,t)

denote the transfer payment received by an agent of vintage v at time t,

and let b(v,t) denote the present value of these payments at time t

given the expected real—interest rate path. We will consider fiscal

policies having the property that the qovernments budget is balanced on

each date t4 so that net transfers to the public are zero:

        t
L3) S (v,t)exp[—p(t—v)]dv                U.



        The present value of transfers faced by an agent born at time t =

O   is b(O!O) .    That individuals consumption is therefore


(34) c(O,O)       = (I'+p) [h(O) +   b(O,O)
                                                     •1
                                                     I-



when u(c.         log(c); and, if optimality condition (20) holds at t = 0,


(35)    c(v,()    =   (i'+p)[h(OY   +   k(v,0)   +        b(v,0)3
         =   (+p) [h(0)      + b (0,0) ]exp[ (—p)v).


Since aggregate consumption              at t = 0 must equal the optimal level C(0)

integration      of (35)      over the population leads to


(35) b(0,0) =         C   U+p—p)/(+p) 3C(0) — h(O)


Equation 35)          implies   that the transfer streams of those born before t =

0 have present values given by



(37) b(v,0)           Ch(0) +   b(0,0)3expE(-p)v]              -    h(0) - k(v,0).

        After    the transfer streams for those alive at t = 0 are announced

by the government, its only remaining choice variables are the transfer

payments to be made to those born on subsequent dates. Suppose these are

chosen in such a way that the budget is balanced on each date (i.e.

(33)    holds)    and


(38) b (t ,t) =       Eh t: + b (00)     Jexp {Str        (s) -p]ds} - h Ct).

The resulting competitive equilibrium will                          then   replicate the optimal
plan.
         To verify this result, it must be shown that the implied cohort

consumption paths satisfy (20) and (21). (We have already seen that the

correct initial consumption levels will prevail.) By the individual's

Euler equation (8), it will automatically be the case that for t                              v



(39) c(v,t) =         c(v,v>exptttCr(s)-flds,
where c(vv) = (&+p)Eh(v)        +   b(v,v)].   It therefore follows from (38)   that

                  (+p)Eh(0) +
(40) c(v,t)                         b(0,0)3exp(r[r(s)-)dsexpE(-p)v].
In the case v < 0, (37) implies that (40) holds for all t 0. Equations
(20) and (21) follow immediately upon differentiation of (40).
      For the sake of intuition, it is useful to analyze the balanced—
budget fiscal policy       that supports the steady    state pictured in figure 1
as a competitive equilibrium. ssume, therefore, that the capital stock

is initially at the level K* defined by equation (27).

      Let us first ask why K* would generally not be a steady—state

equilibrium without government intervention. To be concrete, take the

case Y' (K*) = p =    &. If   the interest rate and the wage were expected to

remain constant at         and w* foreverq each agent in a new cohort would be

born with total (human) wealth


(41) h(t) =     w*I(+p) = p(Y(K*)      —




(by (12)) and his lifetime consumption path would be flat at           the level
p[Y(K*)   —   Y'(K*)K*].   Asymptotically aggregate consumption would clearly

approach labor's share in national output; and because labor's share is

less than total output, this is inconsistent with goods—market equi-

librium in a steady state. In the competitive steady state, Y1(Kc) > 8.

Each cohort's consumption thus rises over time (by (8)) so that ag-

gregate consumption equals the lower level of national output.

          Return now to the decentralization problem. Since we are assuming

a steady state, the payment received by an individual depends on age t—v

only, and so may be written as T(t—v). The present value of these pay-

ments given the expected path of the real interest rate, b(v,t), may be

written as b(t—v) in the present context. It is assumed as before that
                                              n7
                                              - -J



the qovernments budget is balanced. This condition is now written


(42) 5t7(t_v)expE_p(t_v)]dv              0



       To support the optimal steady state associated with p as an equi—

librium, fiscal policy must confront each agent with a transfer path

inducing aggregate consumption equal                 to Y(K*) when the     interest rate is

expected to remain at Y'(K*)             p -forever Let k(t—v) denote the capital

held by an agent of age t—v (of course k(0) =                    0). Since all agents have
the    same wage income the consumptIon               a-f an   indivi dual aged t—v is

(43) c(t—v)         p(+p)CY(K*)        Y'(K*)K*]/(p+p) + (+p)Ck(t—v) +

where


(44) b(t-v) = S7(s-v)exp[-(p+p)(s-t)]ds.

Integrating    (43)   over the entire population, we find that aggregate
consumption    is



(45)    C(t)   ('+p) [Y(K*)   —   V'   (K*)K*lI   cp+p)

         + (+p) {K* + ftb (t-v)exp[-p (t-v) ]dv3-.

Equate the value of C(t) given by (45) to Y(K*) and recall (44. This
yields

(46)
                              =   E(p—)/(p+pH+p)3Y(K*)               —
                                                                         pf(p+pMK*.

        To make sense of the implied fiscal policy we need to interpret the

left—hand side of (46). 4fter hanqing the order of integration, this

nay be written in the farm


(47) !T(n)Cfexp(-ps)expE-(p+p)(n-s)]ds3dn
                                            -24—


                                 =
                                     (1/p)S7(n)exp[-(p+p)n][exp(pn>
                                                                      -   l]dn.

The left—hand        side of    (47) is just a weighted sum of the transfer pay-

ments made    at     each age n. The weiht given to (n) is in turn a sum,

each term of which equals the number of agents in a cohort of age n—s (s

  0) times the discount factor each applies to 'r(n). By the government

budget constraint (42) (46) and (47) can be combined to yield a formula

giving the optimal present value of government transfers at birth


                                                      -
(48) S3T(n)expC-(p+p>nldn =           £pp!(p+p))K*

       Any transfer path C,r(n)}W0         that    simultaneously satisfies (42) and

(48)   will   induce a level of aggregate consumption that is constant at

Y(K*i. in general, many such paths exist. Before concluding that the

problem of decentralizing the steady state has been solved, it is neces-

sary to check the optimality condition (20> governing the allocation of

consumption among contemporary cohorts. But by the individual Euler

condition (8)


(49) c(t—y)/t = c(t—v)EY' (K*) —


Condition     (20>    follows   immediately from the observations that c/t =

—c!iv    in a steady state and that Y'(K*) = p.

        Equation (48) allows us to determine whether a newborn agent's

discounted lifetime transfers b(0) will be positive or negative under

optimal fiscal policy. Direct calculation shows that


(50)   b(0>     0 as p .        + p(+p)[K*IY(K*)].


By (13), however, the steady—state real interest rate in the absence of

fiscal intervention is V' (KC) =            + p(+p) [Kd/Y(Kc)]. It follows from

(50)   that   the government must set b(0) positive if it wishes to maintain
a stationary capital stock K* greater than the laissez—faire level

and must set b(O) negative in the opposite case. In other words, addi—

tional capital accumulation require negative (unfunded) social

security, an unsurprising result in view of those obtained by Diamond

(1965).   Faced at birth with a declining path of transfer payments, each

agent accumulates capital so as to smooth his consumption. By setting

the path of transfers according to (48) the government can equate

aggregate saving to zero.

      The foregoing results are underlined by considernq again the

special case p =   '. Under    this temporary assumption, (48) reduces to


(51> b(O)     ipK*/(&'+p) =   pY' (K*)K*/(&+p).

Equation (51) states that the transfer system endows each agent at birth

with the per capita present discounted value of capital's share in

national income so that, by (41), a(O) = h(O) + b(O) =     pY(K*)/U+p).
Individual consumption is flat at pY(K*) , and a declining path of trans-

fers induces a flow demand for capital just equal to flow supply "be-

queathed to the economy by those who die.



                                  V. Conclusion

      This paper has studied the problen of time—consistent utilitarian

planning in an economy where individual lifetimes are stochastic.

dynamically consistent optimal allocation is characterized by a general-

ized version of Samuelson's (1968) 'two—part golden rule". However, the

economy's aggregate dynamics are quite similar to those arising in the

planning models of Cass (1965), Koopmans (1965), and Ramsey (1928)

which postulate homogeneous nonoverlapping generations. Through ap-

propriate lump—sum transfers, the optimal allocation can be realized as
the equilibrium of a competitive economy with actuarially fair an-

nuities.
