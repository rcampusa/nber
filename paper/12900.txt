Industrial revolution is fundamentally linked with the rise of factories and the decline of skilled artisans
in manufacturing. Most scholars agree that factories as compared to artisan shops were intensive in
unskilled labor. Indeed, the hallmark of the early factories is the utilization of division of labor of relatively
unskilled workers. This paper explores whether the massive influx of unskilled immigrants between
1840 and 1920, by significantly increasing the ratio of unskilled to skilled labor endowment, contributed
to the growth and spread of factory manufacturing in the United States. The data indicate that immigration
not only contributed to the growth and spread of factories but it also contributed to the growth of cities.

I. Introduction

        The century between 1820 and 1920 defined America as a nation of immigrants or a

“melting pot.” During this century, more than 33 million people entered the ports of the United

States. Immigrants from Europe came in massive waves until the era of open immigration ended

with the passage of the 1921 Emergency Quota Act (Figure 1). 1 By the end of the first three

decades of immigration, the census of 1850 finds that almost 10% of Americans was foreign-

born. The share of the foreign-born population fluctuated around 13-15% between 1860 and

1920, but immigrants and their children represented 30-40% of the white population (Figure 2).

With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1965, immigration rose steadily during the last three

decades. However, this recent wave of immigration pales in comparison to that of the earlier

waves in duration and in terms of the share of aggregate population (Figure 3).

        What impact did immigration have on the American economy during the era of mass

immigration? Goldin (1994) and Hatton and Williamson (1998) find that immigrants and natives

were substitutes; immigration lowered native wages and displaced natives from the northeastern

United States where immigrants largely settled. 2 Studies on immigrant assimilation generally

find that immigrants earned lower wages on arrival but provide different assessments on their

rates of assimilation. While Hannon (1982), Eichengreen and Gemery (1986) and Hanes (1996)

find that wage growth among immigrants was slower than native-born workers, Blau (1980),

Hatton (1997), and Minns (2000) find that immigrants experienced faster wage growth than


1 The movement to restrict immigration in the U.S. started in the late nineteenth century. Between 1897 and 1917,
the House and the Senate passed numerous bills on literacy tests which finally became law in 1917. When literacy
tests proved to be ineffective in curbing immigration, the Congress moved toward a quota system. See Hingham
(1955) and Goldin (1994).
2 Friedberg and Hunt (1995) provide an excellent summary of the literature, especially of works on the impact of
immigration on the second half of the twentieth century. Most studies on recent immigration find that immigrants
and natives are substitutes. Some studies such as Borjas (1999) and Borjas, Freeman and Katz (1997) find large
negative impact whereas Card (2001) finds small impact. On the other hand, Ottaviano and Peri (2005a, 2000b)

native-born and caught up to native-born level of earnings within 20 or 25 years. For the

antebellum period, Ferrie (1999) finds that immigrants were geographically, occupationally and

financially mobile. 3 However, from an aggregate perspective, because American real wages rose

steadily between 1820 and 1920, many scholars such as Goldin (1994) point to the absorptive

capacity of the American economy (Figure 4). 4

         In this paper, I explore whether immigration had a more fundamental impact on the

American economy between 1860 and 1920. In particular, I investigate whether immigration

during this period had a significant impact on the growth and spread of factory organization in

manufacturing. Between 1820 and 1840, when factory production was still in its infancy in

America, immigration may have hindered the spread of factories as many skilled European

artisans sought refuge from the spread of European factory production by moving to America.

Immigration after 1840, however, is likely to have contributed to the growth of factories as it

significantly increased the unskilled to skilled labor endowment in America. Because factory

production utilized unskilled workers intensely, the dramatic increase in unskilled to skilled

labor endowment ratio is likely to have had a significant impact on the growth of factory



argue that immigrants and natives are complements and that immigrants had a positive impact on native wages.
3 Ferrie (1999) provides a richly detailed study of the immigrant experience by constructing a sample of immigrants
from passenger ship lists who entered through New York city in the 1840s and located in the census of populations
in 1850 and 1860. By 1850, most immigrants reached their intended destinations (New York, Ohio, and
Pennsylvania) and only 17% remained in the vicinity of New York city. Relative to the native population,
immigrants were initially disproportionately represented as skilled artisans and unskilled laborers. About a quarter of
immigrants moved downwards in occupational status, but the dominant tendency was to move upwards. The Irish,
compared to the British and Germans, were least mobile both geographically and occupationally.
4 Data on real wages were constructed from various sources such as Coombes (1926), Aldrich and Week’s series
from Long (1960), Rees (1961), Lebergott (1964), and Margo (2000). The nominal values were converted to real
wages using the BLS CPI from the Historical Statistics of the United States (1975). Aldrich, Weeks, Rees, and
Lebergott series are the average earnings in all manufacturing, Coombes series is the average earnings of unskilled
workers in manufacturing, and Margo series is the average earnings of common laborers in the Northeast. The ratio
of skilled to unskilled wages seems to have fluctuated without any visible trend between 1820 and 1860 based on the
ratio of wages of artisans and common laborers in the Northeast (Margo (2000)) but seems to have narrowed
between 1890 and 1940 (Goldin and Katz (1999), Goldin and Margo (1992)). Also see Williamson and Lindert
(1980).

production in the United States. 5

         The industrial revolution, which began in England and spread to elsewhere in Europe and

to the United States, is fundamentally linked with the rise of factories and the decline of skilled

artisans in manufacturing (Mokyr (2002)). While there are many theories on the rise of factories,

this paper emphasizes the importance of the unskilled intensity of factory production. 6 It is

widely believed that factories substituted skilled artisans with the division of labor of unskilled

workers who specialized in a limited number of tasks (Sokoloff (1984), Atack (1987), Goldin

and Katz (1998), Atack, Bateman and Margo (2005)). 7 In the United States, in the early

industrial period (1820-1840), factories in New England utilized the unskilled labor of women

and children (Goldin and Sokoloff (1982)); however, in the second industrial revolution (1860-

1920), unskilled immigrant laborers were the dominant factory manufacturing labor force.


5 Beginning with Habakkuk (1962), there is an extensive literature on skilled-biased technology in American
history. For Habakkuk, labor scarcity rather than immigration of unskilled workers caused the early adoption of
mechanized factory production in America as compared to Britain. For Rosenberg (1972), the American system of
manufacturing was biased toward resource intensive technologies due to its abundant resources. Goldin and Katz
(1998) interpret the works of James and Skinner (1985) and Cain and Patterson (1986) as providing evidence for the
existence of technology-unskilled complementarity in the nineteenth century U.S. manufacturing. These works
indicate that physical capital, raw material and unskilled labor were complements and that they substituted for
skilled artisans. To the contrary, Williamson and Lindert (1990) argue that physical capital was a complement to
skilled rather than to unskilled labor during this period (also see Temin (1966) and David (1975)). In this paper, I
highlight the role of the relative supplies of skilled and unskilled workers as in Goldin and Katz (1998) and
Acemoglu (1998). The empirical estimation in this paper is motivated by Acemoglu’s model which predicts that an
increase in the supply of unskilled (skilled) workers increases the technologies used by unskilled (skilled) workers.
Thomas (1954) and Erickson (1957) believed that immigration contributed to the growth of factories in the U.S.
Acemoglu (1998) suggests that the increase in the supply of unskilled workers from villages and Ireland to English
cities, as documented by Williamson (1990), may have played a role in the rise of factories in England as well.
Finally, Lewis (2003, 2006) finds that immigration had an impact on the direction of American technology in the
second half of the twentieth century.
6 Mokyr (1999, 2002) provides an excellent summary of the literature on the British industrial revolution. Mokyr
(2002) examines three main classes of explanations for the rise of factories: fixed costs and physical economies of
scale, information costs and incentives and labor effort. However, he argues that the most compelling explanation for
the rise of factories is based on ideas developed by Demsetz (1988) and Becker and Murphy (1992), namely that
“division of labor is limited by the size of the knowledge set necessary to execute and operate best-practice
techniques.” While workers possessed different skill endowments, factories served as repository of technical
knowledge and reduced the costs of transmitting this knowledge to individual workers.
7 According to Atack, Bateman and Margo (2004), the factory system through division of labor shortened the period
of skill acquisition and contributed to the de-skilling of workers. Thus, the factory system was well adapted to utilize
the abundance of unskilled immigrant workers. Consistent with the de-skilling hypothesis or the intense utilization of
unskilled workers, Atack, Bateman and Margo find that average wages of firms fell with increases in firm size.


                                                           5
        The pace and the skill composition of immigrants differed greatly between the early and

late industrial period in the United States (Tables 1 and 2). In the early period of industrialization

between 1820 and 1840, the pace of immigration was modest and most of the immigrants were

skilled artisans and were relatively wealthy. In the transition period between the early to late

industrialization, the rate of immigration rose dramatically and a great majority of immigrants

were unskilled farmers, laborers and servants. Although the pace of immigration fluctuated and

the sources of immigrants shifted from northwestern to central and southeastern Europe by the

second industrial revolution, a majority of immigrants remained unskilled workers. Thus,

immigration between 1846 and 1920 significantly increased the unskilled to skilled labor

endowment ratio in the United States.

        One major issue is whether factory jobs “pulled” immigrants to the United States or

whether immigrants endogenously changed the direction of American technology toward factory

organization of production. My principal identification strategy rests on the exogeneity or the

“push” factor of immigration between 1847-1854, a period which marked the first major wave of

mass immigration. Many scholars agree that the most important cause of immigration during this

period was the potato famine in Ireland and in other European countries (Ó Gráda and O’Rourke

(1997), Cohn (2000), Hatton and Williamson (2005)). The potato famine, caused by p. infestans,

a fungus-like disease that turns the potato into inedible black mush, reduced the acreage of

potato in Ireland from 2.1 million acres in 1845 to a mere 0.3 million in 1847 causing massive

deaths and emigration (Ó Gráda (1999), Mokyr (1985)).

        The instruments used in this paper are the share of foreign-born population in 1850 and

the growth in the foreign-born population between 1850 and 1860. 8 Because a large share of


8 The growth in the foreign-born population between 1850 and 1860 is likely to capture the large inflow of German


                                                        6
immigration prior to the antebellum period occurred during the famine period, the share of

foreign-born population in 1850 should be highly correlated with the share of immigrants

induced by the potato famine. The total numbers of immigrants between 1846 and 1850 equaled

that of the entire period between 1820 and 1845; in addition, the Irish foreign-born represented

almost 43% of all foreign-born population in 1850 (Gibson and Lennon (1999)). 9 The growth in

the foreign-born population between 1850 and 1860 should also be correlated with the famine-

induced immigration as the number of immigrants between 1851 and 1854 were one and a half

times greater than the number between 1855 and 1860.

         Data on the occupation of immigrants during the mid-nineteenth century provide little

evidence for the proposition that these first wave of immigrants was “pulled” by factory jobs in

the United States. Cohn (1992), based on data from passenger lists from ships which arrived in

New York between 1836-1853, finds that a majority of English immigrants were unskilled and

less than 5% of them possessed prior industrial experience. 10 Relative to the English population,

immigrants were over-represented as farmers and laborers but under-represented in almost all

other occupational categories (Table 3). For a sample of immigrants who came in the 1840s,

Ferrie (1999) finds that a majority of the Irish came as unskilled laborers, the British as unskilled


immigration between 1852 and 1854 sparked by the political repression following the unsuccessful 1848 revolution
(Atack and Passell (1994)). In addition, as compared to studies such as Altonji and Card (1991) and others which use
historic shares of foreign-born as instruments, the historic level of share of foreign-born in 1850 and the growth of
foreign-born population between 1850 and 1860 are much more likely to be exogenous.
9 It is important to note that immigration data between 1820 and 1860 were incomplete and subject to both under-
and over-enumeration. No data were collected for immigrants arriving from Canada, Mexico and Pacific ports and
the data included transients bound for territories outside of the U.S. and double counted merchants and visitors who
made more than one return voyage from Europe. Of these factors, the most important factor was the under-
enumeration of immigration flow through Canada. Between 1810-1839, a large share of immigrants to the United
States arrived at St. Lawrence ports (see McClelland and Zeckhauser (1982)). Before 1865, about half of UK
immigrants, especially the poor, may have come through Canada because the fare to Canadian maritime ports was
less than half of that to American ports (Ferrie (1999)).
10 There is considerable anecdotal evidence that most skilled immigrants were artisans rather than factory managers,
mechanics or operatives. As the rise of factory production in Europe displaced artisans in Europe, they moved to
America. Thus, the arrival of skilled artisans may have delayed the onset of industrial revolution in American cities.
However, as factory production gained momentum in the United States, there is evidence that skilled artisans


                                                          7
laborers and skilled artisans and Germans as farmers and skilled artisans.

        While the long-run ebb and flow of immigration was due to the combination of “push”

and “pull” factors, one additional exogenous factor which significantly increased the share of

unskilled immigrants is related to major advances in transportation. 11 First, advances in internal

transportation due to railroads provided easy access to major ports for most European

populations (Hatton and Williamson (2005)). Second, the advances in steamship technology

made the trans-Atlantic travel shorter, safer, and easier to get in and out of secondary ports in the

Mediterranean (Cohn (2005), Keeling (1999)). Third, the passenger costs relative to per capita

income fell significantly between 1820 and 1860 (Galenson (1984)).

        My second identification strategy utilizes the fact that most immigrants entered the

United States through New York and used domestic transportation networks to reach their

intended destinations. Between 1850 and 1914, 70% of immigrants arrived via the ports in New

York (Keeling (1999)); and many immigrants moved immediately from the port of entry to

internal destinations (Ferrie (1999)). Distance from New York city and access to water

transportation in 1850 are likely to capture the influence of transportation costs on immigrant

settlement patterns. It is important to note that New York city became the dominant mercantile

port and later the port of entry for immigrants long before it became an industrial city (Albion

(1939)). However, distance from New York city and access to water transportation in 1850 may

also be correlated with access to markets for manufacturers.

        To determine whether immigrants contributed to the growth and spread of unskilled-

biased technology embodied in factory-assembly production, I use data of manufacturing firms

drawn from the manuscripts of the decennial censuses between 1850 and 1880 which have been


became managers and foreman of factories suggesting complementarities between immigrant artisans and laborers.



                                                       8
merged with county-level information from the censuses of populations from the same respective

years. 12 Data analysis suggests that immigration between 1850 and 1920 may have had a

fundamental impact on the direction of American technology. The data reveal that firms in

counties with a higher share of foreign-born were much more likely to be organized as factories

and were generally larger. In addition, firms in these counties were also more productive and

were likely to pay higher average wages to their workers. Standard tests of the instruments

indicate their general validity and that the 2SLS estimates are generally similar to those of

ordinary regression estimates.

        The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the model, empirical strategy and

data analysis on the impact of immigration on unskilled biased technology as embodied in

factories. Section III examines the immigrant diversity of occupations by nationality. Section IV

studies immigration and urbanization. Section V concludes.



II. Endowments and Technology

        Industrial development in the United States exhibited three major production

technologies: artisan shops (1790-1820), factory-assembly (1820-1920), and factory-continuous

(1920- ). Prior to the industrial revolution, skilled artisans produced the entire product with the

help of apprentices and family members. With the industrial revolution, factories hired numerous

unskilled workers who specialized in few tasks based on division of labor and few skilled

workers who operated machines and supervised workers. In the first half of the twentieth

century, however, the factory-continuous method began to replace the factory-assembly system


11 See Thomas (1954) and Hatton and Williamson (1998).
12 The firm-level manuscript data were constructed by Jeremy Atack, Fred Bateman and Thomas Weiss; Michael
Haines generously provided the merged data set. For discussions on sampling criteria and other pertinent concerns
related to the firm-level data, see Atack and Bateman (1999), Atack, Bateman and Margo (2004, 2005), and Kim


                                                         9
in a number of industries (Goldin and Katz (1998), Jerome (1924)). Unlike the earlier factories,

the new factory-continuous system was intensive in skilled rather than unskilled workers. With

the advent of electric motors, mechanization replaced the division of labor of unskilled workers.

         Whereas Goldin and Katz (1998) examine the shift in production from factory-assembly

to the factory-continuous methods, I examine the shift from artisan shop to the earlier factory

system based on unskilled division of labor. 13 The empirics of this paper is motivated by

Acemoglu’s (1998) model of endogenous technological change. The model assumes that there

are two types of workers, skilled (H) and unskilled (L), who supply labor inelastically. The

consumption good is produced from two complementary production process, one using skilled

and the other using unskilled. Firm level technology, Ah or Al, is determined by technology

employed by the firm where skilled and unskilled workers are assumed to use different

technologies. The main result of Acemoglu’s model is summarized by the following equation:

Ah/Al = f(p, H/L) where p=ph/pl. In this model, an increase in the relative supply of a skill type

will lead to an improvement in the technologies that uses that particular skill type. Thus, an

exogenous increase in the supply of skilled (unskilled) workers will lead to an improvement in

technologies which utilize skilled (unskilled) workers. 14

         In this paper, I assume that the adoption of the factory method of production signifies the

increase in the use of unskilled intensive technology and also assume that the share of foreign-

born population (FB/(FB+NB)) is a useful measure of the relative supply of unskilled to skilled


(2005).
13 Goldin and Katz (1998) suggests that the growth in the supply of skilled labor due to the sudden growth in high
school educated workers may have fueled skilled-biased technology toward the factory-continuous batch production.
In addition, the supply of unskilled workers fell dramatically during this period as immigration slowed to a trickle.
14 The intuition of the model is as follows: when there are more unskilled workers, then the market for unskilled-
complementary technologies, such as factories, is larger. As a result, more resources will be devoted to the invention
of unskilled-complementary technologies. In this model, Acemoglu (1998) shows that the impact on wages is
dynamic. Initially, the shift in supply of unskilled workers will lower unskilled wages; however, as the “directed



                                                         10
workers (L/H). The share of foreign-born population is subject to two important sources of

measurement errors: (1) not all foreign-born workers are unskilled and (2) not all native-born

workers are skilled. However, these measurement errors, to the extent that they are important,

are both likely to bias the estimates downwards.

         To investigate whether immigration influenced the adoption of factory production in U.S.

manufacturing, I estimate the following equations:

(1) Factoryijc = α0 + α1 Fgn-Bornc + α2 Fijc + dj +ds + uijc

(2) ln[Firmsize]ijc = α0 + α1 Fgn-Bornc + α2 Fijc + dj +ds + uijc

where Factoryijc is equal to 1 if firm size is greater than 15 workers and 0 otherwise, firm size is

defined as one plus the number of male, female and child employees, and i, j, c, s indexes firm,

industry, county and state, respectively. The independent variables are the share of foreign-born

population in county c, firm-level (Fijc) characteristics such as the capital-labor ratio, the share of

male workers and whether a firm used steam-power or water-power rather than hand-power.

Goldin and Katz (1998) believe that the shift from artisan to factory system probably involved an

increase in capital-labor intensity. Since firms in some industries may be more likely organized

as factories because of industry-specific differences in fixed cost or because they are located in

certain regions with access to specialized raw materials, the regressions include 3-digit industry

(dj) and state fixed-effects (ds).

         In addition, I estimate whether firms in counties with higher levels of immigrant workers

were more productive and paid higher wages using the following equations:

(3) ln[Wage]ijc = α0 + α1 Fgn-Bornc + α2 Fijc + dj +ds + uijc

(4) ln[LP]ijc = α0 + α1 Fgn-Bornc + α2 Fijc + dj +ds + uijc


technology effect” shifts the relative demand of unskilled workers, wages of unskilled workers will rise over time.


                                                         11
where wage and labor productivity (LP) are average wages and output per worker of firms,

respectively. To the extent that immigration leads to the adoption of superior factory-assembly

production technologies based on division of labor, workers in immigration abundant counties

should be more productive and earn higher wages.

       To estimate equations (1)-(4), I use a data set which merges the Atack-Bateman-Weiss

(ABW) sample of manufacturing firms drawn from the manuscripts of the decennial censuses for

1850, 1860, 1870 and 1880 with the respective U.S. decadal censuses of population. The ABW

data set contains information on manufacturing firms such as output, capital, labor, raw

materials, wages, and primary power source and are categorized by the standard industrial code

at the 3-digit industry level. The county-level census data contain a rich array of information

such as population, foreign-born population and various economic and demographic

characteristics. The samples were restricted to firms with positive values of output, employment

and capital. To eliminate potential outliers in the data, I also excluded firms with gross output

less than $500 and those with extremely low and high wages (Atack, Bateman and Margo

(2004), Kim (2006)).

       Table 4 presents data on county population characteristics from the censuses of

population. The number of counties in the U.S. grew from 1623 to 2613 and the average

population of these counties also rose steadily from 14,290 to 19,208. The foreign-born share of

the population rose from 5.9% to 11.5% between 1850 and 1870 and then fell slightly to 10.7%

in 1880. The average urban share of the county population rose from 3.8% to 8.1% between

1850 and 1880. From a regional perspective, the share of foreign-born was the highest in the

Pacific and Mountain counties followed by Middle Atlantic, East North Central, New England

and West North Central counties and was the lowest in the southern counties. The share of



                                                 12
natives who were born out of state was lowest in counties in New England, Middle Atlantic,

South Atlantic and West South Central and rose markedly in counties in the Western regions.

       Table 5 shows that factory organization of production and the size of firms in the ABW

sample rose from 10% to 16% and 4.76 to 5.75 between 1850 and 1880, respectively. The

average nominal wages, labor productivity and capital intensity rose between 1850 and 1870 and

then fell slightly in 1880. Firms that used steam-power increased whereas those that used water-

power decreased over time. The share of male intensity in manufacturing remained constant.

Finally, the average percentage of foreign-born of the matched data rose slightly from 13% to

16% over time.

       As discussed in the introduction, equations (1)-(4) are estimated using two sets of

instruments: (1) share of foreign born in 1850 and the change in the share of foreign-born

between 1850 and 1860, and (2) distance from New York city and whether a county had access

to water transportation in 1850. In addition, for 1870 and 1880, years for which county data on

the share of foreign-born by countries are provided, I estimate whether the shares of certain

ethnic groups such as the Irish or whether immigrant diversity contributed to the growth of

factory production in manufacturing.

       The first-stage regressions are presented in Table 6. As expected, the percentage of

foreign-born in 1850 was highly correlated with the percentages of foreign-born in 1860, 1870

and 1880, respectively. A little more surprising is the fact that the change in the growth of

foreign-born in 1850 to 1860 are positively correlated with the shares of foreign-born in the later

decades. Also as expected, the share of foreign-born populations in 1860, 1870 and 1880 were

all negatively correlated with the distance from New York city but were positively correlated

with whether a county possessed access to water transportation in 1850. Finally, the two sets of



                                                 13
instruments are strong candidates according to Staiger and Watson’s (1997) rule of thumb: the

first stage F-statistics, testing the hypothesis that coefficients on the instruments are jointly zero,

are significantly higher than 10.

         Table 7 reports the probit and ordinary least squares estimates of equations (1)-(4).

The probit regression reported in Table 7 shows that counties with a higher share of foreign-born

were significantly more likely to have firms organized as factories. 15 Based on stata’s dprobit

command which calculates marginal changes in probability for infinitesimal changes in the

independent variable (discrete change for dummy variables), the estimated marginal impacts of

foreign-born on the factory variable were 0.15, 0.32 and 0.30 for 1860, 1870 and 1880

respectively. The marginal impact on factory organization was relatively strong for male-

intensity (0.16-0.26) and steam-power dummy (0.11-0.26), moderately important for water-

power dummy (0.01-0.08) but surprisingly weak for capital-labor intensity (0.004-0.01).

         Regression estimates on firm size indicate similar patterns. In this case, one standard

deviation increase in the county foreign-born population increased firm size by 11%, 17% and

14% in 1860, 1870 and 1880, respectively. Firm size is also positively correlated with capital

intensity, male intensity, steam and water powered firms. 16 The regressions on wages and labor

productivities show that firms in counties with a higher share of foreign-born paid higher

average wages and were characterized by higher labor productivity. 17 One standard deviation

increase in the share of county foreign-born population increased wages and labor productivities



15 The results were robust to the exclusion of Mountain and Pacific states.
16 Atack, Bateman and Margo (2005) explore the relationship between capital intensity and factory organization.
17 Edin, Fredricksson and Åslund (2003) find that ethnic enclaves in Sweden increased the wages of unskilled
workers: a standard deviation in concentration increased their wages by 13%. Their evidence based on individual
level data suggests that ethnic enclaves provide network effects or provide human capital externalities. My analysis
suggests that ethnic enclaves also improve the productivity of firms by lowering the costs of matching heterogeneous
workers and firms. Ottaviano and Peri (2005a) find a positive correlation between wages and employment density of
U.S.-born workers and linguistic diversity suggesting that a diversity of skills enhances the productivity of a city.


                                                         14
by 8 to 19%. In terms of firm level characteristics, wages and productivity were positively

correlated with capital intensity, male labor intensity and steam-power use, but negatively

correlated with utilization of water power.

         For 1870 and 1880, the county-level data contain data on the share of immigrants born in

different countries as well as data on the share of native-born who migrated from other states.

The regression estimates reported in Table 8 indicate that shares of foreign-born from most

European countries, such as Ireland, Germany, England and Wales, and Scandinavia, and from

British America (Canada) were positively correlated with factory organization and firm size as

well as wages and productivity. However, firms in counties with higher shares of foreign-born

from Italy were less likely to organize as factories. Interestingly, native in-migration was not

associated with factory organization or firm size, but were associated with higher wages and

productivity. Finally, ethnic diversity also contributed to factory organization and firm size and

was positively correlated with wages and productivity in 1880 but not in 1870. 18

         Tables (9)-(12) present estimates of the instrumental variables regressions. Although not

reported for space considerations, the regressions include all the exogenous variables as in Table

7. For both the IVprobit estimates on factory organization and the IV estimates on firm size, the

IVprobit or the IV estimates are relatively similar to those of the probit or the OLS estimates

except for 1880 when the IV estimates are significantly smaller. However, the IVprobit and IV

estimates are higher than the probit or the OLS estimates when the instruments used are the two

transportation related variables for 1860 and 1870. For average firm-level wages and

productivities, the IV estimates are similar or greater than the OLS estimates, especially when



18 Immigrant diversity is measured using the following standard index of diversity: Diversity = 1/Σi (FBij/Popj)2
where FBij is foreign-born population from country i in county j and Popj is total population in county j. The data
contain information on foreign-born from 25-27 countries.

the instrument used are distance from New York city and water transportation access in 1850.

The differences are also significantly greater in 1880 than in the earlier years. Overidentification

tests generally indicate the validity of the instruments.

       In addition to the formal statistical evidence presented in this paper, there is considerable

anecdotal evidence that immigrants played a major role in industrial America. The clothing

industry in New York City provides an illustrative example of the impact of immigrant workers

on American industries. In the early nineteenth century, clothing was made by artisan tailors

assisted by journeymen tailors and apprentices. In New York City, the majority of the 357

clothing entrepreneurs in the Longworth directory in 1816 were artisan tailors. As Feldman

(1960, p.90) writes: “The shops were not mechanized and only a few inexpensive tools were

needed. Skill, not machinery, was the prerequisite to success for a custom tailor shop.”

       Between 1830 and 1850, wholesale manufacturers began to utilize division of labor

where few skilled workers were employed as cutters and semi- and unskilled workers were

recruited to sew. Although most of the early sewing women were natives, they were quickly

displaced by immigrant workers during the period of heavy immigration in the 1840s. Prior to

1850, most firms operated “inside shops” composed of specialized cutting departments for coats,

pants, vests, and trimmings. Sewing was contracted to outside workers. According to Feldman

(1960, 97)), “Brooks employed 78 people on the premises and more than 1,500 outside. Lewis

and Hanford in 1849 employed 72 people inside and 3,600 outside.” With the introduction of the

sewing machine, a good portion of the sewing operation moved inside the shop. In addition,

division of labor increased within sewing as workers specialized by plain sewing, stitching,

finishing process, embroidering, etc. (See Feldman (1960), Pope (1905), Waldinger (1986), and

Burrows and Wallace (1999), and Stott (1990)).



                                                 16
III. Immigration and Division of Labor

         Between 1820 and 1920, immigrants to the United States came from a historically

unprecedented number of different nations and backgrounds. Immigration not only increased the

unskilled to skilled endowment ratio, it also significantly increased the diversity of the labor

force. While the vast majority of immigrants was classified in the unskilled category, immigrant

workers possessed diversity of prior work experience and physical attributes. Thus, immigration,

by increasing the diversity of the workforce, extended the potential for division of labor in

society, especially in factories.

         Table 13 presents the occupational distribution of the foreign-born by national origins in

manufacturing, mining and mechanical industries for 1870 and 1890. 19 Although the data cannot

distinguish artisans from factory occupations, they indicate significant clustering of occupation

by nationalities. In 1870, the Germans specialized in many food related industries as brewers,

distillers, butchers and confectioners, but they also specialized in other occupations as basket-,

cabinet-, cigar-, and piano-makers. The Irish were highly specialized in gas-works and other

heavy industries and were employed in manual occupations such as bleachers (textiles), brass-

founders, iron-foundry operatives, iron-furnace operatives among others. The English and Welsh

were concentrated in textiles, iron and steel, and in certain machine manufacturing. The

Scandinavians were highly specialized in a few occupations: sail and awning makers and those



19 The census occupational categories probably understate the extent of ethnic division of labor. Even within
occupational categories, there were considerable ethnic specialization. For example, Bodnar, Simon and Weber
(1982; 62-63) write: “Italians coming to Pittsburgh had considerable experience in nonagricultural and skilled blue-
collar work. These experiences enabled them to secure a variety of occupations while the successful operation of the
kin network at the same time funneled Italians into clusters within certain industries. Nearly 60 percent of all adult
male Italians were classified as laborers in the 1900 census. Oral interviews and the Pittsburgh Survey of 1907 un-
covered several distinct groupings of Italian day laborers. Italians in the steel industry dominated carpentry, repair,
and rail shops.”


                                                          17
related to the lumber industry.

        While there were some changes in the definitions of occupations between 1879 and 1890,

the data indicate that occupational clustering by nationalities persisted over time. There is

considerable overlap in the occupational categories in which Germans, Irish, British, and

Scandinavians were over-represented in both 1870 and 1890. However, there were some major

changes as well. Some of these changes were due to the arrival of new immigrant groups such as

the Italians. Italians were over-represented in the boot and shoe, charcoal, coke and lime,

confectioners, distillers and rectifiers industries among a few others.

        Despite the fact that close to one third of the workers in manufacturing and mechanical

industries were women in 1890, the data on occupation by sex reveal limited scope for division

of labor for women in manufacturing. 20 Compared to men’s, women’s occupations were highly

specialized in a few industries. German women were over-represented as bakers; Irish women

were mostly servants and were not well represented in manufacturing; British and Canadian

(French-speaking) women were most prevalent in textile related occupations. Of the female

workers, only the Italian women were specialized in a variety of industries. Consequently, the

data suggest that industrialization based on the unskilled labor of native women and children in

the United States is likely to been much more muted and confined to a few industries.



IV. Immigration and Urbanization

        The United States transformed from a rural to an urban nation between 1820 and 1920

during the era of mass immigration. Interestingly, the pace of urban growth, especially in central



20 While female labor specialization may have been influenced by discrimination, Goldin’s (1990) work suggests
that discrimination against female workers in nineteenth century manufacturing was likely to have been relatively
unimportant.


                                                        18
cities, slowed considerably after 1920 as immigration ended. In 1820, the great majority or 93%

of the population lived in rural areas; by 1920, a majority or 51% resided in cities. In the

succeeding decades, the share of urban population rose modestly to 57% in 1940 and then to

64% in 1960 (Kim (2000)). 21 It is well known that immigrants were concentrated in cities and

were much more likely to live in cities than natives. 22 In 1870, 26.4% of foreign-born resided in

cities with populations greater than 100,000 as compared to 8.1% of native-born; in 1920, the

figures were 47.7% and 22.6% respectively. 23

         In this section, I estimate the extent to which the foreign-born individuals were more

likely to reside in cities as compared to the native-born using individual level data from IPUMS

for 1880 and 1920. While I do not address the issue of native displacement by the foreign-born,

the use of individual level data makes it possible to control for many of the individual level

characteristics which contribute to location decisions and should mitigate some of the

simultaneity problems. The samples were restricted to individuals who were 16 or older and for

those whose urban and literacy statuses were identified. In 1880, the sample consisted of more

than 300,000 individuals; in 1920, the figure was close to 700,000 (Table 14). In 1880, 32% of

the individuals in the sample lived in cities; in 1920, the figure was 54.6%. However, the share

of the population who were foreign-born remained near 20% for both years.

         The logistic estimates presented in Table 15 show that the foreign-born were over 3 times


21 There seems to be some correlation between urbanization and establishment plant size. O’Brien (1988) and Kim
(1995) show that establishment size by production workers generally rose between 1880 and 1920 and then fell over
the second half of the twentieth century for many industries. These trends in plant size may reflect the general shift
in manufacturing production from the factory-assembly method based on division of labor to the factory-batch
method based on machine mechanization. Since labor recruiting and matching costs were likely to be more important
under factory-assembly based on division of labor, manufacturing contributed significantly to urbanization; however,
as establishments required fewer and fewer workers, manufacturing became less urbanized. These trends seem
consistent with the notion that division of labor was an important reason for why manufacturing became
concentrated in cities (Kim (2006)).
22 See Carpenter (1927), Ward (1972) and Bartel (1989).
23 For all urban areas, 61.4% of foreign-born resided in cities in 1890 as compared to 31.6% for native-born; in


                                                         19
more likely to reside in cities in 1880 but that the figure declined somewhat by 1920. Without

any controls, foreign-born were 3.6 and 3 times more likely to reside in cities in 1880 and 1920

respectively. With controls for individual characteristics such as sex, age, marital and literacy

statuses, the estimates on foreign-born rose slightly. Women and literate individuals were more

likely to reside in cities, but the coefficient on age and marital status depended on occupational

and locational fixed effects. When detailed occupational fixed-effects were included in the

regression, the foreign-born coefficient declined somewhat. However, the largest decline came,

especially in 1920, when the regressions included state fixed-effects.

         Did immigrants contribute significantly to urbanization or did they simply displace

natives from cities? 24 Unfortunately, there is no empirical estimate of native urban displacement.

However, Hatton and Williamson (1998) find that between 1880 and 1910, 100 foreign-born in-

migrants displaced 40 native-born by out-migration in the Northeast region. For the period

between 1870 and 1910, Collins (1997) finds a displacement rate of about 4.8 blacks for every

100 foreign-born migrants. 25 Thus, while immigrants may have displaced some natives, the

displacement rate was hardly one for one and the simple fact that immigrants were significantly

more likely to reside in cities than natives suggests that immigrants had a fundamental impact on

the geography of the American economy in the nineteenth century.

         Why did immigrants concentrate in cities? Most likely, immigrants concentrated in cities


1920, the figures were 75.4% and 47.7% respectively. See Gibson and Lennon (1999).
24 For the second half of the twentieth century, the evidence is somewhat mixed. Filer (1992) finds that immigrants
displaced natives whereas Wright, Ellis and Reibel (1997) find that the displacement of natives from metropolitan
areas where immigrants settled were due to reasons other than the inflow of immigrants.
25 Hatton and Williamson (1998) control for state-level employment growth, share of labor force in manufacturing,
share of urban population, share of populations aged 15-27, and log of real manufacturing earnings, but do not
control for individual level characteristics of natives and foreign-born. If the natives are much more skilled than the
foreign-born, then out migration of natives may be unrelated to the inflow of immigrants since natives and foreign-
born may be poor substitutes. The displacement figures reported for blacks by Collins (1997) may be more
appropriate since the skill levels of immigrants were more likely to resemble those of blacks than native whites;
however, the displacement figures for blacks may have been much lower due to discrimination.

to take advantage of ethnic externalities (Borjas (1995)). Immigrant networks greatly facilitated

the transmission of knowledge concerning labor market conditions and skill requirements of

their specialized occupations and industries. 26 Ethnic networks fostered division of labor by

immigrant groups. In addition, Kim (2006) suggests that the rise of the labor market and division

of labor led to the concentration of firms and workers in cities as they attempted to minimize

labor matching costs. Thus, even though many of the first wave of immigrants came from rural

Europe, most immigrants became city dwellers in America.



IV. Conclusion

         Ever since Habakkuk (1962), the idea of skilled or unskilled-biased technology has

generated significant interest in economics. In recent years, a number of scholars have found

evidence of technology-skilled complementarities between computer-based technologies and

college educated labor (Autor, Levy and Murnane (2003), Berman, Bound, and Griliches (1994),

Autor, Katz and Krueger (1998), Beaudry and Green (2005), among others). 27 Goldin and Katz

(1998) present evidence that technology-skilled complementarity originated with the shift in

manufacturing from factory-assembly to factory-batch or continuous production methods and

that this shift may have been caused by the rapid rise in American high school education in the



26 There is considerable anecdotal evidence of ethnic division of labor (see Earnst (1949), Rischin (1962), Stott
(1990), Ward (1989), Barrett (1987), and Bodnar (1977) to list just a few.)) Bodnar, Simon and Weber (1982) finds
that, unlike the Italians and Poles, the blacks were unable to establish occupation networks in Pittsburgh. Because
blacks were forced to seek work on their own, they endured substantial periods of unemployment before securing
their initial jobs. Also see U.S. Senate (1911): Immigrants in Industries.
27 In an open economy model of trade, a change in factor endowment can have two kinds of impacts: change in mix
of production caused by the Rybczynski’s theorem and a biased-technological change. Kim (1999) and Hanson and
Slaughter (2002) examine the impact of resource endowments on industry-mix. Lewis (2005, 2006) finds that local
labor supply shocks identified with a component of foreign immigration had little impact on local industry mix but
had significant impact in local factor intensity in production. These endogenous changes in technology were also
associated with little or no effect on relative wages. To the extent that differences in local factor endowments may
cause differences in local technologies, the literature on factor biased-technology provides evidence for the idea that
different localities, regions and nations may have different technologies of production (Treffler (1995)).

early twentieth century (Goldin and Katz (2000), Goldin (2001)).

         This paper examines whether immigration, by significantly increasing the unskilled to

skilled labor endowment ratio, contributed to the growth and spread of factory production in the

second industrial period in the U.S. between 1860 and 1920. The empirical model is motivated

by Acemoglu (1998) and Goldin and Katz (1998). Acemoglu’s endogenous model of

technological change predicts that an increase in unskilled to skilled labor endowment will lead

to higher productivity of unskilled technology. As noted by Goldin and Katz (1998) and many

others, the form of unskilled technology in manufacturing was embodied in the form of a factory

system based on division of labor.

         Based on the analysis of firm level data merged with county level information for the

period between 1850 and 1880, I find that immigration had a significant impact on the shift in

manufacturing from artisans to factories. Instrumental variable estimates indicate that firms in

counties with a significantly higher share of foreign-born population were much more likely to

organize as factories than as artisans. The diversity of immigrants also seem to have contributed

to the rise of a factory system based on division of labor.

         In the United States, the factory system of production arose in rural New England

between 1820 and 1840 to take advantage of that region’s abundance in unskilled native women

and children. 28 However, because the supply of native unskilled workers was limited and too

homogenous, the industrial revolution in the Unites States would have been much more muted


28 Legal factors may have also lowered the costs of locating in rural locations during this period. Steinfeld (1991,
2001) argues that early American labor was “unfree” in the sense that employers possessed significant legal rights
over workers. In particular, workers who breached their employment contracts were subject to criminal sanctions or
forfeiture of back wages. Consequently, the employer’s legal position reduced the level of turn-over in the labor
market. In the 1850’s, with the rise in the idea of “free labor” in America, employers lost much of their legal
leverage over employees. As workers could terminate their employment any time, the change in the legal
environment likely increased worker turn-over and raised the cost of recruiting workers in rural areas. Interestingly,
Hamilton (2000) suggests that changes in the ability of a master to enforce apprentice contracts in North America



                                                          22
without immigrants. Immigrants not only significantly increased the unskilled to skilled labor

endowment, but they also increased the diversity of skills and worker attributes important for

division of labor in factories. In addition, immigration and division of labor significantly

contributed to urbanization (Kim (2006)).

         What lessons and insights emerge from history for understanding the impact of

immigration on the American economy today? The experience of the era of mass immigration

points to the great absorptive capacity of the American economy. While immigration may lower

the wages of natives in the short run, the long-run impact of immigration is likely to have been

much more positive as indicated by the secular rise in long-run real wages (Figure 4). In this

paper, I suggest that the source of this great absorptive capacity of the American economy lies in

its ability to develop and implement technologies which favor changing factor endowment

conditions. In addition, history teaches that these induced technological changes have had a

major impact on the geographic landscape of the American economy.




may have contributed to the shift in manufacturing from artisans to factory production in the 1820s.

Note: Factory is equal to 1 if a firm employed more than 15 workers and 0 otherwise. Firm size is defined as one
plus number of male, female, and child workers. Steam power is equal to 1 if a firm used steam and 0 otherwise;
same for water power. Sample selection criteria was same as that of Atack, Bateman and Margo (2004): Gross
output greater than $500; for 1850 and 1860, average monthly wage greater than $4.76 but less than $190.5; and, for
1870 and 1880, average monthly wage greater than $5.20 but less than $208. For source notes, see Atack and
Bateman (1999).

Growth in foreign-born is defined as (Foreign-born1860 – Foreign-born1850)/Population1850.
Distance measures square miles from Kings County, New York and is constructed using data on county longitude and latitude from
http://www.census.gov/tiger/tms/gazetteer. Distance between two points, A and B, is calculated using the following approximate formula: [(69.1*(longitudeA-
longitudeB))2 + (53.0*(latitudeA-latitudeB))2]1/2.
