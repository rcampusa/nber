                                           ABSTRACT

       Existing models of contagious currency crises are summarized and surveyed, and it is argued
that more weight should be put on political factors. Towards this end, the concept of political
contagion introduced, whereby contagion in speculative attacks across currencies arises solely
because of political objectives of countries. A specific model of “membership” contagion is presented.
The desire to be part of a political-economic union, where maintaining a fixed exchange rate is a
condition for membership and where the value of membership depends positively on who else is a
member, is shown to give rise to potential contagion.     We then present evidence suggesting that
political contagion may have been important in the 1992-3 EMS crisis.

1. Introduction

       The possibility of contagion in currency crises across countries is highly topical, to say the

least. Though the phenomenon is widely discussed, and is supported by solid empirical evidence1,

construction of convincing theoretical models of contagion is still in its infancy. Moreover, in

existing models of contagion, political aspects of the decision of whether or not to defend a

currency against attack, central to the “new generation” crisis models, do not play an important

role. In this paper I argue that political factors of two sorts may be key to understanding some

examples of apparent contagion, most importantly the EMS crisis of 1992-3. First, the political

nature of the decision to devalue, combined with incomplete information about government

objectives in making this decision, is often crucial to the appearance of speculative pressures.

Second, when one of a country’s principal objectives in maintaining a fixed exchange rate is

(explicit or implicit) political integration with its “neighbors”, a devaluation by one of those

neighbors will increase speculative pressures on the country. This argument is especially relevant

to the EMS, but is not limited to it.

       In the next section, models of speculative attack are summarized, to make clear the

political nature of the devaluation decision. In section 3, existing models of contagion are

summarized, as is the concept of political contagion introduced in this paper. In section 4, a very

simple model is presented, along with a discussion of how it may be easily extended to a

multiperiod framework. Section 5 suggests why, on the basis of varied types of evidence,

political contagion may have been important in the 1992-3 EMS crisis. Section 6 concludes.

2. Models of Speculative Attack

       In Krugman’s seminal 1979 paper on exchange rate collapse, an inconsistency in

fundamentals induces a steady loss in reserves, ending in an abandonment of fixed rates. For

example, the government is running a deficit, and is financing it by printing money. The rate of

monetary expansion is inconsistent with the fixed exchange rate in the long run; in the short run,

individuals do not want to hold the higher level of domestic currency and exchange it for foreign

currency denominated assets.) The peg rate must be abandoned when reserves hit a minimum

level, which is common knowledge to all market participants. However, the peg collapses not at

the date implied by simply extrapolating the steady decline of reserves, but in a speculative attack

at some earlier date, namely the first date at which optimal investor behavior implies such an

attack will succeed.

       Krugman’s model of the inevitable abandonment of an unsustainable peg was a major step

in understanding how currencies collapse, and it has been extended in a number of directions. It

has been criticized, however, because of its description of the decision to abandon a fixed

exchange rate which is clearly unrealistic in some cases. In the Krugman model policymakers are

passive, sticking with current mutually inconsistent policies and abandoning the fixed rate

reflexively when the critical minimum level is reached. They neither take an aggressive role in

defending the current exchange rate policy, nor do they adjust their commonly known policy

objectives in light of external economic and political developments.

       Though it may be accurate in some instances to argue that a devaluation reflected the

technical infeasibility of continuing current policy, a more accurate characterization of the

behavior of policymakers in many cases is that the decision on whether or not to devalue reflect


                                                  2
balancing conflicting objectives. Deteriorating fundamentals are an important part of the story,

but the decision to devalue is taken not because it is literally unavoidable, but because of a the

importance of other objectives given external developments. Hence, devaluation is a political

decision in that it is technically feasible to maintain the peg (especially when a central bank can

borrow reserves), but seen by the government as no longer optimal in light of the costs of doing

so and the importance of other objectives.

       Krugman (1996) and others have applied the term “New Crisis Model” to models of

currency crises which gives a central role to government optimization and which characterize the

devaluation decision in terms of choosing between conflicting objectives. As Krugman puts in

characterizing the New Crisis Model. (p, 350): “A government -- no longer a simple mechanism

like that in the classical model, but rather an agent trying to minimize a loss function -- must

decide whether or not to defend an exogenously specified exchange rate parity.” To the extent

that weighing conflicting objectives is key to the decision of how to respond to respond to

speculative pressures, political considerations are central to the New Crisis model. Examples of

this approach include Obstfeld (1994), Drazen and Masson (1994), Masson (1995), Ozkan and

Sutherland (1995), Obstfeld (1996), and Bensaid and Jeanne (1997).2

       In these models, however, the treatment of speculators is far less meticulous than the

treatment of policymakers; the latter are modeled as solving an explicit, well-formulated

optimization problem; the former act optimally, but the optimization problem is generally either



       2
          A model based on an optimizing government is not identical to one with multiple
equilibria and the resultant possibility of self-fulfilling crises. A “new” crisis model can have a
unique equilibrium, as in Drazen and Masson (1994), whereas a non-optimizing model can have
multiple equilibria, as discussed by Krugman (1996).

                                                  3
left implicit or quite simplified. The problem of formulating devaluation expectations is stressed,

but the information structure under which this takes place is quite simple. In Obstfeld (1994,

1996), for example, speculator behavior is summarized by their expectations of a devaluation,

rationally conditioned on the government’s optimal response to a single underlying shock and on

the common knowledge distribution of that shock. Drazen and Masson (1994), and Masson

(1995) add uncertainty about the policymakers objectives (his “type”), and consider how it will

interact with uncertainty about fundamentals.

       A more realistic model of speculators optimal behavior should have them solving a more

complicated, dynamic signal extraction problem in which there are several types of shocks.

Bensaid and Jeanne (1997) is more satisfactory in this respect, with the probability of devaluation

being derived via Bayesian updating on the policymaker’s type. Drazen (1998) considers a

dynamic model which allows for several types of shocks, where the rational expectations of

devaluation are formed by Bayesian updating based on the history of policies and the current

shock. In that model what is crucial in forming expectations of devaluation is not simply what

policies were previously observed, but also the circumstances in which they were observed. Not

surprisingly, the information-based model of contagion presented here will be based on that

model, though in a simplified form.



3. Contagious currency crises

       “Contagion” appears to be the latest buzzwords in foreign currency markets and in asset

markets more generally. However, carefully-reasoned explanations of the causes of contagion, or




                                                 4
even of what constitutes contagion, are as rare as discussions of the phenomenon are common.3 I

will use the term applied to currency crises to refer to the phenomenon whereby a currency crisis

itself in one country makes a currency crisis (or currency weakness) in another country more

likely. The emphasis is meant to differentiate true contagion from a common shock (other than a

currency crisis) which affects countries differentially because of their differential susceptibility to

infection. When differential vulnerability to an unobserved common shock reflects unobserved

characteristics, we may get what looks like true contagion, since a crisis in one country will be

followed by a crisis in another, with no apparent explanation other than the original crisis itself.

This is an identification problem well known in epidemiology. Following the very clear discussion

in Masson (1998), we call this “monsoonal effects.”4

        Masson makes a further distinction, arguing that contagion should be applied only to the

case “where a crisis in one country may conceivably trigger a crisis elsewhere for reasons

unexplained by macroeconomic fundamentals” (p.2, italics mine). When a crisis in one country

affects the fundamentals in another country (for example, because a devaluation reduces the

competitiveness of other countries and thus makes them more likely to devalue), he uses the term

“spillover.” I will use the term “contagion” more generally.

3.1 Three general models of contagion

        The best developed general model of contagion is that of information “cascades”, in which



        3
        For example, the most common reason by far that market traders gave for devaluation
contagion within the ERM in the Eichengreen and Wyplosz (1993, p. 98) survey was that
“markets ‘tasted blood’ (realized that there were profits to be made)”.
        4
         Masson focusses on shocks from industrial countries affecting Asian emerging markets,
hence the terminology. We will use the term a bit more generally.

                                                   5
asymmetrically informed investors acquire information sequentially by observing the actions of

others who precede them. (See, for example, Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch [1992].)

Agent 2 on the basis of his own information may prefer action A to action B, but he observes

agent 1 choosing B. He thus infers that agent 1 has information favoring B, and this may push 2

to choose B as well. Agent 3, observing two previous choices of B, may also conclude that B is

optimal, although his private information alone would imply choosing A. And so on. The general

informational cascade model may be more relevant for differentially informed investors in a given

market, than for contagion across foreign exchange markets. Two basic assumptions for an

information cascade would not appear to be satisfied in foreign exchange markets: the cascade

model relies on significant differences in private information across agents, but it is far from clear

that there are such informational differences across large investors for major currencies; and, the

cascade model relies on significant transaction costs in order to generate sequential behavior, but

foreign exchange markets are not characterized by such high transaction costs. Moreover, in

discussions of the applicability of cascades to contagious currency crises, it is not clear what is the

relevant information transferred across currency markets.

       Less formally, the idea of information externalities has been applied to foreign exchange

markets as follows. It is argued that with uncertainty about policymakers’s commitment to

defend a fixed exchange rate, the collapse of the exchange rate in one country may provide

information that another country in similar macroeconomic circumstances is more likely to

abandon its fixed parity. Though the argument is often heard, the logic is often incomplete. One

could justify it in terms of a common unobserved shock which affects countries differentially due

to different macroeconomic circumstances, but this is a “monsoonal effect”, rather than true


                                                   6
contagion. As a contagion story, one must make clear what new information that is relevant to

the second currency is being provided by the collapse of the first currency. Since devaluation in

the first country provides no new information either about macroeconomic conditions per se (but,

see the arguments about “spillovers” below) or about the policymaking process in the second

country (but, see the discussion of political contagion in section 3.2 below) a less direct

mechanism of contagion may be present.

       More specifically, the argument that the collapse of the exchange rate in one country

implies that another country in similar macroeconomic circumstances is more likely to abandon its

fixed parity may be probabilistic or statistical. Market participants envision a collapse scenario

which could occur under certain circumstances, but assign it a low probability until it actually

occurs in such circumstances. They then raise the probability of it occurring in similar

circumstances elsewhere, perhaps increasing their speculation against those other countries.

Hence, a crisis in one country, previously assigned low probability, may raise the probability of

devaluation elsewhere. This is not herding to a currently faddish theory of contagion (a

phenomenon which may itself be present), but statistical updating on the basis of drawing another

observation favorable to a theory.

       Another type of contagion model is a “spillover” model (to use Masson’s terminology),

focussing on trade linkages. This has been modeled formally by Gerlach and Smets (1995) and

Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz (1996). An attack-induced devaluation in one country enhances

its competitiveness, leading to trade deficits and declining reserves for its trading partners, making




                                                  7
their currencies more vulnerable.5 If one looks simply at bilateral trade linkages, the idea may be

relevant for some cases (as in the effect of the floating of the Finnish markka on September 8,

1992 on speculation against the Swedish krona, as discussed by Gerlach and Smets), but it

doesn’t appear to be a general explanation. The magnitudes seem wrong, as “contagious” attacks

hit currencies where the bilateral trade volumes just aren’t large enough. However, this bilateral

view is probably too limited, for we should consider multilateral linkages, whereby two countries

compete against one another in the same third-country market. Theoretically, this appears

relevant for Asian countries with significant exports to Japan or the United States. However, the

trade magnitudes are probably still too small to explain contagion beginning in Thailand, even

when both bilateral trade and “third-market” trade are included.

       An analogous argument is that spillovers occur via financial markets, as third-country

investors liquidate their positions in one country to cover crisis induced losses in another. It is far

harder to assess empirically how important this was in the recent Asian crisis. In any case, this

vehicle for contagion seems of little relevance for the ERM crisis of 1992-3.

       A third line of argument is that contagion is linked to the possibility of multiple equilibrium

and self-fulfilling speculative attacks. Masson (1998), in fact, argues that only models of this sort

are capable of producing true contagion, reflecting his view (see above) that contagion, by

definition, refers to the simultaneous occurrence of currency crises not linked to macroeconomic

fundamentals. In his model, a crisis is the result of a deterioration of the current account,

reflecting in turn extremely high debt service. Interest rates include a devaluation premium, so



       5
        An alternative argument is that changes in the trading partners price levels reduce
demand for money, leading to a depletion of reserves.

                                                   8
that the expectation of a devaluation can be self-fulfilling. Masson’s argument concentrates on

the simultaneity of a number of such episodes, rather than a causal link between them. Similarly,

Eichengreen and Wyplosz (1993) suggest that high unemployment leads market participants to

anticipate a future loosening of monetary policy, inducing speculation against the currency. The

costs of defending the currency rise, due in part to the induced upward pressure on interest rates,

so that a country may in fact devalue where they would not have in the absence of speculative

pressure. Hence the expectation of monetary loosening becomes self-fulfilling. This argument, as

will be argued in section 5 below, is close to but not identical to the one presented here.

3.2 Political contagion

        In the previous subsection, we summarized three general models of contagious currency

crises. Each type of model is structured along the lines of the second generation models of crisis

which stress the balancing of conflicting objectives in the devaluation decision, leading us to

characterize these models as “political”. The objectives themselves, however, are basically

economic, and the nature of the contagion is thus economic as well. In this paper, I want to

introduce a fourth type of contagion which is inherently political, in that the objectives which give

rise to contagion are primarily political. Contagion will be intrinsically political, for in the absence

of the political objective, devaluation in one country would not affect speculative pressure on

another country’s currency.

        First, what does one mean by primarily political objectives in economic policy?

Economic decisions are often made on the basis of largely political goals. Income distribution

programs are a good case in point: transfers are made with the aim of maximizing votes for the

incumbent party. The objective of a decision is clearly “primarily” political when it supports a


                                                   9
political objective which is in conflict with an economic objectives. Hence, holding the exchange

rate fixed for the purpose of enhanced political integration at a significant economic cost is a

“primarily political” decision. As many have argued, this characterization describes the impetus

towards fixed exchange rates in the move towards EMU. (Feldstein [1997] argues quite strongly

on the primarily political nature of decisions surrounding EMU.)

       More generally, the point that the decision to keep a fixed parity may be primarily political

can be put as follows. One component of increased political-economic integration with other

countries is often the maintenance of a fixed exchange rate with respect to their currencies. This

may reflect the desire to form some sort of explicit currency area or trading bloc, as, for example,

in the case of the EMU. Or, it may be less explicit, in the sense that “cooperative behavior”

means refraining from competitive devaluations. Hence, one may think of membership in a

“club,”6 whether explicit or implicit, where the benefits of membership are heavily political and the

condition for membership is the maintenance of a fixed exchange rate. (We consider in section 5

below the specific institutional details which describe the EMU as such a club.)

       The concept of political contagion in speculative attacks follows as an implication of the

desire for political integration where maintenance of a fixed exchange rate is a condition on each

potential member for membership in the integrated unit. One must make one further assumption,

namely that the value of membership in the arrangement depends positively on who else is or may

be a member. Hence, if a country learns that other potential members of the arrangement place

less weight on meeting the conditions required to join, and hence, are less likely to participate, it


       6
        I use the term “club” for lack of another term which is concise rather than cumbersome.
One should note, however, that the role of clubs in providing public goods is not central to the
argument here.

                                                  10
will find it less advantageous to join as well. It will therefore assign a lower value to maintaining

a fixed exchange rate, especially when doing so requires sacrificing domestic goals.

       To complete the argument, suppose that speculators are uncertain about a country’s

commitment to a fixed rate, because they are uncertain of the weight the country’s policymakers

put on conflicting objectives. Speculators know, however, that the desire for integration subject

to the no-devaluation membership condition is an important objective. Rational behavior on their

part will then imply that a successful attack on one currency (or perhaps even speculative pressure

on the currency), revealing a weaker commitment than previously believed, creates an externality

in the form of a lower commitment of all other potential members. They will therefore be more

vulnerable to attack.7 We term this contagious effect membership contagion.



4. A Model of Membership Contagion

       In this section we present a simple model of membership contagion, and discuss the

underlying concept in greater detail in section 4.3. The possibility of a contagious currency crisis

depends on incomplete information about government intentions, allowing revelation of

information about the intentions of other countries to affect the probability of a devaluation. This

probability is derived under rational expectations, where it is shown how this probability depends

on history, on the country’s current circumstances, and on the actions of other countries.



       7
          This contagion argument should be distinguished from the earlier argument about the
spillover of competitive pressures via real exchange rate effects in implicit trading arrangements.
The previous argument concerned the trade effect of a lower real exchange rate following a
nominal devaluation, which induces a trading competitor to devalue. Here, the argument focusses
on the contagious nature of “breaking the rules,” independent of any effects on the real exchange
rate.

                                                 11
       To make things as simple as possible, we consider a single-period model, based on the

more general multi-period model presented in Drazen (1998). The more general model allows for

an explicit discussion of how rational devaluation probabilities evolve over time as a function of a

country’s current circumstances and the history of policy, specifically, how information from the

history of policy and the circumstances in which those policy decisions were made affects the

current information set. Here, this updating of the past will be implicit, but it will be clear how

the model is easily extended to a dynamic framework.

       The sequence of events in the model is as follows. A country which has maintained a

fixed exchange rate experiences a stochastic shock ç, which is observed by both government and

speculators. Speculators then choose a level of speculation against the currency, given ç and the

probability they assign to a devaluation (of known size) at the end of the period. Specifically,

speculators borrow domestic currency to be repaid at the end of the period, and use it to buy

foreign currency reserves. Since maintaining the fixed parity requires that reserves remain above

some critical level, speculative demand for reserves determines a minimum interest rate i which

must be maintained if the government is to defend the fixed parity. On the basis of ç and i, the

government then decides whether to defend the fixed exchange rate (denoted by choice of policy

F) by holding the interest rate at i, or not to defend the parity and devalue (a policy D), consistent

with a lower interest rate. At the end of the period speculators sell their reserves back to the

government and pay off their borrowing. Though speculators use a range of information in

deciding whether to attack a currency, there are basically three types of shocks of interest which

we consider here: a country-specific factor which is unobservable to speculators, (the country’s

unobservable “type”); a country-specific shock, which is observable to both government and


                                                  12
speculators; and, to model contagion, a cross-country observable shock.8 Different types of new

information relevant to speculators will generally fall into one of these categories.

4.1 Speculator Behavior

       As already indicated, key to speculators’ behavior is their borrowing of domestic currency

in order to buy foreign currency reserves. Speculators are assumed to be atomistic, but the total

cost of borrowing is assumed to be an increasing, convex function of the quantity borrowed.9

This assumption allows us to maintain the simplicity of working with an parametric interest rate,

rather than an interest rate schedule, but at the same time prevent speculators from taking infinite

speculative positions. Under these assumptions, one can easily show (see Drazen [1998]) that

total demand for reserves by profit-maximizing speculators is increasing in the probability p that

speculators assign to a devaluation and decreasing in the cost of borrowing funds. For simplicity,

we make the further reasonable assumption that the cost of borrowing funds is such that demand

for borrowing goes to zero as i approaches infinity and goes to zero as p goes to zero.

       Suppose that maintaining the fixed exchange rate requires that foreign currency reserves

are above some minimum level. For given devaluation expectations, defending the fixed rate then

requires keeping the interest rate high enough so that total demand for reserves is no greater than

this minimum level. (Speculators’ beliefs about the probability of a devaluation are fully



       8
         In a multi-period version of the model, the country-specific unobservable “type” would
be time-invariant, while the observable country-specific shock would be time varying.
       9
         In a multi-period model, assuming that speculators can adjust their position period-by-
period allows one to retain the feature that in deriving their optimal position, risk-neutral
speculators would need only to consider the probability of devaluation in the current period, and
wouldn’t need to form expectations of the probability of devaluation in future periods. See
Drazen (1998).

                                                 13
summarized by p, where we discuss below how rational beliefs are formed, conditional on

available information.) This determines the lowest interest rate consistent with maintaining the

fixed parity (the “minimum required interest rate”), which, given our assumptions is an increasing,

continuous function of p, namely i(p).

4.2 The Government’s Choice Problem

        We now turn to the decision problem of a social-welfare maximizing government, which

has an announced commitment to a fixed exchange rate. If the government is to maintain the

fixed parity (policy F), it must raise the interest rate to the level i(p) consistent with maintaining

sufficient foreign currency reserves, with the associated welfare loss due to the detrimental effect

of high interest rates on the domestic economy. Four areas of negative impact are generally

mentioned: negative impact on economic activity, especially when the economy is seen as

depressed; negative impact on mortgage interest rates, especially when these rates are directly

indexed to money market rates and defense of the exchange rate requires holding market rates

high for significant periods (as in the case of the United Kingdom); impact of interest rates on

increasing the budget deficit; and, possible destabilization of the banking system. We represent

these losses by a function H(i,ç), where H is an increasing and concave in both the domestic

interest rate i and the shock ç, and where H(@) = 0 if the government chooses to devalue rather

than defend the fixed parity (policy D). The shock ç is observed by both government and

speculators. ç is meant to represent any currently observed factor known to affect the value the

government may assign to maintaining a fixed exchange rate, such as changes in the level of

foreign currency reserves or changes in domestic unemployment rates.

        Not defending the fixed parity and devaluing has both benefits and costs. Since our


                                                   14
interest is in the latter, we assume the benefits are subsumed in the function H. Whereas the

benefits of devaluation are generally purely economic, the cost of not defending a fixed exchange

rate are of a more political nature in that they are costs associated with reneging on a

commitment. In a multi-period model loss of reputation would be foremost among these.

Membership effects, as discussed in section 3.2, present another example of this sort of cost when

devaluing creates a bar to participation in a cooperative arrangement. Two aspects of this cost

are important for our modeling of contagion: first, that the cost the government assigns to

devaluing is asymmetric information, known to the government, but not fully known to

speculators; and that this cost depends, among other things, on (at least partially) known

information about the commitment of other countries to cooperative arrangement or “club” of the

sort discussed in section 3.2 above.10 We consider them in turn, both in some detail.

       Asymmetric information about a government’s intentions is modeled as an element x

which affects the loss from a devaluation is then æ, where x is known with certainty only to the

policymaker himself (his “type”). Speculators, on the other hand, know only the distribution of

possible types as summarized by a distribution G(x), defined over [ x , x̄ ] . The information

summarized by the distribution and its supports could reflect learning about the government on

the basis of past observation of its policies and of the circumstances in which these policies were

undertaken, as will be discussed below.

       The second is summarized by a parameter Z, an index of the value to the country of being



       10
           There is no contradiction between saying that saying that the country’s commitment to
the fixed rate is not fully known and the commitment of other countries to a cooperative
arrangement, which may itself depend on their maintaining fixed rates, is at least partially known.
If this point is not clear here, it will be below.

                                                 15
in the club. Z could be simply the number of other countries that satisfy the membership criteria,

or it could be a weighted sum, with weights depending on the importance for the home country of

a given country’s participation. More generally, Z could encompass the probability of the club

arrangement coming into being, as a function of the behavior of other countries. We present a

fuller discussion of the determinants of Z in the next section. The loss æfrom a devaluation will

equal xZ if the policymaker devalues and will equal zero otherwise.

        The trade-off that a social-welfare maximizing policy maker faces if the currency is

attacked, that of maintaining the fixed exchange rate against maintaining low interest rates, may

then be represent by the loss function:


    L ' H( i , ç ) % æ( x Z ) ,                                                                    (1)


where the last two terms are zero if the government defends the fixed exchange rate, while the

first term is zero if it does not.11

        The government’s policy choice, given the realization ç and the interest rate i(p) required

to maintain the fixed exchange rate consistent with speculator’s beliefs, as summarized by p, will

be summarized by a cut-off type x̂ who is just indifferent between devaluing and not devaluing.

All types with x less than x̂ will devalue; all types with x equal to or greater than x̂ will maintain

the fixed parity. To see why, first derive the cut-off x̂ by equating the value of L in (1) under the

policy of F (so that L = H) and the policy of D (so that L = æ), so that :



        11
         In a multi-period framework the government would minimize a discounted loss function
in which each term would take the form of (1), where the cost æ(xZ) would be interpreted as a
one-time cost. Optimization would be forward-looking, in that the implications of a policy of F or
D in any period on future trade-offs would be considered. See Drazen (1998).

                                                  16
            H( i[p] , ç )
     x̂ '
                 Z        .                                                                          (2)
       ' x̂( p, ç , Z )

The cut-off x̂' x̂( p, ç , Z ) is continuous and increasing in p and ç, continuous and decreasing in Z.

For a type with x $ x̂ , xZ $ H, so that it will be optimal to defend the fixed parity rather than

devalue; for a type with x < x̂ , xZ < H, so that it will be optimal to devalue. Hence, the cut-off

rule fully characterizes a government’s optimal behavior, and the probability of a devaluation

depends on x̂( p, ç , Z ) , given x and G(x). For future use it is useful to denote by ç the value of

ç such that x̂' x , for given p and Z. That is, ç is the value of ç such that even the government

type with the lowest cost of devaluation finds it optimal to maintain a fixed exchange rate, so that

the probability of a devaluation is zero.

        The nature of the optimal policy should be intuitive. Other things equal, the higher is

speculation against the currency (summarized by p), the more likely a government will find it

optimal to devalue, rather than keep interest rates high. (That is, an increase in x̂ means that the

probability that x lies below x̂ increases.) The realization of an exogenous shock ç will affect the

government’s incentive to devalue, and, as we shall see, the equilibrium level of speculation itself.

Finally, the fewer countries which are potential members of the “association” (or the less

important are the other qualifying countries, or the less likely for the association to come into

being), the lower is Z, the higher is x̂ , so the higher is the probability of a devaluation.

        The determination of x̂ , and its implications for possible policy choices, also indicates how

updating would take place in a multi-period model. Suppose x̂ is above x in period t-1, as it will



                                                   17
be for sufficiently high ç and a the government chooses to defend the currency. This policy

choice implies that the government’s x is above x̂ , so that the lower support of the distribution at

the beginning of t will be x̂ > x , the lower support in t-1. This is simply Bayesian updating, with

the implied updating of the distribution of G(x). If the realization of the current shock ç was

sufficiently low that x̂ # x , all possible types would defend the fixed rate and the observation of

the policy F would provide no information, so the lower support of the distribution at the

beginning of t+1 would remain x . Hence, the current lower support x and the associated

distribution G(x) summarizes what has been learned about the government’s type prior to the

current period on the basis of past observation of its policies and of the circumstances in which

these policies were undertaken. The dynamics of speculative attacks based on such learning is the

main focus of Drazen (1998) and this inference problem is one of the two key features

distinguishing the multi-period model presented in that paper from the single-period example

presented here. (The other is the government’s intertemporal optimization problem when they

know speculators are solving such an inference problem.)12 Although we solve only a static

problem, this discussion, combined with the discussion of the government’s multiperiod objective

in footnote 11, indicate how the model can be easily made dynamic.

4.3 The determinants of the value of membership

       The heart of the model of membership contagion is the parameter Z, indicating the value

of membership in a “club,” which depends on who else is, or is not, in the club. The extent of

membership contagion will then depend on the specification of the club for which no devaluation



       12
          A very similar multiperiod inference problem, as applied to the information conveyed by
a policy of capital account liberalization, is presented in Bartolini and Drazen (1997b).

                                                 18
is the key membership criterion. As already indicated, this club may be a formal arrangement,

such as an explicit common currency area or a trading bloc, or a far less explicit arrangement. To

the extent that governments see such clubs as important, the political nature of the decision of

whether or not to devalue may be seen in part as the decision of which club to join, the club of

devaluers or the club of non-devaluers. Furthermore, if one views such clubs broadly, the club

may be defined by politicians at the time devaluation decisions are being debated, rather than

simply pre-existing or previously agreed upon arrangements. Hence, the concept of membership

effects, and the possibility of contagion which arises from it, should be seen as including, but more

broad, than simply explicit currency or trading arrangements.

       The easiest case is that of explicitly defined clubs with no devaluation as an explicit

membership criterion, as is the case of EMU as discussed in section 5. The link, however, from

the no-devaluation membership criterion to contagion may be simple and direct or it may be more

subtle. The simplest link is where a devaluation disqualifies one country from joining the club for

at least some period of time, and where the value to other potential members depends positively

on that country being a member. A less direct link is one in which devaluation by one country

doesn’t literally disqualify it over the relevant time horizon, but makes its participation, or perhaps

the existence of the arrangement itself, discretely less likely, thus lowering the value of

membership to other potential members, making them more likely to devalue. This may be a

more accurate description of the possible causal link from eventual membership in the EMU and

the contagious currency crises in the EMS in 1992-3. An unanticipated devaluation by one

potential member will reveal a lower commitment to fixed exchange rates than previously

believed, not only to speculators, but also to other potential members. This raises the probability


                                                  19
they assign to that country devaluing in the future, and thus lowers the probability they assign to

her meeting the membership criterion when it becomes effective.

       In the context of an explicit currency union like the EMU with a specific membership

criterion of no devaluation over a given horizon, there may be an even more subtle form of

membership contagion. A devaluation by a country that other potential members view as

important may lead to a weakening of the membership rules themselves. Suppose there is the

desire to maximize the likelihood that EMU will come into being with, let’s say, Italy as a

member. An Italian abandonment of the fixed parity in a way that might disqualify it because of

failure to meet the membership criterion may lead to the criterion being will lead the no-

devaluation rule being weakened, though not scrapped entirely. The weaker criterion would

make other countries more likely to devalue, as this would no longer disqualify them as

previously. If several countries can’t “clear the bar”, one might anticipate the bar will be lowered,

so that others that could have will put less effort into maintaining fixed rates. One should be

careful, however, in distinguishing between the argument that contagion may result from a

devaluation-induced weakening of a no-devaluation criterion, and the far stronger argument that a

country that devalued believed ex ante that this would have no membership consequences. There

is no real evidence that ERM countries that abandoned their fixed parities in 1992-3 did so with

the anticipation that the criteria would be changed in such a way that this would have no political

costs, nor that a devaluation by a potential EMU member left the probability of EMU unchanged.

       A related, though less formal, argument is that once a major player devalues and deviates

from a previously solid arrangement, other players suddenly realize, “It can be done!” This is a

variant of the argument in section 3.1 whereby contagion across countries in similar


                                                 20
macroeconomic circumstances may reflect a probabilistic calculation, whereby seeing the

phenomenon once significantly raises the probability that market participants assign to it occurring

elsewhere.. Replacing “probability” by “possibility” and replacing “market participant” by

“government” shows how the analogy can be made. It has been argued (see, for example,

Eichengreen and Jeanne [1998]) that the Britain’s leaving the gold standard in 1931 may have had

contagious effects on other countries for this reason.

       What about less explicit clubs? More specifically, what sort of less explicit clubs might

generate membership effects? And, how might membership be defined? On a regional basis,

politicians may attach weight to being “lumped together” in the eyes of international investors

with neighbors whose economic performance is especially good, while differentiating themselves

from countries in the same region whose performance is seen as poor. To the extent there is a

correlation between perceived performance and the exchange rate regime, more specifically, fixed

exchange rates, one obtains no-devaluation clubs. Such a club effect may be relevant for Asia or

Latin America.13 One possibility for membership contagion then comes the argument in the

previous two paragraphs, by which a devaluation by one club member weakens the membership

criterion and makes other members more likely to devalue. That is, if one “success story” that



       13
          It seems quite relevant for France as well in the early part of the EMS period. In
contrast to the strongly expansionary policies that the socialist government followed after coming
to power in May 1981, there was an important change in behavior in June 1982, reinforced in
March 1983, when France shifted to far tighter fiscal and monetary policies, the politique de
rigueur. The purpose of this change in policy, which had a serious cost in terms of significantly
higher unemployment, was to convince investors of a change in underlying government
objectives. France made this change credible by accepting high unemployment without devaluing.
There were no realignments for a three-year period, despite unemployment rising above 10
percent. For a fuller discussion, see Drazen and Masson (1994).


                                                 21
previously maintained fixed rates suddenly devalues under specific circumstances, governments

may perceive that avoiding devaluations under all circumstances is no longer a criterion in the

eyes of investors to be part of the favored group. Of course, when devaluation itself is seen as

revealing weakness, a “reverse contagion” may result. If devaluations by its neighbors are seen as

revealing economic problems which may have a regional component, a country’s commitment to

fixed exchange rates may be strengthened, as it wants to make clear it still belongs the no-

devaluation club. The strength with which China and Hong Kong defended their exchange rates

in the recent Asian turmoil would appear to reflect reverse membership contagion.

4.4 Speculator inference and rational devaluation beliefs

        In section 4.2 we derived the optimal behavior of speculators on the basis of their beliefs

about the probability of a devaluation p. On the basis of speculators’ behavior, we derived

optimal behavior of the government in deciding whether or not to defend the fixed exchange rate.

To close the model, we must ensure that the beliefs of speculators are consistent with government

optimal behavior, that is that they are rational. Hence, we must calculate the true probability of

devaluation, call it ð, based on the beliefs p and equate them.

        Given the cut-off nature of the government’s optimal decision problem, the probability of

a devaluation should reflect beliefs over government types. These beliefs are fully summarized by

the set [ x, x̄] , and the conditional cumulative distribution associated with this set, G(x). The

actual probability of a devaluation, call it ð, can then be calculated using G(x) and the cut-off type

x̂ , namely as G( x̂ ) for states where x̂ > x (that is for by ç > ç , as defined above) and zero

otherwise. With the actual probability of devaluation ð so defined, we may relate it to the

perceived probability p using the definition of x̂' x̂( p, ç , Z ) in (2). Since our focus is not on the


                                                   22
role of history, as summarized, by x , we will suppress the dependence of ð on x , and concentrate

on the role of ç and Z. The rational equilibrium devaluation probability, for a given values of ç

and Z, is then given by:



    ð ' G( x̂ ( ð , ç , Z ))   for ç > ç ( Z )
                                                                                                        (3)
        ' 0                    for ç # ç ( Z )

where ç ( Z ) is defined by (2) for x̂( 0, ç , Z ) ' x . Equation (3) will always be satisfied for ð = 0,

as x̂( 0 , ç , Z ) < x . There will be at least one interior solution for sufficiently high ç, given Z (that

is ç > ç ( Z ) ), or, for sufficiently low Z, given ç. Given the characteristics of x̂( p, ç , Z ) from (2)

and the definition of ð(ç, Z) in (3), it is clear that the equilibrium level of speculation ð is

increasing in ç and decreasing in Z. The solution ð(ç, Z) is central to our analysis of the dynamics

of contagious speculative attacks.

         The model admits the various types of contagion discussed above. An information

cascade depends on what information is being transmitted; membership contagion discussed

below will provide an example. Contagion via spillover of fundamentals can be represented by a

change in fundamentals in another country inducing an increase in ç, and hence in ð. Contagion

arising from multiple equilibrium follows from the possibility of multiple solutions to (3). There

will always be a solution ð = 0, namely where speculators believe there is no probability of a

devaluation, do not speculate against the currency (due to the interest cost of borrowing), so that

the government finds it costless to defend the currency. There may also be multiple interior

solutions. (In this case, we take the highest value of ð which satisfies the first part of (3) as the

interior solution for the discussion of other types of contagion, so that equation (3) will have one


                                                     23
positive and one zero solution.)

       Our focus is on political contagion in speculative attacks, more specifically, the possibility

of membership contagion, as discussed section 4.3. This would be characterized by the positive

dependence of ð on Z, the (possibly weighted) index of other potential members of the club. (A

crucial assumption is that Z is known to both speculators and the government, as is the fact that

æ(xZ) is increasing in Z.) Hence, as long as no devaluation is a membership criterion and a

devaluation provides new information about Z, one obtains true contagion: a successful

speculative attack on one potential member country will increase the probability of attack on

other potential members.



5. Membership Contagion in the 1992-3 EMS Crisis

       We now turn to the question of whether there is any evidence relating speculative attacks

in the 1992-3 EMS crisis to “membership contagion”. (As argued above, the concept is also

applicable to the desire for membership in less formal cooperative arrangements, but we focus

here on the EMS.) We present no formal econometric tests, but evidence of a more “case study”

nature, culled from other sources, suggesting that the concept may in fact be relevant. This will

concern the answer to two questions: first, is there evidence that a devaluation in one country

affected the probability of a devaluation in other countries; second, if the answer to the first

question is positive, is there evidence that this contagion may reflect membership effects.

       On the first question, there seems to be general agreement that Britain’s abandonment of

its defense in September 1992 did put pressure on some other European currencies. One can see

this using the Eichengreen-Rose-Wyplosz index of crisis. More simply, looking at forward rates


                                                  24
(measured as DM per unit of domestic currency), one can see a sharp fall in the rates for the

Italian Lira, the Spanish Peseta, and the Irish Punt, and a less sharp fall for the Danish Krona and

the French Franc on September 14, 1992.14 The Swedish abandonment of its defense of the

Krona in November appears to have had similar contagious implications.

       The far harder question is whether membership effects were involved. This may be itself

divided into two questions. First, as far as immediate causation, does a devaluation by one

potential member lower the perceived probability of EMU? Second, does the a lower probability

of EMU actually taking place lower the political resolve of potential members to defend their

fixed parity?

       The first question is largely one of institutional detail, though not entirely, as the

discussion in section 4.3 should make clear. As is well known, one of the convergence criteria

required to qualify for EMU is that a country maintains exchange rate stability: it must keep its

currency within their EMS fluctuation bands “without severe tensions” for at least two years

before joining the monetary union. A devaluation, even one-time, outside the ERM bands may

thus prevent a country from joining the EMU. This formal membership criterion could then lower

the perceived probability of EMU either directly, if the devaluation occurred within two years of

when the criterion would be relevant, or indirectly, whereby a devaluation at some point lowers

the perceived probability of a wide EMU coming into being in the more distant future. This



       14
          The model would predict that not all currencies would be equally affected by contagion.
For strong currencies with ð = 0 originally, the increase in Z would still leave x̂ < x , so that
equilibrium ð(ç, Z) will still equal zero, and no change in speculative pressures will be observed.
For other currencies, however, a successful speculative attack elsewhere will increase already
speculative pressures, or will introduce them if absent (that is, where the increase in Z pushes x̂
above x , so that ð rises from zero to G( x̂( ð, ç , Z ) ) > 0 ).

                                                  25
second linkage, more relevant when discussing the connection between the EMS crisis of 1992-3

and later implementation of EMU, is discussed in section 4.3. Given the uncertainty about

whether some countries would be able to meet the no-devaluation-for-two-years criterion when it

would become binding, a current devaluation would lower the perceived probability of EMU

coming into effect.

       One caveat concerns the previously discussed possibility that the failure of a large country

to meet the convergence criteria might lead to the expectation that the criteria themselves will be

changed so much that the devaluation had no effect on the perceptions that there would be an

EMU. As discussed above, there appears to be no evidence for this extreme view. When Italy or

the United Kingdom withdrew in September 1992, the perception was quite the opposite, namely,

raising serious question about the future of EMU. Hence, in terms of the model, the EMU

convergence criteria imply that a devaluation by one potential EMU country will lower Z for all

other potential EMU members.15

       Will the reduced possibility of EMU lower the “political resolve” of countries who have

maintained the fixed parity and make them more likely to devalue? There is much to suggest that

this may be the case. First, there seems no doubt that the desire to play a role, preferably an

important one in EMU, was a factor in decisions not to devalue. For example, in his discussion of

monetary policy in the EMS during this period, Mélitz (1995) asks why many countries

(especially France) followed Germany’s lead in adopting tight monetary policy though they were

going through a recession. Given France’s lower inflation than Germany and its high



       15
          Moreover, as discussed in section 4.3, the perception that membership criteria would be
significantly changed could lead to membership contagion via a different linkage.

                                                 26
unemployment, there is no reason a devaluation would have led markets to question Frances

monetary discipline. To explain the policy choice, Mélitz argues (p. 26),

       “The French official behavior can best be explained on the basis of long-run
       political goals. By maintaining the policy of the franc fort, the French authorities
       wished to promote the aim of monetary union and, in addition, assure themselves
       an important place, along Germany’s side, in future European monetary control.”

       An even stronger statement of how new information about the political “will” in one

country affects currency values in other countries can be found in Eichengreen and Wyplosz

(1993). Speaking about the relation between speculative pressures and the prospects for EMU,

they write (p. 52):

       “... until the summer of 1992, anticipations of a smooth transition to monetary
       union had stabilized expectations and hence the operation of the EMS. At that
       point, the protracted process of negotiation and ratification allowed doubts to
       surface about whether the treaty would ever come into effect. This altered the
       costs and benefits of the policies of austerity required of countries seeking to
       qualify for European monetary union, leading the markets to anticipate that those
       policies would ultimately be abandoned.”

They go on to argue that this may have played a role in the fall 1992 crisis. They suggest, as I

have, that in making policy decisions, these governments traded off the costs of high

unemployment against the benefits associated with qualifying for monetary union. Were the

benefits of the latter reduced, the government’s calculations would be affected. They write:

       “An implication of this trade-off is that the stability of exchange rates should be
       correlated with the prospects for European monetary union. This was clearly the
       case in 1992. The weakness of the lira dated from the day the negative outcome of
       the Danish referendum was known. The lira, the British pound, the Danish krone,
       and the French franc all fell on June 3, the first day after the referendum. The
       Danish nej was a surprise; it had not been forecast by the opinion polls. Initially,
       reports stated that legal experts saw no way the Maastricht treaty, or even parts of
       it, could be approved and enacted by only eleven EC members. Doubts were
       compounded by press reports that confusion about the treaty’s viability would
       stoke German concerns about the wisdom of pressing ahead with European


                                                27
          monetary union. Italian businessmen voiced fears that Danish rejection would
          undermine Italy’s resolve to comply with the convergence criteria laid down at
          Maastricht.”16

          The Eichengreen-Wyplosz argument is clearly close to the argument about membership

contagion presented here, though it is not a contagion story per se, whereby weakness in one

currency weakens another via the political decisionmaking mechanism. It is more accurately

characterized as a non-devaluation, common shock -- the negative outcome of the Danish

referendum, and, more generally, the process of protracted negotiations mentioned in the first

quote -- hitting all currencies before any one of them is attacked. But the arguments are similar,

each stressing how what are termed here membership effects can weaken the currencies of

potential members in a club. The argument in this paper takes the Eichengreen-Wyplosz

argument one step further, showing how membership effects can induce contagion in currency

crises.



6. Conclusions

          The argument here was not meant to suggest that membership contagion explains the

EMS crisis of 1992-3 to the exclusion of other factors. German monetary policy had

“monsoonal” effects, and spillovers of competitiveness clearly played a role in some of the EMS

devaluations, as they have in other contagious currency crises. The purpose of the paper was to

highlight a political mechanism for contagion which may play a role in recent currency crises, but

has received no careful discussion in the literature. The discussion of the previous section should

make clear the importance of external political events on currency crises in general, and the

possibility of contagious membership effects in particular. Moreover, such effects need not be

limited to explicit monetary unions. The next step is to find stronger evidence of such

membership effects, both in explicit and implicit cooperative arrangements. It will not be easy,

but it may be quite worthwhile.
