                                               ABSTRACT

Medicare as a Secondary Payer (MSP) legislation requires employer-sponsored health insurance to
be a primary payer for Medicare-eligible workers at firms with 20 or more employees. While the legislation
was developed to better target Medicare services to individuals without access to employer-sponsored
insurance, MSP creates a significant implicit tax on working beyond age 65. This implicit tax is approximately
15-20 percent at age 65 and increases to 45-70 percent by age 80. Eliminating this implicit tax by
making Medicare a primary payer for all Medicare-eligible individuals could significantly increase
lifetime labor supply due to the high labor supply elasticities of older workers. The extra income tax
receipts from such a policy would likely offset a large percentage of the estimated costs of making
Medicare a primary payer.

   1. Introduction

   It is well known that several European countries have pursued polices to get older workers to

leave the workforce in the hope that this will give more job opportunities to younger workers.

On the surface of it, this so-called “lump of labor” policy has been a failure since youth

unemployment remains very high in most of Europe. Less well known is that the U.S. has a set

of policies, whether intentional or not, that similarly discourage older workers from working by

disproportionately taxing their earnings. Given the demographic trends in the country and the

long-term budgetary pressures faced by the federal government, it is important to evaluate the

possibilities of removing these disincentives for long careers. If these policies effectively

discourage work by older workers, they reduce GDP and the government’s tax receipts.

   In previous work, we examined how the structure of Social Security tends to discourage long

careers (Goda, Shoven, Slavov 2006). In this paper, we focus on another federal policy that

creates disincentives towards working long careers or at least working beyond age 65. The

policy is known as Medicare as a Secondary Payer (MSP). Medicare adopted its MSP policy in

1982, effective January 1, 1983. This legislation states that for individuals working at firms with

20 or more employees, and otherwise eligible for Medicare benefits, Medicare serves as a

secondary payer for health care expenses. The employer’s health insurance is the first payer.

Because employer-sponsored health plans tend to be more comprehensive than Medicare, these

workers are effectively foregoing their Medicare benefits by working. If these same individuals

were not working, they would receive Medicare as their primary health insurance.




                                                                                                   1
   The incidence of the MSP policy would be a worthy research topic in its own right. While

many people would argue that the policy makes hiring workers over the age of 65 more

expensive, this is not necessarily the case. What is clear is that the policy creates a gap between

the cost of employing 65+ workers and their after-health-benefits salary for firms with employer-

sponsored health insurance plans. What is not clear is whether this policy increases the cost of

older workers or decreases their take-home pay. For the rest of this paper, we assume that the

incidence of employer-sponsored health insurance falls on workers. That means that we are

assuming that MSP depresses the net wages of working at sizable firms with health insurance

plans for those otherwise eligible for Medicare. Effectively, workers who are 65 and over and

employed by the relevant employers have incentives to buy the associated employer-sponsored

health insurance plan even though they would otherwise be eligible for Medicare.

   In this paper, we examine a change in policy whereby Medicare would be the primary

insurance provider for all age-eligible people whether they work or not, which we call Medicare

as a Primary Payer (or MPP). With the shift from MSP to MPP, wages for individuals 65 and

older would rise (at least for those working for large employers with health insurance), causing

them to increase both labor force participation and hours worked. We estimate the wage increase

that would arise from an MPP policy. Using estimates of labor supply elasticities by age, we

then estimate the impact of an MPP policy on labor supply, both alone and in conjunction with

reforms to Social Security that reduce the penalties for long careers. We also estimate the net

cost of switching from MSP to MPP.

   We attempt to examine the historical impact of the MSP policy on the labor supply and work

incentives of Medicare-eligible individuals. It is difficult to identify the impact of the MSP

legislation, as it went into effect at a time that the Social Security earnings test was liberalized




                                                                                                       2
substantially. These two policy changes tend to work in the opposite direction in terms of work

incentives for individuals aged 65 and older. We investigate the response to MSP by looking at

the labor force participation behavior and health insurance availability of individuals most

affected by the MSP provision relative to a control group of non-Medicare eligible individuals.

We examine the effects at two different points in time: 1983, when the policy was implemented,

and 1995, when numerous steps were taken to increase the enforcement of the provision. Our

results show that labor supply actually increased in the treatment group relative to the control

group, a finding that is most likely caused by roughly simultaneous changes to the Social

Security earnings test.

   This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the history behind Medicare as a

Secondary Payer, and the existing literature on the impact of this policy. Section III investigates

the change in work incentives and the economy that would result from a switch to a MPP policy.

Section IV discusses the changes in labor force participation and health insurance availability

that has occurred since MSP was instituted, and Section V concludes.



   2. History of Medicare as a Secondary Payer

   There has been evidence that as public insurance programs expand, private insurance

purchases are substituted with public insurance coverage. The extent to which private insurance

coverage is reduced is known as “crowd-out,” and estimates suggest that the crowd-out rate was

approximately 60 percent for Medicaid expansions (Gruber and Simon (2007), Cutler and

Gruber (1996)). In other words, the number of privately insured fell by 60 people for every

additional 100 people covered by public insurance.




                                                                                                   3
     For the population over 65, Medicare was essentially a universal insurance program. As

such, it crowded out private coverage for anyone who would have had private coverage in its

absence. This means that Medicare was providing health insurance for lots of people who would

have had health insurance anyway. One possible way to reduce crowd-out is to provide coverage

or a higher subsidization of costs to targeted groups who are in greater need of coverage.

Medicare as a Secondary Payer attempted to do this by essentially limiting benefits for

individuals who had opportunities to obtain insurance through their employers. The legislation,

which took effect on January 1, 1983, stated that Medicare would be a secondary payer for

individuals who carried employer-sponsored health insurance at firms with 20 or more

employees. The legislation also extends to spouses of workers who are otherwise Medicare-

eligible. As a secondary payer, Medicare would only pay expenses that are covered by Medicare

and not covered by the employer plan. The employer is required to offer health insurance to its

employees over 65 on identical terms as to employees under 65; in particular, 65-and-over

employees cannot purchase policies that merely fill in the gaps of Medicare (known as

“MediGap” policies). Firms are also not allowed to compensate workers who choose to decline

coverage. If a worker chooses to decline their employer-sponsored health insurance, they would

be subject to substantial Medicare deductibles and co-payments, and historically, no coverage for

pharmaceuticals. Therefore, in most instances, enrolling in the employer-sponsored plan was a

superior alternative for these workers. Medicare’s expenses are then essentially reduced by the

cost of health care for individuals who have access to employer-sponsored health insurance.

   However, a major concern of anti-crowd-out measures such as MSP is that incentives may

change in a way that distorts labor market behavior. Butrica, Johnson, Smith and Steuerle (2004)

found that because of this policy, Medicare significantly increases the effective tax rate on




                                                                                                  4
working beyond age 65. The study finds that a middle income worker in their early 50s faces an

effective tax rate of roughly 15 percent but that this tax rate approaches 50 percent by age 70 due

to policies that discourage older individuals from working and having a longer career. The MSP

policy is a big part of this jump.

   Johnson (2003) makes a back of the envelope estimate of how much the cost of hiring older

workers would be reduced if the MSP policy were dropped. He guesses that if Medicare were

the primary payer for working individuals over age 65, the costs of hiring older workers would

reduce by approximately 4 percent of their salary. He was not explicit about his incidence

assumption, but it clearly was different than ours. In our approach, the cost of hiring older

workers does not change; the impact of the policy switch is the supply response to higher take-

home pay. Our estimates of the wage increase from the switch are far higher than 4 percent and

more in line with Butrica et al. (2004). The discrepancy is largely because Johnson (2003)

assumes that employed older adults are generally in better-than-average health and use relatively

few health services.

   Glied and Stabile (2001) showed that there had been no significant changes in wages or

employment due to the secondary payer mandate. However, their period of analysis was 1977 to

1987, and they assert that compliance appeared to be low immediately following the 1983

introduction of the legislation. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) changed

its procedures in 1995 in order to tighten enforcement of MSP. In particular, CMS has

contracted with a firm to survey beneficiaries three months before they are scheduled to be

entitled to Medicare benefits regarding their and their spouse’s employment status and other

health insurance they are receiving. If the questionnaire is not returned within 45 days, the

beneficiaries are provided with a follow-up survey. Non-responses are followed up with a




                                                                                                  5
telephone call. Seventy percent of the initial surveys are returned, and the response rate

increases to 79 percent after the follow-up. CMS uses the surveys to determine whether the

beneficiary has coverage that is primary to Medicare. In 1997, it was estimated that this process

saved Medicare an extra $425 million. Other initiatives, such as the sharing of data between

CMS, private insurers, the IRS, and the Social Security Administration, have also led to

increased compliance with MSP. According to a Department of Health and Human Services

report in June 2000, only 0.43 percent of beneficiaries with primary health insurance coverage in

1997 were not identified by Medicare (Brown 2000). In Section IV, we take another look at

Glied and Stabile’s analysis, examining the effects in both 1983 and 1995 when Medicare as a

Secondary Payer was better enforced.



   3. The Effects of Medicare as a Primary Payer

   To determine the effect of the MSP provision, one could look at its historical impact in 1983

(when it was introduced) or 1995 (when enforcement was ratcheted up). The associated

reductions in labor supply and wages can provide an estimate of the policy’s impact. However,

as will be shown in the following section, it is difficult to identify the historical impact of the

MSP provision. This problem occurs because, during the same period, the Social Security

earning’s test was liberalized, which had an opposite effect on labor supply. The earnings test

liberalization impacted exactly the same workers (those 65 or over) as the MSP policy. Even if

identification were possible, it is unlikely to provide a good estimate of the impact of MSP today.

Health care costs have risen substantially in recent years, making the added “tax” attributable to

MSP larger. This would result in a larger impact on the wage of individuals aged 65 and older,

and a greater decline in labor force participation and hours worked.




                                                                                                      6
    Therefore, in this section, we follow an alternative approach. Because workers essentially

forego Medicare benefits by working at a firm that offers health insurance to their employees, we

can think of the value of average Medicare expenditures for each age and gender as a tax on

working. As a result of this implicit tax, workers aged 65 and over earn lower wages than they

would in the absence of the MSP provision. Using data on Medicare costs, we estimate the

implicit tax due to the MSP provision. If the MSP provision were removed, we would expect

wages to rise by the amount of the implicit tax. Combined with estimates of labor supply

elasticity for older workers, we can determine the increase in labor supply that would result from

making Medicare a primary payer for all beneficiaries. In reality, the average Medicare

expenditure for a particular age and gender is a lower bound for the insurance value that an

individual receives from Medicare, as private insurance companies generally include loading and

expense charges in their premiums.

    We begin by estimating average real Medicare expenditures by age and gender for 1997-

2005. We were able to obtain Medicare claims-based data on average Medicare expenditures by

age and gender for 1989-1997. However, we do not have similar figures for 1997 onwards.

Using the 1989-1997 data, combined with Social Security population figures by age and gender,

we determine the ratio of average Medicare expenditures for each gender to average Medicare

expenditures for the total Medicare population. We average this ratio over 1989-1997 and apply

it to average real Medicare expenditures by age from 1997-2005 to calculate average real

Medicare expenditures by age and gender for these years.1

    The average Medicare expenditures represent the total tax on workers in a given age and

gender group. To compute the implicit tax rate, we simulate real age-wage profiles for each year

from 1997 to 2005. To construct these age-wage profiles, we compute the average wage for each

age and gender using the Outgoing Rotation Groups from the 2005 and 2006 Current Population

Survey (CPS). Then we compute the ratio of each age and gender group’s wage to the entire

sample’s average wage. We apply these ratios to the time series of nationwide average wages

published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to find the age- and gender-specific wage for each

year. For example, consider an average male 65-year-old worker in 2000. The national average

annual wage in 2000 was $24,667.76. Based on the CPS surveys, male 65-year-old workers earn

approximately 1.098 times the national average; therefore, a 65-year-old male worker’s

simulated nominal wage in 2000 would be $24,667.76 x 1.098 = $27,085.20.

   Figures 1 and 2 summarize our estimates of the added tax attributable to the MSP provision

for men and women, respectively. Each line in the graph depicts the implicit tax rate by age for

a particular year, based on that year’s simulated age-wage profile. The tax rate is computed by

dividing the relevant year’s Medicare expenditures for each age and gender group by the

simulated wage. We find that this implicit tax ranges from approximately 15 percent for men

age 65, to 45 percent for men age 80. Women face higher implicit taxes from MSP: 20 percent

at age 65, growing to almost 70 percent at age 80. While women generally have lower health

care costs than men at each age, they also have lower average wages. As shown clearly in the

graphs, the implicit tax for all age groups has increased over time because health care

expenditures have grown faster than wages over this period.

     Medicare is not the only program that discourages work among older individuals. Social

Security also contains a number of provisions that create high marginal tax rates on older

workers. In previous work (Goda, Shoven, and Slavov 2006), we identify some of these

features. The Social Security benefit computation is based on the highest 35 years of indexed

earnings. If an individual works for fewer than 35 years, zeros are averaged in for the remaining

years. For a career that is shorter than 35 years, working an additional year increases Social

Security benefits considerably, as the earnings from that year replace a zero in the benefit

computation. A year of work beyond 35 years has a significantly lower payoff: at best, it




                                                                                                  10
replaces a positive (but lower) value in the benefit computation. Moreover, the benefit

computation makes no distinction between short careers and low wages. An individual who

works for 40 or more years at a low wage may have the same average indexed earnings as an

individual who works for less than 20 years at a high wage. The individual with the short career

appears to have a low income because zeros are averaged in for the remaining 15 years. The

progressivity of the benefit formula implies that the short-careered individual receives a

relatively high rate of return intended for lower-income workers.

   In our earlier work, we examined policies that would make Social Security more neutral with

respect to career length. These policies are (1) changing the number of years of earnings used in

the calculation of Social Security benefits from 35 to 40, so that it uses the highest 40 years of

indexed earnings; (2) establishing a new “paid-up” category of workers who have 40 years of

covered earnings above a set threshold (e.g. five percent of the earnings cap) who would then be

exempt from both the employer and employee portion of the payroll tax; and (3) using a new

method of calculating benefits that would allow low income workers to be treated differently

from workers with short careers, separating the progressivity of the system from the treatment of

career length. We show that, taken together, these three policies reduce the large disincentives

towards working at older ages.

   The “paid-up” concept can also be extended to Medicare, so that those who work longer than

40 years would face no payroll tax at all. That alone would remove a 15.3 percent wedge

between what employers pay and what senior workers receive. The current policy is that these

long-career employees are subject to the payroll tax, but many receive no extra benefits from

their additional contributions. The combination of the paid-up concept and the MPP policy




                                                                                                     11
could remove a 30 to 60 percent wedge in the labor market for men over the age of 65, and a 35

to 85 percent wedge for women over age 65.

       Eliminating the MSP in isolation or in combination with the paid-up concept results in a

permanent increase in the wage for individuals aged 65 and above. The impact of these policy

changes depends on the elasticity of labor supply among older individuals. French (2005)

develops a life cycle model in which individuals choose their consumption, labor supply, and

retirement age; they face a fixed cost of working, borrowing constraints, and uncertainty

regarding health status and wages. French estimates the parameters of the model by matching its

predictions to life cycle profiles of labor force participation, hours worked, and assets from the

Panel Study of Income Dynamics.

       Table 1 summarizes the labor supply responses simulated from a permanent change in wages

at several different ages.2 The impact of a permanent wage change at relatively young ages (e.g.,

age 30) are low because as labor supply increases beginning at age 30, savings are also

increased. The higher accumulated savings near retirement may actually cause people to retire

earlier through a wealth effect, dampening the overall response in total lifetime labor supply.

Note that a permanent wage change at age 55 leads to the highest overall effect on lifetime labor

supply, with an elasticity of 0.16021. For the MSP policy, the relevant figure is the lifetime

labor supply elasticity for a permanent change in wages at age 65. This elasticity is 0.04208,

indicating that a doubling of wages at age 65 would increase the total lifetime labor supply by

approximately 4 percent. This change can be decomposed into two effects: a slight reduction in

labor supply from ages 30 to 64 in anticipation of higher wages at age 65 and beyond, and a very

large increase in the labor supply during the years of higher wages. The reduction before age 65

represents a partial reallocation of labor supply to ages where wages are higher. To the extent

that the permanent wage change is unanticipated, perhaps during a transition to the MPP policy,

the reallocation effect would be small and the total lifetime labor supply response would be even

greater. Even in the case that the permanent wage change is fully anticipated, the labor supply

response after the permanent wage change more than makes up for the reallocation effect,

resulting in higher lifetime labor supply.

   Combining the estimates of the taxes created by MSP and the elasticities summarized above

indicates that switching to an MPP policy could increase total lifetime labor supply by 0.15 x

0.04208, or approximately 0.6 percent. This estimate is a lower bound that assumes that MPP

would cause wages to increase by 15 percent beginning at age 65. Because health care

expenditures rise with age, the actual wage increase at higher ages is much larger. If the paid-up

concept were instituted as well, the lower bound on the effect on total lifetime labor supply

would double to 1.2 percent. Table 2 shows the percentage of workers achieving paid-up status

(i.e. 40 years of earnings) at several ages based on the Benefits and Earnings Public-Use File,

2004. This dataset contains earnings histories for a one percent sample of Social Security




                                                                                                  13
beneficiaries in December 2004. It shows that approximately 52 percent of men and 20 percent

of women eventually do achieve paid-up status. Of these, the vast majority achieve paid-up

status by the age of 65. This suggests that almost half of workers would be paid-up and therefore

experience the additional 15.3 percent wage increase at age 65.

       What are the costs to the federal government of switching to an MPP policy? To determine

Medicare’s potential savings from the current MSP policy, we estimate the amount of Medicare

expenditures that are borne by the population of older workers covered by employer-sponsored

health insurance in 2002:

                         MSPSavings 2002 = ∑ LFPa , g ⋅ Pop a , g ⋅ ERHI a , g ⋅ MedExpa , g
                                               a,g



We first arrive at the number of workers by using 2002 labor force participation rates by age and

gender, LFPa , g , calculated from the CPS, and population estimates, Pop a , g , from the Social

Security Administration as of July 1, 2002.3 Because not all workers are covered by a primary

health insurance plan provided by their employer, we then multiply by the percent of workers

who have employer-sponsored health insurance, denoted by ERHI a , g . In 2002, this value was

54.7 percent for men age 65 and above, and 50.9 percent for women age 65 and above. Note that

                                                                                                              14
this value is only a proxy for those likely to be covered by MSP legislation; it is possible that the

proportion covered by MSP is smaller due to its exception of firms with 20 or fewer employees.

    Once we have the number of individuals likely foregoing Medicare benefits due to MSP for

each age and gender, we multiply by the average Medicare expenditures in the respective

cell, MedExpa , g , to arrive at an upper bound of the Medicare expenditures borne by the

population of older workers covered by MSP of approximately $11.6 billion. This represents an

upper bound of the extra expenditures that Medicare would be responsible for if it switched to a

policy of being the primary payer for all individuals over age 65.4 This value compares to total

Medicare expenditures for HI and SMI of $265.7 billion for that year, and indicates that

dropping the secondary payer provisions and adopting a primary payer policy could increase

Medicare’s costs by at most 4.4 percent.

    Suppose the MPP policy were instituted alone (i.e. without the accompanying paid-up

concept). If we take into account the labor supply response that would occur if we moved to an

MPP policy, the federal government unified budget deficit would not worsen by exactly that

amount. This is because of the additional personal income and payroll taxes that would be

generated by removing the disincentives for people to work long careers. According to the

National Income and Product Accounts, aggregate wage and salary disbursements totaled

$4,942.8 billion in 2002. If we assume that aggregate wages would increase by 0.6 percent from

making Medicare a primary payer of health benefits (a reasonable estimate given the elasticities

above), an extra $29.7 billion in income would be subject to federal income taxes. This means

that if 25 percent of this extra income was captured by the federal tax system and funneled into

4
  The 2004 House Ways and Means Committee Green Book (Table 2-44) estimates that Medicare saved just under
$2 billion in 2002 from the secondary payer provisions. The Green Book gives no description of how the $2 billion
is calculated. The discrepancy may be due to the fact that not all workers with employer-sponsored health insurance
are covered by MSP (e.g. if they work at firms with 20 or fewer employees), and also that workers may have lower
than average Medicare expenditures, leading to a lower “savings” from MSP.


                                                                                                                15
Medicare finances, the additional $11.6 billion that Medicare would be paying as a primary

payer would be offset by $7.4 billion in additional revenue to the government. Additionally, the

extra income would be subject to payroll taxes, channeling an extra $4.5 billion (15.4 percent x

$29.7 billion) directly into Social Security and Medicare.

   If the MPP policy were instituted in combination with the paid-up concept, aggregate wages

could increase by 1.2 percent, generating $59.3 billion in income that would be subject to federal

income taxes (but not payroll taxes). If the average marginal income tax rate were 25 percent,

this extra income would in turn divert $14.8 billion in additional revenue to the government.

This revenue would more than offset the additional cost of the MPP policy if it were redirected

to Medicare, and would partially offset the costs of the paid-up policy change.



   4. The Historical Impact of MSP

   Identifying the impact of the MSP requirement is tricky because of an important confounding

factor: the Social Security earnings test. Under the earnings test, Social Security recipients who

earn income above a certain threshold are subject to reductions in their Social Security benefits.

As documented by Gruber and Orszag (2000), the earnings test threshold for individuals aged

65-69 increased in real terms between 1978 and 2000 (when it was eliminated). There was a

particularly sharp increase starting in 1996 and coinciding with the period of increased

enforcement for the MSP requirement. There were also increases in the early 1980s. Both the

earnings test and the MSP requirement work in opposite directions, which would make it

difficult to identify the labor supply response to the law changes.

   Nonetheless, we attempt an analysis along the lines of Glied and Stabile (2001). We use a

difference-in-difference approach to evaluate the impact of labor market incentives before and




                                                                                                  16
after MSP. However, we look at both at the original implementation of the policy in 1983, as

well as the increase in enforcement efforts in 1995. The possible effects on the supply of older

workers include switching into employment not under the provisions of MSP, or stopping

participation in the labor force completely. Employment not under the provisions of MSP may

include firms that do not offer health insurance, or positions that are not eligible for health

insurance benefits, such as part-time or consultant status.

    Our data come from the March supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS) from

1980-2006.5 The sample includes individuals aged 60-69 who are not employed in the armed

forces. The treatment group consists of individuals aged 66-69, who are affected by the MSP

policy; the control group consists of individuals aged 60-64, who are not affected by the policy.6

Our basic strategy is to look at a set of labor supply variables for the treatment group relative to

the control group. The labor supply variables we consider include indicators for labor force

participation and full-time employment. We would expect to see a decline in both of these for

the treatment group relative to the control group after MSP went into effect. We also look at

whether the individual holds an employer-provided health insurance policy, and whether the

individual is covered by an employer-provided health insurance policy (regardless of whether

they are the policy holder). Again, we would expect to see a relative decline in both of these

characteristics among the treatment group, as they are likely to shift from employers who offer

health insurance to ones who do not. Determining the effective date for MSP is somewhat

tricky. While it went into effect in 1983, it was not widely enforced until 1995. To deal with

this, we consider two separate “after” time periods: 1984-1994 and 1996-2006. In the former

  We do not include 65-year-olds. Since it is possible for a person to be surveyed in adjacent March CPSs, we want
to avoid the problem of someone switching from the control group to the treatment group.


                                                                                                                17
period, the MSP policy was in effect but not enforced. In the latter period, the MSP policy was

widely enforced.

   Our regression model is as follows:

                   Yit = βX i + αD + γTi + δ 84−94Ti * d 84−94 + δ 96−06Ti * d 96−06   (1)

Here, Yit is our indicator of labor supply or health insurance coverage for individual i in year t ,

X i is a vector of individual characteristics (we use race and education), D is a vector of year

dummies, d 84−94 and d 96−06 are dummy variables equal to 1 during the periods 1984-1994 (when

MSP was in effect but not widely enforced) and 1996-2006 (when MSP was enforced), and Ti is

a dummy variable equal to 1 if individual i is in the treatment group. The key parameters are

δ 84−94 and δ 96−06 , the coefficients of the interaction terms, which measure the differences

between the treatment and control groups after MSP went into effect and began to be enforced.

Their predicted signs are negative. We would also expect δ 96−06 to be larger in magnitude than

δ 84−94 as a result of increased enforcement.

       We estimate (1) for men and women separately. We initially include all individuals in

the sample, whether or not they participate in the labor force. Our dependent variables in this

case are labor force participation and insurance coverage indicators. We then restrict the sample

to individuals in the labor force. Our dependent variables for this restricted sample are indicators

for full-time employment and health insurance coverage. Finally, we restrict the sample further

to individuals who work full time. The restricted samples are intended to capture shifts in

employment from full-time to part-time work, or from employers that provide health coverage to

ones who do not.

 The results are not substantially different if we use a logit or linear probability model instead. They also do not
change if we exclude the controls for individual characteristics and the time dummies.

above, these results are explained by the relaxation of the Social Security earnings test that

occurred in these periods. In addition, the current Medicare treatment of workers and non-

workers may blunt the impact of raising the Social Security normal retirement age (NRA) on

retirement age. The NRA will soon be 66 and will advance to 67 by 2022. However, the age of

eligibility for Medicare is scheduled to remain 65. If someone works between 65 and 67, they

effectively give up their Medicare entitlement. Of course, their opportunity to work and their net

wage from working is reduced by the current Medicare treatment. One policy (advancing the

NRA) tends to encourage working to older ages while the other (Medicare’s coverage being

contingent on not working for an employer with health benefits) discourages it.



   5. Conclusion

   Medicare as a Secondary Payer legislation was developed to better target health insurance for

the elderly to individuals who did not have access to insurance from their employer. However,

anti-crowd out measures often distort labor market behavior, and given high health care

expenditures among the elderly, MSP creates a significant implicit tax on working beyond the

age of Medicare eligibility. By working at a firm that offers health insurance to its employees,

workers are effectively foregoing their Medicare benefits. We find that this creates a 15 to 70

percent implicit tax on working beyond age 65. Eliminating this implicit tax by making

Medicare a primary payer regardless of an individual’s employment status, along with

eliminating other provisions that discourage long careers, could have a significant effect on

lifetime labor supply. In addition, increased personal income tax revenues would likely offset

the additional cost of providing Medicare benefits to the working population that is currently

covered primarily by private health insurance from their employers. The effect of the provision




                                                                                                   20
thus far is difficult to determine given periods of less stringent enforcement and the concurrent

easing of the Social Security earnings test. However, given the high labor supply elasticities of

older workers, eliminating the large tax on working that is created by MSP could potentially

have a significant effect.
