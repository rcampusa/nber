Family Status Transitions, Latent Health, and the Post-Retirement Evolution of Assets

JEL No. E21,J14

                                              ABSTRACT

We consider the evolution of assets after retirement. We ask whether total assets--including housing
equity, personal retirement accounts, and other financial assets--tend to be husbanded for a rainy day
and drawn down primarily at the time of precipitating shocks, or whether they are drawn down throughout
the retirement period. We focus on the relationships between family status transitions, “latent” health
status, and the evolution of assets. Our analysis is based primarily on longitudinal data from the HRS
and AHEAD cohorts of the Health and Retirement Study. We find that the evolution of assets is strongly
related to family status transitions. For both single individuals and married couples who do not experience
a death or divorce, total assets increase well into old age. In contrast, individuals in married couples
that experience a family status transition, either a death or a divorce, exhibit much slower asset growth
and often experience a large decline in asset values at the time of the transition. In addition, the level
and evolution of assets is very strongly related to health, measured by a latent health index. For example,
for continuing two-person HRS households between the ages of 56 and 61 in 1992 the ratio of assets
of households in the top health quintile to the assets of those in the bottom quintile was 1.7 in 1992.
It had increased to 2.2 by the end of 2006.

       Personal retirement accounts are one of the primary means of saving for
retirement in the U.S. Since the advent of these accounts in the early 1980s, a
great deal of attention has been directed to the accumulation of retirement assets
in these accounts. Much less attention has been directed to the drawdown of
assets under a regime in which personal accounts play an increasingly important
role. When private retirement saving was dominated by employer-provided
defined benefit plans, benefits were typically dispersed in the form of annuities.
Under the personal account regime only a very small fraction of retirement assets
are annuitized, and the drawdown of assets is largely self-directed.

        The increasing importance of personal retirement accounts raises a
number of important questions. One is how the evolution of assets in retirement
is related to precipitating "shocks," such as health events, widowhood, divorce,
and nursing home entry. All of these shocks may have financial consequences.
Another is how the distribution of assets evolves with age. What is the likelihood
of a household being unable to cover the cost of health shocks or the cost of a
change in family status? A third question is how alternative methods of
managing asset drawdown may affect financial well-being. In particular, how
does the current largely “self-directed” system compare to a more “managed”
system such as one featuring partial or full annuitization of personal account
assets? Finally, how do recent and anticipated future developments, such as
the recent decline in financial asset values, rising retirement ages, and the
anticipated growth in personal retirement assets in future decades, affect the
ability of households to meet health and family status shocks?
       The principle aim of this paper is to set out a data framework that can
support analysis of these questions. We focus our analysis on the extent to
which the drawdown of assets is triggered by shocks to family status and how the
evolution of assets is related to health status.
        Venti and Wise (2001, 2004) considered the drawdown of home equity in
retirement. They found that, on average, home equity increased through age 70
and declined slightly (1.76 percent per year) thereafter. Almost all of this
average decline for older retirees could be accounted for by the decline in home
equity among households experiencing shocks to family status, like death of a
spouse or entry into a nursing home. There was little decline for households that
did not experience shocks, which suggested that home equity was typically not
used to support general consumption in retirement but instead was conserved for
a “rainy day.” Megbolugbe, Sa-Aadu, and Shilling (1997, 1999) and Banks,
Blundell, Oldfield and Smith (2007) also found that the drawdown of assets was
greatest at times of change in family status. Davidoff (2007) concludes that
households may preserve their home equity to finance potentially large health
expenses, using home equity as an informal source of long-term care insurance.

       In Poterba, Venti, and Wise (2009), we found that IRA and 401(k) assets
tend to be conserved and that less than one-quarter of all account holders
withdraw assets from these accounts before age 70 ½, the age at which they


                                        2
become subject to minimum distribution requirements. Even among those who
made withdrawals before age 70 ½, the amounts averaged less that 2 percent of
the balance. Holden (2009) found that only 21.4 percent of IRA-owning
households age 59 to 69 made a withdrawal in 2008. This evidence suggests
that personal retirement plan assets, like home equity, are husbanded in
retirement – at least by many households.

        Most previous research on retirement saving has focused on asset
accumulation, not the draw-down of assets after retirement. A notable exception
is the study by Hurd and Rohwedder (2006), which tracks wealth changes and
household consumption in panel data. There have also been a number of
studies, summarized in Hurst (2008), of household consumption after retirement.
But the consumption literature in most cases does not examine changes in asset
holdings.

        Among the studies that do focus on changes in wealth, there has been
limited attention to shocks to family status. Hurd (2002), using HRS data, finds
that most components of the portfolios of the elderly grow after retirement. The
exception, he finds, is that the probability of owning a home declines after age
80. Coile and Milligan (2009), also studying HRS data, find that holdings of
housing and vehicles decline with age but that holdings of financial assets
increase. They find that shocks, particularly widowhood, are coincident with
asset drawdown, and in particular with a decline in home ownership. They do
not compare the age profile of housing and vehicle ownership for those with, and
without, shocks to health and family status. Haveman et. al. (2005) consider
whether assets at retirement are sufficient to maintain for the next ten years the
earnings replacement rate at retirement, using the SSA's New Beneficiary
Survey. They find that although the median replacement rate remains constant,
there is substantial variation over time. Over a fifth of the households judged to
have adequate saving at retirement fell below their retirement-age replacement
rate by ten years after retirement. Lupton and Smith (2000) explore the
relationship between family status and wealth using the first wave of the HRS
and three waves of the PSID. Their cross-sectional analysis using the HRS
shows that there are large wealth differences by marital status. Their longitudinal
analysis using the PSID shows that assets increase for continuously married
families, are unchanged for divorced or separated families, and decline for
widowed families. The PSID results pertain to households that are younger than
the HRS households that we study, and thus the estimated changes in assets
reflect differences in pre-retirement saving rather than post-retirement asset
drawdown.

       In this paper we ask if the key features of the drawdown of home equity
and personal retirement assets are reflected in the drawdown of other assets as
well. Our key data source is the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We use
eight waves of data from the original HRS cohort who were age 51 to 61 in 1992
and seven waves of data from the original Asset and Health Dynamics Among



                                         3
the Oldest Old (AHEAD) cohort who were age 70 and older in 1993. The results
are based on the observed evolution of the assets of these two cohorts as they
age. The HRS cohort is followed from 1992 until 2006 and the AHEAD cohort
from 1993 until 2006. Thus our results do not capture the effect of the recent
sharp decline in financial and housing markets.

       A key issue confounding our analysis is the high incidence of apparent
asset reporting errors and missing data. Details of these data problems are set
out in an appendix. We use medians and trimmed means in an attempt to limit
the effects of data errors. We are also limited in our analysis because the HRS
and AHEAD data do not allow reliable estimation of 401(k) assets, an
increasingly important source of retirement saving. This limitation and
measurement problems are discussed in section 1 below.

        This paper is divided into eight sections. The first five consider the
relationship between family status transitions and the post-retirement evolution of
total assets, defined broadly to include financial assets, home equity and
retirement plan assets. We emphasize the drawdown of assets that are
controlled directly by the household. Thus we do not include the asset value of
annuities received from Social Security or from defined benefit pension plans.
We focus on how asset accumulation patterns vary across households that
experience different family status transitions, distinguishing continuing two-
person families, families that transition from two-person to one-person families,
and continuing one-person families. In section 1 we describe how the data are
organized for analysis, as well as the limitations of the data. In section 2 we
consider the evolution of the assets of the HRS cohort between 1992 and 2006.
In section 3, we consider the evolution of the assets of the older AHEAD cohort
between 1993 and 2006. In section 4, we look more closely at the assets of
individuals in households that experience a family status transition by considering
their assets before and after the transition. In section 5, we compare the results
based on the HRS and AHEAD cohorts with results for the same cohorts based
on the SIPP data. We also expand the analysis of family status transitions to
consider the effect of latent health on the level and the evolution of assets. In
section 6 we describe the latent health index that we use to index health status.
In section 7, we describe the relationship between latent health and the level and
evolution of assets, within family status transition groups. Section 8 is a
summary and discussion of future work.

1. Family Status Transitions and the Evolution of Assets: Data Limitations
and Organization

       We begin with analysis of the evolution of total assets based on data from
the HRS using both the original HRS cohort and the AHEAD cohort. The
analysis, however, is confounded by data limitations and reporting errors that
have motivated the analysis and conditioned how the analysis proceeds. Thus




                                        4
we give attention to these issues before explaining how the data is organized for
analysis.

       The key limitation of the HRS and AHEAD data is the measurement of
401(k) assets. These datasets provide reliable information on assets in IRA and
Keogh plans but, as noted above, not on assets in 401(k) accounts. A large
proportion of IRA balances (which are included in our measure of total assets)
represent rollovers from 401(k) plans, however. But the information on directly
held 401(k) balances in the HRS is incomplete and is not used in this analysis.
Thus we compare the results based on the HRS and AHEAD data with results
based on the SIPP that does include 401(k) assets. We find that SIPP trends are
similar to those based on the HRS and AHEAD data, but the rates of increase
are typically higher based on the SIPP data.

       Data reporting errors and missing data also pose difficulties for our
analysis and condition the approach we have taken. Curtin, Juster and Morgan
(1989), Juster, Smith and Stafford (1999), and Bosworth and Smart (2009) and
others have shown that survey estimates of wealth are well-known to be
susceptible to under-reporting and misreporting. This is true in all large
household-level surveys and is a particularly severe problem among wealthy
respondents.

         A careful examination of the HRS data used in this analysis reveals two
sources of apparent error. The first is the misreporting of asset ownership. A
household may, for example, report owning a home (or some other major asset)
for four waves, then report no ownership for a wave, and then report ownership
again in subsequent waves. 1 The second source is the misreporting of the value
of an asset. In this case a respondent may report a particular value for several
periods, then report a wildly different value for one period, and then report the
original value in subsequent periods. In some cases these apparent "errors" may
be valid responses--a person may sell a home and not repurchase for another
year. If this is the case, then the loss of value in the "misreported" asset should
be offset by an increase in value elsewhere on the household balance sheet.
This does not happen in the majority of the cases, so misreporting is the most
likely explanation for many of the extreme dips and spikes we observe in the
data. Smith (1995) provides additional details on inconsistent asset levels in the
first two waves of the HRS.

        The high frequency of apparent misreporting of asset values leads to
volatile estimates of mean assets, especially in small samples. This type of
1
  This problem is particularly severe for pension assets – a major component of total wealth.
Gustman and Steinmeier (2004), Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai (2008) and, Dushi and
Honig (2008) show that a large fraction of the population has little knowledge of the features of
their pension and often misreport something as basic as pension type (DC vs DB). In many
surveys, including the HRS, a misreported pension type means that the pension balance is not
collected.



                                                 5
measurement error is particularly serious in longitudinal analyses when the
variable of interest is the wave-to-wave change in wealth. A single misreport in a
panel will result in two incorrect measurements of the change in wealth. For
example, failure to report an asset on one wave will lead to a large negative
change and a large positive change in two consecutive surveys. Moreover,
these spurious changes are likely to be large relative to correctly reported values,
so misreports generate a large amount of "noise" relative to signal, thus making it
very difficult to obtain reliable estimates of even simple statistics such as the
mean rate of wealth accumulation.

       We have directed considerable attention to dealing with data problems
associated with apparent misreporting. In most instances we do not directly
estimate changes in total assets. Instead we obtain estimates of the change in
assets by separately estimating the level of assets at the beginning of the period
and the level of assets at the end of the period and then calculating the mean
change as the difference between mean levels. We also make extensive use of
medians and trimmed means to lessen the influence of outliers that may be the
result of misreporting. 2

        There are two additional features of the HRS data that bear on the quality
of reported asset information. First, these apparent misreporting errors persist in
the data despite the sophisticated bracketing methods employed in the HRS.
When a respondent fails to provide an asset value, a follow-up question asks if
the value fell in a particular interval. Additional follow-up questions narrow the
range. These bracketing methods have been shown to significantly reduce the
rate of non-response. Second, there are some special issues concerning the
collection of data on 401(k) assets. In particular, persons are well-known to
misreport the type of pension (defined benefit or defined contribution) they have.
When a currently employed person with a DC plan misreports his pension as DB,
the person is not queried about the balance. Thus we observe many large wave-
to-wave fluctuations in 401(k) assets that appear to be the result of misreporting
pension type. There are also difficulties with the collection of 401(k) balances for
persons who are retired, but still have a 401(k) balance with their previous
employer. In principal, information about pensions with past employers should
have been "pre-loaded" in the HRS survey instruments to prompt questions
about these balances. However, in many years this pre-loading did not occur or
was incomplete so complete 401(k) balances were not obtained. Because of
these problems we have chosen to exclude all 401(k) balances from the measure
of total assets in our analyses using the HRS (we do include IRA and Keogh


2
  There is, in principle, another approach we could employ--go back to the raw data and "correct"
misreported values. This approach would rely in part on an "asset verification" module, described
in Hill (2006) that is now part of the bi-annual HRS survey. Responses in the current survey
wave are compared to responses in the previous wave and respondents are asked to reconcile
inconsistencies. The data collected by this module have not been used in the present analysis,
although we hope to use them in future analyses.



                                               6
assets). In section 5 we compare HRS data to SIPP data, which contains more
complete 401(k) data, to gauge the extent of this problem.

        Our analysis uses wealth at the beginning and end of each two-year
interval to calculate the change in assets. This change in assets can be
separated into two components: withdrawals (or deposits) and capital losses
(gains). The distinction is particularly relevant in the current financial crisis
because it is important to know if declining wealth reflects active asset spend-
down or passive asset repricing. The HRS provides limited information on this
distinction. There is very good information on direct withdrawals from IRAs and
Keoghs, but the data on withdrawals from 401(k) are subject to the same
problems that prevent us from using the data on 401(k) balances. There is also
very good data on house sales that allow us to distinguish between withdrawals
of home equity and falling house values. The data on withdrawals from other
asset balances is less complete. Respondents are only asked if they bought or
put money in stocks or mutual funds and if they sold or cashed in any stocks or
mutual funds since the previous interview. They are also asked the dollar
amount of these transactions. There is no information on withdrawal of funds
from other assets (e.g. bonds, CDs, money market instruments, etc.) held by
households.

        We turn now to how we organize the data for analysis. For this analysis
the unit of observation is the person rather than the household. From the HRS
we follow persons first surveyed in 1992 when they were age 51 to 61 and
subsequently resurveyed every other year through 2006 (when they were age 65
to 75). We look at asset growth over the two-year intervals between each of the
seven survey waves, from 1992 to 1994, 1994 to 1996 and so forth through 2004
to 2006. From the AHEAD cohort, we follow persons aged 70 to 80 first
surveyed in 1993 and then resurveyed in 1995, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, and
2006. For these persons we consider changes from 1993 to 1995, 1995 to 1998,
1998 to 2000, 2000 to 2002, 2002 to 2004, and 2004 to 2006. In many instances
we follow subsets of the HRS and AHEAD age ranges, for example looking only
at persons age 56 to 61 from the HRS or persons age 70 to 75 from the AHEAD.
The age groups we consider are summarized in Figure 1-1. For each age
interval the figure shows the range of ages for the youngest members of the
group and for the oldest member of the group. For example, the last row of the
figure, labeled "HRS 51-55 in 1992: youngest" shows that the youngest member
of this age interval was 51 years old when first surveyed in 1992 and 65 years
old when last surveyed in 2006.

       Finally we also use data from three panels of the SIPP. From the 1996
panel of the SIPP we obtain data for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 and thus we
calculate asset changes from 1997 to 1998, 1998 to 1999, and 1999 to 2000.
From the 2001 panel of the SIPP we have data for 2001, 2002, and 2003, and
thus changes from 2001 to 2002, 2002 to 2003, and 2003 to 2004. From the
2004 panel of SIPP we have data for 2004 and 2005, and thus the change from
2004 to 2005. We have six year-to-year changes from the SIPP data, from 1997
to 1998, 1998 to 1999, and so forth to 2004 to 2005. The SIPP data differ in one
important way from the HRS data: SIPP collects data for all respondents age 15
and older (but top-codes age at 85). Thus it is possible to choose a sample from
the SIPP that "matches" as closely as possible the age ranges in the two HRS
samples.

       For each of the three data sources we consider assets at the beginning
and end of each interval, although the width of the intervals differ—one year in
the SIPP and, with one exception, two years in the HRS and the AHEAD data.
For each person in each survey we categorize family status at the beginning of
the interval as belonging to either a one-person household or to a two-person
household. Over the interval between surveys a person initially in a one-person
household may remain in a one-person household. We designate the family
status transition for this person as 1→1 indicating that the person is in a one-
person household in both years. If this person remarried (or partnered) during
the two year interval then the person is classified as 1→2. Similarly, we classify
persons initially in two-person households as 2→2 if the person remains in a two-
person household, 2→1(div) if the person divorces or separates by the end of the


                                            8
interval and 2→1(wid) if the spouse dies by the end of the interval. The sample
sizes for persons classified as 1→2 are quite small so this group has been
excluded from many of the figures presented below.

       To illustrate this organization of the data, we show HRS assets by family
status in both 1992 and 1994, and the change in assets between the two years.
Table 1-1 shows these data for persons aged 51 to 61 in 1992 (in year 2000
dollars). Total assets include equity in owner-occupied housing, IRA and Keogh
balances, other financial assets, and the value of vehicles, less debt. The value
of business assets and other real estate are excluded. Balances in 401(k) plans
are excluded from the HRS and the AHEAD data because, as noted above, a
complete 401(k) series cannot be obtained from these sources, but 401(k) assets
are included in the SIPP data. We present medians and trimmed means, as well
as simple means, because the latter are sensitive to outliers.

       The table shows the organization of one of many family status transitions
that can be obtained from the HRS, AHEAD, and SIPP surveys. Between 1992
and 1994 the median wealth of persons in continuing two-person households
increased 10.9 percent and the median wealth of persons in continuing one-
person households increased 7.6 percent. Among persons experiencing a
change in family status, persons becoming widowed experienced a slight
increase in assets, those becoming divorced experienced a large decline, and
persons marrying saw their assets increase dramatically. The means in the
lower panel show a similar pattern. The key results we present in later sections
are based on graphical descriptions of the changes by family status for each of
the intervals and for each of the data sources. As emphasized above, reporting
errors can have an important effect on the changes between the beginning and
the end of an interval. To mitigate the effect of errors on the results shown in this
paper we emphasize comparisons based on trimmed means and on medians, as
explained above.

        Before looking at additional results, we show sample sizes for each
interval by family status transition in Table 1-2. These data draw attention to the
effect of selection on the change in assets within and between intervals. For
example, consider the change in assets of persons in continuing two-person
households (2→2) in the 1992-1994 interval, which is used to obtain the
estimates in the first row of Table 1-1. In subsequent sections we report changes
in assets for these persons in later intervals as well. These persons will only
appear in the 2→2 transition group for the next interval, 1994-1996, if they remain
in a two-person household for the next two years. Those who will lose a spouse
during the next two years will be in the 2→1 group in 1994-1996. Persons who
will lose a spouse in a subsequent interval tend to have lower assets than those
who will continue in two-person households. The numbers in the Table 1-2 only
give a general indication of the extent of selection. For example, consider the
decline in the number of persons in the 2→2 group in the HRS sample between
the1992-1994 and the 1994-1996 intervals (6,365 to 5,732). Part of the decline
in the number of persons occurs because some of the persons in the 2→2 group
in 1992-1994 are in one of the 2→1 groups in 1994-1996. This is the key
selection. Persons in the 2→1 group have lower assets than persons in the 2→2
group. But part of the decline in the number of persons is also due to attrition



                                        10
from the sample. In addition, persons in the 1→2 group in 1992-1994 are in the
2→2 group in 1994-1996 if they remain married for the next two years. Persons
who continue in the 1→1 group also tend to have greater assets than those who
leave the sample because of death.

2. The HRS Cohort

        We next summarize asset changes for the HRS cohort and then for the
AHEAD cohort; we also compare the two and compare results based on these
surveys with results based on the SIPP. We begin by graphing the "raw" means
like those presented in the bottom panel of Table 1-1. As the graphs will show,
the data are confounded by a large number of reporting errors and missing
values. Ultimately, we will need to find a way to “correct” the errors and “fill in”
the missing values. For present purposes, we simply show how two alternative
estimation procedures—trimming outliers and using medians—can affect the
results. To demonstrate the effect of alternative estimation procedures we use
data for persons aged 51 to 55 in 1992 from the HRS cohort.

      Figure 2-1 shows the means based on the raw data. Here and in the
subsequent analysis all values are in constant year 2000 dollars. These
estimates are analogous to those shown in the bottom panel of Table 1-1. There
appear to be many aberrant within and between interval changes in assets.
Closer examination of the data reveals that there are a large number of apparent



                                              11
errors in the raw data. These include cases where balances for major assets
(such as housing or retirement accounts) are apparently misreported (the asset
total reported in one wave is very different from the total reported in adjacent
waves). The effect of outliers is evident in the figure. To address this problem,
we show means based on trimmed data in Figure 2-2. and estimates of medians
in Figure 2-3.

        To obtain the trimmed means we estimate separate GLS regressions for
assets at the beginning and end of each interval. Each GLS regression allows
the residual variance to differ from interval to interval. For each family status
transition group, we estimate a specification of this form:
                     J
            α b + ∑ δ bj I j + ε ibj
       Aibj =
(1)                  j =1
                     J
            α e + ∑ δ ej I j + ε iej
       Aiej =
                    j =1


In these equations A is the asset level (in constant dollars). The first equation
pertains to beginning assets in each interval and the second equation to ending
assets; I j is an indicator variable for the jth interval, i indicates person, b
indicates the beginning of an interval, and e indicates the end of an interval. As
set out, these equations reproduce exactly the results shown in Figure 1-1. The
key feature of the estimates is that the error variance is allowed to vary by
interval. To obtain trimmed means, for each interval and for each family status
group we eliminated the observations with the top one percent and the bottom
one percent of residuals. In cases where there are fewer that 100 observations
in an interval we exclude the observations with the highest and lowest residuals.

        Then we re-estimate the same GLS regressions on the trimmed data and
predict the mean beginning and ending assets that are graphed in Figure 2-2.
For illustration, Appendix Table 2-1 shows the GLS estimates for beginning
assets of 2→2 persons based on the raw data and then based on the trimmed
data. It can be seen that the standard error of the means based on the trimmed
data are for some intervals as little as one-third as large as the standard error
based on the raw data. The comparisons are similar for the other transition
groups.

       Comparing Figures 2-1 and 2-2 suggests that trimming reduces the
estimated mean assets, especially for the 2→2 and 1→1 transitions. For
example, the 2006 mean for the 2→2 group is reduced from over $600,000 using
the raw data to just over $400,000. In addition, the within-interval changes are
much more consistent from one interval to the next. Some apparently aberrant
means for the 2→1(widowed) and 2→1(divorced) groups remain.




                                        12
        We also experimented with trimmed data based on the change in assets
over each interval. In this case, we estimated a GLS regression like the one
above but used the change in assets for each interval (instead of one regression
for beginning assets and a second for ending assets) as the dependent variable.
Then for each interval, the top and bottom one percent of changes were
eliminated. In most instances, we report only the trimmed results based on asset
levels, but in a few instances we have calculated average asset changes over all
intervals based on trimmed change data.

      Figure 2-3 shows medians. The medians are much lower than the means,
as might be expected, and the apparently aberrant mean values are not
reproduced in the medians. For the other age groups and cohorts discussed
below only trimmed mean and median values are shown.

       Focusing on the trimmed mean results in Figure 2-2, several general
features of the data stand out. First the assets of persons in continuing two-
person households (2→2) increase in each interval (all in year 2000 dollars).
Second the assets of continuing 1→1 persons in the 1→1 group also increase in
most intervals; 2000-2002 is the only exception. Third, the assets of 1→1
families are much lower than the assets of 2→2 families in all intervals.

       Fourth, the assets of persons in two-person households that will become
one-person households during the interval (2→1) are typically much lower at the
beginning of an interval than the assets of persons in continuing two-person
households (2→2). And, the assets of 2→1(divorced) persons typically decline
substantially within each interval. The asset of 2→1(widowed) persons--although
also much lower than the assets of 2→2 persons at the beginning of the period—
do not decline in most intervals. The medians in Figure 2-3 show much the
same pattern.

        The average change in assets in each interval is summarized in Table 2-1
for each of the four family status transition groups and for each of the three
estimation procedures. The average increase over the seven intervals is shown
in the second column. Recall that beginning assets in each interval differ
substantially by family status transition group. To quantify the difference, the first
column of this table shows the average (over the seven intervals) of the ratio of
the beginning assets of the 2→1 and 1→1 groups relative to the beginning assets
or the 2→2 group. For example, based on trimmed means the beginning assets
of the 2→1(widowed) transition groups was about 56 percent of the average of
the 2→2 group; the average of the 2→1(divorced) group is about 59 percent of
the 2→2 group. Asset changes (in the second column) show that the assets of
the 2→2 group increase on average by close to 11 percent but the average of the
2→1(divorced) group fell by about 32 percent based on the trimmed means. The
average of the 2→1(widowed) group increased by about 15 percent. The
beginning assets of the 1→1 group were only about 40 percent of the assets of
the 2→2 group. The mean assets of the 1→1 persons increased by about 6.5
percent, a little more than half the rate of increase observed for the 2→2 group.

       The medians show somewhat different magnitudes but broadly similar
patterns for the most part. The medians show that the beginning assets of the
2→1(widowed) persons were about 66 percent of 2→2 persons, the assets of
2→1(divorced) persons about 54 percent of the assets of the 2→2 persons, and
the assets of 1→1 persons only about 30 percent of those of the 2→2 persons.

The median increase in the assets of 2→2 persons was about 5 percents. But
the median increase in the assets of the 1→1 group was only about 0.04 percent.
The median decline in the assets of 2→1(divorced) persons was about 27
percent and the median of the assets of 2→1(widowed) persons was about 1
percent.

             the median change in assets within an interval as a percent of median
             beginning assets, averaged over the seven intervals.


       In this section we have presented estimates separately for each family

status transition groups are confounded with differences in initial asset levels.
This is illustrated in the adjacent diagram which shows beginning and ending
assets for hypothetical 2→2 and 2→1 groups of equal size (in hundreds of
thousands of dollars). The first row shows that assets for the 2→2 group
increase by 50 (from 300 to 350). The next row shows that assets for the 2→1
group decline by 50 (from 100 to 50). If we do not distinguish the two groups and
begin with the average of the assets of the two groups, we overestimate the
asset increase for the 2→2 families and overestimate the asset decrease for the
2→1 families as shown in the bottom two rows of the diagram.

       Figures 2-4 and 2-5 and Table 2-2 pertain to HRS persons aged 56 to 61
in 1992. The key difference between this age cohort and the 51 to 55 cohort is
that the younger cohort would have been in the labor force for many of the
intervals; they were between the ages of 65 to 69 in 2006 and on average retired
in about 2000 or 2002. The older age cohort would have been 70 to 75 in 2006
and on average may have retired in about 1996.

       The general trends for the four transition groups for the 56 to 61 cohort are
much the same as the trends for the 51 to 55 cohort. There are differences in
magnitude, however, and they can best be seen by comparing the averages for
the two age cohorts shown in Table 2-2. Based on the trimmed means, the
average within-interval percent increase in assets is lower for the older 2→2 and
1→1 persons—6.3% versus 10.6% and 4.2% versus 6.5% for the 2→2 and the
1→1 groups respectively. The large reduction in the assets of the 2→1(divorced)
group is evident for both age cohorts. Based on medians, the increases are
close to zero for both the younger and the older age cohorts. Indeed for the
older cohort the change in the median assets of the 1→1 group is zero. The
large decline in the assets of the 2→1(divorced) group is again evident.

      It might be expected that the increase in the assets of the younger group
would be greater since they were in the labor force for more years than the older
group and thus could save out of earning for more years.

3. The AHEAD Cohort

       We now turn to the evolution of the assets of the older AHEAD cohort.
This members of this cohort were aged 70 and over in 1993, when the survey
began. They have been followed for six waves until 2006, when they were at
least 83 years old. Figure 3-1 shows the trimmed mean assets of the
respondents aged 70 to 80 in 1993, based on within-interval data that has been
trimmed as described in the previous section. Results based on medians are
shown in Figure 3-2. Rohwedder, Haider, and Hurd (2006) make a compelling
case that the increase in assets between 1993 and 1995 is likely exaggerated
because of under-reporting in the 1993 survey. For completeness, however, we
show results for this interval as well as the other intervals.

partners die decline by almost 11 percent, and the assets of persons who will
become widowed in an interval are over 20 percent lower at the beginning of the
interval than the assets of the continuing 2→2 transition group. The median
increase in assets of the 2→2 group is less than 2 percent and the median
change in the assets of the 1→1 group is negative (-0.59 percent).

       Recall that households in the HRS cohort were between the ages of 51
and 61 in 1992 and between 75 and 85 in 2006. Persons in this older AHEAD
cohort were 70 to 80 in 1993 and they were 83 to 93 in 2006. Thus there is


                                            21
some age overlap between the two cohorts, for example, the original HRS cohort
contains households aged 70 to 75 in 2006 and the AHEAD cohort contains
households aged 70 to 75 in 1993. For ease of comparison, Figure 3-3 shows, in
the same figure, the evolution of assets for HRS respondents age 56 to 61 in
1992, who were 70 to 75 in 2006, and the AHEAD respondents who were 70 to
75 in 1993, based on the trimmed mean sample. Analogous results based on
medians are presented in Figure 3-4.

        The difference between the two cohorts, the "cohort effects," are evident
in the figures as the "seam" between the HRS and AHEAD cohorts. Persons
who attained ages between 70 and 75 in 2006 had much greater assets (in year
2000 dollars) than persons who had attained ages between 70 to 75 thirteen
years earlier in 1993. The cohort effect is particularly large for the 2→2 transition
group.

       as a percent of median beginning assets, averaged over the intervals.


       The evolution of assets for the two groups is summarized in Table 3-2.
Several features stand out. First, for persons in both 2→2 and 1→1 groups the
average percent increase in mean assets is substantially lower for the 70 to 75
age cohort than for the 56 to 61 age cohort. There is little difference in the
median percent change in the assets of the younger and older 1→1 groups,
however. Both are close to zero—0.0 percent for the HRS cohort and -0.48
percent for the AHEAD cohort. Second, for both age groups and for each of the
estimation procedures persons who will become widows over an interval—the
2→1(widow) group—start the interval with lower assets than those who will
continue in two-person households. Third, for both estimation procedures,
assets of the older 2→1(widow) group decline.

        Finally, to provide a concise summary of the evolution of assets and to
provide an estimate of the statistical significance of our findings for the HRS and
AHEAD cohorts, we show estimates of the average within interval change in
assets over all intervals. To do this we have estimated GLS regressions and
median regressions of the change in assets over all intervals. That is, we
combine the seven intervals to obtain a single estimate of the average change
over all intervals. The estimates based on trimmed means are presented in the
first column of Table 3-3. The method of trimming is the same as that described
above. In this case, we estimate a GLS regression like equation (1), but the
dependent variable is the change in assets for each interval. This procedure is in
contrast to our earlier approach of estimating one regression for beginning assets
and another second for ending assets. The median estimates are presented in
the second column of Table 3-3. Both the trimmed mean and median estimates
of the change in assets for 2→2 persons are positive for all age groups and all
estimates are statistically significantly different from zero. The trimmed mean
assets of the 1→1 group also increase for all age groups but the estimate for the
AHEAD cohort is not statistically different from zero at the 5% level. All of the


                                        25
median estimates for the 1→1 group are close to, and statistically
indistinguishable from, zero. The trimmed mean and median assets for the
2→1(wid) group increase for the HRS cohorts but decline for the AHEAD cohort.
We cannot reject the null hypothesis that all of these differences are equal to
zero at conventional levels of statistical significance. On the other hand, the
trimmed mean and median estimates of assets of the 2→1(div) group decline
substantially for the HRS cohorts. In contrast, for the 1→2 group for the HRS
cohorts, the increase in the trimmed mean and median assets is large and
statistically significantly different from zero.

4. Past and Future Assets

       The results reported above show the change in total assets that is
coincident with a change in family status. We considered, for example, assets at
the beginning and end of a two-year interval, as well as the change in assets
over the two-year interval, for persons who are in continuing two- or one-person
families over the interval, or who transition from a two- to a one-person family
during the interval. We now consider the assets of these same persons prior to
the beginning of the interval and after the end of the interval in which the family
status transition occurs. That is, we want to consider the past and future assets
of persons who experience a transition within a particular interval. What were
asset balances in the years preceding the transition and what were asset
balances in the years subsequent to the transition?

       Table 4-1 shows total asset data for HRS respondents age 56 to 61 in
1992 for all seven intervals, identified by the interval in which the family status
change occurred. This transition interval is denoted the base interval. The
assets of the people who experienced each type of family status transition are
reported for intervals before and after the base interval. For example, the first of
seven panels of the table shows beginning and ending assets in first interval and
the last interval whose family status changed in the first interval, 1992 to 1994.
The fourth panel shows prior and future assets of persons that changed family
status in the fourth interval, 1998-2000. The seventh panel shows the prior
assets of persons whose family status change is reported for the last interval,
2004 to 2006. Each panel shows asset balances for persons in each family
status group in the base period. These persons may be in other family status
groups in periods other than the base period. Thus, for example, the first row of
Table 4-1 pertains to persons who remained in two-person households (2→2) for
the 1992-1994 interval. Some of the persons shown in this row may have

         The asset patterns are difficult to distinguish in the table, but are more
easily seen in figures. Figures 4-1, 4-2, and 4-3 show assets pertaining to the
first, fourth, and seventh panels of the table. In each figure, the year in which the
asset change occurred, the base interval, is highlighted in a box. For ease of
exposition we show only the assets for three groups, 2→2, 2→1(wid), and 1→1,
and emphasize the assets of the 2→1(wid) group compared to the 2→2 group.
The key finding is that two-person household that will experience a 2→1(wid)
transition during the 1992 to 2006 period had lower assets than continuing 2→2
households long before the transition occurred. Thus for the 2→1(wid) group the



                                             27
finding that pre- and post-transition asset levels are low is an important message
that complements that finding of the drop in assets at the time of the transition.

       Consider first Figure 4-3, which shows the assets in each interval of
persons by family status transition group in the last (2004-2006) interval. First
compare the assets of persons in the 2→2 group to the assets of persons in the
2→1(wid) group. In the last interval, in which the change in family status
occurred, the assets of persons in the 2→1(wid) group were much lower than the
assets of persons in the 2→2 group. But the assets of the 2→1(wid) group had
been lower for most of the 14 prior years. In 1992 the assets of these two groups
were similar, but over the next 14 years the assets of the 2→2 group increased
substantially, while the assets of the 2→1(wid) group changed little, on balance.
That is, the assets of persons who would experience a 2→1(wid) transition many
years in the future did not change much in the years prior to the transition, while
the assets of the persons who were to experience a 2→2 transition in the future
increased substantially in prior years. (The relationships for the other base
intervals are similar in this respect, but for the other intervals, the assets of the
2→1(wid) group were much lower than the assets for the 2→2 group.)

        Moving to the Figure 4-1, we can follow the future assets of persons who
changed family status in the first interval (1992-1994). We see that the assets of
the 2→2 group in the first interval continued to increase in all of the later periods.
The initial wealth of this group was $177,439 at the end of the first interval in
1994 and $241,431 at the end of 2006 (in year 2000 dollars), an increase of 36.1
percent over the next 12 years. Persons whose spouse died between 1992 and
1994, the 2→1(wid) group, had assets about half the level of the 2→2 group in
the first interval and the surviving persons in this group had only a small increase
in assets over the next 14 years, about 2.0 percent. The 1→1 group in the first
interval experienced a 34.0 percent increase in assets over the next 12 years.

        Figure 4-2 shows the prior and subsequent assets of persons who
changed family status in 1998-2000. The assets of the 2→2 group were
increasing in each of the prior three intervals and continued to increase in each
of the three subsequent intervals. The 2→1(widowed) group had much lower
assets than the 2→2 group in the prior three intervals and continued to have
much lower assets in the future three intervals. The patterns for the other
intervals are much like the patterns revealed in three intervals discussed.

        Finally, we want to emphasize that the sequence of family status
transitions can be quite complicated. To demonstrate this feature of the data, we
use the prior and future family status transition of persons with base transitions in
1998-2000, those represented in Figure 4-2. For example, the first panel of
Table 4-2 shows the percent distribution of the family status transition groups of
persons who were in the 2→2 group in 1998-2000. The entries in bold in the first




                                          28
row show that most of those in the 2→2 group in the base year were also in the
2→2 group in the prior three intervals and in the subsequent three intervals.

        One might suppose that that those in the 2→1(wid) group in the base year
(in the second panel of the table) would typically be in the 2→2 group in prior
intervals, as they are. One might also expect that they would be in the 1→1
group in subsequent years. But this is not so certain. We see that 10.3 percent
are in the 1→2 group in the next interval, suggesting that they remarried during
the next interval. And by the following interval, 13.7 percent were once again in
the 2→2 group.

       The 2→1(div) group (in the third panel) also follow disparate transitions
before and after the base transition. For example, 21.4 percent were in the 1→2
group in the prior interval, suggesting that they were married in the prior interval.
Another 25 percent were in the 1→2 group in the following interval, suggesting
that they remarried in the interval just after the base interval.

       We have emphasized the errors in asset reporting. It may also be that
there are errors in reports of family status as well, and we will need to pursue this
issue further in future work

Note: the base for these calculations is all persons in the sample in a given interval.


       In summary, we conclude that households that continue as two-person
households (2→2) in any of the seven two-year intervals not only increase total
assets in that interval and also typically experience an increase in assets in all
prior and subsequent intervals. The same pattern typically holds for continuing
one-person (1→1) households as well. We also find that the asset history of two-
person households that experience a change in family status -- 2→1(wid) -- is
very different from the history of continuing two-person families. The 2→1(wid)


                                                  31
group have much lower assets than persons in 2→2 households in the interval
during witch they experienced the transition, but this group also had much lower
assets than persons in continuing two-person households long before they
experienced the change in family status.

5. The SIPP Cohort Estimates

        Recall that the total assets based on HRS and AHEAD data exclude
401(k) assets that have not been rolled over into an IRA. To determine whether
the general trends seem to be the same when 401(k) assets are included, we
now show assets based on SIPP data. For ease of comparison we show figures
analogous to Figures 3-3 and 3-4 above that show trimmed means and medians
for persons age 56 to 61 in 1992 (the HRS cohort) and for persons age 70 to 75
in 1993 (the AHEAD cohort). Because the SIPP surveys persons at all ages in
each wave, these data can be "matched' to the age groups surveyed in the HRS
and AHEAD cohorts. However, the years sampled in SIPP are different from the
years sampled in the HRS and AHEAD. Thus, the intervals we show based on
the SIPP do not exactly match the HRS and AHEAD intervals. In addition, the
SIPP figures are based on one-year intervals in contrast to the two-year intervals
for the HRS and AHEAD. Figure 5-1 shows the SIPP data for trimmed means
and Figure 5-2 shows the SIPP data for medians. Each of the figures shows
data for the same two cohorts graphed in Figures 3-3 and 3-4 above, although
not for the entire time period shown for the HRS and AHEAD cohorts. Persons
who were 56 to 61 in 1992 are observed six times in the SIPP, first at ages 61 to
66 in 1997 and last at ages 68 to 73 in 2004. Persons who were age 70 to 75 in
1993 are first observed in the SIPP at ages 74 to 79 in 1997 and last at ages 79
to 84 in 2002. Data for 2004 cannot be used for the older cohort because the
SIPP top-codes age at 85.

        Because we observe households over a one-year interval in the SIPP, the
sample size is not large enough to distinguish between 2→1(wid) and 2→1(div).
We have combined these two transition groups into a single 2→1 group, primarily
widows for the older group. The trimmed mean estimates for this group are
erratic, although the medians are smoother.

       The SIPP data for persons in the 1→1 and 2→2 groups show a pattern of
asset change that is similar to the pattern based on the HRS and AHEAD
cohorts. For persons age 56 to 61 in 1992 the asset levels for persons in the
1→1 and 2→2 groups are lower in the SIPP survey and the upward trend over
time is more prominent in the HRS data. This is true for both median and
trimmed mean estimates. A similar relationship between the SIPP and AHEAD
data is observed for persons aged 70 to 75 in 1993.

    The differences between estimates based on the SIPP and the HRS-
AHEAD data are summarized more clearly in Tables 5-1 and 5-2. Table 5-1

pertains to the younger cohort, age 56 to 61 in 1992. Recall that the HRS
intervals are two years in length while the SIPP intervals are one year. The HRS
and SIPP estimates are quite different for the 2→1 transition groups, although
these comparisons are confounded because the SIPP does not distinguish
widowhood from divorce. Perhaps the most notable difference between the HRS
and the SIPP results is the substantially larger within-interval increase based on
the SIPP data, for both the 2→2 and the 1→1 groups and for both the trimmed
mean and the median estimates. It is possible that this result is due to the
inclusion of 401(k) assets in the SIPP but not the HRS data. Households are
likely contributing to their 401(k) plans during their working years and thereby
increasing their account balances through both account inflows and potential
appreciation. Recall that the SIPP increases are over one year and the HRS
increases over two year.

means, however, the SIPP estimates show somewhat larger percent increases

slightly negative based on the HRS data.

6. Health and Asset Accumulation: Latent Health Index

       In addition to understanding the relationship between asset evolution and
family status transitions, we want to explore the relationships between health and
asset evolution. Because family status transitions are likely to be correlated with
the health status of the family members, it is possible that our classification of


                                              36
households by transition groups may proxy in part for underlying differences in
health status. In this section and the next, we take some preliminary steps to
develop an explicit measure of health status, and to investigate its relationship to
the asset evolution we have described above. We begin in this section by
explaining the “latent” health measure that we use. Then, in the next section, we
show how differences in latent health are associated with differences in the levels
and rates of change in total assets. Within family status transition groups we find
very large relationships between our latent health measure and the evolution of
assets.

       The HRS collects substantial information on health status and changes in
health status. We use this information to calculate a “latent” health index. We
assume that latent health is revealed by information about health contained in
responses to the health questions over the course of the survey waves. We
suppose that persons with poorer “latent” health will report more poor health
indicators than persons in better health. The index is used to group persons by
latent health status at the beginning of each of the two-year intervals (seven
intervals in the HRS and six intervals in the AHEAD) for which we observe a
change in assets.

        We construct a latent health index as an “evolving” index that uses
information up to the beginning of each interval. For example, suppose we are
considering the change in assets between the third and fourth waves of the HRS
survey (between 1996 and 1998). We group persons by a health index based on
health indicators available in the 1992, 1994, and 1996 waves of the HRS. If we
consider the change in assets between 1992 and 1994 we construct the index
from the 1992 responses. An index for the asset change between 2004 and 2006
can be constructed from the seven survey waves between 1992 and 2004. This
is the procedure we follow.

       The HRS contains a large number of detailed questions that can be used
to construct an index of latent health. The results reported here use a latent
health index based on responses to the following questions:
   1. BMI at beginning of period                 9. Number of periods: health
   2. Sum of real out-of-pocket                      problems limit work
      (OOP) medical costs                        10. Number of periods with back

   20. Number of periods with
       difficulty push/pull

        The evolving latent health index is constructed by obtaining the first
principal component of all of the health indicators. The first principal component
is the weighted average of the health indicators where the weights are chosen to
maximize the proportion of the variance of the individual health indicators that
can be explained by the first principle component. For presentation purposes we
convert the first principal component into percentile scores and group persons by
quintile of this score.
7. The Relationship between Latent Health and Asset Levels and Evolution

      To explore the link between the evolving latent health index, asset levels,
and asset evolution, we begin by showing illustrative results based on the raw
trimmed data. We then discuss “smoothed” results based on an extension of the
trimming procedure to analyze family status transitions in equation (1) above.

        Figure 7-1 shows wave-to-wave changes in mean total assets for
continuous two-person households in the HRS cohort by “latent health” quintile.
The positive association between latent health and the level of assets is striking.
Persons in the lowest (5th) health quintile have median total assets about half as
large as persons in the top (1st) quintile in 1992-1994 and about one-third as
large in 2004-2006. Of course, the existence of a health-wealth relationship is
well-known. We do not try to explain this relationship, but simply describe the
relationship between the evolution of assets as people age and their latent
health.

       Although the relationship between latent health and asset evolution
appears quite systematic in Figure 7-1, to smooth out random fluctuations from
interval to interval we parameterize the relationship between latent health and
asset accumulation within each interval. The idea is not to impose a given
structure on the data, but rather to smooth over randomness from interval to
interval. We want a procedure that will mimic the results shown for the raw data
in Figure 7-1. The parameterization is an extension of the specification shown in
equation (1) above. For each family status transition group we estimate a
specification of the form:

                   α b ∑ (δ bj + βbj hi ) I j + ε ibj
                             J
              Aibj =+
                            j =1
(2)
                   α e + ∑ (δ ej + β ej hi ) I j + ε iej
                            J
              Aiej =
                            j =1


In these equations A is asset level (in constant dollars), h is latent health,
expressed as a percentile score, I j is an indicator variable for the jth interval and
 i, b, and e represent, respectively, person, beginning of the interval, and end of the
interval. The key feature of the parameterization is that the estimated effect of
latent health is linear within each interval, but the relationship is allowed to differ
from interval to interval. One restriction embodied in this specification is that the


                                                                                     39
effect of latent health is linear with the index percentile. The same trimmed data
used in the family status transition analysis above is used here. We refer to
these estimates as the "smoothed" estimates.

        The equations in (2) enable us to predict the beginning and ending asset
levels for any latent health level and for any family status transition group. Using
estimates from this specification, the estimated trimmed mean asset levels for
continuing 2-person families are shown in Figure 7-2--analogous to the trimmed
means without parameterizing latent health that were shown in Figure 7-1. The
prediction for the first quintile (between the 80th and 100th percentiles) is obtained
by setting h (latent health) to 90 percent; the prediction for the second quintile
sets h to 70 percent, etc. As in Figure 7-1, the influence of stock market booms
and busts on the accumulation of total assets is evident. These “smoothed”
estimates capture very closely the trends based on interval-by-interval estimates
but without the random variation from interval to interval in the effect of latent
health. The estimates for persons age 56 to 61 in 1992 in continuing two-
persons households are shown in Appendix Table 7-1.

        The effects of latent health are very large. The ratio of assets of persons
in the top health quintile to the assets of persons in the bottom quintile is 1.7 in
1992. The assets of persons in the top quintile increased much more between
1992 and 2006 than the assets of persons in the fifth quintile. By the end of 2006
the ratio of assets in the top quintile to assets in the bottom quintile was over 2.2.
The estimates for the HRS cohort age 51 to 55, shown in Figure 7-3, look much
the same. In 1992, the ratio of assets in the first quintile to assets in the fifth
quintile was almost 1.8. By 2006 this ratio was 2.7.

        Figure 7-4 shows estimates for persons in continuing two-person AHEAD
households who were age 70 to 75 in 1993. Again, the "fanning out" of profiles
occurs as these persons age, but the spread is not as dramatic as for the
younger cohorts. The ratio of assets in the top quintile to assets in the bottom
quintile increases from 1.5 in 1993 to 1.9 in 2006. Figure 7-5 shows assets for
persons age 56 to 61 in continuing one-person households in 1992 and Figure 7-
6 show assets for persons age 70 to 75 in continuing one-person households in
1993. We have not reported latent health results for two-to-one-person
transitions because the small number of observations and the confounding of
data errors make the estimates very unstable.
       The same sort of specification used in this section could be used to control
for additional covariates such as age and gender. Controlling for age, for
example, would allow us to trace out the within interval evolution of assets for
any given age. But controlling for age would likely have little effect on the results
that we report here for five-year age intervals.

8. Summary and Discussion

        In this paper, we consider the post-retirement drawdown of total assets,
including housing, retirement accounts, and other financial assets. We ask how
total assets evolve after retirement: whether total assets tend to be husbanded
and drawn down primarily at the time of precipitating shocks. We give particular
attention to the relationship between family status transitions and the evolution of
assets, and the relationship between “latent” health status and the evolution of
assets.

        Our analysis is based primarily on HRS and AHEAD data. We organize
the data so that we can observe the change in assets between each of the
waves of the surveys, and we observe the changes by family status transition.
Thus, we can observe the change in assets between waves for persons who
continue in two-person or in one-person households between one wave and the
next. This allows us to determine how asset evolution is related to family status
transition. In particular, we can compare the change in assets for persons who
experience a family status transition between waves with the change for persons
who continue in two-person or in one-person households. In this way, we
emphasize the discontinuous change in assets that accompany shocks to family
status, in particular the transition from two- to one-person households.

        We find several key regularities in the data. First, that the evolution of
assets is strongly related to family status transitions. The total assets of
continuing two-person households increase substantially well into old age. For
persons aged 56 to 61 when initially observed in 1992 and aged 70 to 75 when
last observed in 2006 the average (trimmed) wave-to-wave increase in total
assets is 6.3 percent for continuing two-person households. For the older cohort,
aged 70 to 75 in 1993 and 83 to 88 in 2006, the average(trimmed) rate of growth
is 4.6 percent for continuing two-person households. For persons aged 56 to 61
when initially observed in 1992 and 70 to 75 when last observed in 2006, the
average (trimmed) wave-to-wave increase in total assets is 4.2 percent for
continuing one-person households. For the older cohort, aged 70 to 75 in 1993
and 83 to 88 in 2006, the average (trimmed) rate of growth is 1.4 percent for one-
person households. The median estimates tend to be smaller, but still positive
with the exception of the older continuous one-person households, for whom the
average increase is not significantly different from zero. In contrast, persons in
households that experience a family status transition during an interval, either as
a result of a divorce or the death of a spouse, often experience a large decline or
no increase in total assets. Substantial declines are associated with divorce, and
the declines are statistically different from zero. The total assets of persons
entering widowhood increase on average but the increase is not significantly
different from zero.

       Second, households that experience family status transitions during an
interval—widowhood or divorce—have lower levels of assets than continuing



                                                                                  44
two-person households. The mean beginning assets of persons who will
experience a family status transition are approximately 55 to 65 percent of the
assets of continuing two person households. Further, these differences exist not
just at the time of the transition, but are also evident long before the family
transition and continue long after the transition. This finding underscores the
need to account for differences in initial assets when estimating the change in
assets at the time of a family status transition. Otherwise, the effects of family
status transitions are confounded with prior differences in assets.

        Third, the evolution of assets is very strongly related to a latent health
index that we construct using principal component analysis and a range of self-
reported health status measures in the HRS and AHEAD surveys. For
continuing two-person HRS households aged 56 to 61, the ratio of assets of
households in the top health quintile to the assets of households in the bottom
quintile is 1.7 in 1992. The assets of households in the top quintile increased
more between 1992 and 2006 than the assets of households in the fifth quintile.
By the end of 2006 the ratio of assets in the top quintile to assets in the bottom
quintile was over 2.2. For continuing one-person HRS households aged 56 to 61
the ratio of assets of households in the top health quintile to the assets of
households in the bottom quintile is 2.8 in 1992. The assets of households in the
top quintile increased more between 1992 and 2006 than the assets of
households in the fifth quintile. By the end of 2006 the ratio of assets in the top
quintile to assets in the bottom quintile was 4.1. Similar differences are found for
older AHEAD household.
        Finally, we speculate about possible explanations for our results and how
our results are related to recent research on the “adequacy” of saving.
Households on average seem not to reduce their asset holdings in old age
except at the time of changes in family status. While some might argue that this
suggests that most households could have spent more before and during
retirement, our results do not necessarily suggest over-saving or under-spending
in retirement. If households accumulate assets to self-insure against uncertain
future health shocks, then one might find many households holding stable or
even rising assets over most of their retirement period. Such self-insurance was
the rationale that Venti and Wise (2004) used to explain their results on the
husbanding of home equity. Marshall, McGarry and Skinner (2010) make clear
that out-of-pocket medical expenditures can be very large - so the potential "loss"
that households may be insuring against could warrant holding substantial
assets..

       For similar reasons our findings do not necessarily support the view that
people on average are well prepared for retirement, although they do seem to
suggest better preparation than a number of other studies suggest. Hurd and
Rohwedder (2009b) for example, assess saving adequacy by determining if
assets at retirement are sufficient to maintain observed age-consumption profiles
throughout the retirement years. Our results, however, suggest that for most
types of households, assets are on average greater at age 75 than at 65. This


                                                                                  45
implies that if the Hurd-Rohwedder analysis was carried out at an older age, with
fewer remaining years of consumption to finance and potentially higher asset
levels, the results might be somewhat more encouraging about retirement saving
adequacy.

        We should also note that our results provide an incomplete analysis of
retirement income adequacy because we do not consider alternatives to drawing
down assets as a means of financing consumption in retirement. For example,
we do not account for other income sources such as earnings or annuities from
Social Security or defined benefit pensions. Annuity wealth is important because
it affects how much non-annuity wealth needs to be drawn down in retirement.
Much of our analysis focuses on the change in asset holdings over various
intervals before and after retirement, and it is possible that some households with
very low levels of assets are reporting increases in assets. This could generate a
finding of rising asset holdings, but at a level that does not provide a substantial
buffer for post-retirement financial or health shocks.

       We also emphasize the empirical relationship between latent health and
wealth accumulation. A number of previous studies have made formal efforts to
integrate health shocks into models designed to assess the adequacy of saving--
Hurd and Rohwedder (2009b), Scholz, Seshadri, and Khitatrakun (2006), and
Scholz, Gale, and Seshadri (2009) are leading examples. But from the
presentation of these models it is unclear how important potential future health
shocks are as a source of wealth accumulation. Recent work by De Nardi,
French and Jones (2006) is an exception. In their model households are shown
to respond to uncertain future health costs by increasing saving. Their study
does not, however, ascertain whether observed levels of wealth, though higher
than they would otherwise be, are "adequate" to insure households against the
financial consequences of health shocks. Laibson (2010), in the discussion
comments that follow this paper, presents a more direct attempt to integrate the
empirical patterns presented in this paper with a theoretical model that is capable
of determining whether observed levels of wealth are "optimal." We believe there
is much promise in this approach.

        In future work we will address many of the issues raised in our introduction
but that have not been addressed in this paper. These include an assessment of
the likelihood that households will be able to cover the costs of health and family
status shocks, the merits of different methods of asset drawdown, and the effect
of factors such as the recent asset price decline, rising retirement ages, and the
growth of personal retirement accounts on the ability to meet health and family
status shocks in the future. The analysis reported here can be viewed as a
starting point for these further analyses.

       Finally, as emphasized above, missing data, reporting, errors, and other
data limitations pose serious limitations on the analysis. In this paper, we have
use medians and trimmed means to limit the influence of data errors. As we



                                                                                    46
proceed to further analysis we will give more careful attention to correcting errors
and to cross-section-longitudinal methods to check the data and fill in missing
observations.
