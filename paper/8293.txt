       The central tenet of international economics is that free trade is welfare improving. We

express our conviction about free trade in our textbooks and we sell it to our politicians. ‚ÄúIt

is through the gradually increasing exposure of Canadian producers to competitive world-

market forces that the Canadian economy, as a whole, has become more productive,‚Äù states

Canada‚Äôs implementing legislation for NAFTA (Government of Canada 1994, page 70). Yet

the fact of the matter is that we have one heck of a time communicating this to the larger

public, a public gripped by Free Trade Fatigue.

       Why is the message of professional economists not more persuasive? I think that there

are two reasons. First, in examining trade liberalization we treat short-run transition costs

and long-run eÔ¨Éciency gains as entirely separate areas of inquiry. On the one hand are those

who study the long-run productivity bene√ûts of free trade policies e.g., Levinsohn (1993),

Harrison (1994), Tybout and Westbrook (1995), Krishna and Mitra (1998), and Pavcnik

(2000). On the other hand are those who study the short-run impacts of freer trade on

employment, earnings, and inequality e.g., Gaston and Tre√üer (1994, 1995), Feenstra and

Hanson (1996a, 1997), Revenga (1997), and Hanson and Harrison (1999).1 Only Currie and

Harrison‚Äôs (1997) study of Morocco examines both labour market outcomes and productiv-

ity. We are thus thin on research that integrates long-run bene√ûts and short-run costs of

liberalization into a single framework. Nowhere is this more apparent than for the Canadian

experience with the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and its extension to Mexico.

The FTA triggered on-going and heated debates about freer trade. This heat was generated

   1
     These papers deal with the impact of free trade policies. There are other papers that examine the eÔ¨Äect
of increased trade without asking why trade increased e.g., Freeman and Katz (1991), Abowd and Lemieux
(1991), Revenga (1992), Bernard and Jensen (1995, 1997), Feenstra and Hanson (1996b, 1999), and Borjas,
Freeman, and Katz (1997).
by the con√üict between those who bore the short run adjustment costs (displaced workers

and stakeholders of closed plants) and those who garnered the long run eÔ¨Éciency gains

(consumers and stakeholders of eÔ¨Écient plants).

   There is another reason why the free trade message is not more persuasive. While case-

study evidence abounds about eÔ¨Éciency gains from liberalization (e.g., Krueger 1997), solid

econometric evidence for industrialized countries remains scarce. When I teach my students

about the eÔ¨Äects of free trade on productivity I turn to high-quality studies for Turkey

(Levinsohn 1993), Cote d‚ÄôIvoire (Harrison 1994), Mexico (Tybout and Westbrook 1995),

India (Krishna and Mitra 1998), and Chile (Pavcnik 2000) among others. Even though I

√ûnd these studies to be compelling, I wonder whether they can be expected to persuade

policy makers in industrialized countries such as Canada or the United States.      What is

needed is at least some research focussing on industrialized countries.

   The Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement oÔ¨Äers several advantages for assessing the short-

run costs and long-run bene√ûts of trade liberalization in an industrialized country. First,

the FTA policy experiment is clearly de√ûned. In developing countries, trade liberalization

is typically part of a larger package of market reforms, making it diÔ¨Écult to isolate the

role of trade policy. Further, the market reforms themselves are often initiated in response

to major macroeconomic disturbances. Macroeconomic shocks, market reforms, and trade

liberalization are confounded. Indeed, Helleiner (1994, page 28) uses this fact to argue that

‚ÄúEmpirical research on the relationship between total factor productivity (TFP) growth and

... the trade regime has been inconclusive.‚Äù His view is widely shared e.g., Harrison and

Hanson (1999) and Rodriguez and Rodrik (1999). In contrast, the FTA was not implemented


                                             2
as part of a larger package of reforms or as a response to a macroeconomic crisis. Second,

as Harrison and Revenga (1995, page 1) note, ‚ÄúTrade policy is almost never measured using

the most obvious indicators ‚Äî such as tariÔ¨Äs.‚Äù See also Tybout (2000). This study of the

FTA is particularly careful about constructing pure policy-mandated tariÔ¨Ä measures.

   Third and perhaps most important, this paper examines the impacts of the FTA on a

large number of performance indicators in the manufacturing sector. These include imports,

value added, output, number of plants, plant size, labour productivity, total factor produc-

tivity, employment, skill upgrading, wages, hours of work, earnings, and income inequality.

Since each of these outcomes is examined using a common econometric framework, I am

better able to assess whether all my empirical ducks have lined up in a way that is consistent

with trade theory. In particular, I am better able to assess whether the results on long-run

bene√ûts and short-run costs are consistent.

   The FTA was implemented on January 1, 1989.          I assess its impacts using ‚Äòpre‚Äô and

‚Äòpost‚Äô Canadian data extending from 1980 to 1996. The data suÔ¨Äer two drawbacks. First,

capital stock is poorly measured which complicates productivity analysis. Second, plant-

level data are inaccessible so that I must work with manufacturing data at the industry

level. However, at some points of the paper I am able to exploit sub-industry level data on

plants grouped by plant size. These data form a balanced panel of 1,026 industry-plant size

observations in each year.

   There is a body of econometric research on various aspects of the FTA (Beaulieu 2000,

Claussing 1995, Gaston and Tre√üer 1997, Government of Canada 1997, Head and Ries 1997,

1999a,b, Schwanen 1997, and U.S. Congress 1997). Each of these represents only one piece of


                                              3
a larger puzzle whose picture depicts the many impacts of the FTA. For example, Claussing

(1995) focuses on trade eÔ¨Äects, Gaston and Tre√üer (1997) only explore employment eÔ¨Äects,

and Head and Ries (1999b) only examine plant size eÔ¨Äects. Thus, none of the existing

studies can address the trade-oÔ¨Äs between long-run eÔ¨Éciency gains and short-run adjustment

costs. In addition, this paper oÔ¨Äers a large number of re√ûnements that improve on existing

approaches.

   This paper does not provide the silver bullet that makes the case either for or against

free trade. I oÔ¨Äer clear evidence that the FTA created substantial long-run productivity

bene√ûts. However, the short-run worker-displacement costs were also substantial. There

is thus a question of net bene√ûts left hanging, but whose answer has been considerably

re√ûned by the research to be presented. I hope that the results here take us one step closer

to understanding how freer trade can be implemented in an industrialized economy in a

way that recognizes both the long-run gains and the short-run adjustment costs borne by

workers and others.



1. The FTA TariÔ¨Ä Cuts: Too Small to Matter?

This paper deals with the impact of the FTA tariÔ¨Ä cuts in manufacturing. It is therefore

natural to start by asking whether the FTA tariÔ¨Ä cuts were deep enough to have mattered.

Recall that the FTA was implemented on January 1, 1989. The top panel of √ûgure 1 plots

Canada‚Äôs average tariÔ¨Ä rate against the United States in manufacturing. In 1988 it was 5.6

percent, a level too low to have had much eÔ¨Äect. There are two problems with this claim.

First, tariÔ¨Äs tend to be lowest on less-processed manufactures and highest on processed ones.

For Canada this means that the tariÔ¨Ä rate understates the eÔ¨Äective rate of protection. The

bottom panel of √ûgure 1 plots the eÔ¨Äective rate of protection against the United States in

manufacturing. EÔ¨Äective rates of protection against the United States were twice as high

(11.3 percent in 1988) and have fallen more dramatically than nominal tariÔ¨Ä rates.2

       Second, low average tariÔ¨Äs disguise enormous diÔ¨Äerences in tariÔ¨Äs across industries. Fig-

ure 2 plots a Lorenz curve for industry-level tariÔ¨Äs in 1988 and 1996. To derive this plot in

any year, say 1988, industries were sorted by their tariÔ¨Ä rates. Let œÑ Uit S be the Canadian tar-

iÔ¨Ä against the United States in industry i in year t where i < i + 1 implies œÑ Uit S > œÑ US
                                                                                         i+1,t . Let


nit be the percentage of Canadian 4-digit SIC industries with tariÔ¨Äs in excess of œÑ US
                                                                                    it . There


are 213 industries so that, for example, an nit of 33 percent corresponds to 71 industries.

The √ûgure plots œÑ Uit S against nit . In 1988 almost 30 percent of all Canadian manufacturing

industries were sheltered behind a tariÔ¨Ä in excess of 10 percent. By 1996 this number was

zero.

       It is important to emphasize that √ûgure 2 depends crucially on the level of aggregation.

If one moves from the plotted 4-digit data (213 industries) to 3-digit data (104 industries)

almost no industries had 1988 tariÔ¨Äs in excess of 10 percent. Thus the sample variation

associated with 4-digit disaggregation is a key feature of this study.

       Another point to note is that the FTA called for reductions in U.S. tariÔ¨Äs against Canada.

I do not have U.S. tariÔ¨Ä data at the level of disaggregation of interest. However, the

correlation between U.S. and Canadian bilateral tariÔ¨Äs in 1988 was very high (Magun et

   2
    Both the nominal and eÔ¨Äective tariÔ¨Ä rates were calculated at the 4-digit level as duties paid divided
by imports. They were aggregated up to all of manufacturing using 1980 Canadian production weights.
Appendix 1 provides details of my (standard) formula for the eÔ¨Äective rate of protection.

al. 1988, Gaston and Tre√üer 1997, Head and Ries 1997). That is, Canada and the United

States were protecting the same industries. It is thus not surprising that with 2-digit SIC

data Gaston and Tre√üer (1997) found that once the Canadian tariÔ¨Ä changes against the

United States are incorporated, it makes little diÔ¨Äerence if the U.S. tariÔ¨Äs against Canada

are added in. In addition, tariÔ¨Äs are positively correlated with eÔ¨Äective tariÔ¨Äs and non-tariÔ¨Ä

barriers to trade. In a regression setting this means that the tariÔ¨Ä regressor will be picking

up the eÔ¨Äects of U.S. tariÔ¨Äs, eÔ¨Äective tariÔ¨Äs, and non-tariÔ¨Ä barriers. This is precisely what

I want: When I analyze tariÔ¨Ä reductions I am actually capturing a wider set of liberalizing

FTA policies.



2. The Data

In outlining a comprehensive assessment of the FTA the chief obstacle has been data prepa-

ration. Without high quality data all conclusions must be tentative. The database spans the

years 1980-96 and is at the 4-digit SIC level (213 manufacturing industries). The database

includes the most up to date information available and is unique in combining data from a

large number of disparate sources. All Canadian data are from Statistics Canada without

whose collective expertise nothing would have been possible. The variables may be divided

up into the following groups. (i) Imports, exports, and tariÔ¨Ä duties from special tabula-

tions of the International Trade Division. (ii) Gross output, value added, number of plants,

employment, annual earnings, wages, and hours from special tabulations by the Canadian

Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) Section. (iii) The above ASM data by plant size,

again by special tabulation. (iv) Output and value-added de√üators from the Input-Output


                                              6
Division and the Prices Division. (v) Concordances from U.S. SIC (1987) and Canadian

SIC (1970) to Canadian SIC (1980) from the Standards Division.

       Most of the U.S. data through 1994 are from the NBER Manufacturing Productivity

Database (Bartelsman and Gray 1996). The database was augmented and updated to 1996

using data from special tabulations done by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and

from data available on the BEA and Bureau of Labor Statistics websites.

       I will be working with industry-level data and industry-level data disaggregated by the

employment size of plants. I would have preferred using plant-level data. However, for legal

reasons these data have not yet been made publicly available.3



3. Econometric Strategy


Let i index industries, let t index years, and let Yit be an outcome of interest such as

employment or productivity. The FTA was implemented on January 1, 1989. I have data

for the FTA period 1989-96 and the pre-FTA period 1980-88. For reasons to be explained,

it is useful to de√ûne the FTA and pre-FTA periods without reference to data availability.

For choice of years t0 and t1 with 1980 < t0 < 1989 < t1 , I will de√ûne the FTA period as the

years 1989 to t1 and the pre-FTA period as the years 1980 to t0 . Let ‚àÜyis be the average

annual log change in Yit over period s where s = 1 indexes the FTA period and s = 0

indexes the pre-FTA period. That is,

   3
    Note that Levinsohn (1993), Harrison (1994), Tybout and Westbrook (1995), Krishna and Mitra (1998),
and Pavcnik (2000), who use plant-level data, all work with industry-level trade-policy data (e.g., tariÔ¨Äs)
that are at much higher levels of aggregation.

‚àÜyis approximates the annual compound growth rate of Yit during period s. I am interested

in a regression model explaining the impact of the FTA tariÔ¨Ä cuts on industry outcomes of

interest:



                        ‚àÜyis = Œ≤‚àÜœÑ FisT A + Œ≥‚àÜxis + Œµis ,          s = 0, 1                (2)


where ‚àÜœÑ FisT A is a measure of the FTA mandated tariÔ¨Ä concessions and ‚àÜxis collects all

other determinants of ‚àÜyis . The remainder of this section is devoted to a discussion of the

regression controls appropriate for equation (2).


3.1. The FTA TariÔ¨Ä Concessions


Interest in equation (2) focuses on the tariÔ¨Ä term. It is tempting to measure ‚àÜœÑ FisT A as the

change in Canadian tariÔ¨Äs against the United States during period s. However, as √ûgure 1

above shows, tariÔ¨Äs were coming down against the rest of the world (i.e., against non-U.S.

trading partners) over this period. Thus, Canadian tariÔ¨Äs against the United States have a

strong trend that coincides with larger globalization trends. They thus potentially pick up

much more than just the FTA. Further, even in the absence of the FTA, tariÔ¨Äs would have

come down as a result of the Uruguay Round. One can see this in √ûgure 1 as the sharp drop

in Canadian tariÔ¨Äs against the rest of the world beginning in 1994. Let œÑ Uit S be the Canadian

tariÔ¨Ä against the United States in industry i in year t and let œÑ ROW
                                                                  it  be the Canadian tariÔ¨Ä


                                               8
against the rest of the world. Then œÑ Uit S ‚àí œÑ ROW
                                                it  is the FTA mandated preferential tariÔ¨Ä

concession extended to the United States. Its average annual change during the FTA period

(s = 1) is


                               ¬≥                                        ¬¥
                   ‚àÜœÑ Fi1T A ‚â° (œÑ Ui,tS1 ‚àí œÑ ROW         US         ROW
                                             i,t1 ) ‚àí (œÑ i,1988 ‚àí œÑ i,1988 ) / (t1 ‚àí 1988) .          (3)


Appendix table A1 lists the industries with the largest | ‚àÜœÑ Fi1T A |. In terms of the top panel

of √ûgure 1, ‚àÜœÑ Fi1T A measures how the distance between the two lines changed between 1988

and year t1 .

       For the pre-FTA period, one expects the two lines to coincide because tariÔ¨Ä rates were

primarily extended on a Most Favoured Nation (MFN) basis prior to 1988. One does not

see this for two reasons. First, the 1965 Canada-U.S. Auto Pact was a major exception to

MFN. I therefore let ‚àÜœÑ Fi0T A = ((œÑ Ui,tS0 ‚àí œÑ ROW         US         ROW
                                                i,t0 ) ‚àí (œÑ i,1980 ‚àí œÑ i,1980 ))/ (t0 ‚àí 1980) when i is an


automotive industry.4 Second, while the underlying tariÔ¨Ä rates on about 15, 000 commodities

usually obey MFN, they have been highly aggregated using import and production weights.

Aggregation causes the two lines to diverge. This raises a set of issues addressed in appendix

2. Since I do not want the results to be driven by aggregation bias, I impose ‚àÜœÑ Fi0T A = 0

when i is not an automotive industry.

       As a tariÔ¨Ä measure, ‚àÜœÑ FisT A has two advantages. First, it captures the core textual aspect

of the FTA. Second, its trend component is weak, indeed zero in the pre-FTA period. Thus,

much of the tariÔ¨Ä data variability comes from the FTA period cross section. Implicitly, I

am comparing the performance of industries that were subjected to large tariÔ¨Ä cuts with

the performance of industries that received small or zero tariÔ¨Ä cuts.5


3.2. The Secular Growth Control


I return now to the choice of ‚àÜxis in equation (2).               For political economy reasons, one

expects declining industries to have high tariÔ¨Äs (e.g., Tre√üer 1993) and hence deep FTA

tariÔ¨Ä cuts. One must therefore be careful not to attribute the eÔ¨Äects of secular industry

decline to the FTA tariÔ¨Ä cuts. Columns 1 and 2 of table 1 oÔ¨Äer evidence on this by reporting

the cross-industry correlation of FTA period growth ‚àÜyi1 with tariÔ¨Ä cuts ‚àÜœÑ Fi1T A and pre-

FTA growth ‚àÜyi0 . The correlations are all positive, indicating that sluggish FTA period

growth coincided both with sluggish pre-FTA growth and with large FTA period tariÔ¨Ä cuts.

    To prevent secular growth trends from being imputed to the FTA tariÔ¨Ä cuts, I introduce

a growth √ûxed eÔ¨Äect Œ±i into equation (2):



                                                          0
                         ‚àÜyis = Œ±i + Œ≤‚àÜœÑ FisT A + Œ≥‚àÜxis + Œµis ,           s = 0, 1.                      (4)

           0
where ‚àÜxis is all other controls except Œ±i . As a result, ‚àÜœÑ Fi1T A can only pick up FTA impacts
                                                                                                  0
on growth that are departures from trend growth. I now turn to the choice of ‚àÜxis .

   5
     It would be nice to exploit more of the within-industry changes in tariÔ¨Äs over time. In a previous draft
this was done by looking at speci√ûcations in which all changes where annual i.e., there were 16 observations
per industry, one for each of the years in 1980-96. This means that there were 16 tariÔ¨Ä changes recorded
for each industry. These annual-change results were similar to what will be repeated below. I no longer
report the annual change results because it is impossible to combine the annual change estimator with
adequate controls for business √üuctuations. As will become clear, controlling for business √üuctuations is
more important than squeezing out extra time-series variation in the data.




                                                     10
3.3. The U.S. Control


The 1990‚Äôs was a period of accelerating changes in technology as well as other determinants

of supply and demand. Thus, the secular growth captured by Œ±i is not always a reliable

predictor of current growth. Further, these 1990‚Äôs changes were probably not con√ûned to

Canada - they likely aÔ¨Äected the United States as well. I thus control for underlying supply

                                                   US                                 US
and demand changes by introducing a U.S. control ‚àÜyis into regression equation (4). ‚àÜyis

                                                                                        US
is the U.S. counterpart to ‚àÜyis . For example, if ‚àÜyis is Canadian employment growth, ‚àÜyis

is U.S. employment growth. Column (3) of table 1 reports the correlation of FTA period

                                        US
Canadian growth ‚àÜyi1 with U.S. growth ‚àÜyi1 . The correlations are large and positive

which indicates that FTA period innovations in Canada and the United States shared a

common component.6

                                      US
       It is tempting to argue that ‚àÜyis is endogenous. That is, when Canadian industries do

well it is at the expense of their U.S. counterparts. If true, we should see it in one of two

ways. First, Canadian and U.S. growth should be negatively correlated. Yet I just showed

in column (3) of table 1 that these bivariate correlations are positive. Further, Gaston and

Tre√üer (1997) found positive multivariate correlations. (They looked at employment growth

using 2-digit data for the period 1980-93.) Thus, endogeneity is not evident in bivariate

   6
    The U.S. database is at the 4-digit level of 450 U.S. SIC industries whereas the Canadian data are at the
level of 213 Canadian SIC industries. I have converted the U.S. data into Canadian SIC using a Statistics
Canada electronic concordance called COMIND92 which is related to Statistics Canada‚Äôs catalogue 12-574
publication. Because some U.S. SIC industries do not go uniquely into a single Canadian SIC industry,
I have had to augment the Statistics Canada converter with more detailed U.S. data. Where there is no
uniqueness, U.S. industries were allocated to Canadian industries based on 5-digit U.S. value of shipment
weights. (The √ûrst 4 digits are SIC industries, the last digit is a product code.) The weights used for year t
were year t data on either shipments, value added, or employment depending on the series being converted.
Data on 5-digit shipments are from the BEA website. With these data I was able to build a converter
that ‚Äòsteps down‚Äô from over 1000 U.S. industry/products to 213 Canadian industries. I am indebted to my
research assistant Susan Zhu for taking on this mind-numbing, lengthy task.

or multivariate correlations of ‚àÜyi1 with ‚àÜyi1 . Second, if ‚àÜyis is endogenous because

                                        US
it was eÔ¨Äected by FTA tariÔ¨Ä cuts then ‚àÜyis must be correlated with ‚àÜœÑ Fi1T A . In fact,

the correlation is virtually zero for each of the table 1 variables. The explanation for the

zero correlations is simple: The U.S. market is so large that the eÔ¨Äect of the FTA was

swamped by more fundamental movements in industry demand and supply. It is exactly

                                            US
these movements that I wish to proxy with ‚àÜyis . I therefore amend equation (4) as follows:


                                                       00
                ‚àÜyis = Œ±i + Œ≤‚àÜœÑ FisT A + Œ≥‚àÜyis
                                            US
                                               + Œ¥‚àÜxis + Œµis ,      s = 0, 1.                 (5)


          00                                     US                                      00
where ‚àÜxis is all other controls except Œ±i and ‚àÜyis . I now turn to the choice of Œ¥‚àÜxis .


3.4. The Business Conditions Control


A key issue for examining the FTA is the treatment of the early 1990‚Äôs recession. Figure

3 plots gross domestic product (gdp) for Canadian manufacturing. The data are in logs

relative to a 1980 base i.e., ln(gdpt /gdp1980 ). The FTA period recession stands out. General

business conditions can be introduced into equation (5) by including a regressor ‚àÜzs that

measures movements in gdp, the exchange rate, Canada-U.S. interest rate diÔ¨Äerentials, and

other macro variables. However, one needs to allow industries to vary in their sensitivity to

general business conditions. That is, equation (5) needs a term ‚àÜzs whose coeÔ¨Écient Œ¥ i is

industry subscripted. Otherwise, if tariÔ¨Ä cuts are deepest for the most cyclically sensitive

industries (e.g., low-end manufacturing), then the estimate of the tariÔ¨Ä eÔ¨Äect will be biased

                 ‚àÜyis = Œ±i + Œ≤‚àÜœÑ FisT A + Œ≥‚àÜyis
                                             US
                                                + Œ¥ i ‚àÜzs + Œµis ,     s = 0, 1              (6)


                              00
where I have replaced Œ¥‚àÜxis with Œ¥ i ‚àÜzs . Œ±i , ‚àÜœÑ FisT A , ‚àÜyis
                                                              US
                                                                 , and Œ¥ i ‚àÜzs are my regression

controls.

   Estimating both the Œ¥ i and the Œ±i is a diÔ¨Écult problem, not least because it involves

estimating these 2 √ó 213 parameters with only 2 √ó 213 observations. Fortunately, there is a

simpler approach based on matching the FTA and pre-FTA business cycles. From √ûgure 3,

there are a number of similarities between the 1980-88 and 1988-98 periods. Each begins a

year before the peak, enters a deep recession in the third year, and ends with a prolonged

expansion. This is not to minimize diÔ¨Äerences in the depth of the recessions or the pace of

their recoveries, but to point out useful similarities. By experimenting with the choice of

pre-FTA and FTA periods (i.e., t0 and t1 in equation 1), it is possible to place industries

at about the same point on the business cycle in each of the two periods. In this way, the

pre-FTA period data on business cycle sensitivity can be used to control for FTA period

business cycle sensitivity.

   My preferred choice of periods uses t0 = 1986 and t1 = 1996 so that FTA changes cover

1988-96 and pre-FTA changes cover 1980-86. Relative to 1980-86, the 1988-96 period is one

year ahead as judged by the number of years into the expansion and less than one year

behind as judged by gdp growth. Clearly, there is some question about how best to choose

the periods. Fortunately, the empirical results are not particularly sensitive to this choice,



                                              13
a fact that will be shown at length below. I therefore postpone further discussion of timing.

       By the way, it is no coincidence that there were suÔ¨Écient data for lining up the pre-FTA

and FTA business √üuctuations. In a previous draft I only had data back to 1984 because

that was the year that Statistics Canada changed its industrial classi√ûcation from SIC(1970)

to SIC(1980). Obtaining data back to 1980 in order to match business √üuctuations involved

custom runs by Statistics Canada as well as the construction of a concordance between

Canadian SIC (1970) and Canadian SIC (1980) which, remarkably, existed previously only

in limited form.7


3.5. Estimation


Moving to the formal estimation framework, I will diÔ¨Äerence equation (6) across the two

periods and use the fact that industries are at the same point on the business cycle in each

period (Œ¥ i ‚àÜz1 = Œ¥i ‚àÜz0 ). Then



                  (‚àÜyi1 ‚àí ‚àÜyi0 ) = Œ≤(‚àÜœÑ Fi1T A ‚àí ‚àÜœÑ Fi0T A ) + Œ≥(‚àÜyi1
                                                                   US     US
                                                                      ‚àí ‚àÜyi0 ) + œÖi.                    (7)


Such diÔ¨Äerencing eliminates 2 √ó 213 parameters from equation (6). Not only do the Œ¥ i fall

out, but so do the Œ±i along lines related to the Heckman and Hotz (1989) random growth

estimator. Equation (7), with an intercept, is my primary regression speci√ûcation:



                (‚àÜyi1 ‚àí ‚àÜyi0 ) = Œ∏ + Œ≤(‚àÜœÑ Fi1T A ‚àí ‚àÜœÑ Fi0T A ) + Œ≥(‚àÜyi1
                                                                     US     US
                                                                        ‚àí ‚àÜyi0 ) + œÖi.                  (8)

    I am indebted to Paul Beaudry, Janet Currie, Paul Romer, Alwyn Young and other CIAR workshop
participants for insisting that I control for business cycles. I am also indebted to Richard Barnab√©, Direc-
tor General of the Standards Division at Statistics Canada, for helping me to construct an SIC(1970) to
SIC(1980) converter.


                                                    14
The intercept is derived by adding a period dummy Œ∏s to equation (6) and de√ûning Œ∏ ‚â°

Œ∏1 ‚àí Œ∏0 .

       I will also consider a simpler regression that eliminates the equation (6) secular growth

and business condition controls (Œ±i and Œ¥i ‚àÜzs ):



                         ‚àÜyis = Œ∏ + Œ≤‚àÜœÑ FisT A + Œ≥‚àÜyis
                                                    US
                                                       + Œµis ,            s = 0, 1.                       (9)


This speci√ûcation helps pinpoint the impact of these controls on the estimate of Œ≤. I em-

phasize that equation (9) is used only for regression diagnostic purposes.


3.6. Endogeneity of TariÔ¨Äs


TariÔ¨Ä cuts are not exogenous. They depend on industry characteristics e.g., Brock and

Magee (1978) and Tre√üer (1993). In the change-in-changes equation (8) setting, it is not clear

why endogeneity should be an issue.8 However, one can always work up some story about

endogeneity. As such, I also consider instrumental variables (IV) estimates. The instrument

set consists of 1988 values for hourly wages (capturing protection for low-wage industries

as in Corden‚Äôs 1974 conservative social welfare function), the proportion of non-production

workers (capturing protection for unskilled industries), the level of output (capturing pro-

tection for large industries as in Finger, Hall, and Nelson‚Äôs 1982 high track protection for

large industries), imports, and exports. I also include all the cross‚Äîproducts. Since all these

                                                                                                            TA

is largely determined by the tariÔ¨Ä level in 1988. This in turn depends on industry characteristics in 1988.
There are two types of such characteristics, those expressed as levels in 1988 such as average wages and those
expressed as changes leading up to 1988 such as output growth. It is not clear why such levels or changes
should be correlated with changes in changes i.e., with the dependent variable ‚àÜyi1 ‚àí ‚àÜyi0 in equation (8).

variables are in 1988 levels, the assumption that they are uncorrelated with the double-

diÔ¨Äerenced error term is comfortable. Finally, I include ‚àÜyi1 ‚àí ‚àÜyi0 since this already

appears as an exogenous variable. I do not include any Canadian growth characteristics

such as ‚àÜyi0 or ‚àÜyi1 ‚àí ‚àÜyi0 since these are arguably endogenous.

   I have mixed feelings about the IV estimates. On the one hand, a number of factors

argue for emphasizing them. (i) The IV results invariably imply larger FTA impacts than do

the ordinary least squares (OLS) results. They thus strengthen my conclusions. (ii) The IV

estimates are robust in that they are insensitive to the choice of instruments i.e., to diÔ¨Äerent

                                                                       US     US
variables, to the omission of cross-products, and to the omission of ‚àÜyi1 ‚àí ‚àÜyi0 . (iii) The

√ûrst-stage R2 s are always close to 0.4 which is arguably not ‚Äòtoo‚Äô high. On the other hand,

there are factors that argue against emphasizing the IV results. First, IV methods require

strong assumptions about instrument validity. Second and more important, the Hausman

test (Wu‚Äôs T2 test) rejects endogeneity for 17 of the 22 variables to be considered. For these

reasons, I will present the IV results, but not have much to say about them.



4. Empirical Results: Employment

Unlike most assessments of the impact of trade liberalization, this paper examines impacts

on a large number of performance indicators. I begin with employment. The results appear

in table 2. Since tables of this form will appear repeatedly, I carefully review it. Consider

the top block of rows which deal with the employment of all workers. The ‚ÄòRegression

Speci√ûcation‚Äô columns state whether equation (8) or equation (9) is being estimated and

how the pre-FTA and FTA period changes are de√ûned. For example, the √ûrst line presents


                                              16
estimates of equation (8) with the pre-FTA period changes de√ûned over 1980-86 and the

FTA period changes de√ûned over 1988-96. This is my preferred speci√ûcation.

   Returning to the √ûrst line, the coeÔ¨Écient on the FTA tariÔ¨Ä concessions is Œ≤b = 1.51 which

indicates that the FTA reduced employment. The coeÔ¨Écient on the U.S. control is Œ≥b = 0.20.
                                                                         2
The intercept is not reported. There are 213 observations and the R is a modest 0.071.

In the second line, the pre-FTA period changes are re-de√ûned to cover 1980-88 and in the

third line the FTA period changes are re-de√ûned to cover 1988-94.         As is apparent, our

results are only modestly sensitive to the choice of periods and hence to the implicit choice

of business-cycle control.

   The last line gives estimates of the regression diagnostic equation (9). In this line there

are 426 (=2√ó213) observations because I have stacked the 2 periods. When the secu-

lar growth and business conditions controls are omitted, the FTA eÔ¨Äect is much larger

(Œ≤b = 2.29). This shows that in the absence of proper controls, it is easy to overstate the em-

ployment eÔ¨Äects of the FTA. It thus vindicates the lengthy theoretical discussion of controls

in section 3.

   The fourth row gives the IV estimate Œ≤b = 2.70. As will generally be the case in this

paper, it is larger in magnitude than the OLS estimate. The column ‚ÄúWu‚Äôs T2‚Äù gives the

p-value for the Wu-Hausman exogeneity test. The value of 0.106 indicates that endogeneity

is just rejected at the 10 percent level. Given the low power of the test, I will use Wu‚Äôs

T 2 < 0.01 as a criterion for rejecting exogeneity.

   The data distinguish between workers employed in manufacturing activities and non-

manufacturing activities. I will refer to these as production and non-production workers


                                              17
since the distinction broadly follows that used in the U.S. Annual Survey of Manufactures

(ASM). In 1988, production workers earned 30 percent less than non-production workers.

An internal Statistics Canada memo also veri√ûes that non-production workers are more

educated than production workers. Table 2 reports results separately for production and

non-production workers. The results for production workers are very similar to those of all

workers. Thus, the results for total employment are driven by production workers. The

FTA appears to have had almost no impact on non-production workers (Œ≤b = 0.48 and

t = 0.55). However, exogeneity is rejected and the IV estimate indicates that the FTA

raised non-production worker employment.

   A common measure of average industry skill is the ratio of non-production workers to

production workers. Hence the change in this ratio is often referred to as ‚Äòskill upgrading.‚Äô

The OLS results indicate that the FTA did not signi√ûcantly contribute to skill upgrading

(Œ≤b = ‚àí1.35 and t = ‚àí1.35). However, the IV results paint a picture of statistically signi√ûcant

FTA induced skill upgrading. This is consistent with a Feenstra and Hanson (1996a) story

involving Canadian outsourcing to low-wage, less-unionized Southern U.S. states. This was

an issue raised during the FTA negotiations.



5. Economic Impacts

For industry i, Œ≤‚àÜœÑ FTA
                        is the log-point change in an outcome of interest such as employment
                    i1


that is explained by the FTA mandated tariÔ¨Ä cuts. To calculate the log-point change for all

                                                              b
of manufacturing one must compute the weighted average of the Œ≤‚àÜœÑ FTA
                                                                      where the weights
                                                                  i1


depend on industry size. See appendix 5 for details. The change in employment for all of


                                              18
manufacturing appears in table 2. Consider the last line in the block of rows dealing with the

employment of all workers: ‚ÄòObserved Change = (-16%, -25%), Due to FTA = (-5%, -15%).‚Äô

Observed Change is the log point change in employment during 1988-96. In what follows I

will interpret these log point changes as percentage changes. The √ûrst number in parentheses

(-16 percent) is the manufacturing-wide percentage change in employment. Employment fell

by 16 percent. Due to FTA is the log point change in employment estimated to have been

caused by the FTA mandated tariÔ¨Ä cuts. With Œ≤b = 1.51, I estimate that the FTA tariÔ¨Ä

cuts reduced employment by 5 percent. Re-stated, about one-third (= 5/16) of the 1988-96

manufacturing employment losses are due to the FTA.

   Of course, some industries experienced particularly large tariÔ¨Ä cuts. I ranked the 213

manufacturing industries in my sample by the size of the FTA mandated tariÔ¨Ä cuts (i.e.,

by the ‚àÜœÑ Fi1T A ) and examined the one-third of industries that experienced the deepest tariÔ¨Ä

cuts. This group has 71 (= 213/3) industries. For these industries the production-weighted

average tariÔ¨Ä cut was 10 percent, the smallest tariÔ¨Ä cut was 5 percent and the largest

tariÔ¨Ä cut was 33 percent. I will refer to these industries as the most impacted industries.

The industries are listed in table A1.   As is apparent from table A1, these are ‚Äòlow-end‚Äô

manufacturing industries. Log point changes for these industries appear as the second

number in the parentheses following Observed Change and Due to FTA. For these industries,

employment fell by 25 percent and I estimate that the FTA reduced employment by 15

percent.   Re-stated, about two-thirds (= 15/25) of the employment losses in the most

impacted industries were due to the FTA. These numbers point to the very large transition

costs of moving out of low-end, heavily protected industries. They are the most obvious of


                                             19
the short-run costs associated with trade liberalization.



6. Earnings

Most commentators expected Canadian wages to suÔ¨Äer from competition from less-unionized,

less educated workers in the Southern United States. I assess this using annual earnings data

from ASM payroll statistics. See table 3. For all workers, the Observed Change row pro-

vides some evidence of downward earnings pressure. Earnings growth in the most impacted

industries was a scant 2 percent over 8 years compared to 5 percent for all industries. This

makes it particularly surprising that when inferences are based on a model with adequate

controls (i.e., equation 8), the FTA tariÔ¨Ä concessions appear to have raised earnings. From

table 3, the tariÔ¨Ä coeÔ¨Écient estimate is Œ≤b = ‚àí0.50 with a t-statistic of ‚àí2.61. For the most

impacted industries this translates into a modest, but positive 5 percent rise in earnings

over 8 years.

   Inspection of table 3 reveals that the FTA earnings gains were completely driven by

earnings for production workers rather than non-production workers. This implies that

the FTA led to declining inequality as measured by the ratio of non-production worker

earnings to production worker earnings. This is con√ûrmed by the table 3 results for ‚ÄòEarnings

Inequality.‚Äô However, the reduction in inequality is not statistically signi√ûcant.

   Finally, table 4 shows that all of the earnings eÔ¨Äect for production workers is due to FTA

eÔ¨Äects on wages, not hours.




                                              20
7. Imports

Table 5 presents results for the impact of the FTA tariÔ¨Ä concessions on imports. The import

regressions do no include U.S. controls because this would make no sense. More sensible

controls can be introduced by scaling. In particular, I consider Canadian imports from the

United States as a share of Canadian output. I also consider Canadian imports from the

United States as a share of total Canadian imports. This captures import substitution.

   From table 5, the FTA tariÔ¨Ä cuts are a statistically signi√ûcant determinant of these

import shares.    From the Observed Change row, the FTA tariÔ¨Ä cuts explain most of the

huge change in import shares experienced by the most impacted industries. For example,

the ratio of imports to output rose by 72 percent for the most impacted industries, a number

which is very similar to the 67 percent due to the FTA. Needless to say, the FTA cannot

explain the import surge among industries such as autos that were not eÔ¨Äected by the FTA.

That is, the Due to FTA numbers for aggregate manufacturing are small.

   For intra-industry trade, the results suggest that if anything, the FTA reduced such trade.

This is indicative of modest comparative advantage specialization. It is consistent with the

fuller discussion of specialization in Head and Ries (1999a). Note that my conclusion is not

statistically signi√ûcant.



8. Output, Value Added and Number of Plants

Table 6 reports results for real output. Output is the value of shipments adjusted for

changes in inventories, goods in process, and goods for resale. Data are from a special



                                             21
Statistics Canada run. I will discuss de√üation issues in the next section. For now I note that

there is little sensitivity to choice of de√üators. With an eye to later results on productivity,

I also prefer to work with output generated by production activities since it excludes non-

production activities such as in-house marketing, book-keeping and other service activities

for which productivity concepts are less clear. This said, results for production activities

and all activities are invariably similar. From the Observed Change row of table 6, output

rose by 9 percent during 1988-96 for all of manufacturing while it fell by 10 percent for the

most impacted industries. This is potentially strong evidence about the harm caused by the

FTA. However once controls for secular trends, business conditions, and U.S. movements

are added, this relationship is weakened (Œ≤ = 1.08 and t = 1.76). The FTA reduced output

by a statistically insigni√ûcant 11 percent for the most impacted industries.

   Table 6 also reports results for real value added in production activities. Again, de√üation

is discussed below. The most impacted industries experienced a 5 percent reduction in value

added compared to a 6 percent expansion in value added for all of manufacturing. However,

this relationship is neither statistically signi√ûcant (t = 0.37) nor economically large in the

multivariate regression setting of equation (8).

   Over the 1988-96 period, the number of plants declined by 12 percent for all of manufac-

turing and by a staggering 23 percent for the most impacted industries. (See the Observed

Change row.) Once controls are added, the FTA eÔ¨Äect becomes statistically small (t = 1.74),

but remains economically large. For the most impacted industries, the FTA reduced the

number of plants by 8 percent. Thus, there remains evidence that the FTA led to plant

rationalization by accelerating exit.


                                              22
      To conclude, although the most impacted industries experienced large declines in output,

value added, and number of plants, FTA culpability appears to be only partial.



9. Labour Productivity

Ideally, one wants to examine productivity using a total factor productivity (TFP) measure.

Unfortunately, the Canadian ASM does not record capital stock or investment information.

There is thus little alternative but to work with labour productivity. The most common

measure of labour productivity is real value added per worker. This is the third measure

reported in table 7. There are several defects with this measure, two of which are easily

addressed.

      The √ûrst deals with the measurement of labour input. In Canada, but not in the United

States, there has been a strong trend towards part-time employment. By not correcting

for Canadian hours, measure 3 has a downward trend. Since this trend will be spuriously

correlated with the downward trend in tariÔ¨Äs, the estimated eÔ¨Äect of the FTA on produc-

tivity (Œ≤b ) will be downward biased.          The Canadian data allow for an hours correction.

Unlike the U.S. data, value added is reported for production activities alone and thus can

be directly compared with the data reported for hours worked. Measure 1 of table 7 reports

Œ≤b using Canadian real value added in production activities per hour worked and U.S. real

value added in all activities per employee. As expected, Œ≤b is larger for measure 3 than for

measure 1 (though both are large). Clearly, measure 1 is preferred.

      The second data issue deals with de√üators.9 In table 7, measures 1 and 3 use output

  9
      I am indebted to Alwyn Young for encouraging me to examine this issue carefully.


                                                    23
de√üators while measure 2 uses value-added de√üators. Value-added de√üators would have been

preferable had the U.S. de√üator not been seriously √üawed for present purposes. It is at the

2-digit level (20 industries) and even at this highly aggregated level there are imputations

for instruments (SIC 38) and electric and electronic equipment (SIC 36). Measure 2 of table

7, the value-added de√üated measure, thus has serious problems. This said, the Œ≤b based on

value-added de√üators are very similar to the Œ≤b based on output de√üators. This can be seen

by comparing measures 1 and 2 in table 7.10

       I now turn to a detailed review of the labour productivity results. Independent of

the measure of labour productivity, FTA tariÔ¨Ä concessions raised labour productivity both

statistically and economically. For my preferred speci√ûcation (the √ûrst line of table 7),

the estimate of the FTA tariÔ¨Ä eÔ¨Äect is Œ≤b = ‚àí1.56 with a t-statistic of ‚àí3.17. From the

Due to FTA row, this implies that the FTA raised labour productivity by 4.7 percent for

manufacturing as a whole and by 16.6 percent for the most impacted industries.

       More generally, consider all the equation (8) OLS speci√ûcations in table 7 that I have

reviewed so far i.e., the √ûrst 3 lines for each measure. The Œ≤b range from -0.88 to -1.59 which

implies FTA induced productivity eÔ¨Äects of 2.6 to 4.8 percent for manufacturing as a whole

and 9.3 to 16.9 percent for the most impacted industries. Thus, no matter which estimate

is used, large productivity gains obtain.

       These numbers leave a greater impression when put on a compound annual basis. For

all of manufacturing, the FTA tariÔ¨Ä concessions raised labour productivity by between 0.3

and 0.6 percent per year. For the most impacted industries, the tariÔ¨Ä concessions raised

  10
    There are other problems with the de√üators used in this study, but as an empirical matter these turn
out to be minor. I thus relegate them to appendix 4.


                                                  24
labour productivity by between 1.2 and 2.1 percent per year. Further, my preferred measure

1 puts the gains at the upper end of these intervals. These are enormous numbers. The idea

that an international trade policy could raise productivity so dramatically is to my mind

remarkable.


9.1. Some Additional Sensitivity


To further investigate robustness, I considered several additional speci√ûcations for the mea-

sure 1 of labour productivity. These appear as the new block of 4 lines under measure 1.

(Similar conclusions emerge for the other measures.) In the √ûrst of these lines (Œ≤b = ‚àí1.52),

            US
I exclude ‚àÜyi1 as a regressor on the grounds that U.S. productivity growth in the high-tech

sector might be an inappropriate control for Canada. In the next line (Œ≤b = ‚àí1.56), the 9

industries (observations) that comprise the automotive sector are deleted on the grounds

that this sector is distorted by the 1965 Auto Pact. In the next line (Œ≤b = ‚àí1.38), I deleted

the 2 industries (observations) which, from table A1, might be viewed as having unusually

large FTA mandated tariÔ¨Ä cuts. In the last line (Œ≤b = ‚àí1.95), only those industries that

were among the 71 most impacted industries are included. (Here the sample size is down

to 71.) The similarity between the Œ≤b for the most impacted industries and for all of man-

ufacturing means that the estimates reported in table 7 adequately represent the former.

Looking across the 4 speci√ûcations that I have reviewed in this subsection, it is clear that

the conclusions about large FTA induced increases in labour productivity are robust.




                                             25
10. What Underlies Rising Labour Productivity?

Rising labour productivity could be driven by any number of factors. For example, capital

deepening and within-industry shifts to high productivity √ûrms are obvious explanations.

In this section I take a systematic look at these and other explanations. I begin with a few

familiar equations. Let Q = A ¬∑ F (L, K, M ) be the production function for a representative

√ûrm where Q is output, L is labour, K is capital, M is materials plus fuel, and A is a measure

of technical eÔ¨Éciency. Let Œ±i (i = l, k, m) be factor shares. For example, Œ±m = Pm M/(P Q)

where P is the product price and Pm is the price of materials plus fuel. I allow for imperfect

competition with zero pro√ûts. Let ¬µ be the elasticity of scale or, equivalently, the mark-up

of price over marginal cost. I will use lower case letters to denote log changes. For example,

a ‚â° dA/A. Following Hall (1988), totally diÔ¨Äerentiate the log of the production function to

obtain



                               a = q ‚àí ¬µ(Œ±l l + Œ±k k + Œ±m m).                            (10)


a is a common measure of productivity growth.

   Now consider labour productivity growth. Value added is de√ûned as V ‚â° P Q ‚àí Pm M .

Totally diÔ¨Äerentiating ln V ‚àí ln L, equating marginal revenue ‚àÇP Q/‚àÇQ with marginal cost

M C, and using M C = P (P/M C)‚àí1 = P ¬µ‚àí1 , one obtains an expression for labour produc-

tivity growth v ‚àí l:



                                      q ‚àí ¬µŒ±m m ‚àí ¬µ(1 ‚àí Œ±m )l
                             v‚àíl =                            .                          (11)
                                            ¬µ(1 ‚àí Œ±m )


                                             26
   Consider the relationship between productivity growth a and labour productivity growth

v ‚àí l. In equation (10), substitute out Œ±l using the zero-pro√ût condition Œ±l + Œ±k + Œ±m = 1

and substitute out q ‚àí ¬µŒ±m m using equation (11) to obtain



                            a = ¬µ {(1 ‚àí Œ±m )(v ‚àí l) ‚àí Œ±k (k ‚àí l)} .                     (12)


This equation provides a reference point for thinking about why labour productivity growth

v‚àíl diÔ¨Äers from productivity growth a. Interest focuses on the impact of trade liberalization

dœÑ on productivity i.e., on da/dœÑ . From equation (12), da/dœÑ depends on how ¬µ, Œ±m , (v ‚àíl),

Œ±k , and (k ‚àí l) vary with dœÑ .

   What follows is full of details so let me summarize it in advance. First, I will argue

empirically that d(k ‚àíl)/dœÑ and d¬µ/dœÑ are close enough to zero to be treated as second-order

eÔ¨Äects. I will then compute da/dœÑ using data on the remaining terms. Empirically, the only

large term in the expression for da/dœÑ will be ¬µ(1 ‚àí Œ±m )d(v ‚àí l)/dœÑ . Since ¬µ(1 ‚àí Œ±m ) ‚âà 1/2

and d(v ‚àí l)/dœÑ is my estimate of the eÔ¨Äect of the FTA on labour productivity, the eÔ¨Äect of

the FTA on productivity is approximately half as large as its eÔ¨Äect on labour productivity.

Finally, I will use data grouped by industry and plant size to argue that these productivity

eÔ¨Äects are not due to shifts in market shares from low- to high-productivity plants. Rather,

they are due to plant turnover (entry and exit) together with rising technical eÔ¨Éciency.


10.1. Capital (d(k ‚àí l)/dœÑ )


4-digit capital stock does not exist for Canada. What is available is a wealth survey at

the 3-digit level for 1984-95. There are a number of problems with these data. First, at


                                              27
the 3-digit level of 104 industries, much of the tariÔ¨Ä variability disappears. Second, wealth

surveys are based on ownership rather than use so that most of the capital stock is assigned

to the √ûnancial sector. (See Statistics Canada 1996). Third, the U.S. capital stock data

from the NBER productivity database are constructed very diÔ¨Äerently from the Canadian

data. With these caveats in mind, I proceed to estimation.

                                                         US
       I estimate the usual equation (8) with ‚àÜyis and ‚àÜyis de√ûned as changes in the log of the

Canadian and U.S. capital-labour ratios, respectively. The pre-FTA period changes cover

either 1984-86 or 1984-88 and the FTA period changes cover 1988-95.11 Table 8 reports the

results. As is apparent, the FTA had no eÔ¨Äect on the capital-labour ratio. To re√ûne matters,

I also de√ûned the Canadian capital-labour ratio on something closer to a production activity

basis: machinery and equipment divided by hours worked by production workers. Again,

there is no eÔ¨Äect of the FTA tariÔ¨Ä cuts on the capital to labour ratio. Note that I am

precisely estimating zero eÔ¨Äects.12

       None of this will surprise those involved in Canadian public policy where it is well known

that over the 1988-96 period, real √ûxed investment grew by 74 percent in the U.S. compared

to only 15 percent in Canada. It is thus unlikely that the FTA labour productivity eÔ¨Äect is

driven by capital deepening.

  11
     For this paper I updated the NBER productivity database from 1994 to 1996. However, I could not
update the capital stock data. Thus, for 1995 the U.S. capital stock data were extrapolated based on
1993-94 growth rates. This appears not to be important as judged by the fact that almost identical results
obtain when the FTA period changes cover 1988-94, thus excluding 1995.

10.2. Scale (d¬µ/dœÑ )


From equation (12), the diÔ¨Äerence between productivity a and labour productivity v ‚àí l

depends on the scale of operations or mark-up ¬µ. Work by Levinsohn (1993), Harrison

(1994), Krishna and Mitra (1998), and Pavcnik (2000) indicates that trade liberalization

has reduced mark-ups in developing countries.      For the purpose of this section, which is

to investigate whether the FTA labour productivity results are driven by changes in ¬µ, the

changes in ¬µ documented by these authors are small. For example, one would need ¬µ to

fall from 2.0 to 1.0 in order to argue that the FTA had no impact on productivity a. A

more realistic fall in ¬µ, say from 1.1 to 1.0, would make little diÔ¨Äerence to my conclusions.

This point is explored in detail below.

   Unfortunately, in the absence of good capital stock data, I cannot directly estimate either

¬µ or d¬µ/dœÑ . Nevertheless, there are some interesting insights to be garnered by examining

the eÔ¨Äects of the FTA on proxies for ¬µ. Very poor and dated proxies that hark back to

the pre-1980‚Äôs industrial organization literature are output per plant and value added per

plant. I estimate the usual equation (8) using these scale proxies. Note that I am back to

using 4-digit SIC data and that I do not have U.S. data for these scale proxies because U.S.

number-of-plants data are published only at 5-year intervals. The results appear in table 8.

As is apparent, the FTA impact on these proxies is statistically insigni√ûcant and sensitive

to the choice of proxy.

   I was initially surprised by the absence of FTA eÔ¨Äects on output per plant. It contrasts

sharply with the computable general equilibrium literature. In many of those models it is

precisely scale eÔ¨Äects that lead to much of the gains from trade. It is thus reassuring that


                                             29
I arrive at the same conclusions as Head and Ries (1999b). It is all the more reassuring in

that I use a very diÔ¨Äerent set of modelling assumptions. Tybout and Westbrook (1995) and

Tybout (2000) echo this theme of limited scale eÔ¨Äects.

      Mark-ups ¬µ are the ratio of price to marginal cost.          It is thus relevant to examine

prices. Returning to 3-digit data, the bottom of table 8 reports results for the impact of

the FTA on shipments de√üators. The reduction in prices associated with the FTA tariÔ¨Ä cuts

is statistically insigni√ûcant and economically small.

      To conclude, while I am con√ûdent that the FTA had no impact on prices or output per

plant, I can only tentatively conclude from this that the FTA had no impact on scale or

mark-ups i.e., on ¬µ.


10.3. Productivity (da/dœÑ )


The caveat-ridden conclusions of the last two subsections are that the FTA had little or no

eÔ¨Äect on capital-labour ratios or scale economies. If so then a simple calculation relates FTA

induced productivity growth da/dœÑ to FTA induced labour productivity growth d(v ‚àí l)/dœÑ .

DiÔ¨Äerentiating equation (12) with respect to œÑ and using d(k ‚àí l)/dœÑ = d¬µ/dœÑ = 0 yields


                                                    (                           )
                    da              d(v ‚àí l)             dŒ±m           dŒ±k
                       = ¬µ(1 ‚àí Œ±m )          ‚àí ¬µ (v ‚àí l)     + (k ‚àí l)     .                    (13)
                    dœÑ                 dœÑ                 dœÑ            dœÑ

      Table 9 calculates da/dœÑ for a particular set of assumptions about the terms in equation

(13). dœÑ is just a continuous version of the discrete change ‚àÜœÑ Fi1T A . d(v ‚àí l)/dœÑ is the

Due to FTA labour productivity eÔ¨Äect from measure 1 of table 7.13 v ‚àí l is the Observed

 13
      v is nominal value added growth.   However, since we √ûnd no evidence that the FTA eÔ¨Äected value


                                                   30
Change data from measure 1 of table 7. k ‚àí l is the Observed Change data for machinery

and equipment per hour worked from table 8. For dŒ±m /dœÑ and dŒ±k /dœÑ , I use the observed

change in Œ±m and Œ±k during 1988-96 (times ‚àí1). This will overstate dŒ±m /dœÑ and dŒ±k /dœÑ ,

but the associated terms are so small that any bias will have only second-order eÔ¨Äects. For

the mark-up ¬µ, Basu and Fernald (1997) and others argue that ¬µ is small, close to unity

and no larger than 1.10. It makes no diÔ¨Äerence which ¬µ ¬≤ (1.00, 1.10) I use so that I settle

for ¬µ = 1.05. The reader can readily re-compute da/dœÑ for any value of ¬µ by using equation

(13), table 9, and a hand-held calculator.

   From table 9, the eÔ¨Äect of the FTA on labour productivity is about twice as large as on a

i.e., on TFP. It raised TFP by 1.9 percent for all of manufacturing and by 7.7 percent for the

most impacted industries. On an annualized basis, the FTA raised TFP by a compounded

1.0 percent per year in the most impacted industries. To my mind, this number paints a

picture of very large long-run eÔ¨Éciency gains from trade liberalization.

   Now that the reader has seen equation (13) and table 9, it is easy to show that it makes

little diÔ¨Äerence if the empirically motivated assumption d¬µ/dœÑ = 0 is relaxed. For the

most impacted industries (which are basically low-end manufacturing and hence subject to

constant returns to scale), a large change in ¬µ would be 0.1 i.e., d¬µ/dœÑ = ‚àí0.1. Under this

assumption, it is easy to show that the FTA eÔ¨Äect for the most impacted industries falls

from 7.7 percent to 6.7 percent.14 That is, our estimate of the eÔ¨Äect of the FTA tariÔ¨Ä cuts

on TFP is not particularly sensitive to the assumption made about the eÔ¨Äect of the FTA

added de√üators, the change in nominal value added due to the FTA equals the change in real value added
due to the FTA.
  14
     From equation (12), ‚àÇa/‚àÇ¬µ = (1 ‚àí Œ±m )(v ‚àí l) ‚àí Œ±k (k ‚àí l) ‚âà 0.10 for the most impacted industries. If
d¬µ/dœÑ = ‚àí0.1 then ‚àÇa/‚àÇœÑ ‚â° (‚àÇa/‚àÇ¬µ)(d¬µ/dœÑ ) ‚âà ‚àí0.010 or ‚àí1.0 percent.

tariÔ¨Ä cuts on mark-ups.

   Finally, one might ask if there is more direct evidence on TFP. The answer is yes. Using

some heroic assumptions about Canadian and U.S. data comparability, Statistics Canada

published 1990-95 TFP growth rates for 17 Canadian and U.S. industries. U.S. TFP growth

rates minus Canadian TFP growth rates appear in √ûgure 4. I have ordered industries by the

depth of the FTA mandated tariÔ¨Ä cuts: The most impacted industries are at the bottom and

the least impacted industries are at the top. Every one of the top 5 industries experienced

more rapid TFP growth in the United States than in Canada. Further, almost every one of

the bottom 5 industries experienced more rapid TFP growth in Canada than in the United

States. Figure 4 shows that Canadian TFP rose relative to U.S. TFP in those industries

that were most impacted by the FTA. This is exactly the same conclusion arrived at

econometrically in table 9.


10.4. Heterogeneity


It seems likely that part or most of the estimated FTA impact on productivity is not a gain

in technical eÔ¨Éciency, but industrial reallocation from low productivity to high productivity

plants. In this section I oÔ¨Äer some informal evidence about the decomposition of FTA

labour productivity growth into its technical (within-plant) and allocative (between-plant)

components. I have 1988 and 1995 data on labour productivity grouped by industry and

plant size where plant size is de√ûned by the number of employees e.g., all plants in SIC

industry 1011 with between 10 and 19 employees. The data are from special tabulations

by Statistics Canada and cover 204 of the 213 industries in my sample. There are 1,026

where œâ ijt is the usual cell weight for the industry-plant size cell (Œ£ij œâ ijt = 1).15 The three

terms in equation (14) are the ‚Äòtotal,‚Äô ‚Äòwithin‚Äô and ‚Äòbetween‚Äô changes, respectively. I will

denote them by ‚àÜy T , ‚àÜy W , and ‚àÜy B , respectively.

       Table 10 reports ‚àÜy W , ‚àÜy B , ‚àÜy T and ‚àÜy W /‚àÜy T for variables of interest. The √ûrst

observation is that 78 percent of labour productivity growth is within industry-plant size

cells. This is almost identical to the plant-level results reported by Baily et al. (1992) for

1982-87 U.S. TFP growth. Thus, most of FTA period labour productivity growth occurred

within industry-plant size cells. A secondary conclusion pointed to by the value added

and hours rows is that the productivity gains are coming from labour ‚Äòshedding‚Äô: Within

industry-plant size cells, value added is not changing, but hours are falling.

       It is still possible that the industries which experienced the deepest tariÔ¨Ä cuts tended to

have share shifts favouring the most productive plants. To investigate the possibility of large

between-cell eÔ¨Äects for the most impacted industries, I considered a variance decomposition

where œâ ijt is the usual plant size weight for plant size j (Œ£j œâ ijt = 1). The three terms

in equation (15) will be denoted by ‚àÜyiT , ‚àÜyiW , and ‚àÜyiB , respectively. The correlation

of ‚àÜœÑ Fi1T A with ‚àÜyiB /‚àÜyiT is a statistically insigni√ûcant 0.04. That is, the most impacted

industries did not experience greater share shifting towards productive plants. Restated,

FTA induced labour productivity growth is unlikely to have been driven by shifts in market

share from low- to high-productivity plants.

   There is another interesting result in table 10. For output per plant, growth between

industry-plant size cells accounts for 73 percent of total growth. This con√ûrms what we

discussed before, namely, that any trend towards increased output per plant is associated

with a shift in market share to larger plants. By adding a plant size dimension, this result

extends the Head and Ries (1999b) observation that the FTA did not drive √ûrms down

their average cost curves. It also extends the Tybout and Westbrook (1995) observations

for Mexico into a developed-country context.

   Does the fact that most of the labour productivity growth was within industry-plant

size cells tell us that the observed labour productivity growth primarily re√üects growth in

technical eÔ¨Éciency rather than growth in allocative eÔ¨Éciency? Not quite. I have ignored

entry and exit. While it is not a priori clear whether plant turnover belongs in the ‚Äòbetween‚Äô



                                                              34
or ‚Äòwithin‚Äô categories, Baldwin (1995) argues at length using 1970-79 Canadian plant data

that Canadian productivity growth due to plant turnover mostly occurred within industry-

plant size cells. Baldwin further √ûnds that entering plants tended to be more productive

than exiting plants. Bernard and Jensen (1999) report a similar √ûnding for the United

States.16 Thus, labour productivity growth associated with entry and exit is likely part of

what is driving the observed labour productivity growth within industry-plant size cells.

This position is buttressed by the table 6 results which document that the FTA induced

large net exit.

       Where is the rising technical eÔ¨Éciency coming from? Baldwin and Beckstead (2001)

argue that plants responded to the FTA tariÔ¨Ä cuts by reducing the number of product lines.

Other sources of technical eÔ¨Éciency are also possible, including eÔ¨Éciency gains related to

the skill upgrading documented in table 2 above.

       To conclude, FTA labour productivity growth does not appear to be caused by shifting

market share from low- to high-productivity plants. Rather, it appears to be explained both

by plant turnover (entry and exit) and rising technical eÔ¨Éciency within plants.17


10.5. Productivity Conclusions


I examined the role of scale, capital deepening, materials usage, and plant heterogeneity

for my conclusions about labour productivity. If one is prepared to put aside the serious

problems caused by lack of good capital-stock data, then it appears that scale and capital

  16
     This may be related to Griliches and Regev‚Äôs (1995) ‚Äòshadow of death.‚Äô See Tybout (2000) for a review
of the literature that indicates how common is the √ûnding that entering plants are more productive than
exiting plants.
  17
     We cannot be sure which is most important. Both Baily et al. (1992) and Griliches and Regev (1995)
√ûnd that productivity gains are primarily due to within-plant gains rather than entry and exit.


                                                   35
deepening are not part of the FTA productivity story. If so, then half of the FTA impact

on labour productivity is attributable to an FTA impact on industry-level TFP. This latter

impact is large. Further, this change in industry-level TFP likely re√üects a mix of plant

turnover and rising technical eÔ¨Éciency within plants.

   While the absence of plant-level and capital stock data dampens my certainty about these

conclusions, the big picture is clearer. The most impacted industries are best characterized

as low-end manufacturing industries. See table A1. Thus, unless low-end manufacturing

experienced unusually high investment rates or enormous declines in mark-ups, the FTA

must have induced TFP growth. There is suÔ¨Écient evidence at the 3-digit SIC level to be

con√ûdent that low-end manufacturing did not experience an investment boom.         Further,

the fact that low-end manufacturing typically has small mark-ups makes it impossible for

low-end manufacturing to have experienced enormous declines in mark-ups. Thus, it seems

likely that the FTA induced signi√ûcant TFP growth through a combination of plant turnover

and rising technical eÔ¨Éciency within plants.



11. Conclusions

The FTA lives in two diÔ¨Äerent worlds. For some, it is integral to employment losses and

eroding productivity relative to the United States. To others, it brought explosive trade

growth and large gains in manufacturing gdp. Both these views rest on aggregate numbers

for manufacturing. Neither is supported by a careful sectoral analysis. The following are

the main conclusions of sectoral analysis. I summarize these conclusions separately for

manufacturing as a whole and for the most impacted industries. The latter are the one-

third of industries which experienced the largest tariÔ¨Ä cuts over the 1988-96 period. For

this group the tariÔ¨Ä cuts ranged between 5 and 33 percent and averaged 10 percent.

   (1) For the most impacted industries, the tariÔ¨Ä cuts reduced employment by 15 percent,

reduced output by 11 percent, and reduced the number of plants by 8 percent. For man-

ufacturing as a whole, the numbers are 5, 3, and 4 percent, respectively. These numbers

capture the large adjustment costs associated with reallocating resources out of protected,

ineÔ¨Écient, low-end manufacturing. The fact that manufacturing employment and output

have largely rebounded since 1996 suggests that some and perhaps most of the reallocation

has been to high-end manufacturing.

   (2) The tariÔ¨Ä cuts raised labour productivity by a compounded annual rate of 2.1 percent

for the most impacted industries and by 0.6 percent for manufacturing as a whole. The tariÔ¨Ä

cuts also raised total factor productivity by a compounded annual rate of 1.0 percent for

the most impacted industries and by 0.2 percent for manufacturing as a whole. We argued

that rising total factor productivity is not due to scale eÔ¨Äects, capital deepening, or market

share shifts towards high productivity √ûrms. Rather, it is due to a mix of plant turnover

and rising technical eÔ¨Éciency within plants. Dramatically higher productivity in low-end

manufactures and resource re-allocation to high-end manufactures are the key gains from

the FTA.

   (3) Surprisingly, the tariÔ¨Ä cuts slightly raised annual earnings, primarily by raising pro-

duction worker wages by 0.8 percent per year for the most impacted industries and by 0.3

percent per year for manufacturing as a whole. The tariÔ¨Ä cuts did not eÔ¨Äect earnings of

non-production workers or weekly hours of production workers. The FTA thus reduced


                                             37
inequality, albeit minimally.

   (4) For the most impacted industries, the tariÔ¨Ä cuts explain almost all of the increased

trade with the United States and the increased U.S. share of Canadian trade.

   Most of the eÔ¨Äects of the FTA tariÔ¨Ä cuts are smaller than one would imagine given the

heat generated by the debate. This heat is generated by the con√üict between those who

bore the short run adjustment costs (displaced workers and stakeholders of closed plants)

and those who are garnering the long run productivity gains (consumers and stakeholders of

eÔ¨Écient plants). One cannot understand current debates about freer trade without under-

standing this con√üict. The results here thus take us one step closer to understanding how

freer trade can be implemented in an industrialized economy in a way that recognizes both

the long-run gains and the short-run adjustment costs borne by workers and others.

   Appendix

   1. The EÔ¨Äective Rate of Protection: Let œÖ j be value added in industry j per dollar

of output in the absence of tariÔ¨Äs. Let aij be the value of input of good i per dollar value of

the output of j in the absence of tariÔ¨Äs. Let œÑ j be the tariÔ¨Ä rate against products in industry

j. The eÔ¨Äective tariÔ¨Ä œÑ ej is the amount by which the tariÔ¨Ä structure (œÑ 1 , ..., œÑ j , ..., œÑ J ) raises

value added in industry j. Following Basevi (1966),


                                            X                                 X               X
                œÑ ej = œÑ j + (œÑ j ‚àí œÑ j )       aij œÑ i /œÖ j    where œÑ j =       aij œÑ i /       aij .
                                            i                                 i               i




For post-1992 eÔ¨Äective rates of protection, the 1992 input-output table was used. In all

years, the eÔ¨Äective rate of protection is calculated at the input-output ‚ÄòM‚Äô level (which is

roughly at the 3-digit SIC level) and aggregated using production weights. The aggregated

data of √ûgure 1 use 1980 production weights for aggregation and were smoothed using a

3-year moving average to eliminate a spike in 1993-94.

   2. TariÔ¨Ä Aggregation Bias: Aggregation bias (the use of imports as weights for

aggregating tariÔ¨Äs to the 4-digit level) leads to violations of the Most-Favored Nation (MFN)

equality œÑ Uit S = œÑ ROW
                     it  for t ‚â§ 1988. Aggregation bias is only a problem in the present context

if it changes over time. Imposing œÑ Ui,1988
                                       S
                                            = œÑ ROW
                                                i,1988 in equation (3) exacerbates such change


because it implicitly uses arbitrary aggregation weights for 1988 that are unrelated to the

import aggregation weights used for year t1 . That is, it forces the aggregation weights to

change dramatically between 1988 and t1 . This increases the change in aggregation bias

in the FTA period. As a result, I do not impose œÑ Ui,1988
                                                     S
                                                          = œÑ ROW
                                                              i,1988 in equation (3). To




                                                           39
investigate further, I also considered speci√ûcations with ‚àÜœÑ Fi0T A = 0 replaced by ‚àÜœÑ Fi0T A ‚â°

((œÑ Ui,tS0 ‚àí œÑ ROW         US         ROW
               i,t0 ) ‚àí (œÑ i,1980 ‚àí œÑ i,1980 ))/(t0 ‚àí 1980). This had little or no eÔ¨Äect on the results.


   3. List of Industries in Each TariÔ¨Ä Group: See table A1. Note that 12 of Canada‚Äôs

225 4-digit SIC industries were either excluded from the analysis because of incomplete data

or aggregated in order to ensure consistency over time. The aggregated industries are (new

name in parentheses): 1094 and 1099 (1098); 1511 and 1599 (1598); 1995 and 1999 (1998);

2911 and 2919 (2918); 2951 and 2959 (2958); 3051 and 3059 (3058); 3351 and 3359 (3358);

3362 and 3369 (3368).

   4. De√üators:

   U.S. Def lators: The value-added de√üator is the gdp de√üator reported on the BEA

website as of May 1999. The output de√üator is the usual value of shipments de√üator.

Through 1994, it is adjusted by Make tables as described in Bartelsman and Gray (1996).

After 1994, it is unadjusted. To see the eÔ¨Äect of this series break, in table 7 compare the

√ûrst and third lines for the output-de√üated productivity measures. The √ûrst line ends in

1996, the third in 1994. Since the estimates are similar, the splicing of the 1980-94 and

1995-96 de√üator series plays little role. On a technical note, in converting de√üators from

U.S. SIC to Canadian SIC, Tornqvist indexes were used.

   Canadian Def lators: The value-added (output) de√üator is derived by dividing nominal

value added (output) by real value added (output). The real and nominal series for value

added and output are from the Canadian input-output tables. The tables are available

through 1995. For 1996 both the value added and output de√üators were spliced to the

Canadian ‚Äòindustry price indexes‚Äô from CANSIM. This series is almost identical to the


                                                   40
input-output-derived output de√üator, but not of course to the value added de√üator. Again

from table 7, comparison of the √ûrst line (ending in 1996) with the third line (ending in 1994)

reveals that the splice plays little role. The input-output tables are roughly at the 3-digit

Canadian SIC level (137 industries) so that the de√üator values were repeated at the 4-digit

level (213 industries). It is diÔ¨Écult to evaluate the importance of this. Note though that

the simple correlation of tariÔ¨Ä cuts ‚àÜœÑ Fi1T A with the output de√üator is -0.04. This suggests

that cross-sectionally, the results are not being driven by a spurious correlation hidden here.

       5. De√ûning ‚ÄòObserved Change‚Äô and ‚ÄòDue to FTA‚Äô: Recall that Yi,1988 is the level

of, say employment, in industry i in 1988. The industry i change in employment over the

FTA period is approximately (‚àÜyi1 ) Yi,1988 i.e., the log change times the initial level. The
                                                                                                    P
change in employment among industries in any set I is approximately                                   i¬≤I   (‚àÜyi1 ) Yi,1988 .
                                                            P                          P
As a proportion of total employment it is                    i¬≤I   (‚àÜyi1 ) Yi,1988 /    j¬≤I   Yj,1988 . This can be re-
               P                                        P                                            b
                                                                                                d = Œ≤‚àÜœÑ
written as       i¬≤I   ‚àÜyi1 œâ i where œâ i ‚â° Yi,1988 /   j¬≤I     Yj,1988 .18 Using the fact that ‚àÜyi1
                                                                                                        FTA
                                                                                                        i1

change in employment is              i¬≤I   Œ≤‚àÜœÑ i1  œâ i . With this in mind, Observed Change is de√ûned
               P                                                                Pb

               i¬≤I                                                              i¬≤I

converts the average annual changes for the 8 FTA years into a total FTA period change.

For the compounded annual rates reported in this paper, the ‚Äò8‚Äô is removed. The Œ≤b used

in Due to FTA is the estimate from the √ûrst-line speci√ûcation (equation 8 with pre-FTA

period changes over 1980-86 and FTA period changes over 1988-96).

  18
    For the cases of production worker earnings and wages, œâ i is based on total hours worked by production
workers. For the cases of skill upgrading and inequality œâi is based on total employment. For cases
where Yi,1988Pis a ratio, œâ i is based on the numerator of the ratio i.e., if Yi,1988 = ai,1988 /bi,1988 then
œâi ‚â° ai,1988 / j¬≤I aj,1988 .

Notes: a ) The regression specification is given by the estimating equation (equations 8 or 9), the definition of the pre-
FTA period changes (1980-86 or 1980-88), and the definition of the FTA period changes (1988-96 or 1988-94).
b ) The Wu's T2 column is blank when the OLS estimator is reported and is filled when the IV estimator is reported.
The column reports the p -value for a Hausman test (specifically, Wu's T2 test). Rejection of exogeneity is indicated by
a p -value of less than 0.01 (and an asterisk).
c ) Observed Change is the FTA-period change in the dependent variable. Due to FTA is the FTA-period change
estimated to be caused by the FTA tariff cuts. The first number in parentheses reports the change for all 213 industries.
The second number reports the change for the 71 industries that experienced the largest tariff cuts. Estimates are based
on the estimated Œ≤ that appear in the variable's first line e.g., Œ≤=1.51 for All Workers and Œ≤=1.62 for Production
Workers.
d ) Skill upgrading is the log of the ratio of non-production workers to production workers.
e ) The dependent variable is indicated in bold font at the start of each block of results e.g., 'Employment - All
Workers.' All dependent variables are in logs. For equation (8) there are 213 observations for all workers, 211
observations for production workers, 212 observations for non-production workers, and 211 observations for skill
upgrading. For equation (9) there are twice as many observations.

Notes: a ) Row 1 is the log point change in TFP that is due to the FTA.
Row 2 is the log point change in labour productivity that is due to the
FTA. See measure 1 of table 7. Row 3 is the materials share in 1996.
Row 4 is the log point change (1988-96) in labour productivity. Row 5 is
the log point change (1988-96) in machinery and equipment per hour
worked. Row 6 (7) is the change in Œ±m (Œ±k ) over the 1988-96 period
(times -1). This change is entirely attributed to the FTA because the exact
attribution makes little difference. Row 1 is calculated using equation
(13) with ¬µ = 1.05.
b ) All Industries is all 213 manufacturing industries. Most Impacted
Industries is the one-third of all industries that experienced the deepest
FTA-mandated tariff cuts.
