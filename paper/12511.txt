                                           ABSTRACT


We study how the trajectory of health for the near-elderly uninsured changes upon enrolling into
Medicare at the age of 65. We find that Medicare increases the probability of the previously
uninsured having excellent or very good health, decreases their probability of being in good health,
and has no discernable effects at lower health levels. Surprisingly, we found Medicare had a similar
effect on health for the previously insured. This suggests that Medicare helps the relatively healthy
65 year olds, but does little for those who are already in declining health once they reach the age of
65. The improvement in health between the uninsured and insured were not statistically different
from each other. The stability of insurance coverage afforded by Medicare may be the source of the
health benefit suggesting that universal coverage at other ages may have similar health effects.

I. Introduction

The Medicare program provides near universal health insurance coverage for Americans over the
age of 65, while those under 65 are predominantly reliant on employer-sponsored health
insurance for affordable health insurance coverage. The substantial gaps in coverage resulting
from the employer-based system are partially filled by individually purchased policies and public
insurance (primarily Medicaid), but 18% of the non-elderly, 45.5 million people in 2004, remain
without health insurance. Because health insurance reduces the financial barriers of using the
medical system to maintain or prevent the deterioration of health, the uninsured may experience
indirect negative consequences to their health as a result of health care foregone from a lack of
incentives for obtaining medical care (Institute of Medicine, 2001). Because the near-elderly
uninsured obtain health insurance through the Medicare program at the age of 65, they may
experience a health benefit from this transition. The goal of this paper is to determine the effect
of the Medicare program on the health of the near-elderly uninsured.


Understanding whether there is a health benefit to the near-elderly uninsured from the Medicare
program is an important aspect of policy debates regarding expanding and contracting Medicare
coverage. As we approach the year 2018 -- when the Medicare trust fund reserves are projected
to be exhausted (Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, 2006) – policy
changes to Medicare may become necessary. The near-elderly uninsured may be particularly
vulnerable to any contraction in Medicare coverage because Medicare arrives at an age when
treatable health conditions are emerging at an increasing rate. Despite the importance of health
insurance for this age group, 25% of the near-elderly will experience a period without health
insurance between ages 55 and 65 (Baker et al., 2005). This may be partially due to the fact that
affordable coverage is difficult to find for those lacking health insurance with existing or
emerging health conditions. Although all are guaranteed an issue of a health insurance policy in
the individual market through the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA), the law does not limit the amount insurers can charge for such coverage. Hence,
premium levels can exceed the financial resources of all but the wealthiest individuals. As a
result, several policy proposals have emerged to address this vulnerable group including
expansions in the Medicare program to cover the uninsured in the 55 to 65 age group.
Understanding the direct and indirect benefits of providing health insurance to the near-elderly


                                                 4
uninsured can help inform these policies. The health effects of policies specifically aimed to
provide insurance to the near-elderly uninsured have not been established.


In this paper, we use a quasi-experimental approach to establish the health effects of insurance
for the near-elderly uninsured. Those who acquire health insurance typically do so for a reason:
they may have gained employment that offers coverage; they may have qualified for coverage
from the federal government as a result of poverty or disability; or they may have purchased
insurance in the individual market. In all of these cases, the decision to purchase health insurance
may be related to recent and projected changes in health status, making it difficult to empirically
assess the health effects of acquiring insurance using cross-sectional comparisons. In contrast,
uninsured persons who turn 65 acquire health insurance through the Medicare program simply
by aging in. Therefore, by using panel data to assess how gaining Medicare coverage at age 65
changes the health trajectory of the near-elderly uninsured as they age into their late 60s and
early 70s, we can identify how insurance changes the trajectory of health for this group.


II. Literature on Health Insurance and Health
The Institute of Medicine Committee on the Consequences of Uninsurance examined the
relationship between being uninsured and the health of American adults (Institute of Medicine,
2002). The Committee concluded that if the roughly 30 million working-age uninsured
Americans were to become continuously insured, their health would be expected to improve. The
studies on general health supporting these conclusions find that being uninsured for relatively
short periods (1 to 4 years) appears to result in a decrease in general health status (Baker et al.,
2001) and that uninsured adults followed for 5 to 17 years are at higher risk of premature death
than are persons with private coverage (Franks et al., 1993; Sorlie et al., 1994). Hundreds of
other studies have also documented a disparity in morbidity between the uninsured and the
insured (Literature reviews: Brown et al., 1998; Hadley, 2003; Institute of Medicine, 2002).
From these studies, however, it is difficult to determine the causal relation between health
insurance and health for several reasons. A positive association between health insurance and
health may reflect the effects of health on health insurance (reverse causation) or the effects of
some other unobserved attribute on both health insurance and health (selection) (Levy and
Meltzer, 2004).



                                                  5
The only experimental study of the effect of insurance on health was the RAND Health
Insurance Experiment (HIE). Between 1974 and 1982, the HIE randomly assigned roughly 2,000
families to one of 14 experimental health plans that varied in their cost-sharing arrangements
(Newhouse et al., 1981; Newhouse et al., 1993). Although the study found sizable effects of
more generous health insurance on use and expenditures, effects on health status were more
modest. For low-income persons with high blood pressure, free care brought an improvement in
blood pressure control. Vision also improved among those with poor vision. No significant
effects were detected on eight other measures of health status and health habits for adults (Brook
et al., 1983). The absence of a health effect could be due to the presence of a cap on out-of-
pocket health expenditures by all enrollees that was, at most, 15% of income (Newhouse et al.,
1993). This randomized social experiment is of limited use for our purposes because (1) it did
not include a study group with no health insurance; (2) it excluded the Medicare-eligible
population and thus excluded the elderly population; and (3) the health care delivery system and
medicine have both changed substantially since the mid to late seventies.


By exploiting a natural experiment from a change in the eligibility of pregnant women for
Medicaid benefits, a few quasi-experimental studies have provided evidence of a causal relation
between health insurance and health of newborns (Joyce, 1998; Epstein and Newhouse, 1998;
Baldwin et al., 1998; Ray et al., 1997; Currie and Gruber, 1996a, 1996b, 1997; Reichman and
Florio, 1995; Haas et al., 1993; Fossett et al., 1992; Buescher et al., 1991; Piper et al., 1990). The
findings generally suggest that health insurance does result in modest reductions in infant
mortality.


More recently, quasi-experimental designs have been applied to the question of health and health
insurance around the introduction of Medicare. Decker and Rapaport (2002) found that mortality
decreased significantly after women diagnosed with early breast cancer acquired Medicare.
Finkelstein and McKnight (2005) reported that the establishment of Medicare in 1965 had no
discernible impact on the mortality of the elderly in the 10 years following Medicare’s
enactment.




                                                  6
The hypothesized mechanism by which health effects might occur is through increased or more
timely use of medical services with insurance and Medicare. The HIE provides direct
experimental evidence that a reduction in out-of-pocket costs increases utilization and
expenditures for health care services (Manning et al., 1987; Newhouse et al., 1993). Several
recent observational studies provide strong evidence of the increased use of medical services due
to Medicare. State hospital discharge datasets have also been used to assess how Medicare might
alter medical service use (Lichtenberg, 2002; Card et al., 2004). These studies have found that
utilization rates for doctor visits and hospitalizations (particularly hospitalizations for
discretionary conditions) increase at age 65, the cusp of Medicare eligibility. McWilliams et al.
(2003), using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), found a jump in preventive care
utilization between just before and just after age 65. Because so many medical procedures have
been found to reduce risks of death and disability (Aiken and Bays, 1984; Cassel et al., 1999;
Fuchs, 1999; McClellan and Noguchi, 1998), the assertion that Medicare and other forms of
health insurance that improved access to medical care has helped Americans live longer,
healthier, and more independent lives is compelling.


Yet no study has looked directly at how the introduction of Medicare may change the health
trajectory of the previously uninsured using individual-level data. We hypothesize that the health
trajectory of previously uninsured persons will improve as a result of the introduction of
Medicare at age 65. The mechanism for this change would be the greater use of medical care
induced by subsidized, universal health insurance coverage. There may also be
contemporaneous changes occurring at this age. The most obvious are the higher rates of
retirement and the introduction of Social Security payments at age 65. Because of these other
changes occurring simultaneously, we will also test whether the health trajectory of the
previously uninsured changes by more than that of the previously insured.


III. Conceptual and Empirical Framework
Health insurance and medical care exist to maintain and improve health, and to guard against the
financial risks associated with poor health. Health can be viewed as an asset that has a natural
rate of deterioration over time. A medical event can hasten that deterioration. Medical care is
used after a medical event to restore, maintain, or prevent further decline in health (Grossman,



                                                   7
1972). The expenditure for this medical care is sometimes large and unexpected. Insurance
reduces the financial risk associated with higher medical expenses after a health event. Health
insurance plays other important roles in this relationship, including allowing access to health care
that would otherwise be unaffordable (de Meza 1983, Nyman, 1999) and increasing demand for
medical care because the person using health care with insurance typically does not pay the
entire cost of that care (Pauly, 1968).


Determining whether the additional medical care afforded by the introduction of health insurance
affects health may be complicated by adverse selection: the decision to acquire or to drop health
insurance is often related to one’s health status (sometimes this is not a decision – it happens
because a person involuntarily loses their job with employment-based benefits). For example,
one could acquire health insurance before seeing the doctor for an emerging health problem.
Unless the health status factors that led to the change in insurance status are perfectly controlled
for, assessing causality in the empirical evaluation of the relationship between change in health
insurance status and health status is problematic because the effects of the unmeasured or
mismeasured aspects of poor health may be attributed to being insured.


The empirical framework in this paper focuses on the introduction of Medicare insurance at age
65, where the introduction of government-subsidized health insurance for previously uninsured
persons occurs independently of any underlying health status change other than aging one more
year. Because government policy restricts entry into Medicare until age 65 for most Americans,
those who take up Medicare insurance (at age 65, but not those before age 65) do so for reasons
other than changes in health status. It is the introduction of health insurance at age 65 for no
other reason than turning this age that creates the natural experiment used in our key
comparisons.


A stylized version of our model is expressed as
        ∆H = β0 + β1U + β2 M + β3 U * M + β4 Age
where H is the change in health status between age and age+2, U is an indicator of whether the
subject is uninsured prior to age 65, M is an indicator for the age the subjects is enrolled in
Medicare. We can determine from the estimated coefficients the average change in health status


                                                   8
( ∆H ) in the pre-Medicare and post-Medicare period for both the Uninsured and the Insured
groups: HUpre= 0+     1,   HUpost= 0+   1+   2+   3,       HIpre= 0, and HIpost= 0+   2.   To simplify the
notation, we refer to these four ∆H groups as Upre, Upost, Ipre, and Ipost. They are depicted as
slopes in Figure 1. From ∆H , we can estimate the change in the rate of health decline after the
introduction of Medicare for the Uninsured and Insured groups ( U and I, respectively) by
subtracting the pre change from the post change (i.e. U= Upost-Upre; I= Ipost-Ipre). Finally, we
estimate the change in the rate of health decline for the Uninsured using the Insured group as a
control by U- I. Note that while, for simplicity, the graph depicts no intercept change at 65,
our modeling does allow for this.


This experimental opportunity at age 65 is not exact for two reasons. First, initial insurance
status is not randomly assigned, which could bias our findings: certain factors, such as low
socioeconomic status, can cause poor health and lower rates of health insurance coverage. With
the first-difference approach, baseline health differences between the insured and uninsured
(both observed and unobserved differences) are removed. By controlling for the characteristics
of the groups, we control for differences in the rate of change in health status due to differences
in these characteristics. Second, other changes confounded with health status may also occur at
age 65, including retirement and Social Security payments. We consider the change in trajectory
of the insured as a proxy for these and other contemporaneous changes. We also directly
consider how sensitive our comparisons are to the time-dependent (but potentially endogenous)
retirement status and Social Security payments.


IV. Data
The data were obtained from the original age-eligible cohort of the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS). The HRS began in 1992 as a national longitudinal study of the noninstitutionalized
population born between 1931 and 1941 (i.e., persons age 51 to 61 at the time of the baseline
survey) and their spouses. Respondents and their spouses have been reinterviewed every 2 years
since. The investigators used a complex sample design in which black persons, Hispanic persons,
and residents of Florida were oversampled. The initial age-eligible sample was 9,771. We use all
biannual waves from 1992 to 2004. Figure 2 describes the aging of the original sample at each
wave.


                                                       9
Our study sample includes birth cohorts 1932-1937 (grey shading in Figure 2). These birth
cohorts have the potential to be observed at age 59/60 and then being observed at least twice
upon reaching the age of 65. By using the same participants for the pre- and post-eligibility
periods removes the possibility of a birth cohort effect; we excluded the 1938-1941 birth cohorts
for this reason. Starting all individuals when they are 59/60 removes the possibility of left-
censoring bias that would result from a differential death rate by insurance status and age cohort;
to avoid this, we excluded the 1931 cohort and started following the included birth cohorts at age
59/60. As a result, we studied the 1932-1937 birth cohorts (N = 5,086).


We also excluded persons who dropped out or died before age 59/60 (n = 226), those with
missing insurance status (n = 55), the few persons who reported never receiving Medicare after
age 65 (n = 31), those with no follow-up after age 59/60 (n = 127), and those on Medicare or
Medicaid at age 59/60 (n = 572). We used sensitivity analysis to test the influence of this last
exclusion. Our final study sample consists of 4,075 persons (Table 1).


In each wave, HRS respondents provided detailed information about their current insurance
coverage. They were asked whether they received any employment-based coverage, individual
coverage, and coverage through federal programs such as Medicare or Medicaid. The uninsured
are defined as those whose response indicated they had no form of private or public insurance.
Those uninsured at age 59/60 represent the uninsured group and those insured at age 59/60
represent the insured group. The insured group consists of 3,484 persons, and the uninsured
group consists of 591 persons (Table 2). Everyone is insured through Medicare once they cross
the age 65 threshold, but the analytical labels for our comparison groups are held fixed according
to their insurance status at age 59/60. The percentage of uninsured persons drops from 14.5% to
14.0% between the pre and post period because of the higher death rate in the uninsured group.


However, switching between insured and uninsured states is possible before age 65. In fact, 9.7%
of the sample switched from insured to uninsured or from uninsured to insured between 59/60
and 63/64. Because our interest is determining whether health is a consequence of one’s
insurance status, we would like the definition of insurance status to not be a consequence of a



                                                 10
health event. Therefore, our primary analysis is based on the initial insurance status (i.e.
insurance status at age 59/60). In a sensitivity analysis, we compare the group continuously
insured and the group continuously uninsured.


While wave-specific overall response rates average 88.6%, persons who are uninsured are more
likely to be lost to follow-up than persons who are insured. The HRS sample weights account for
attrition (in addition to the complex sample design) through a post-stratification of the HRS to
the Current Population Survey (CPS) by age, sex, race, ethnicity, and marital status groups. This
stratification explains differential non-response over time by those major demographic groups.
Because differential attrition by insurance status remained, we used the CPS to apply an
additional adjustment to the HRS weights by age, race, labor force status, education, and
insurance status to arrive at our final weights. The details of this adjustment are provided in the
technical appendix. These adjusted weights are used in all analyses.


The primary outcome measure is self-reported health status combined with mortality. The former
is measured by the question, “Would you say that your health is excellent, very good, good, fair,
or poor?” Mortality is reported by surviving family members or other contacts, and non-reported
mortality is obtained through a link of the HRS files with the National Death Index. Self-reported
health status has been used as a measure of health for many previous studies that related
insurance coverage to health outcomes (Fihn and Wicher, 1988; Hafner-Eaton, 1993; Lurie et al.,
1984; Short and Lair, 1994) and has been shown to have predictive validity for both future health
care utilization and subsequent mortality (Manning et al., 1987; DeSalvo, 2006). Due to the
small sample sizes on the extremes of this scale, we combine the excellent and very good health
into a single category, and the fair and poor categories into another category.


The primary control variables include sex, age, education, ethnicity, race, and region. Baseline
marital status, income, and wealth and time-varying covariates of retirement status, receipt of
Social Security payments, and marital status are included as explanatory variables in sensitivity
analysis only because these variables may be considered endogenous. Wealth and income
measures are converted to 2004 real U.S. dollars adjusted by the Consumer Price Index.




                                                 11
Retirement status is based on self-reported categories of not retired, fully retired, partially retired,
or not applicable.


V. Empirical Model
We estimate health state transitions between health state at age t (Ht) and the health state at age
t+2 (Ht+2), one survey wave later. Ht+2 is a categorical variable with four categories: j =
(excellent/very good (E), good (G), fair/poor (F), and died (D)). The transitions from Ht to Ht+2
are estimated by using the following multinomial logit model:


     pij
ln         = βij0 + βij1H t + βij2 U t + βij3 M t + βij4 H t * U t + βij5 H t * M t + βij6 M t * U t
     piE
             + βij7 H t * U t * M t + βij8 Age t + βijn X n

where pij is the probability of being in health state category j for participant i at age t+2 given his
or her health and other characteristics: pij = pr(H t +1 = j | H t = i;age t ; X) . A more traditional fixed

effect model of health state would not be appropriate because death is one of the states and it is
an absorbing state. While we considered an ordered logit specification for this model because
our measure of health status is ordered, we abandoned this approach because of the poor
performance of this model on the Brant test and the fact that the multinomial logit generally
passed the revised Hosmer-Lemeshow test, while the ordered logit universally failed this test.
(The details of our specification tests are provided in the technical appendix.)


To provide interpretability from the large number of estimated relevant coefficients in our
multinomial logit model, we simulate how the estimated health transitions will change health for
U and I as the subjects in these groups age. The simulation is conducted as follows. First, we
start with the sample when they are 59/60. We then use the estimated coefficients from the
health transition model to predict their probability of being in each of the four health states at
61/62. Each subject’s realized health state at 61/62 is then determined from a random draw from
a uniform distribution on the unit interval. We then repeat this process using the predicted health
states at 61/62 as their baseline health state for the prediction of the probability of being in each
of the four health states at 63/64. This process is repeated until each subject is aged to 71/72.
Those subjects who enter the dead state are treated as dead for all remaining ages in the


                                                              12
simulation and are dropped from the repeated predictions for subsequent ages. In addition to
simulating the health of subjects as they age onto Medicare, we simulate the health of subjects as
they age from 65 to 71 assuming they did not receive Medicare. This out-of-sample simulation
is performed by not “turning on M” for ages beyond 65.


The simulation is similar to a Markov chain, but instead of using average transition probabilities
and averages for initial conditions, the Markov process is conducted at the individual level. This
allows for unique transition probabilities for each individual’s covariates. This greatly simplifies
the process when the time dependent covariates of retirement status and Social Security
payments are added to the model. However, random variation enters because realized states are
based on a random draw. This variation is reduced because we repeat the simulation 100 times
for each individual.


When the simulation is complete, the average proportion of subjects in each health state at each
age for each insurance group is estimated as well as for the counterfactual post period of U and I.
We then estimate the change in health state over a 6-year period for each insurance group (i.e.
Upre, Ipre, Upost, Ipost) by subtracting the health state probability at age 71 from the health state
probability at age 65. The difference-in-difference for each insurance group ( U and I) is
defined as the difference in a 6-year change in health state caused by Medicare enrollment at age
65 ((Upost – Upre) and (Ipost – Ipre)). Finally, the difference between these two differences gives
the change in health status caused by Medicare enrollment at age 65 for the uninsured,
controlling for any contemporaneous changes in health over time. These calculations are
depicted graphically in Figure 3.


We estimated standard errors and significance in the multinomial logit using robust standard
errors (White, 1980), correcting for clustering at the person level. We estimated confidence
intervals of the health state probabilities estimated in the simulation using the percentile method
from a non-parametric clustered bootstrap. The cluster was at the individual level to maintain the
serial correlation pattern at the individual level without assuming an explicit form for the
autocorrelation (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993).




                                                   13
We then estimate the base model for several important subgroups: continuous insurance groups,
by gender, for low income and low wealth, and for those with and without supplemental
insurance. Low income (wealth) group is defined as those with income (wealth) below the
median in that wave when 59/60. For the 1996 wave, this translates into income below $46,000
and wealth below $156,000 in 2000 dollars. Supplemental insurance is defined as any additional
insurance to Medicare. This includes employer-sponsored insurance, individual insurance, a
MediGap plan, VA Champus, and Medicaid. Finally, we perform several robustness checks.
We explore whether the results are robust to additional control variables such as time-dependent
labor force participation and Social Security payments, to alternative age specifications, to
alternative health status categorizations, and to weighting.


VI. Results
Table 3 shows the baseline characteristics of the study sample by insurance status. The insured
and uninsured groups in the HRS at age 59/60 are representative of these groups in the United
States. The uninsured are more likely to be in fair or poor health, are less likely to work, have
lower education and lower income, and are more likely to be African American or Hispanic.
Although the uninsured are more likely to have diabetes and psychiatric problems and to visit the
hospital, they are less likely to visit the doctor.


Table 4 shows the coefficients of the multinomial regression coefficients, with the excellent/very
good group being treated as the reference category. The tests of significance for key groups of
variables are displayed at the bottom of the table. Here we see that the health of the uninsured is
different from that of the insured in the pre-and post-Medicare periods. The health status
differences before and after Medicare within insurance group approaches significance at the .05
level. The difference in the rates of change pre- vs. post-Medicare between the uninsured and
insured is not statistically significant.


To better understand the direction of these health changes, we turn to the simulated trajectories
depicted in Figure 4. In the northwest quadrant we see the trajectory for the excellent/very good
health status. The darker lines represent the uninsured group trajectory and the lighter lines
represent the insured group trajectory. The uninsured trajectory is below the insured trajectory



                                                      14
representing their inferior health. Both lines decline with age representing deteriorating health
with age and the monotonically increasing probability of being in the dead health state. At age
65 there is a kink in the trajectories which represents the change in the rate of health decline post
Medicare enrollment. The dashed line is the pre-65 trajectory, based on the pre-65 transition
probabilities, extended into the post-65 ages. The divergence between the two lines for each
insurance group represents the effect of Medicare on that insurance group. Here we see the
increase in the likelihood of excellent/very good health with Medicare for both the uninsured and
insured groups. The divergence is greater for the uninsured group. The other panels show the
trajectories for the other health status categories. It is notable that by age 71 the fair/poor
trajectories for the insured and uninsured groups converge.


As a check on the fit of our model and our simulation to the raw data on health status for our
sample, we graphically display the raw trajectories with the trajectories from our fitted data in
Figure 5. This dramatically demonstrates the remarkable fit of our model.


Table 5 displays the simulated incremental effects between health trajectories. In column [E] we
see that for every 100 persons in the uninsured group, from age 65 to 71 the introduction of
Medicare at age 65 leads to 7.7 more uninsured people reporting excellent or very good health,
6.1 fewer reporting good health, 3.7 fewer reporting fair or poor health, and 2.2 more are dead.
The changes are statistically significant for the excellent/very good group, suggested by the
exclusion of 0 in the reported 95% confidence interval. Similar but weaker patterns are observed
for the insured group from age 65 to 71, where the introduction of Medicare at 65 leads to 5.9
more insured people reporting excellent or very good health, 5.1 fewer reporting good health, 1.0
fewer reporting fair or poor health, and 0.2 more are dead (column [F]). Medicare at age 65
appears to delay the erosion of excellent or very good health. For the uninsured group, the
deterioration of health prevented is one that would have resulted in good, fair, or poor health. For
the insured group, the deterioration of health prevented is one that would have resulted in good
health. We could not detect a significant survival effect of Medicare at age 65.


The comparisons between the insured and uninsured groups in column [G] show 1.8 more
reporting excellent or very good health in the uninsured group and 2.8 fewer reporting fair or



                                                  15
poor in the uninsured group. Although not statistically significant, this does suggest that
providing health insurance to the uninsured does has a modest health effect.


Table 6 displays results for various subgroups. There is a similar pattern when the analysis is
limited to the continuously insured and the continuously uninsured. The uninsured enrolling into
Medicare appears to have a slightly greatest positive influence on women compared with men in
terms of the gain in excellent/very good health. The comparisons in the low-income and low-
wealth groups look remarkably similar to the overall result. Finally, we compare the subgroup of
those with supplemental versus those without supplemental insurance. The rates of death
increase for both subgroups because those who died before 65 were dropped from both
subgroups because supplemental status could not be determined. The relative difference
between the uninsured and insured is greater for the uninsured who also obtain supplemental
insurance.


Table 7 presents the sensitivity of the results to various alternatives. The results are insensitive
to changes in retirement status, changes in marital status, or the introduction of Social Security
payments suggesting that the difference within the insured and uninsured groups cannot be
attributed to these often contemporaneous changes at age 65. The results are insensitive to
alternative age specifications. Our main concern is that our use of a quadratic age specification
was not appropriately capturing the non-linear trajectory of health status with age. In this series
of robustness checks, we find almost no non-linear pattern of health status changes and age. The
three alternative age specifications considered (i.e., 2a, 2b, and 2c in Table 7) are nearly identical
to the base model, suggesting that we have appropriately specified the age/health trajectory.
Panel 3 in Table 7 shows the model when the five living health states are not collapsed into three
living health states. The three health states used in the base model potentially mask some
differences between the excellent and very good health states, and between the fair and poor
health states, but the smaller sample sizes in the finer categories leads to less precise estimates.
Generally, the combined groups are a fair representation of the more specific patterns in this
panel. When the five categories of health status in the multinomial logit but summarizes the
results in the same way as the base model. Here the results are similar to the base model.




                                                  16
Panel 4 in Table 7 shows the results excluding the weights. The weighting slightly increases the
additional number of persons with excellent/very good health and this increase is greater in the
uninsured group. Given the greater rates of attrition among the uninsured, the weighted estimate
offers an appropriate adjustment for the observable attrition differences between groups.


VII. Conclusion
Because the number of near elderly is rising rapidly and there are few affordable alternatives for
health insurance for those who lack access to employment-based coverage, the uninsured near-
elderly are of growing concern. We find that providing Medicare to the near-elderly uninsured
increases their probability of being in excellent or very good health, decreases their probability
of being in good health, and has no statistically significant effects at lower health levels.
Surprisingly, we found Medicare had the same pattern of effect on the health of the previously
insured. This suggests that Medicare helps the relatively healthy 65 year olds, but may do little
for those who are already in declining health once they reach the age of 65. The improvement in
health from Medicare for the uninsured was not statistically different from the improvement in
health from Medicare for the insured. However, the direction of the statistically insignificant
effect is suggestive of a greater health effect for the previously uninsured.


Our evidence of Medicare improving the health status for the uninsured is consistent with
evidence that the lack of health insurance in the period immediately preceding Medicare
eligibility is associated with faster declines in health (Baker et al., 2001; Dor, Sudano, and Baker,
2006) and suggests that Medicare may attenuate the rapid health declines of the uninsured. It is
also consistent with the conclusions of Hadley and Waidmann (2006) who, using an instrumental
variables analysis approach with pre-65 HRS data only, summarize their findings as suggesting
that extending insurance coverage to the near-elderly uninsured would result in an increase in the
proportion of people at age 65 in excellent and very good health. Yet, as pointed out in a
commentary by Kronick (2006), the magnitude of the health changes found in Hadley and
Waidmann (much larger than those found here) seem implausible. Part of this may be due to
issues with the appropriateness of their instruments, but part may be due to their use of an
inappropriate instrumental variables estimator for nonlinear estimators for endogenous
categorical health status and dependent variables (Newey, 1987; Terza, 2006). Another possible



                                                  17
explanation for the differences between their results and ours is their use of an ordered logit. As
our Technical Appendix indicates, these data reject that specification of the model. Moreover,
Finkelstein and McKnight (2005) found, using aggregate data, that the establishment of
Medicare had no discernible impact on the mortality of the elderly in the decade after the
enactment of Medicare.


The potential for health improvements for the uninsured is supported by the evidence that use of
medical services rises dramatically after enrollment into Medicare and that the increase is greater
for those who become insured when they are eligible for Medicare than for those who were
insured before Medicare enrollment. This effect of Medicare on health service use may be the
mechanism for the positive effects on health status. Yet this mechanism is not entirely consistent
with our finding that health status also improved for those who enrolled into Medicare at age 65
and were insured before this age. To be consistent with an improvement in health for both the
previously insured and previously uninsured, the mechanism would have to include aspects of
the Medicare program that are different from insurance obtained in the private market. For
example, Medicare offers a more stable source of health insurance which may itself have a health
advantage because the decision to leave work when one is recovering from an illness may
improve recovery (Bradley et al., 2005). This might outweigh the possibility that insurance
coverage under Medicare may be less generous, on average, when compared to employer-
sponsored health insurance, even in the presence of private supplemental coverage that is
obtained by many Medicare beneficiaries. If, in fact, the stability of insurance coverage
afforded by Medicare is the source of the health benefit, universal coverage at other ages may
have similar health effects.


An alternative explanation for health improvements at 65 would be if health changes resulted
from contemporaneous changes at age 65, such as retirement and Social Security payments.
Because the majority initiate retirement and social security prior to 65, rather than
contemporaneous with Medicare eligibility, we were able to separately identify these events and
add controls for initiation of retirement and Social Security. This alternative explanation was not
supported by our data because when we added these controls, the changes to health observed at
Medicare eligibility remained. Another alternative may be that the observed changes in health



                                                 18
status could be attributed to subjective responses to the health status question. This study is
limited by its use of self-reported health status rather than objectively determined health status
measures. Further research into the mechanisms generating the effects measured in this paper is
still needed.


We find that Medicare does improve the health of the uninsured and the insured, but only for the
relatively healthy. This suggests that there are health benefits of universal coverage and that
extending this coverage to much earlier ages may increase the proportion of the population who
arrive at the age of 65 in excellent or very good health. It also suggests that Medicare itself may
be providing health benefits to the population. When considering the value of health insurance,
however, health is only one important aspect. Health insurance is designed to provide financial
security to families by protecting them from potentially devastating financial consequences that
can result from unexpected health care expenses (Himmelstein, et al., 2005). The more direct
financial justification for health insurance should not be forgotten as we seek to better understand
its indirect health consequences.

In this technical appendix, we provide additional details about the data, the sample used, the
specification of the model, and assorted sensitivity tests to verify the robustness of our results.


Differential sample loss. One of our early analyses indicated that there was differential sample
loss for the initially uninsured from the initial cohort of the HRS. For example, while the
overall rate of loss to follow-up is 7.4% in the 1994 HRS (Baker and Sudano, 2005), we
estimated this rate to be 6.7% among the insured and 13.8% among the uninsured. (Polsky et al.,
2005). This dropout pattern continues in all survey waves and is not accounted for in HRS
survey weights. The respondent levels weights in the HRS are scaled so as to yield weight sums
which correspond to the number of individuals in the U.S. population as measured by the March
CPS for the year of data collection. Existing HRS methodology involves post-stratifying each
wave’s weights to the corresponding March CPS on the basis of age of respondent and spouse
and on the basis of respondent gender and race/ethnicity. Since insurance status was not factored
into the weight estimation strategy by the HRS, we made additional adjustments to the
respondent-level weights in the HRS so as to account for this differential dropout by insurance
status in the HRS.


To create additional weight adjustment factors for the HRS using the Current Population
Survey’s (CPS) March supplement as a benchmark so that the weights would account for
population level incidence of being uninsured we followed for following steps. First, we created
mutually exclusive categories within 4 dimensions related to insurance status: insurance
categories defined as mutually exclusive insurance groups using hierarchical assignment
(Employer/ Individual, Medicaid / Medicare / VA/Champus, Uninsured), race/ethnicity
categories (White/Other (non-Hispanic), Black (non-Hispanic), All Hispanic), education
categories (<high school degree, >=high school degree), and labor force participation categories
(in labor force, not in labor force). Second, for respondents at age 59/60 in the 1992, 1994, and
1996 March CPS we estimated weighted and unweighted frequency counts for the 36 cells
defined by: insurance groups * race* education * labor force status. Cells smaller than n=20
were collapsed. Third, we similarly estimated weighted and unweighted counts for our study



                                                 38
sample of 59/60 year olds in the 1992, 1994, and 1996 HRS for the 36 cells defined by insurance
groups * race* education * labor force status. Fourth, an adjustment factor was calculated as the
ratio of the weighted CPS count to the weighted HRS count within each of the 36 cells. Fifth,
these insurance-race-education-labor force status- specific adjustment factors were applied to
each individual’s HRS wave-specific weight in our study sample of 59/60 year olds in 1992,
1994, or 1996. Hence, by applying the adjustments, our study estimates from the HRS were
benchmarked with the CPS.


Design Effects. For all of our subsequent analysis, we have adjusted for the design effects in the
original study and for the differential sample loss by using these revised weights.


We also correct for the panel nature of our data – repeated observations on individuals over a
twelve year period. In the estimation stage, and tests on the estimated equations, we use robust
(Huber-White-Eicker) corrections appropriate to the estimator, and include cluster corrections at
the person ID level using SAS SURVEYLOGIT procedure with the cluster option. In predicting
the trajectories from these estimates, we use estimates based on a clustered nonparametric
bootstrapping of the data, where the clusters are all of the observations on an individual. Each
of the thousand replicates’ parameter estimates are used to make predictions based on a fixed
reference sample. That sample includes 100 copies of the values for our sample at age 59/60,
with the weights equal to the weights at that age. The reason for the additional copies was to
reduce the extra variation induced by our Monte Carlo simulation of the trajectories for
categorical health outcomes (see below).


No formal correction is made for the clustering of observations by PSU’s in the Health and
Retirement Study.


Estimation approach to health transitions. Because self-reported health status (augmented
with being dead as the worst alternative) is an ordered categorical variable, one of the logical
choices for analyzing the response in ordered data is either the ordered logit or the ordered
probit. In contrast, our multinomial approach does not exploit the information contained in the
ordering. In our sensitivity analyses, we examined the ordered logit and an extension, the



                                                 39
generalized ordered logit (Williams, 2006). The ordered logit estimator is highly restrictive in
that it assumes proportional odds (or parallel lines). The multinomial logit removes the ordering
assumption between categories at the expense of increasing the number of parameters estimated.
The generalized ordered logit model is a partial proportional odds model that preserves the
information from ordering, but loosens the restrictive proportional odds assumption when it is
violated. In our case, the generalized ordered logit estimated the same number of parameters as
the multinomial logit. We use a Richard William’s gologit2 command in STATA for the partial
proportional response model. Although the formulation is slightly different, the model is
equivalent to Lall et al. (2002) and Peterson and Harrell (1990).


To test the proportional property of the ordered logit, we performed the Brant Test (Brant, 1990)
The resulting test value in Appendix Table 1 indicates that we can reject the ordered logit at p <
0.001; the proportionality assumption does not hold for these data. Moreover, an examination of
the specific contributors to the overall test value suggests that several key explanatory variables
are involved, including initial health good and fair/poor and the specification of age, which is
confounded with Medicare status. The eliunin variable is a key violation given that it represents
the interaction between Medicare eligibility and being uninsured at age 59/60.


We also used other specification tests to assess the alternative estimators. We employed the
modified Hosmer–Lemeshow Test to determine whether there was a relationship between the
raw-scale residuals (indicators for each status minus their predicted probability) against
indicators for deciles of each of the predicted probabilities from these three models (ordered
logit, generalized ordered logit, and multinomial). We show the F-statistics from test of whether
deciles of the predicted probability to determine if there is any systematic misfit in the
predictions over the range of the data. If the specification is appropriate, we would expect that
the raw-scale residuals would not be significantly different from zero as we move from low
predicted values to high predicted values. Appendix Table 2 and Appendix Figure 1 provide the
results of these tests. These tests suggest that the ordered logit does not fit these data well. The
ordered logit is unable to capture the movement to dead at the higher levels of predicted
probabilities. [Given the Brant test result above, part of this is the failure of the data to satisfy
the proportionality assumption.] The generalized ordered logit and the multinomial logit behave



                                                  40
fairly well and yield similar predictions to each other. They do not appear to be systematically
biased over sub ranges of the data. Given the similarity in predicted trajectories for the
multinomial and the generalized ordered logit estimators, we decided to employ the multinomial
model, because it is more widely known. At worst the price for this may be some loss of
precision.


We also assessed each of the estimators using appropriate extensions of Pregibon’s Link Test
and the Ramsey’s RESET Test. Our specification failed for all three estimators [Not shown].


We also test the fit for the multinomial logit and the ordered logit (this command was
unavailable for the generalized ordered logit) using the Log Likelihood, AIC and Schwartz
criteria. See Appendix Table 3.


Finally we provide the regression output for the ordered logit and the generalized ordered logit in
Appendix Tables 4a and 4b. This output is analogous to the multinomial regression which is
Table 4 in the paper.
