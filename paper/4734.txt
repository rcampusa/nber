       This paper documents the changing pattern of wage differentials between state and local

government employees and their piiv ate sector counterparts during the 1979-1992 period. While

the relative wages of women employed in the two sectors changed very little during this period.

the relative wages of men employed in the state and local sector rose nearly 8%. There is

substantial heterogeneity in the changes in relative wages of public and private sector employees

during the 1980s. For highly educated workers, private sector wages rose significantly faster than

public sector wages, while for those with at most a high school education, the public sector wage

premium increased. We present both least squares and quantile regression estimates of the public

sector premium. While the level of this premium is sensitive to our choice of quantile, the

change in the premium, and the estimated pattern across skill levels, is not substantially affected

by varying the quantile.

      Total compensation for state and local government workers in the United States

rose ten percent faster than that for civilian workers between 1982 and 1993. These

statistics have sparked a public policy debate on the role of public sector pay
increases in contributing to the fiscal problems of state and local governments during

this period,' and more generally on compensation policy in the public sector.1 Much

of this debate has proceeded without regard to a voluminous literature In labor

economics, beginning with Smith (1977) and surveyed by Ehrenberg and Schwarz

(1986), that has estimated the pay premium associated with working in the public

rather than the private sector. The recent increase in average public sector
compensation is particularly difficult to interpret in light of the well-documented rise

in the labor market returns to schooling during the 1 980s, and the greater
concentration of highly-educated workers in state and local government than in the

private sector.

      Most of the previous research on pay differentials between the public and

private sectors focuses on the 1960s and 1970s, a period when public sector

employment grew rapidly and unions and collective bargaining diffused in the public

sector. Ehrenberg and Smith (1994) summarize these studies as suggesting a public

sector wage premium for women, and a small wage penalty for men. The most

recent comparison of public and private sector wages, by Katz and Krueger (1991),

tracks the evolution of relative wages during the 1979-1988 period. That study



   'Examples of recent policy discussions focusing on this issue include Cox and
Brunelli (1992), who attribute fiscal stress to rising public sector pay, and Beiman and
Heyward (1992), who argue that wages in the public sector are insignificantly
different from those in the private sector.

contrasts the state and local government wage premium for workers with different

educational attainments. It finds that poorly-educated workers enjoyed a growing

public sector wage premium during the 1980s, while better-educated workers faced

a shrinking public sector premium. These findings, which motivate the current study,

underscore the importance of dlsaggregation In considering relative public and private

sector wages.

      This paper presents new evidence on the evolution of the state and local

government wage premium for different categories of workers during the last decade.

We employ quantlle regression techniques to explore the distribution of relative wages

in the two sectors. We find that while the level of the public sector wage premium

varies significantly as one moves across quantiles of the conditional wage distribution,

the change in the public sector wage premium is relatively insensitive to the choice

of quantile.

      This paper Is divided into four sections. SectIon one summarizes recent trends

in wages and compensation In state and local government and the private sector. It

uses data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) to confirm previous estimates of

the average public sector wage premium, for men and women with different levels of

human capital. It also discusses the intertemporal consistency problems that are

created by the 1992 change In the CPS questions related to education.

      Section two presents quantlie regression evidence on both the level of, and

change In, the public sector wage premium. The empirical results suggest that

different parts of the relative wage dIstrIbution have evolved In different ways during
                                           3
the last two decades, and provide further insight on the experience of workers with

various levels of human capital. Section three reports alternative estimates of the

public sector wage premium, based on comparisons of workers in narrowly-defined

occupations with similar Job responsibilities in both sectors. Although there are
substantial disparities in the estimated public sector premia in different occupations.

the broad patterns are consistent with our earlier findings. A brief conclusion
suggests a number of directions for further work.



1. Comr,ensatipn & Waae Differentials: State & Local Government vs. Private Sector

      Two data sources are widely used to compare the relative earnings of workers

in state and local government and the private sector. These are the Employer Cost

Index (ECU. which is compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and has included

information on total compensation of state and local government employees for the

period since 1982, and the Current Population Survey (CR5), which contains

individual-level information on the wages and salaries of workers in state and local

government as well as the private sector.2 This section begins by describing the

relative compensation trends shown by the ECI data. The primary limitation of the ECI

is that it is not possible to control for worker characteristics in comparing wages and

benefits In the two sectors. The remainder of this section, and this paper, therefore



    2We combine state and local government employees into a single sector. in 1991,
states employed 4.4% (5.4%) of employed men (women), while localities accounted
for 7.6% (11.9%). The higher share of female local employees largely reflects local
employment of primary and secondary teachers.
                                          4
relies on CPS data to compare the relative public and private sector wages of workers

with similar characteristics.



1.1 RelatIve Compensation Data from the Emolovment Cost Index

       The BLS Employment Cost Index measures total compensation, wages plus the

cost of fringe benefits, for workers in the public and private sectors. These data can

be used to compare the average levels of compensation in the two sectors at a point

In time, or to compare the relative growth rates over time in compensation for a fixed

occupational mix of workers.         Table 1 presents data from the March 1993
Employment Cost Survey, which show a substantial difference between average

compensation in state and local government ($24.44 per hour) and the private sector

($16.70 per hour). Nearly two thirds of this disparity is the result of higher wages
and salaries in the public sector.

      Table 1 also presents more disaggregate information on the relative
compensation of workers in the two sectors. It divides employees into three

categories: white collar, blue collar, and service.3 Part of the disparity between the

average compensation In the public and private sectors is due to the greater

concentration of white collar workers, 68% vs. 51%. in state and local government.

Even within these broad occupational categories, however, both average



   3More than half of state and local government employees are employed in the
production of educational services. Teachers and most other workers in the education
sector are white collar employees. Police, fire, and sanitation workers are classified
as service workers.
                                          5
compensation and average wage and salary for state and local employees exceed the

comparable magnitudes for private sector workers. The absolute disparitIes are
greatest for white collar and servIce employees, who receive an average of $8.00 and

$8.50 in additional compensation In the public sector. The percentage difference In

compensation Is greatest for servIce workers, for whom total public sector
compensation Is nearly twice that in the private sector.

      ECI data are available since 1982. They show that the index of total
compensation for private sector workers rose 60.4%, or at a compound annual

growth rate of 4.3%. between June 1982 and June 1993. For state and local

government employees, the corresponding increase in compensation was 76.2%,
which corresponds to an annual growth rate of 5.1%. Most of the difference in
compensation growth rates occurred during the mld-1980s.

      The primary advantage of ECI data, relative to information in the CPS. is that

it provides information on fringe benefits as well as wages and salaries. In 1993.

beneflt costs averaged 43.8% of wage costs for public sector workers, and 40.3%

for those In the private sector. Between 1982 and 1993, wages and salaries grew

69.2% in the public sector, and 52.2% in the private sector. Thus, both wage and

non-wage compensation increased faster for public sector than private sector workers.

These summary measures nevertheless suggest that focusing exclusively on the

evolution of relative wage levels, as we do below, should capture the broad trends in

relative compensation in the two sectors.

 1.2 PublIc Sector Waoe Premia in the CPS Data

       We follow In the tradition of Smith (1977) and estimate the wage premium

 associated with state and local government employment by fitting wage equations on

 CPS data.' Our wage equation relates the logarithm of an individual's hourly wage,

 ln(wft), to a set of individual characteristics (;)that can affect marginal productivity,

 and an indicator variable (SLGOV) for working in the public sector:


                           In w, XJ3, + SLGOV,.6, + c,.                              (1)

The set of individual characteristics includes education, experience (age - education.

 6), marital status, race, residence in an SMSA, as well as an indicator variable for

part-time employment. We allow education to affect wages through a set of four

categorical variables (EDUC) for number of years of schooling, corresponding to less

than twelve years, thirteen to fifteen years, sixteen years, which typically corresponds

to completing college, and more than sixteen years. The omitted category is twelve

years of schooling, which typically corresponds to completing high school. The wage

equajion includes linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic powers of experience. In some

equations, we also include a set of control variables for ten broad occupational




   'Moore and Newman (1991) summarIze this literature, and also note that since
wage equations estimated on Individual data typically lack Information on precise job
characteristics, there may be omitted factors, such as the riskiness of some types of
public sector jobs, that contribute to wage differentials.
                                           7
classifications, such as managerial and technical, sales, or crafts.'

      We estimate (1) usIng data from the merged outgoIng rotation groups In the

CPS for the years 1979-1992. We exclude self-employed IndivIduals from our
analysis, because It is difficult to measure their wage rates. We also exclude federal

government employees, because they are neither private sector nor state and local

government employees.e We estimate equation (1) separately for men and women.

      Changes in the CPS questIonnaire with respect to education, introduced

beginning with the 1992 survey, make it impossible to estimate the same wage

equation before and after 1991. Prior to 1992, the CPS question about educational

attainment asked respondents about the number of years that they had attended

school, and whether the final year of schooling had been completed. Beginning with

the 1992 survey, the CPS questions focused on the respondent's highest grade

completed, with additional questions designed to collect information on degrees



   'The set of variables included In this wage equation is similar to that in Katz and
Krueger (1991, 1992), although our approach is somewhat different. They estimate
separate wage equations for workers in the public and private sectors, and then
predict average wages In each sector for hypothetical workers with fixed
characteristics. We estimate a single wage equation each year for all men, and all
women, and impose the same coefficient vector fl for the private and public sectors
up to a year-specific shift parameter, 6. This procedure yields a parametric estimate
of the wage premium associated with public sector employment. We further
disaggregate this premium, in some cases, Into that part attributable to differences In
the returns to schooling and experience across sectors. We always constrain the
coefficients on other individual characteristics to be equal across sectors.

    'if we include federal empioyees, and allow a separate average wage premium for
these workers, our results on the relative wages of state-local government and private
sector employees are not affected. The average wage premium for federal workers,
relative to private sector workers, is positive.
                                          8
 obtained. These questions do not elicit the same Information from respondents, and

we present information in the appendix on the distribution of educational attainment

from the two sets of surveys.'

       These survey changes Imply an inconsistent classification of Individuals across

the five categorical variables for educational attainment between 1992 and previous

years. This inconsistency will also affect the measurement of experience, which is

defined as (age - schooling - 6). In spite of these problems, we estimate the analogue

of equation (1) on the 1992 data, and we do not find any evidence of a discontinuity

in the estimated public sector wage premium between 1991 and 1992. The problem

of intertemporal inconsistency, however, leads us to focus on the 1979-1991 period

when we disaggregate the state and local government wage premium by education

and experience.

       Equation (1) allows the premium for state and local government employees (6k),

as well as other coefficients in the wage equation, to vary across years. Figure 1 a

plots the values of 6 from the estimated wage equations for men for the 1979-1992

period. The other coefficients from the estimated wage equations, which are similar

to those in other studies using CPS data, are not reported. Figure 1 shows two

curves, one corresponding to estimates of (1) without occupational controls, the other

with such controls. The standard error of each year's estimate is approximately


   7To illustrate the potential differences, consider a respondent who failed second
grade, but then successfully completed all subsequent years of schooling and received
a high school degree. This respondent would have thIrteen years of schooling
according to the pre-1992 questions, but would be recorded as having completed high
school (12 years of schooling) In the 1992 survey.
                                          9
0.005. The figure shows that after controlling for worker attributes, men employed

in the public sector earned IQU on average than their private sector counterparts in

the early 1 $8Os. The estImated magnitude of the private sector premium Is
sensitive to the inclusion of occupational controls, a point that Beimar, and Heyward

(1992) raise in the popular debate on public sector compensation. For 1980, for

example, without such controls the point estimate suggests a private sector premium

of twelve percent. With such controls, the premium is approximately sevenpercent.

      The premia shown In FIgure 1 a contrast with the earlier estimates based on

differences in average wages in the Employment Cost Index. In the early 1 990s. the

CI'S data show rough parity between the characteristic-controlled wages of men

employed in the public and private sectors. The estimates of J with and without

occupational controls display a similar pattern of compression in the differences
between public and private sector pay. While the estimates without occupation

controls suggest that public sector male workers earned 11.5% less than their private

sector counterparts In 1980, they suggest earnings of only 1.9% less in 1992. With

occupational controls, the absolute difference narrows, with a change from a 6.6%

deficit (1979) to a 0.3% premIum (1992).

      Figure lb shows the analogous estimates of the year-by-year wage premium




     We have disaggregated public sector workers into state employees and local
government employees. In 1979, men who worked for local governments earned
2.9% (0.8 standard error) less than those who worked for state governments. This
differential declined over the 1979-1991 period, to a local government penalty of
0.6% (0.9) by 1991. For women, local governments also pay less well than state
governments. The pay penalty changes from 3.7% In 1979 to 4.2% in 1991.
                                          10
for women employed in state and local government. Both the level of the wage

premium, and the time pattern of this premium, are very different than those for men

In Figure la. Without occupational controls, the public sector appears to pay a
oremlum of between three and five percent to women employees during this period.

With occupational controls, the average wage premium Is statistically indistinguishable

from zero in the early 1 980s and early 1 990s, although it rises slightly, to a premium

of one and a half percent, In the mid-1980s.



1 .3 Public Sector Waae Premia Stratified by Educational Attainment

      Katz and Krueger (1991) found substantial differences between the public

sector wage premia for those with high school and college degrees. We present

further evidence on the link between worker attributes and the public sector wage

premium by interacting the set of indicator variables for five ranges of educational

attainment (EDUC,J with the Indicator variable for working in the state and local
sector. This yields the equation:

                                    S
                     In w1 = ,çp, + E SLGOV,sEDUC*6, +         €,.                 (2)

The set of coefficients 5,1 measure the public sector wage premium for each
educational group.

      To avoid the problems of intertemporal inconsistency In the CPS education

variable between 1992 and earlier years, we estimate equation (2) for 1979, 1985,

and 1991. The upper panel presents estImates of 6,, for men, and illustrates Important
                                           11

differences in the level and evolution of the public sector wage premium across

educational groups. For men with a hIgh school education or less, there was a public

sector pay penalty at the beginning of the 1 980s. but It largely disappeared during this

decade. The premium for such employees with a high school degree was -.1 25 In

1979. but It was positive, +.021, in 1991. This reflects a net change of more than

fourteen percent In the public sector premium. For men with college degrees, the

public sector pay penalty also declIned, but did not disappear, during the 1980s. In

1979, men with a college degree faced a public sector pay penalty of .130. It
declined to .077 by 1 991. The public sector wage penalty for men with post-college

education did not follow the pattern for those with college degrees or less education.

It widened by 4.7% from 1979 to 1985, and then remained constant between 1985

and 1991. There was consequently a net exDansion In the public sector pay penalty

for post-college educated men during the 1980s.

       The lower panel of Table 2 presents estimates of 4 for women. The pattern

of changes in the public sector wage premia across educational classes resembles that

for men, although the levels are different. High school educated women experienced

an Increase in their public sector pay premium from .016 In 1979 to .073 in 1991.

Although high school educated women did not face the public sector pay penalty that

high school educated men faced at the end of the 1970s, they did share in their


     °Katz and Krueger (1991) limIt their analysis to those with either 12 years or at
least 16 years of schooling. They report relatively little change, or a slight Increase,
in the public sector pay penalty for men with college or post-college education during
the 1979-1987 period. Table 2 shows there are differences in the relative wage
experience of those with Just 16, and more than 16, years of schooling.
                                           12

relative public sector wage appreciation. For highly-educated women, the public
sector wage premium of the late 1 970s largely disappeared by 1991. A woman with

a college degree was predicted to earn 9.2% more In the public than In the private

sector In 1979, but no more In 1991. For women with post-college educatIon, the

estimated wage premium declined from 14.4% to 3.4%.



2. Exoiprina Public and Private Sector Wace Distributions

       The recent decline in the real wages of workers with relatively low skill levels,

documented for example by Bound and Johnson (1992), Katz and Murphy (1992).

and Murphy and Welch (1992), has heightened interest in the lower tails of the both

the private and public sector wage distributions in the United States. The possibility

that political factors constrain the pay of highly-skilled public sector employees, which

is discussed by Joskow, Rose. and Shephard (1993) and Ritchie and Gold (1992),

suggests the value of examining the upper tails of the distributions as well. Katz and

Krueger (1991, 1992) discuss a number of factors that may contribute to greater

rigidity overtime, as well as less dispersion at a point in time, in public sector wages

than their private sector counterparts. in this section, we present new evidence on

the distribution of relative wages in the public and private sectors.

      There are three sources of differences in the public and private sector wage

distributions: differences in the distributions of worker characteristics in the two

sectors, differences In the returns to various worker charateristics across sectors, and
                                           13
differences In the distributions of unexplained wage residuals across sectors)° To

explore the distribution of human capital attributes In the two sectors, we computed

the distribution of predicted wages in each sector using the coefficients from a wage

equation estimated only for private sector employees in 1991. These distributions for

men and women are shown In Figure 2. For both men and women, the distribution

of predicted hourly wages In the public sector is right-shifted relative to the analogous

private sector wage distribution, Indicating that there are proportionally more workers

with high levels of education and experience in the pubilc than in the private sector.

      The regression coefficients in Table 2 describe the average pubiic sector wage

premium for individuals with different leveis of education. They do not consider the

possibility that the distribution of actual wages around their predicted values differs

across sectors. in fact, both the unconditional and conditional wage distributions in

the public sector are more compressed than those in the private sector. To Illustrate

this, we estimated separate wage equations for public and private sector workers,

without occupational controls, using the 1979 and 1991 CPS data sets. The
estimates for men show that for 1991, o = .440, while u = .410. For women,

the analogous estimates are        = .414 and g = .387. There has been relatively

little change in the relative dispersion of the public and private sector wage
distributions for men, although there Is some evidence of growing private relative to




    '°Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993) decompose changes in the wage distribution
Into these three components.
                                            14
 public sector dispersion for women."

       Estimating the public sector wage premium is complicated by the presence of

 different 'ariances in the wage distributions in the public and private sectors. To
 Illustrate this, consider a case in which the mean and median wages in the two

 sectors, conditional on worker attributes, are Identical, but the private sector has

 greater wage dispersion. While comparisons of the mean or median conditional wage

 will show no public sector premium, comparisons of higher quantiies will show a

 public sector pay penalty, while lower quantiles will show a public sector premium.

       Similar concerns about differences in the variance of conditional wage
distributions between the union and non-union sectors led Chamberlain (1994) to

study the union wage premium at various quantiles. Buchinsky (1994a,b} has

developed related arguments for applying quantile-based methods to studying the
returns to education and the changing distribution of private sector wages more

generally. We follow this approach and estimate quantiie regression models
corresponding to equations (1) and (2) above.

      We assume that the qth quantiie of the conditional wage distribution is a linear

function of individual attributes (X1j:


                    Quanç( In w, / )t') =        + SLGOV*64,.                    (3)

Koenker and Bassett (1978) demonstrate that quantile regression models can be

estimated by finding the vector       JJ that minimizes

   "in 1979, for men, u = .408 and a = .374, whIle for women, c = .362
and a, = .344.

      FigureS presents estimates of      from quantile regressions with q = .10, .25,

.501.75. and .90 forthe years 1979-1991. The corresponding point estimates, along

with OLS estimates, are shown in Table 3. The estimated private sector wage

premium for men, estimated by median regression, is about two percent greater than

that estimated by ordinary least squares. At q = .10. the estimated private sector

premium for the early 1 980s is negligible, even though the OLS estimates suggest an

11 % wage disparity between state and local government and the private sector.

Similarly, the results for q = .90 show a public sector wage disadvantage of more than

twenty percent in the early 1 980s, declining to eight percent by 1991. In most years.

the absolute difference between the wage premium estimated with median regression

and that with q = .90 Is smaller than that between the median regression and q = .10.

      The quantile regression results for women are similar to those for men. The

median regression results are similar to the least squares coefficients, and the level

of the estimated public sector wage premIum depends on the value of q, but the time

series pattern of wage premia Is similar for most quantiles. There Is one exception:




    '2Chamberlaln (1994) proposes an alternative minImum-distance estimator for
quantile regression models, which requires stratifying the data Into cells, computing
cell quantiles, and then fitting a conditional quantile function to these cell quantlles.
Where feasible, we estimated the quantlie regression models presented below by this
method, with results quite similar to those we report, which are based on the linear
programming algorithm.
                                           16

the low-quantile estimates of the wage premium display an upward trend during the

 1979-1991 perIod. The median regression estimate of the public sector wage
premium In 1991 (.039) Is similar to that in 1979 (.041). For the lowest quantile

(q = .10), however, the 1991 premIum (.092) is substantially greater than the 1979

value (.061). The estimated premium at q.10 also widens more during the mid-

1 980s, to .137 In 1988, than the premium estimated using either OLS or median

regression.

      The quantile regression results suggest two findings. First, the yf of the

estimated public sector wage premium is sensitive to the choice of quantile. There

Is a much smaller penalty associated with working in the public sector at low than at

high quántiles. The pattern of quantlie regression coefficients for the state and local

wage premium resembles Chamberlain's (1994) findings for union wage effects, with

larger positive effects at lower quantiles. Second, in spite of our finding regarding the

level of the public sector pay premium, however, the time series oattem of state and

local government wage premla from the quantile regressions tracks that from the least

squares regressions very closely, regardless of which value of q we choose.

      We do not report standard errors for each of the coefficient estimates in Table

3, because these standard errors are roughly constant from year to year for each

quantile. We do present the average of the twelve estimated standard errors for each

set of quantile coefficients.'3 These standard errors are computed from the analytic



   "In a typical column in Table 3, more than half of the estimated year-specific
standard errors equal the average standard error reported In the bottom row.
                                          17

varlánce-covariance matrix, V(81) (X'Xr' (X'WW'X)(X'X)', where W = diag[(q l,>

+ (1-q)9,<0)/fjO)1 and fjO) is a kernel estimator of the density of the residual
distribution at zero.'4 The standard errors vary relatively little across years. but do

vary across quantiles within each year. The regression coefficients corresponding to

more extreme quantlies are estimated less precisely than those closer to the median.

      Several recent studies, for example Rogers (1992), have considered the

estimation of quantile regression standard errors, and compared the performance of

this analytical procedure with alternatives such as bootstrap estimation. We also

calculated bootstrap standard errors for some of our quantlie coefficient estimates.

Table 4 reports the 6 coefficients, and both sets of standard errors, for the 1979

and 1991 samples. The results show that the analytic and bootstrap standard errors

are very similar for both years. In no case do the two approaches yield differences

in the estimated standard errors of more than .001, which corresponds to less than

a 25% difference for virtually all coefficients.

      There remains a question of whether our quantile regression results are solely

driven by differences in conditional variances across sectors. Applying a result In

Chamberlain (1994), If the conditional log wage distributIons for the private and public

sectors are respectively N(XI8V, o,,) and N(6 + Xhfi1 oj, then the estimated state

and local wage premium at the qth quantile will equalS + X,(8 -fl,,,) + q'(o - c,,j.



   "The density f4(O) Is estImated by rankIng residuals, finding the residuals with
ranks N = qN - N'5 and N = qN + N6, and calculatIng [N•• - EN412N6. This
procedure Is modified when qN + N' > N. or qN-1t5 < 0. Rogers (1992) discusses
this algorIthm In more detail.
                                          18
Our estimated differences In the conditional variances across sectors are not large

enough to explain the results in Table 3 if ft = fi. The differential variance
contribution to the difference between fl and Po. Is .80 •        - o-), or less than .03

for both men and women. The actual 1991 difference In these coefficients is .157

(men) and .135 (women). This suggests, as our estimates of 4 by educational level

confirm, that there are differences in the coefficient vector ft across sectors.

      We also apply quantile methods to study the public sector wage premium
conditional on various levels of educational attainment, and conditional on various

levels of experience. The results of estimating equation (2) by quantile methods are

presented in Table 5. The results show that there is relatively little difference across

quantiles In the 1979-91 chanae in the public sector premium. The level of the public

sector wage premium, however, differs across quantiles in the same way as in Table

3. For those with less than a high school degree, there are also differences in the

changes in the wage premla at different quantiles, but there is no apparent pattern.

For those at high quantiles (q     .90), the increase In the public sector premium is

smaller than that for others in the distribution.

      The lower panel of Table 5 presents results for women analogous to those in

the upper panel for men. The most striking examples of differences in the chance In

the public sector premium as we vary the quantile value are found for women with

college or post-graduate degrees. For those with a college degree, the public sector

pay premium in the 10th percentile narrowed from 13.6% (1979) to 10.3% (1991).

For those In the 90th percentile, however, the pay penalty expanded substantially,
                                          19
from -1.4% in 1979 to -11.0% In 1991. A similar pattern Is observed for those with

post-graduate degrees.
      We also explored the distribution of public sector wage premia for workers with

different levels of experience. Instead of the quartlc equation In experience, which Is

Included In the ; matrix of equatIons (1) and (2), we stratified CPS respondents Into

four experience groups: those with less than 11 years of experience, 11-20 years, 21-

30 years, and more than 30 years. We then Interacted these four indicator variables

(EXPERJ with an Indicator for working in state and local government, to measure the

public sector premium for workers at different experience levels. This yields the

following wage equation:


                   In w, = X1p, + ESLGOV,*EXPER,s8, + E.                          (5)




      Table 6 shows the results of estimating (5) by quantile regression. For men,

there is no evidence that the level of the public sector wage prenlia depends

significantly on experience, or that the pattern of such premia across experience

categories changed substantially during the 1 980s. For women, however, the results

do suggest that those with more experience fared relatively better than those who

were recently hired in the public sector. For female employees with less than ten

years of experience, the public sector pay premium narrowed from 5.5% to 1.8%

between 1979 and 1991. For those with more than thirty years of experience, the

premium grew from 7.2% to 8.5%. There Is some evidence, based on comparison
                                          20
of various quantiie results, that high-experience women at the bottom of the
conditional wage distribution recorded larger relative gains than those elsewhere In the

distributIon. For men, there is some evidence that the change in the public sector

premium, conditional on experience, depended on their location In the conditional

wage distribution. For those with less than tenyears of experience, the public sector

pay premium grew much more for those near the top of the wage dIstribution than

those at lower strata.



3. Public and Private Sector Waces in Soecific OccuDatlons

      Our analysIs so far has compared Individuals with similar human capital

attributes, but we have not considered occupational characteristics, such as the

riskiness of some public safety jobs, that might lead to a pay differentials for public

sector work. To address such differences, in this section we present detailed
comparisons of relative public and private sector wages for several occupational

categories with substantial employment in both sectors.

      We begin by pooling adjacent years of CPS data, for 1979/80 and 1990/91.

to increase our effective sample size.'5 For each of these data sets, we then select

respondents in the various occupational categories, estimate a wage equation similar


  '5Given the CPS sampling pattern, which surveys Individuals for four consecutive
months, leaves them out of the survey for eight months, and then includes them again
for another four months, half of the Individuals who participate In the survey in a
given month of one year will will also be surveyed In the same month the next year.
To avoid spurious double-counting of these individuals, we exclude the 1980
responses of such Individuals in our 1979/80 data set, and the 1990 responses of
such Individuals in our 1990/91 data set.
                                         21
to (1) above, and report the estimated value of           where subscript o denotes

occupation and subscript t corresponds to either 1979/80 or 1990/91. The resulting

coefficient estimates broadly confirm our earlier evidence that the public sector pay

premium is most pronounced in traditional low-skill occupations.

      The upper panel of Table 7 presents results for men in several occupations that

are common in both the public and private sectors. For orderlies, our estimates

suggest a public sector pay premium of 17.3% in both 1979/80 and 1990/91. For

cleaners, the pay premium widens from 2.1% (1979/80) to 9.1% (1990/91), and for

truck drivers, a substantial pay penalty of 19.1% In 1979/80 is erased during the

subsequent ten years, with an estimated, but statistically insignificant, pay penalty

of 1.7% In 1990191. For the highest skill occupation that we consider, doctors, the

point estimates suggest a growing public sector pay penalty but we cannot reject the

null hypothesis of pay equality across sectors for either 1979/80 or 1990/91.

      The last two rows in the first sub-panel of Table 7 present results for teachers.

We include special education and pre-klndergarten teachers in our classification of

primary and secondary teachers. Post-secondary teachers are professors and

instructors In universities, community colleges, and other institutions of higher

learning. For primary and secondary teachers, the results suggest a substantial public

sector premium: 15.4% in 1979/80, 16.8% in 1990/91 - Interpreting these findings

Is clouded, however, by the difficulty of comparing public and private schools.
Because private schools may offer less difficult work environments than public

schools, part of the estimated public sector premium may reflect differences in Job
                                           22
characteristics. Private schools also typically require fewer credentials, beyond a

college degree, than their public sector counterparts. For post-secondary teachers,

we estimate a public sector pay premium of between six and seven percent In both

data sets.

      The lower panel of Table 7 presents parallel evidence for women employed in

similar occupations in the public and private sectors. The results for both orderlies

and cleaners confirm the earlier findings for men, and there is weak evidence, based

on the results for cleaners, receptlonlsts, secretaries, and typists, of a growing public

sector pay premium during this period. For nurses, a relatively high-skill occupation,

we are not able to reject the null hypothesis of equal pay In the two sectors.

      The results for female teachers differ somewhat from the results for men. For

primary and secondary teachers, the point estimates suggest a substantial public

sector pay premium, with weak evidence of a widening pay premium over the twelve

years we consider. For post-secondary teachers, the estimates suggest that a

substantial pay premium in 1979/80 largely disappeared by the end of our sample.



4. Conclusions

      This paper presents new evidence on the evolution of the pay differential

between state and local government and the private sector during the 1980s. It

emphasizes changes In the distribution as well as the average level of this pay

differential. For men, the results suggest that a substantial private sector premium

at the beginning of the 1 980s was largely eradicated during the 1979-1992 period.
                                          23
For women, there is little evidence of a change In the relationship between public and

private sector wages. Most of this analysis has focused on wages and salaries, usIng

data from the Current Population Survey.

      We have not considered the potential selection biases that plague studies of

inter-sectoral wage differences, whether between the public and private sectors orthe

union and non-union sectors. This Is because we have not found variables that are

likely to affect the probability of public sector employment, but not public sector
wages, and that could consequently be used to identify selection models.

      One natural avenue for extending this work would involve more detailed

consideration of fringe benefits in the public and private sectors. Public sector
workers are more likely to be covered by defined benefit pension plans, and are more

likely to receive a number of other fringe benefits than their private sector
counterparts. There is little systematic evidence, however, on how the value of such

fringes for comDarable workers in the oublic and Drivate sectors has changed over

time. Moreover, this paper has not considered the possibility that the availability of

benefit packages changed in different ways for different classes of workers, for

example those with college degrees versus those with high school degrees.

      A second issue we have not explored Is the relative contribution of changes in

public sector wages, and changes In prIvate sector wages, to movements in the

public-private pay differential. Evidence from previous studies of private sector pay,

however, suggests that much of the change In relative wages for those with low

educational attainment Is due to worsening wage prospects in the private sector,
                                           24
combined with less pronounced changes in public sector real wages.

      A final direction for further analysis is the link between fiscal institutions, such

as balanced budget amendments or expenditure limitation laws, and the evolution of

public sector pay. Compensation costs account for nearly two thirds of expenditures

by state and local governments in the United States, and to the extent such laws

affect public spending, they are likely to affect wages and/or employment In the public

sector. Research directed at this issue is currently underway.

       Appendix: Changes in CPS Coding of Education. Pro- and Post-1992

      In 1992. the Bureau of Labor Statistics changed the Current Population Survey

questions concerning educational attainment. Prior to 1992, the questions focused

on number of years of school attended, and whether the respondent had completed

the final year of schooling. Beginning In 1992. the survey asked about the highest

arade of school attended. The modified questionnaire also grouped some potential

responses on years of schooling, such as grades 1-4 and 9rades 5-6.

      These changes makes It Impossible to estimate the same wage equation on CPS

data before 1992. and for 1992 and subsequent years. Jaeger (1993) presents some

evidence on the relative performance of wage equations estimated with the two sets

of educational variables. In this appendix, we present summary information on the

dIstribution of responses to the two sets of surveys, and the pattern of responses for

those who were included in both the 1991 and 1992 Current Population Surveys.

      Table A-i shows the distribution of responses across education categories for

respondents in the 1990, 1991, and 1992 Current Population Surveys. The pre-1992

respondents are classified by number of years of education completed, while the 1992

respondents are categorized by highest grade attended. There are two differences of

note. First, the fraction of 1990/1991 respondents who are classified as having
twelve years of schooling Is more than two percent greater than that in 1 992. This

Is offset by a higher fraction of the 1992 respondents who appear to have attended

some college, but do not have a college degree. Second, the 1992 survey reveals a

higher fraction of respondents with sIxteen years of schooling, and a lower fraction

with post-graduate degrees.
                                           38
       To provide further Information on the nature of the response changes, Table A-

2 reports a cross-tabulation of responses to education questions for respondents who

were in the Current Population Survey in two consecutive years. The column labelled

1990/1991 shows the degree of agreement between responses to the same survey

instrument, pertaining to the same individual, In two consecutive years. For most

levels of educational attainment, the agreement rates are greater than 95%, wIth the

notable exception of the 11 or 12 years of schooling (no high school degree)
category. The incidence of identical responses Is 94% for those completing 12 years

of high school, and 97% for those with 16 years of schooling.

      Table A-2 also shows the degree of agreement in education responses for

individuals who were surveyed with different Instruments in 1991 and 1992. The

Incidence of identicai responses for those with 1991 responses shwoing fewer than

twelve years of education completed is less than 70%. Since the 1990/1991 cross-

tabulation suggests there is relatively little pure measurement error in these questions,

these results suggest substantive differences in the responses to the two sets of

questions. There is a higher degree of agreement in responses for those who

completed high school, with 90% of the 1991 respondents in this category classified

the same way in 1992. For those recorded as having 16 years of schooling in 1991,

however, only 79% were coded as having a B.A. degree in 1992.

Notes: Match rates are for male respondents who were in the fourth month rotation
In the earlier year and the eight month rotation of the second year listed. Individuals
were matched based on household identification number, age, race and relation to
reference person. In both 1990/1991 and 1991/1992, about half of all possible
respondents matched. Percentages listed are the match rates of the latter year
category with the earlier year category. For example, the number listed for 16 and
BA degree is the percent of respondents who responded that they had a BA in 1992,
and who also responded they had 16 years of education. (This entry is nQl the
percent of people who had 16 years of education who have a bachelor's degree.)
