Is American Pet Health Care (Also) Uniquely Inefficient?

                                         ABSTRACT

We document four similarities between American human healthcare and American pet care: (i)
rapid growth in spending as a share of GDP over the last two decades; (ii) strong income-
spending gradient;(iii) rapid growth in the employment of healthcare providers; and (iv) similar
propensity for high spending at the end of life. We speculate about possible implications of these
similar patterns in two sectors that share many common features but differ markedly in
institutional features, such as the prevalence of insurance and of public sector involvement.

Consumer Expenditure Survey Data (Figures 1 and 2)
Figures 1 and 2 use data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) from 1996-2012. Prior
to 1996 the format of the CEX files differs substantially; 2012 was the latest available year at the
time we began this project.
The CEX conducts interviews with households over 5 quarters – the first quarter is a baseline
interview, while the remaining 4 quarters record expenditures (“consumption”) each quarter.
These four quarters do not necessarily conform to a calendar year. We aggregate quarters within
a calendar year. Observations of the same household across calendar years are treated separately.
The unit of observation is therefore a household-year. When households do not appear in the
survey for all four quarters of a calendar year, we use the available quarters and annualize the
total to obtain annual expenditure levels.
We analyze data on four categories of expenditures: pet care, (human) health care, housing, and
entertainment. Human health care includes the household’s (out of pocket) spending on health
insurance premiums, physician, and hospital services. Housing includes spending on mortgages,
rent, property taxes, and maintenance costs. Entertainment includes spending on recreational
activities and equipment, and television subscriptions and equipment.
Our measure of pet care is based on three expenditure categories: (i) pet purchase and medical
supplies; (ii) Veterinary services; and (iii) pet services except Veterinary services. These sub-
categories account, respectively, for 50, 38, and 12 percent of total pet care spending. Of the two
main categories, veterinary services are naturally part of pet health care, while some, but not all
of the “pet purchase and medical supplies” category is too. It is unclear what is covered by the
smaller “pet services except veterinary services” category. In our main analysis we aggregate all
three sub-categories. In Appendix Figures 1 and 2 below we replicate Figures 1 and 2 in the main
text limiting spending on pets to just the “Veterinary services” category; the results are
qualitatively quite similar (the sample remains the same; a pet owner is still defined as a
household with positive spending on pets, regardless of whether the spending is on veterinary
services).
We start with the full CEX sample in every quarter, omitting only households (less than one
percent) where the head of the household is younger than 18 or older than 90. This results in a
sample of 240,390 household-years. We further limit all analyses to household-years with
positive expenditure on pets, which is our proxy for pet ownership. About 35 percent of
household-years are included as “pet owners,” so that our final sample size is 84,341 household-
years, covering 57,346 unique households. Appendix Table 1 below compares demographics and
expenditure on the main categories between our baseline sample and the entire CEX sample.


                                                 1
When we analyze expenditure by income in Figure 2, we categorize household-years by the
household income bucket they report. Household income in the CEX is categorized into <20,000,
20,000 – 29,999, 30,000 – 39,999, 40,000 – 49,999, 50,000 – 69,999, >=70,000. The income
category is missing for 8% of the observations.

US County Business Patterns (Figure 3)
We use annual data from 1996-2013 from the County Business Patterns (CBP) published by the
US Census. We aggregated employment data across standard industry classification codes (the
North American Industry Classification System, or NAICS) to the sector level. We analyze total
employment as well as employment in two specific sectors: physicians and veterinarians.
Physician employment is defined as employment in hospitals, physician offices, dentist offices,
and all other health care professional offices. Veterinarian employment is defined as employment
at a veterinary office; both veterinary and physician employment measures will therefore include
support staff in those offices. We sum employment across counties to arrive at national, annual
totals.
The CBP defines an establishment as “a single physical location at which business is conducted
or services or industrial operations are performed.” An establishment is not necessarily
equivalent to a company or enterprise, which may consist of one or more establishments. A
single-unit company owns or operates only one establishment. A multi-unit company owns or
operates two or more establishments. The series excludes data on self-employed individuals,
employees of private households, railroad employees, agricultural production employees, and
most government employees.


End of life care (Figure 4)
The data on end of life care for dogs come from a large veterinarian hospital in California. Using
information on billed drugs, they identified animals who were treated for lymphoma between
2011 and 2014 (the period for which electronic billing data was available). We limit our analysis
to dogs, which account for 80 percent of their patients. We received data for a random sample of
300 dogs who had received a biopsy, which is a diagnostic test for lymphoma, among other
things. Of these 300 dogs, 44 were identified as having received chemotherapy, and we therefore
code them as having lymphoma. Of those 44, we have 23 dogs who died during the period of our
data and for whom we observe billing claims for at least 12 months before death. Our analysis of
end of life spending pertains to these 23 dead dogs. For those dogs, we obtained detailed
information about their claim-by-claim bills, and use this to create a monthly measure of total
spending for each of the 12 months prior to death.
The data on end of life care for humans is based on claims data from Traditional Medicare. We
selected a random sample of 125 patients who were diagnosed with Lymphoma latest by the
penultimate year of life (i.e. if the patient died in 2008, she was diagnosed with Lymphoma by
2007 or earlier), and who died in December of a year between 2008 and 2011. Patients were
identified as having Lymphoma based on ICD9 diagnoses codes in the 200xx (Lymphosarcoma
and reticulosarcoma) or 202xx (Other malignant neoplasms of lymphoid and histiocytic tissue)
families. These two groups are used by the AHRQ Condition Classification System (CCS) to
define Lymhoma. For these 125 patients, we measure monthly total Medicare spending in each
of the 12 months prior to death. In both cases (dogs and Medicare), we observe claims for the


                                                3
last 12 months of life. The spending values span several different years and hence the monthly
values are inflation adjusted to be in 2012 dollars using the CPI-U series.
