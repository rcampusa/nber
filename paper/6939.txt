I.     Introduction

       Every major proposal for national tobacco legislation introduced during the past two

years called for significant increases in the price of cigarettes as a way to discourage teens from

smoking. The original June 20, 1997 agreement between the tobacco industry and states'

Attorneys General called for the costs of the settlement to be passed on to smokers in the form of

higher prices, which would have increased cigarette prices by 62-cents per pack, or more

(Federal Trade Commission, 1997). Senator McCain's proposal included a $1.10 increase to be

phased in over five years while Senator Kennedy proposed a $1.50 increase phased in more

rapidly, with both calling for adjustments to keep pace with inflation. Larger increases of up to

$2.00 per pack were proposed by various public health groups.

       A number of issues concerning the effectiveness and appropriateness of using large price

increases to discourage youth tobacco use were raised in the debate over these proposals and

ultimately led to their defeat. In addition, opponents of the price hikes suggested that even if

they did succeed in discouraging youth from smoking, large cigarette price increases would lead

youths to substitute towards other substances, particularly marijuana. While there is little, if any,

empirical evidence that this type of substitution would occur, there is considerable evidence to

suggest the opposite could result. That is, in addition to reducing youth smoking, higher

cigarette prices could reduce other substance use among youth. For example, cigarettes have

long been thought to be a “gateway drug,” in that early experimentation with cigarettes

encourages youths to try marijuana and other illicit substances (i.e. Kandel, 1975; Ellickson,

Hays and Bell, 1992; Kandel and Yamaguchi 1993). Other research has concluded that cigarette

smoking is a significant predictor of both the probability and frequency of other drug use (i.e.

Clayton and Ritter, 1985; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1988; Henningfield,




                                                  2
Clayton, and Pollin, 1990). For example, citing data from the 1985 National Household Survey

on Drug Abuse, the 1988 Surgeon General Report states that teens who smoke are three times

more likely to use alcohol, eight times more likely to use marijuana, and twenty-two times more

likely to use cocaine (USDHHS, 1988). Using the same data, Henningfield and his colleagues

found that young daily cigarette smokers were 114 times more likely to have used marijuana

heavily (11 times or more in the past 30 days). This suggests that cigarettes and other substances

are complements for one another and that higher cigarette prices, by discouraging smoking

among youth, could also lead to significant reductions in youth and adult drinking and illicit drug

use.

       The fact that policy makers are considering the ripple effects of policies targeting one

substance on the use of other substances is a major leap forward in the area of substance control

policy. However, the economic research exploring the relationship between the demands for

different drugs that is needed to inform these discussions is sorely lacking. This paper begins to

address the gap in existing research by examining the relationship between the contemporaneous

demands for cigarettes and marijuana in a nationally representative sample of eighth, tenth, and

twelfth grade students from the 1992 through 1994 Monitoring the Future Study. In particular,

this paper examines the impact of cigarette prices, tobacco control policies, marijuana policies,

and alcohol prices on youth cigarette smoking and marijuana use. Estimates generated from two

part models indicate that higher cigarette prices, in addition to reducing youth smoking, will

significantly reduce the average level of marijuana used by current users. They further suggest

that higher cigarette prices will reduce the likelihood that youths use marijuana, although these

findings are not significant at conventional levels. Elasticities calculated from short and long

form specifications suggest that a 10% increase in the price of cigarettes would reduce the




                                                 3
probability of using marijuana between 3.4%-7.3% and decrease the average level of marijuana

use by regular users between 3.6%-8.4%.



II. Literature Review

       In part because of the lack of good data on the prices for and use of illicit drugs,

economists have contributed little to the debate over the relationship between cigarette smoking

and other drug use. To date, only three studies have analyzed the economic relationship between

the demands for cigarettes and marijuana. In the only published analysis, Pacula (1998a) used

data from the 1984 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to estimate the current

demand for alcohol and marijuana for a sample of young adults between the ages 19 and 26.

Although she did not estimate a demand equation for cigarettes directly, she included the current

state cigarette tax as an additional regressor in her models in order to identify whether a

significant cross-price effect exists. Her analyses also included state and federal beer taxes, the

minimum legal purchase age for alcoholic beverages, an indicator for decriminalized states, and

the crime per officer ratio, which was her proxy for the monetary price of marijuana. Pacula

found that cigarette taxes had no significant effect on the current likelihood of using marijuana or

the conditional quantity consumed. She reached the opposite conclusion, however, in later work

that focused on the intertemporal relationship between alcohol and marijuana using data from the

1983 and 1984 NLSY (Pacula, 1998b). In this analysis, which controlled for persistence in the

consumption of both drugs over time, Pacula found that cigarette prices have a negative and

statistically significant effect on the probability of using marijuana, suggesting that cigarettes and

marijuana are economic complements for young adults. She also found that higher past prices of

cigarettes have a negative and significant effect on the probability of using marijuana, supporting




                                                  4
an intertemporal complementary relationship between the two substances. Although much of

the inconsistency in findings across these two studies can be attributed to differences in controls

and model specification, this variation in findings is still unsettling.1

         In a working paper using more recent data, Farrelly, et al (1998) estimated the decision to

use alcohol, tobacco and marijuana for a nationally representative sample of youths (ages 12 to

20) and young adults (ages 21 to 30) from the 1990-1996 National Household Surveys on Drug

Abuse. Measures of the real price of beer, the real price of cigarettes, marijuana possession

arrests over total arrests and cannabis eradication (used as a proxy for the monetary price of

marijuana) were included in probit specifications of the probability of using each substance,

making it possible to analyze cross-price effects. They further controlled for unobserved time-

invariant state-specific effects that may be correlated with policy measures by including a series

of dummy variables for each state. Their results indicated that tobacco, marijuana and alcohol

are economic complements for youth. Higher cigarette prices decreased the probability of using

marijuana, as did higher beer prices. The calculated cross-price participation elasticities of

cigarette prices and alcohol prices on marijuana use were –0.49 and –1.05, respectively. Cross-

price effects for adults, however, were insignificant although the signs indicated a weak

complementary relationship.

         This paper builds on this limited econometric research by further investigating the

relationship between the demands for tobacco and marijuana among youths. Unlike previous

studies, this study examines the prevalence and average level of use of cigarettes and marijuana

among a nationally representative sample of eighth, tenth and twelfth graders. This age

  In the contemporaneous analysis (Pacula, 1998a), the natural logarithm of the state tax was employed, which
significantly reduced the variation in this measure of price and reduced its expected predictive power. The later
analysis (Pacula, 1998b) entered the state average price of cigarettes, inclusive of taxes, linearly into the model.

group is particularly important for examining substance use behavior since most youths initiate

use during these years. Findings from this study can help inform the current debate over the

potential unintended consequences of raising cigarette prices.



III.   Data and Methods

       The data on youth cigarette smoking and marijuana use employed in this study come

from the 1992 through 1994 Monitoring the Future Surveys of eighth, tenth and twelfth grade

students. The Monitoring the Future Survey is an annual school-based survey focused on youth

perceptions of, attitudes towards, and use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. The survey was

developed and is conducted by the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the University of

Michigan. Each year since 1975, ISR has surveyed a nationally representative sample of high

school seniors; beginning in 1991, comparable surveys of eighth and tenth grade students have

been conducted. Detailed information on the survey design and sampling methods is available

in Johnston, et al. (1998). Given the focus of the surveys on youth substance use, great care is

taken to ensure that the youths' responses are reliable and valid. See Johnston and O’Malley

(1985) for a detailed discussion of validity of these data.

       Two measures of youth cigarette smoking are constructed from the survey data. First, a

dichotomous indicator of smoking participation is created from the answer to the question: “How

frequently have you smoked cigarettes during the past 30 days?” Anyone reporting a positive

amount is defined as a current smoker while those reporting having not smoked at all in the past

thirty days are considered nonsmokers. Second, a quasi-continuous measure of average daily

cigarette consumption is constructed by assigning the median value of the categorical responses

provided to that same question. The possible responses (and their assigned values) include: less




                                                  6
than one cigarette per day (0.5); one to five cigarettes per day (3); about one-half pack per day

(10); about one pack per day (20); about one and one-half packs per day (30); and two packs or

more per day (45).

         Similar measures of marijuana use are constructed based on the responses to the question:

“On how many occasions (if any) have you used marijuana (grass, pot) or hashish (hash, hash

oil) during the last 30 days?”2 A dichotomous indicator of current marijuana use is set equal to

one for youth reporting one or more occasions and zero otherwise. A quasi-continuous measure

reflecting the frequency of use in the past month is constructed by assigning midpoint values to

the categorical responses as follows: 1-2 occasions (1.5), 3-5 occasion (4), 6-9 occasion (7.5),

10-19 occasions (15), 20-39 occasions (30), and 40 or more (40). While neither of these quasi-

continuous measures is ideal for capturing total amount consumed, they are helpful in gauging

the impact of price and public policies on average daily cigarette consumption and the frequency

of marijuana use among teens.

         A simple cross-tabulation of current cigarette and marijuana users obtained from the

1992, 1993 and 1994 surveys is reported in Table One. Less than one-quarter of the respondents

report using either of these substances in the past thirty days, with 22.7% reporting cigarette

smoking and 10.9% reporting marijuana use. While the majority of cigarette smokers (65.8%)

smoked only cigarettes, over seventy percent (71.0%) of marijuana users also report current

cigarette smoking.

         In addition to the information on youth smoking and marijuana use, detailed

socioeconomic and demographic information is also collected in the surveys. A variety of

2
 On Form 1 of the high school senior surveys, this question is broken out so that information pertaining to the use of
marijuana can be identified separately from the use of hashish. Forms 2-6, however, ask only the question shown
above. To make the responses compatible, the responses to the separate questions in form 1 are combined. If the




                                                          7
potential determinants of youth cigarette smoking and marijuana use are constructed from these

data, including: indicators of gender (male or female), race (white, African-American, and

other), current grade (eight, tenth or twelfth), marital status (married or engaged versus being

single), parental education (less than a high school education, high school graduate, and more

than a high school education for mother and father separately), family structure (live alone, live

with mother, live with father, both parents present, or other living arrangement), mother’s work

status while growing up (full-time, part-time, or stay at home), the presence of siblings, living in

a urban or rural area, and frequency of participation in religious services (no participation,

infrequent participation and frequent participation), and continuous measures of age, average

weekly income from all sources (employment, allowances and other), and average number of

hours worked weekly. Sample means and standard errors for these variables are provided in

Table Two.

         Location-specific price and policy measures based on the county and state in which the

respondent lives were merged with the survey data. Several measures reflecting the full cost of

cigarette smoking by minors were included in the empirical models. The first is the state-level

price for a pack of 20 cigarettes, including generics, obtained from the Tobacco Institute’s annual

Tax Burden on Tobacco. This price represents the weighted-average price of a pack from single

packs, cartons and vending machine sales, and includes state-level cigarette taxes. These prices

are deflated by the national CPI (1982-1984=1) to obtain the real price of cigarettes. In addition,

a variable measuring the largest real price difference for a pack of cigarettes between the youth’s

state of residence and states within 25 miles of the youth’s county of residence is included to

capture potential cross-border shopping for cigarettes by young smokers. A larger difference in


respondent reports any use of either marijuana or hashish, he or she is defined as a current user. Frequencies were
summed after medians were assigned to each category separately.


                                                          8
border price is expected to have a positive impact on the probability of using cigarettes as well as

the average level of use.

       Four additional measures of tobacco control policies were included to capture the general

state and local sentiment towards tobacco and youth access to tobacco products. The first is an

index of state and local restrictions on smoking in public places and private work sites. This

index is constructed as the sum of five variables capturing the fraction of the population in the

youth’s county of residence that is subject to state or local restrictions in each of the following

areas: private worksites, restaurants, retail stores, schools, and other public places. The second is

a similarly constructed index of state and local limits on youth access to tobacco. This index is

constructed as the sum of two state-level dichotomous variables - one indicating that the

minimum legal purchase age for cigarettes is at least 18 years and a second indicating that signs

stating the minimum legal age are required at the point of purchase - and three continuous

measures - representing the fraction of the population in the youth’s county of residence subject

to restrictions on vending machine cigarette sales, limits on the distribution of free tobacco

samples to youth, and licensure requirements for tobacco retailers. Third, a dummy variable

equal to one in states that earmark a portion of the revenues generated by cigarette excise taxes

to fund anti-tobacco activities, and zero otherwise is included. Finally, an indicator of smoker

protection laws is added. Data on state level policies were obtained from various years of the

Coalition on Smoking OR Health’s (CSH) annual State Legislated Actions on Tobacco Issues.

The primary source of information on local level restrictions was the National Cancer Institute’s

1993 Monograph summarizing major local control policies, updated with information from CSH.

       To capture the full price of marijuana, a series of alternative measures reflecting the

potential legal costs associated with the possession of marijuana are included. The first is a




                                                  9
dichotomous indicator set equal to one in those states that have decriminalized the possession of

small amounts of marijuana, generally less than an ounce. In these states, it is not a felony to

possess small quantities of marijuana although it is still a crime. In addition, measures of the

median fine and jail time that can be imposed for possession of an ounce of marijuana on the first

offense are included. These data were obtained from various years of the Bureau of Justice

Statistics’ annual Sourcebook on Criminal Justice Statistics, augmented with information from

the states’ Controlled Substance Acts. In a few states, these measures could be constructed for

1994 only. Rather than lose respondents in these states, the penalties for marijuana possession

that were in place in 1994 were assumed to exist in 1992 and 1993 as well and a dummy variable

was created to identify the observations affected by this assumption. Sensitivity analyses are

conducted to evaluate the impact of this assumption on the estimates.

       Because many teens that smoke cigarettes and/or marijuana also drink, a measure of the

price of alcohol is included in the cigarette and marijuana demand equations to control for the

possible relationships between cigarette, marijuana, and alcohol use. The real state tax on a case

of 24 12-ounce cans of beer is used as a proxy the price of alcohol because beer is by far the

drink of choice for youths these ages and because these data are available for all states. The beer

tax data were obtained from the Brewers Almanac.

       After eliminating respondents with missing or inconsistent data, a sample of 109,612

youths remains.3 Given the limited nature of the dependent variable, two-part models are

employed to estimate youth cigarette and marijuana demand. In the first stage, the likelihood of

being a current cigarette or marijuana smoker is estimated using a probit specification. In the

second stage, the conditional quantity of cigarettes smoked daily and frequency of marijuana use




                                                 10
are estimated using log-linear least square methods. Robust standard errors that correct for the

clustering of observations at the state level are reported. These are obtained in STATA using the

robust cluster option, which is equivalent to requesting Huber-corrected standard errors. This

correction accounts for any unobserved correlation in the error terms across individuals within

the same state, which could be caused by an unobserved public sentiment toward healthy

behaviors for example, but assumes that this correlation is independent of the other regressors in

the model.

         Two alternative specifications are presented for each equation. The first is a relatively

limited specification including the cigarette price and border price difference, beer tax, a

decriminalization dummy variable and a variety of socioeconomic and demographic variables

constructed from the survey data. The second is a more complete specification that includes the

four tobacco-related policy measures and the marijuana possession penalty variables. It is likely

that these additional variables are correlated with the unobserved state sentiment toward general

use of these substances and are therefore potentially endogenous. By including them as

additional regressors, however, we hope to obtain more precise estimates of the effect of

cigarette prices and marijuana decriminalization, whose estimates might otherwise be biased

upward because of potential correlation with this same unobserved state sentiment.4




3
  Preliminary analyses including indicators for observations with missing data suggested that these data were
missing randomly and that the findings would not be significantly altered by deleting observations with incomplete
data.
4
  A more precise way of dealing with the potential correlation between policy variables and the error term would be
to estimate a fixed-effect model, which we tried to do. Our relatively short panel does not provide us with sufficient
within state variation to estimate the model efficiently however. We therefore present results from the approach
described above.

IV.      Results

         Table Three reports the marginal effect of a change in each of the independent variables

on the average probability that an individual currently smokes cigarettes or uses marijuana.5

Column one contains the estimates for cigarette smoking from the relatively limited specification

while column two contains those from the expanded specification. Similar estimates for the

probability of using marijuana are contained in columns three and four. Table Four reports the

estimates from the conditional demand equations in a similar fashion as Table Three.

         Cigarette prices are found to have a negative effect in all estimated equations. The

estimated coefficients are significant at better than the one-percent significance level in three out

of the four cigarette equations. 6 When additional tobacco control measures are included in the

cigarette equations, the marginal effect of the cigarette price falls in the prevalence equation but

increases slightly in the conditional demand equation. The implied own-price elasticity for the

prevalence of cigarette smoking calculated from the short- and long-form specifications of the

model are –0.66 and –0.42, respectively, while those for the conditional demand equations are

–0.62 and –0.71. These are consistent with previous findings using these data but omit the

alcohol and marijuana policy variables (Chaloupka and Grossman, 1996; Chaloupka and Pacula,

1998).

         Cigarette prices are also found to have a negative and generally significant effect in the

marijuana demand equations. Higher cigarette prices have a statistically significant effect on the

average level of marijuana use in both the long and short form specifications. In the prevalence

equations, the estimates remain negative but are no longer significant at conventional levels. The

5
 Marginal effects for dichotomous variables are calculated as a change in these variables from “0” to “1”, not as a
one unit change from the mean.




                                                         12
estimate from the long form specification, however, is significant at the 7% level. The inclusion

of additional tobacco control and marijuana policy measures, shown in column four of both

tables, leads to a doubling of the estimates, raising some concerns regarding the precision of

these estimates. It is clear from these results, however, that higher cigarette taxes will not lead

youth to substitute marijuana for cigarettes. The implied cross-price elasticities from the short-

and long-form specifications of the prevalence equations are –0.34 and –0.73, respectively, while

those from the conditional demand equations are –0.36 and -0.84. These estimates suggest that,

for teens, cigarettes and marijuana are economic complements for one another. The estimates for

the border-price variable generally support this finding of complementarity. Lower border

cigarette prices have a positive and, at times, statistically significant effect on the alternative

measures of cigarette smoking and marijuana use.

         More comprehensive restrictions on cigarette smoking are estimated to have a negative

and significant impact on the probability of youth smoking, but appear to have little impact on

conditional cigarette demand. In contrast, these restrictions are not found to affect the

probability of youth marijuana use, but, surprisingly, are estimated to have a positive and

significant impact on the conditional frequency of use. None of the other tobacco-related policy

measures is significant in any of the eight equations. These findings suggest that laws limiting

youth access to tobacco products, earmark tobacco taxes for anti-smoking media campaigns,

and/or protecting smokers do not affect youth smoking or marijuana use. However, no controls

for the implementation or enforcement of these policies have been included in the models, which

are likely to influence these findings.



6
  In general, statements concerning the significance of variables capturing alternative aspects of the own-full price
are based on one-tailed significance tests given the law of demand. Those concerning cross-prices are based on two-
tailed significance tests given the potential substitutability or complementarity of various licit and illicit substances.


                                                            13
       With respect to the various proxies for the full price of marijuana, we find that youths

living in decriminalized states are significantly more likely to report currently using marijuana

and may consume more frequently. The positive effect on the average level of marijuana used

by current users is only statistically significant when additional tobacco controls and marijuana

policies are included. The magnitudes of the coefficients are also substantially influenced by the

inclusion of these policy variables. In contrast, the estimates indicate that youth smoking is

unaffected by state decriminalization status.

       Youths who currently use marijuana and live in states where higher median fines can be

imposed for the possession of up to an ounce of marijuana consume less frequently than those

living in states with less severe fines. The comparable measures for jail sentences, however, were

not significant in either equation. It should be noted, however, that the indicator for youth in

states where the 1994 values of the penalty variables were assumed to apply in earlier years is

negative and significant in both of the marijuana use equations in which it is included, suggesting

that the findings for the penalty variables could change if more accurate measures were

available. Additional runs of the model, which are not presented here, verify that the estimates

for other key variables are unaffected by the inclusion or exclusion of the penalty data.

       Neither of the marijuana penalty variables or the indicator for states where these data are

problematic is significant at conventional levels in the youth cigarette smoking equations. In

general, these estimates suggest that while youth marijuana use is reduced by increases in the full

price of marijuana, youth cigarette smoking is unaffected. To some extent, these findings

support the hypothesis that youth substance use progresses from cigarette smoking to the use of

other licit and illicit substances, as described above. That is, increases in the price of cigarettes

reduce the likelihood of marijuana use, but increases in the price of marijuana do not




                                                  14
significantly affect youth smoking. More research using longitudinal data is needed, however,

before this can be clearly established.

       In contrast, the beer tax is found to have a generally insignificant effect on youth cigarette

smoking and marijuana use. The one exception to this is in the expanded version of the

conditional frequency of marijuana use equation where it is positive and approaches significance

at the 7% level, consistent with the hypothesis that alcohol and marijuana are economic

substitutes for at least young marijuana users. This lack of a consistent finding is consistent with

the mixed findings from prior research on the complementarity or substitutability of alcohol and

marijuana. DiNardo and Lemieux (1992) and Chaloupka and Laixuthai (1997), for example,

conclude that the two were substitutes among youth. In contrast, Farrelly et al (1998), Pacula

(1998a, 1998b) and Saffer and Chaloupka (1998) concluded that alcohol and marijuana were

complements for youth, young adults, and adults, respectively.

       The findings with respect to the socioeconomic and demographic variables are generally

consistent with those obtained in other studies. Males are significantly less likely to report

currently using cigarettes than females, but among those who do smoke cigarettes young men

consume more on average than young women. Young males are also more likely to use

marijuana and to consume it more frequently than young females. African American and other

non-white youth smoke significantly less than whites, although only African-Americans are

significantly less likely to smoke marijuana. Older youths are both more likely to use either

substance and, for users, to use more frequently. Teens that work more hours, on average are

significantly more likely to smoke cigarettes, but not to use marijuana; among users, however,

those working more hours consume more cigarettes per day, and may use marijuana less

frequently. Income has a positive and significant impact on both the probability and conditional




                                                 15
use of both substances. Interestingly, however, the positive effect of income on the probability

of using both substances diminishes as income gets larger while the positive effect of income on

the conditional use of both substances increases with income.

       Youths who attend religious services either frequently or infrequently are significantly

less likely to use both substances than youths who do not attend such services and, for users, to

consume less. Youths living in nontraditional families are significantly more likely to use either

substance and to use more often than those in families where both parents are present. Youth

with siblings, however, are less likely to consume either cigarettes or marijuana and, for users, to

consume less. Youths with mothers that worked more while they were growing up are

significantly more likely to use cigarettes or marijuana than those with mothers who stayed

home; among users, however, there are few significant differences. Youth cigarette smoking

appears to be inversely related to parental education, while marijuana use appears to have a U-

shaped relationship with parental education, although the estimates for marijuana use are not

consistently significant. Finally, youths living in the Western states are less likely to smoke

cigarettes and smoke significantly less on average than youth living in the South, Midwest or

Northeast. They are more likely to use marijuana, however, and use significantly more on

average than youths living in other regions of the country.



V. Conclusions

       Based on the estimates described above, the answer to the question posed in the title of

this paper is clearly "No" - higher cigarette prices will not increase youth marijuana use. Instead,

these estimates indicate that higher cigarette prices, in addition to reducing youth cigarette

smoking, would certainly lower the average frequency of marijuana use among youth users and




                                                 16
would likely lower the probability of using marijuana. According to these estimates, a ten-

percent increase in cigarette price is predicted to lower the prevalence of youth marijuana use

between 3.4% – 7.3% and decrease the average level of marijuana use by regular users between

3.6% - 8.4%.

       This finding is consistent with the evidence that youth substance use typically progresses

from cigarette smoking and other tobacco use to other licit and illicit substance use, implying

that policies that would be effective in reducing youth smoking would also lead to reductions in

youth drinking, marijuana use, and other illicit drug use. In addition, this finding is consistent

with the evidence emerging from the qualitative research conducted by the Centers for Disease

Control and Prevention's network of prevention research centers. This research, based on focus

groups of young smokers from around the country, suggests that at least some young marijuana

users use cigarettes to enhance the high they obtain from smoking marijuana, implying that there

are complementarities between youth cigarette and marijuana smoking. Similarly, teens in these

groups consistently indicate that there are important qualitative differences between cigarette

smoking and marijuana use that would keep them from substituting towards marijuana should

cigarette prices increase dramatically (personal communications, George Balch and Robin

Mermelstein).

       This research clearly takes a very small first step towards evaluating the impact of

changes in prices and control policies for one substance on youth use of other substances. Much

more research, ideally using appropriate longitudinal data that contain information on the

initiation and progression of youth substance use, is needed to adequately address these issues.
