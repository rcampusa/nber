Transparency is one of the biggest innovations in central bank policy of the past quarter century. Modern
central bankers believe that they should be as clear about their objectives and actions as possible. However,
is greater transparency always beneficial? Recent work suggests that when private agents have diverse
sources of information, public information can cause them to overreact to the signals from the central
bank, leading the economy to be too sensitive to common forecast errors. Greater transparency could
be destabilizing. While this theoretical result has clear intuitive appeal, it turns on a combination of
assumptions and conditions, so it remains to be established that it is of empirical relevance.

In this paper we study the degree to which increased information about monetary policy might lead
to individuals coordinating their forecasts. Specifically, we estimate a series of simple models to measure
the impact of inflation targeting on the dispersion of private sector forecasts of inflation. Using a panel
data set that includes 15 countries over 20 years we find no convincing evidence that adopting an inflation
targeting regime leads to a reduction in the dispersion of private sector forecasts of inflation. While
for some specifications adoption of inflation target does seem to reduce the standard deviation of inflation
forecasts, the impact is rarely precise and always small.

1         Introduction

Transparency is one of the biggest innovations in central bank policy of the past quarter
century. Modern central bankers believe that they should be as clear about their objectives
and actions as possible. This notion arises from the view that policymakers should be a
source of stability, not a source of noise; with the economy and markets responding to data,
not to the policymakers themselves.

Inflation targeting is one of the first and most comprehensive implementations derived from
this view. As a framework for monetary policy, inflation targeting involves ‘the public
announcement of medium-term numerical targets for inflation [and] increased transparency
of the monetary policy strategy through communication with the public and the markets about
plans, objectives, and decisions of the monetary authority’ (Mishkin 2002, pg. 361). The
result is not only clearly understood and published numerical targets, but also inflation
reports that explain past and likely future actions. Most economists believe that greater
transparency is beneficial. See, for example, the survey papers by Walsh (2007), Carpenter
(2004), Dincer and Eichengreen (2002), and Geraats (2002). However, transparency is not
nudity. Understanding policymakers' contingency plans does not mean laying the
policymaking process bare for all to see. Monetary policymakers should not put cameras in
the meeting room. There are clear limits. What are they?

Recent theoretical work has put this question into a new perspective. In their pioneering
work, Morris and Shin (2002 and 2005) show that when private agents have diverse sources
of information, public information can cause them to overreact to the signals from the central
bank, which makes the economy too sensitive to common forecast errors. The reason for this
is that individuals care not only about accurately estimating the state of the economy, but
also about having an estimate that is not too different from that of others. The implication is
that more transparency may in fact be destabilising, so policymakers should think long and
hard before changing their disclosure policies in ways that publicise more information.

Svensson (2006) and Woodford (2005) both suggest that the Morris and Shin result is likely
to be a theoretical curiosum rather than anything policymakers should worry about. That is,
the circumstance under which additional information is welfare reducing is extremely unlikely
to occur in the real world. As Svensson shows, Morris and Shin's own conclusion only holds
when the noise in policymakers’ publicly announced information is at least eight times that of
the private information agents have obtained on their own. That is, public officials must be far
worse in their evaluations of the economic environment than private agents. Evidence, such
as that in Romer and Romer (2000), suggests that central bank staff forecasts are at least as
good, if not better than, those of market economists.

Woodford's critique is based on the Morris and Shin choice of how to aggregate the quadratic
loss functions of the individual agents. In their original paper, Morris and Shin assume that
policymakers seek to minimise a social loss function that is based on the average squared
error of individual estimates of the state of the economy. By contrast, if the social welfare
function includes losses associated with the dispersion of agents’ estimates of the state –
something Morris and Shin assume the agents themselves care about – then more
information is unambiguously a good thing.

Regardless of these two coherent and largely convincing criticisms, the Morris and Shin
argument retains intuitive appeal. In particular, policymakers worry that releasing more
information might cause private agents to coordinate expectations, leaving the economy
more exposed to common shocks. In the end, however, we are left with an empirical
question: does increased transparency lead to lower dispersion in private forecasts? If the
answer is no, then there is little to worry about. However, if the answer is yes, we cannot
necessarily conclude that greater transparency—in the form of adopting an inflation target—
is harmful. The reason is that greater transparency about the fundamentals and long-run
inflation objective should also lead to a smaller dispersion of inflation forecasts which is
beneficial. So, a smaller dispersion of private forecasts could reflect the beneficial effects of
greater transparency and not the harmful effects described by Morris and Shin.

In this paper we study the degree to which increased information about monetary policy
might lead to a reduction in the dispersion of inflation forecasts. By combining information
about whether a country targets inflation with the dispersion of private sector forecasts of
inflation, we seek to understand how inflation targeting affects private sector behaviour. In
particular, does inflation targeting lead to a smaller or possibly larger dispersion of private
sector inflation forecasts? If it leads to a larger dispersion, then there is no need to worry
about the harmful effects of greater transparency discussed by Morris and Shin. However, if
inflation targeting leads to a smaller dispersion, then there is at least some evidence that
increased information could be harmful because it leads individuals to coordinate their
forecasts à la Morris and Shin or could be beneficial because of additional information about
central bank objectives and fundamentals.

In order to examine this, we estimate a series of simple models designed to measure the
impact of inflation targeting on the dispersion of private sector forecasts of inflation. Using a
panel data set that includes 15 countries over 20 years we find no convincing evidence that
adopting an inflation targeting regime leads to a reduction in the dispersion of private sector
forecasts of inflation. While for some specifications adoption of an inflation target does seem
to reduce the standard deviation of inflation forecasts, in others it does not. And the precision
of the estimates is rarely very high. The bulk of our evidence does not support the view that a


                                                 2
Cecchetti and Hakkio       Inflation targeting and private sector forecasts        October 2009



shift to inflation targeting has resulted in a significant decline in the cross-sectional standard
deviation of inflation forecasts across survey respondents.

Before proceeding, it is useful to note that our work is distinct from, but related to, two earlier
papers. First, Mankiw, Reis and Wolfers (2004) examine the dispersion of inflation
expectations in survey data and find that inflation expectations have become more
concentrated around the mean as the level of inflation has fallen. At first glance this may
seem as if it is a result that is more positive than ours. But, given that Mankiw, Reis and
Wolfers only study US data, it is not possible to disentangle the impact of disinflation from
increased Federal Reserve transparency.

Levin, Natalucci and Piger (2004) investigate how well the mean of inflation expectations has
been anchored, also from survey data. They provide evidence on how inflation targeting has
changed the dynamics of inflation. Their results suggest that the adoption of an explicit
inflation target reduces the correlation of long-run inflation expectations with short-run
movements in inflation, largely eliminating the link between expectations and realised
inflation. Furthermore, Levin, Natalucci and Piger find that the adoption of an inflation
targeting framework lowers the persistence of inflation, so that inflation behaves more like a
random walk.

The remainder of this paper is organised in five sections. Section 2 provides a description of
the data we use. This is followed in section 3 with a simple statistical analysis, and in section
4 with the results of more sophisticated regressions. Section 5 discusses some possible
extensions and provides evidence on the robustness of the results. Section 6 provides a
conclusion.



2         Description of the data

We study the dispersion of monthly survey-based inflation expectations for a number of
countries from October 1989 to April 2009. The data are collected by Consensus Economics.
Each month the firm surveys a large cross-section of professional forecasters – currently
more than 700 world-wide – asking each one for their current and next calendar years’
predictions for growth, inflation, unemployment, and short- and long-term interest rates in the
countries that they follow. For each month, for each variable, Consensus Forecasts reports
the high, low, and median forecast, as well as the standard deviation of survey responses.
While Consensus Forecasts supplies forecast information for more than 70 countries, we
restrict ourselves to the following 15: Australia, Canada, the Euro area, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK

and the US. For many of the results, we ignore the Euro area because data are only
available starting in December 2002.

 Notes: For the ‘Inflation targeting regime’ countries, the dates shown are either the first date of inflation
 targeting or the first date for which data are available; as a result, they do not necessarily correspond to dates
 at which a country adopted an inflation target. For the ‘Non-inflation targeting regime’ countries, the dates
 shown correspond to dates for which the dispersion of inflation and GDP forecasts are available.
 Source: Appendix A, Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel (2007), Norges Bank Regulation on Monetary Policy, March
 29, 2001. Contrary to the date given in Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel, the start date of inflation targeting for
 Australia is June 1993, based on data from the Reserve Bank of Australia.



This sample is sufficiently diverse to allow us to study the impact of inflation targeting, as two
countries (New Zealand and Sweden) targeted inflation over the entire period, six (Australia,
Canada, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK) adopted inflation targeting at some point
during the sample, and the remaining eight have never adopted an explicit inflation target.
For the second group, the six that adopted an inflation target during the 1990s, we need to
choose a date for the adoption. It is perhaps surprising that there is disagreement on this
timing. Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel (2007), Ball and Sheridan (2005), and Truman (2003),
among others, all choose slightly different dates. For the most part, we adopt the dating in
Appendix A of Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel (2007).

To continue, we need a bit of notation. We use the general form S it (.,.) to denote the standard
deviation of private sector forecasts for country i made on date t. Next, we specify the
variable being forecasted as π for CPI inflation and y for GDP growth, and whether the
forecast is for the current year, which we denote by c, or for the next year, which we denote
by n. Using this notation, S it (π , c ) is the standard deviation of private sector forecasts for

CPI inflation made at date t for the current year (the year containing t). Analogously,
S it (π , n ) is the standard deviation of private sector forecasts for CPI inflation also made at

date t but for the next year (the year containing t+1), and S it ( y, c ) and S it ( y, n ) are the

standard deviations of private sector forecasts for GDP growth for the current and next year,
respectively.

To provide a sense of the time-series properties of the data, Figures 1 and 2 plot the
standard deviation of current and next year’s forecasts of inflation, S it (π , c ) and S it (π , n ) , for

all the countries in our sample. Simple inspection reveals that the standard deviation of
forecasts for the current year, S it (π , c ) plotted in Figure 1, has significant seasonality; while




                                                                      5
Cecchetti and Hakkio              Inflation targeting and private sector forecasts          October 2009



S it (π , n ) has less seasonality. Focusing on S it (π , c ) , a closer look shows that the standard
deviation is highest in January and falls throughout the year. This is not at all surprising,
since as a particular year progresses, inflation during that year increasingly becomes an
historical fact that need not be estimated.

To assess the seasonality in these series, we assume they are deterministic and estimate
the following regressions:

                          12
           S it (π , c) = ∑ β kc Dktm + ε it                                                           (1)
                         k =1


and

                          12
           S it (π , n) = ∑ β kn D ktm + ε it ,                                                        (2)
                          k =1


where Dktm is a monthly dummy for month k. Notice that for this exercise, the coefficients (the
β k ’s) are constrained to be equal across all of the countries in the sample.

The coefficients from equations (1) and (2), with a 95% confidence interval, are plotted in
Figure 3. We report the coefficients from left to right depending on the amount of time from
the date of the survey to the end of the period covered by the forecast. Starting on the far
left, the first observation, labelled ‘Jan_n,’ is the coefficient associated with the dummy
variable for the standard deviation of the January forecast for the next year’s inflation ( β1n ),
which is completed 24 months in the future. By contrast, the far right of the figure plots the
coefficient associated with the standard deviation of inflation in December of the current year
( β 12
    c
       ), which is completed in only one month. While the relationship is not linear, it is clearly

declining. A regression of { β1n , β n2 …, β 11
                                             c

                                                       } against {1, 2, ...,23, 24} yields a slope coefficient
of -0.012 and a t-statistic of 16.2.1 This means that the marginal effect of an additional month
of data reduces the standard deviation of private inflation forecasts by 0.012. The average
value of S it (π , n ) in January (the standard deviation of private sector forecasts for ‘next’ year

in January of ‘this’ year) is 0.377 percentage points and the average value of S it (π , c ) in

December is 0.094 percentage points. Thus, each additional month of data tightens the
spread of private sector inflation forecasts (reduces the standard deviation) by 3.2 percent

    We also regressed the coefficients against {1, 2, …, 12, 0, …, 0} and {0, …, 0, 1, 2, …, 12}. The slope
    coefficients (t-statistics) were -0.003 (2.80) and -0.024 (23.1).

(0.012 / 0.377). The implication of all of this is that it is important that further analysis account
for the pronounced seasonality in the data.

3              Simple statistical tests

We now turn to the key question of this paper: is the spread (standard deviation) of inflation
forecasts by survey participants lower in countries that adopt an explicit inflation target? To
examine this, we start with some very simple statistics designed to measure whether the
spreads S it (π , c ) and S it (π , n ) are lower when a country’s policymakers employ an inflation

target. For clarity, we do this with a series of regressions. In the first one we estimate the
following regression for each country separately:

                                  12
               S it (π , c) = α + ∑ β k D ktm + γT arg et it + u itc                                             (3)
                                  k =2


and similarly for S it (π , n ) . Of course, the variable ‘Target’ is only included if the country was

both an inflation and non-inflation targeter during the sample period. In addition, since the
available data are different for different countries, each equation is estimated with a different
number of observations.

The results are shown in Appendix Tables A.1 and A.2 and summarised in Table 2. Note,
there are only 6 countries that switched regimes during the sample period. For these
countries, the average standard deviation for the non-inflation targeting regime is α, for the
inflation targeting regime is α + γ, and γ is the difference. If the dispersion is smaller for
inflation targeting regimes, we would expect to see γ < 0.

These results allow us to conclude that for those countries that adopted inflation targeting
during the period 1990 to 2009, the standard deviation of private sector forecasts for CPI
inflation sometimes falls and sometimes rises. Specifically, the standard deviation of inflation
forecasts falls when Australia, Canada, and United Kingdom adopt inflation targets; but it
increases when Norway adopts an inflation target. Spain and Switzerland are somewhere in
between, depending on whether you are looking at the dispersion of current year forecasts or
next year forecasts.

A next step is to estimate the equations jointly using Zellner’s seemingly unrelated regression
approach. Since the model is estimated as a set of equations, we need the same number of
observations for all countries. There are basically three different start dates that could be
used: November 1990, January 1995, or June 1998. Depending on the start date, the
number of countries that were both inflation targeters and non-inflation targeters differs, as
seen in Table 3. There is clearly a trade-off between sample size, number of countries, and
mix of inflation regimes.

Table 4 summarises the results of estimation using Zellner’s seemingly unrelated regression
approach, focusing on the sign and significance of the inflation targeting variable for
countries that were both inflation targeters and non-targeters. (Additional results are shown
in Appendix Table A.3.) In general, the results are similar to the single equation regressions
in Table 2: sometimes the coefficient is negative and sometimes it is positive; sometimes it is

So far, the determinants of the dispersion of private sector forecasts are deterministic
variables: seasonal dummies and an inflation targeting dummy. There are no economic
variables that may affect the dispersion of forecasts. For example, the dispersion of inflation
forecasts may be greater when overall macroeconomic variability is greater. While we do not
have a country-specific measure of macroeconomic variability, we use the dispersion of
private sector forecasts of GDP growth. To avoid any simultaneity concerns, we actually use
the lagged value of the spread of GDP forecasts, S i ,t −1 ( y , c ) and S i ,t −1 ( y , n) . In addition, to

capture the fact that volatility may have changed over time reflecting the so-called ‘Great
Moderation’ and then the more recent financial crisis, we include a year variable and two
dummy variables to capture the recent financial crisis. The two financial crisis variables are
Crisis1 = 1 for September 2007 – September 2008, and Crisis2 = 1 for October 2008 – April
2009. These two variables reflect the fact that the financial crisis is generally thought to have
started in August 2007 and then intensified in September 2008. Since the survey
respondents presumably did not recognise the start and intensification of the crisis until the
next month, the Crisis variables are dated one month after the start and intensification. In
addition, we allow the current inflation dispersion to depend on its own lagged value,
S it −1 (π , c ) and S iit −1 (π , n) . In all, we estimate a set of equations of the following form:

                       12
S it (π , c ) = α ic + ∑ β kc D ktm + γ c Target it + δ c year t +κ 1c Crisis 1it + κ 2c Crisis 2 it

Since the model is estimated as a set of equations, a Target variable can only be included for
those countries that switched during the same period.

The results of estimating these equations using Zellner’s seemingly unrelated regression
approach are summarised in Table 5. With three different start dates, the countries that were
both inflation targeting and non-inflation targeting differ. We report results only for the
countries that change regime, so the coefficient of interest on Target can be estimated.

This exercise allows us to draw several conclusions. First, the coefficients on Target reported
in Table 5 are generally insignificant. However, the estimates of γc in the equation for
S it (π, c ) are positive and significant for Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. Second, the

coefficient on the lagged value of the spread of the inflation forecast (ρc and ρn) is positive
and significant, with the estimated impact in the regression of the dispersion in next year’s
inflation forecast larger than for the current year’s inflation forecast (ρn >ρc). And third, in
looking at the full set of regressions not reported in the table, the coefficient on the lagged
value of S(y,.) is generally insignificant. When the coefficient is significant, it is mostly
positive, although there are a couple of cases when the coefficient is negative and
significant.

While these results are interesting, they fail to utilise information from the countries that
either never adopted an inflation target or did so prior to the beginning of our sample. We

now turn to a more sophisticated analysis designed to account for seasonality, control for
general macroeconomic volatility, and employ all of the data we have available.



4          Panel regressions

The various shortcomings mentioned at the end of the previous section can be addressed by
estimating a set of equations using a panel regression approach. By estimating various
regressions using both fixed effects and random effects (Baum (2006)), we show that there is
little evidence that inflation targeting countries have a smaller dispersion of private sector
inflation forecasts.

Fixed Effects (FE)

We start by estimating some fixed effects models given the general applicability of this
approach. To capture the fact that volatility may have changed over time reflecting the Great
Moderation and then the more recent financial crisis, several dummy variables are included
in the equation. Specifically, year dummy variables are included (Year1991, …, Year2006),
where, for example, Year1991 = 1 for 1991. We also define Year2007 = 1 for January 2007 –
August 2007, Crisis1 = 1 for September 2007 – September 2008, and Crisis2 = 1 for October
2008 – April 2009. The results from estimating the following equation (or some variant of it)
are reported in Table 6 and the time-varying constants (the constant and terms related to
time) are shown in Figure 4.2

where the constant α can be thought of as a mixture of the average level in January, the
base month, plus the average impact of October 1989 to December 1990, while the u is the
country-specific fixed effect. In addition, the table reports the long-run effect of inflation
targeting on the dispersion: γ/(1-ρ).

In all cases, the coefficient on Target is negative, which suggests that countries with an
inflation target have a smaller standard deviation of private sector inflation forecasts.
However, the coefficient is significant only for the bare-bones regression (excluding lagged

    The chart plots the constant term (α) and coefficient on variables related to January of each year: Yeart (δt),
    Crisis1it (κ1), and Crisis2it (κ2). In this way, the chart plots the “time varying constant term.” Specifically, the
    value plotted for the years 1991 – 2007 are = α + δt for 2008 = α + κ1, and for 2009 = α + κ2.

values of S (π, .) and S (y , . ) . In addition, the coefficients on lagged values of S (π, .) and S (y , . )

are positive and significant. The estimate of ρ is 0.49 for regressions using S it (π, c ) and 0.74

when looking at S it (π, n ) . This suggests that the persistence of the spread is less for current
year forecasts than for next year forecasts, but still sizeable. A larger coefficient on the
lagged spread for next year forecasts than for current year forecasts might suggest that
incoming monthly data plays a smaller role for next year forecasts than for current year
forecasts. In addition, to the extent that lagged values of                                          S ( y , .) capture overall
macroeconomic uncertainty, the positive and significant coefficients suggest that the
standard deviation of inflation forecasts depend on macroeconomic uncertainty.

Figure 4 shows the effect of time and the financial crisis on the standard deviation of private
sector forecasts of current and next year inflation made in January. In general, the standard
deviation declined from 1991 to 1999, was stable through 2006, and then rose significantly in
2008 and 2009. This suggests that the ‘Great Moderation’ did lead to a reduction in the
dispersion of private sector forecasts of inflation through the first part of the sample period
and that the financial crisis led to an increase in the dispersion. Interestingly, the coefficient
on (α + δ) in 2009 is about the same as in the early 1990s for S (π , n ) but higher for S (π, c ) .

While the coefficient on Target is negative for both S (π, c ) and S (π , n ) , the magnitude is
economically small. There are several ways to see this. First, look back at Figures 1 and 2
and note that the average of S (π, c ) is roughly 0.20 while S (π , n ) averages closer to 0.35.
This means that the estimated impact of inflation targeting even in the long run (0.017 and
0.036) is to reduce the standard deviation of inflation forecasts by 10 percent or less.

A second way to see that γ is economically small is to compare it to the impact of the
financial crisis. To do this, we consider what would happen to S (π, c ) if a country were to
adopt an inflation target in February 2007 versus adopting it in February 2009. Taking the
case of the United States, we use equation (2) to calculate the predicted value of S (π, c ) first
with the Target = 0 (no inflation target) and then with the Target = 1 (assuming the US had
an inflation target). The result is that the predicted dispersion in survey inflation expectations
would fall from 0.269 to 0.260 in February 2007, but from 0.663 to 0.654 in February 2009. In
other words, while dispersion would be less, the impact of financial turmoil on the dispersion
is much larger –0.394 versus –0.036, or 11 times larger.

Random Effects (RE)

We next considered estimating the panel regression using a random effects estimator. The
fixed effects (FE) model specifies the country specific effect as a constant, whereas the
random effects (RE) model specifies the country specific effect as a random variable that is
uncorrelated with the regressors. Breusch and Pagan (1980) developed a Lagrange
multiplier test for σ u2 = 0 ; the p-value is reported in Table 9 in the row labeled ‘ σ u2 = 0 p-value.’
If the orthogonality assumption is true, then the random effects model is more efficient
because it uses the assumption that ui is uncorrelated with the regressors. Of course, if this
assumption is false, then the random effects model is inconsistent. We can then use a
Hausman test of the extra orthogonality condition imposed by the random effects estimator.
The idea of the Hausman test is simple: if the regressors are uncorrelated with ui, the fixed
effects estimator is consistent but inefficient and the random effects estimator is consistent
and efficient; however, if the regressors are correlated with ui, the fixed effects estimator is

consistent but the random effects estimator is inconsistent. Table 7 estimates the same
models and includes the p-value from the Hausman test in the row labelled ‘Hausman’.3

The results from using random effects to estimate the model are mixed. The coefficient on
Target is sometimes negative and insignificant and other times it is positive and significant.
Not surprisingly, one can always reject the hypothesis that σ u2 = 0 . Unfortunately, one can
often reject the hypothesis that the orthogonality condition holds. In general, it appears as
though we cannot reject the hypothesis that the orthogonality condition holds for the stripped-
down model (which includes only Target and year and month dummies) but we can generally
reject the orthogonality condition when we include lagged values of S(π, .) and S( y , .) .
Interestingly, in the bare-bones model (which fails to reject the Hausman test) the coefficient
on Target is negative but insignificant.

      Including a lagged dependent variable in a fixed effects model creates a large-sample bias in the estimate of
      the coefficient on lagged dependent variable. Since we are not really interested in this estimate, the concern is
      somewhat mitigated. In addition, in a simple model Nickell (1981) shows that for large values of T, the limit of
       (ρˆ − ρ) as N → ∞ is approximately –(1+ρ)/(T-1). With ρ = 0.5 (0.8) and T = 235, the bias will be -0.0064 (-
      0.0077).

5           Robustness and Extensions

In this section, we check the robustness of the results by considering six modifications to the
baseline model:
        •    we examine the sensitivity of the results to individual countries
        •    we compute the standard errors of the estimated coefficients using alternative
             techniques
        •    we consider the effect of the dating of the introduction of inflation targeting
        •    we include various measures of actual inflation
        •    we introduce commodity prices into the model
        •    we replace the standard deviation of forecasts with their root mean square error.
In what follows, we discuss results only for the fixed effects panel regression using
S it (π, c ) and S it (π, n ). Thus, each of the six modifications to the baseline model is compared to

the results in Table 6. In general, the conclusions from the previous section are supported.

Sensitivity to individual countries

Since the panel includes 15 countries, the first robustness check is to see whether some
countries are ‘influential’. To check this, the fixed-effects panel regression is estimated with
all countries, and then we exclude one country at a time. So, for example, we re-estimate the
model with Australia excluded, we then include Australia but exclude Canada, we then
include Australia and Canada, but exclude Norway, and continue in this way.

Table 8 reports the coefficients and t-statistics on Target (γ) for all three panel equations for
all countries, corresponding to the columns as labelled in Table 6, and then for each
excluded country. In looking at the table, the appropriate comparison is between the first row
(‘None’ excluded) and each subsequent row.

The results suggest that Canada and Norway may be influential for S(π, c) and that Canada,
Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain, may be influential for S(π, n). First, note that in all
but 6 cases – 2 for S (π , c) and 4 for S(π, n) – the sign remains negative. In the 6 cases
when the sign changes (Australia and the United Kingdom), the coefficient is small and
insignificant. More importantly, Canada and Norway appear to be influential for S (π , c)
because the coefficient is insignificant in columns 2 and 3 when all countries are included,
but becomes significant when Canada and Norway are excluded. This suggests that Canada
and Norway are the countries behind the insignificant coefficient when all countries are
included. These result may not be too surprising since the coefficient on Target was positive



                                                   15
Cecchetti and Hakkio            Inflation targeting and private sector forecasts                  October 2009



and insignificant for Canada and positive and significant for Norway in Tables 2, 4, and 5. In
addition, when looking at the results for S (π , n) , Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and
Spain are influential in the same way: the coefficient on Target becomes significant when
these countries are excluded in columns 5 or 6. As with S (π , c) , the earlier results in Tables
2, 4, and 5, these results are not surprising given.

Alternative measure of standard errors

Given the range of countries included in the panel of countries, the conventional standard
errors reported in Table 6 may be misleading. Therefore, another robustness check involves
estimating alternative standard errors. The standard errors reported in Table 6 are the typical
standard     errors        for   generalised       least     squares.       As     a        check,   Table     9   reports
heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors and bootstrap standard errors.

Not surprisingly, the t-statistics are smaller. In particular, the t-statistic on the Inflation Target
is now insignificant in all cases when using the robust or bootstrap standard errors. However,
the other coefficients generally remain significant (the coefficient on lagged S it ( y, n ) is

insignificant no matter what standard errors are used).

Dating the introduction of inflation targeting

As noted earlier, the dating of the inflation-targeting regime is somewhat ad hoc and different
researchers use different dates for the start of the regime. In addition, if survey participants
take time to learn about the inflation targeting regime (for example, how serious are the
authorities?), then an alternative dating regime could give different results. To test this


                                                           17
Cecchetti and Hakkio           Inflation targeting and private sector forecasts                      October 2009



hypothesis, the fixed effects panel regressions are re-estimated using the third lag of Target
rather than the current value of Target (from Table 1), thus allowing survey participants three
months to learn about the new regime. The results are shown in Table 10.

In this case, the coefficients on the lagged inflation target variable are somewhat larger (in
absolute value) and significant for all three models for Sit (π , c ) , compared to only one of the

models in Table 6. And the coefficient is significant for two out of three models for Sit (π , n ) ,

compared to only one of the models in Table 6. Thus, there is some evidence that it takes a
couple of months for survey participants to respond to the introduction of an inflation
targeting regime. Stated somewhat differently, it means the first three months of inflation
targeting are influential observations in models 2, 3, and 5 because the coefficient on the
inflation targeting variable is insignificant when these observations are included but the
coefficient is significant when these observations are excluded.

Including measures of actual inflation

Turning now to some extensions of the baseline model, we first introduce various measures
of actual inflation into the specification. One measure of inflation is the percent change in the
CPI from 12 months ago and the other measure is the year-average-over-year-average
percent change. Since the survey participants provide estimates of the year-average-over-
year-average inflation rate, the percent change from 12 months ago is not exactly
comparable to the inflation rate being forecasted. However, it does provide actual inflation
data that survey participants could use in forecasting inflation. The year-average-over-year-


                                                         18
Cecchetti and Hakkio           Inflation targeting and private sector forecasts                      October 2009



average inflation rate is comparable, but is the same for all months in the year. Including the
lagged value of either inflation rate does not change the results in any meaningful way: the t-
statistic on the inflation rate is always less than 1.0. (To conserve space, the results are not
shown.)

Another inflation measure turned out to be significant. Since the dependent variable is the
dispersion of private sector forecasts, one might expect that the variability of inflation would
be a significant explanatory variable. The results in Table 6 suggest that the dispersion of
private sector forecasts is a significant explanatory variable. We extend those results by
including a measure of the variability of actual inflation, measured as the 12-month rolling
standard deviation of month-over-year-ago inflation rates. This variable is significant in all six
cases; the t-statistic is between 6.5 and 12.3 in equations for S (π, c ) and between 4.1 and 10.1
in equations for S (π, n ) . However, the coefficients and t-statistics on the other variables are
fairly similar, so the results are not shown (to conserve space).

Commodity prices

Given the wide range of countries used in the panel, the effect of having an inflation target
may be overwhelmed by other factors. In particular, some countries are more susceptible to
commodity price shocks than other countries. In an effort to check this, we extend the results
in Table 6 by including a measure of the volatility of commodity price inflation. Specifically,
we include the lagged value of the rolling 12-month standard deviation of the percent change
(from the previous month) in a commodity price index; the index used is the Commodity
Research Bureau spot raw industrial price index. The same commodity price index is used

for all countries under the assumption that commodity prices are set in world markets.
However, the coefficient on the commodity price variable is allowed to be different for each
country. The results are shown in Table 11. Recall that there are 15 countries and three
equations for S it (π, c ) , so there are 45 coefficients for commodity price variability. In order to
conserve space the coefficients on commodity price variability are not shown. Briefly, the
coefficients on commodity price variability are almost always positive and significant. For the
S it (π, c ) equations, 36 of the 45 coefficients are positive and significant, and the other nine

coefficients are positive and insignificant. For the S it (π , n ) equations, 35 of the coefficients

are positive (24 are significant and 11 are insignificant) and 10 of the coefficients are
negative (two are significant and eight are insignificant). Returning to our primary interest,
however, we note that when we add the commodity price variation measure to the
regression, the coefficient on Inflation Target is similar in magnitude and significance in the
S it (π, c ) equations, but about half the magnitude and significance in the                           S it (π , n ) equations.

Root-mean-square error

Finally, we estimated a model similar to equation (3) but using the root-mean-squared-error
of the inflation forecast, RMSE it (π, c ) and RMSE it (π, n ) rather than using the standard deviation
of current (and next) year’s inflation forecast. (Appendix 1 describes the mechanics of how
the RMSE is recovered from the data we have available.) Specifically, we estimate the
following equation by fixed-effects:

                                                                          Yeart +κ 1n Crisis 1it + κ 2n Crisis 2it

Table 12 reports the results of this exercise. These are clearly more compelling than what we
obtained using the dispersion of private sector forecasts against an inflation targeting
variable. In particular, the coefficient on Inflation Target is negative and significant in 5 of the
6 equations.

While it may appear that the RMSE results are stronger than those using the dispersion, we
view them with caution for two reasons. First, while the coefficient on the inflation target
variable is larger when using RMSE than when using S it (π ,.) , the RMSE itself is also larger

than S it (π ,.) . For example, the average (across all countries and time) of S it (π, c ) is 0.20

while the average of RMSEit (π , c ) is 0.40; and the average of S it (π , n ) is 0.34 while the

average of RMSEit (π , c ) is 0.77. A better way to compare the results using S it (π ,.) and



                                                       20

RMSE is to look at the effect of adopting an inflation target relative to the average value of
S it (π ,.) and RMSEit (π ,.) as we did above. Here the results are the same, the reduction in

S it (π ,.) or RMSEit (π ,.) is small relative to the average size of S(π, .) or RMSEit (π ,.) for non-
inflation targeting regimes. The reduction is between 3 percent and 47 percent, depending on
which model is used and whether we look at current year or next year forecasts. Second, the
RMSEit (π ,.) is much more volatile than S it (π ,.) . And not only is it more volatile, the volatility

is more episodic in that there are some years when RMSEit (π ,.) is three to five times larger

than S it (π ,.) and other years when they are about the same magnitude. Part of the reason is

that RMSEit (π ,.) is calculated from relative actual inflation measured as year-average-over-

year-average percent change and is thus the same for all months in a given year.

6             Conclusions

Using survey data on inflation expectations drawn from Consensus Forecast, we find little
evidence that inflation targeting countries have a smaller dispersion of private sector
forecasts of inflation. While for some countries, some models, and some estimation
techniques, we estimate that inflation targeting countries have a smaller dispersion of private
sector inflation forecasts, for other countries, other models, and other estimation techniques,
we find that they do not.

Returning to the question that motivated this analysis – ‘Does increased transparency lead to
lower dispersion in private forecasts?’ – the answer appears to be no. This suggests to us



                                                       21
Cecchetti and Hakkio       Inflation targeting and private sector forecasts       October 2009



that the Morris and Shin argument that increased transparency could be destabilising is of
little practical concern to policymakers. And even in the cases when inflation targeting leads
to a lower dispersion of private forecasts, we cannot necessarily conclude that greater
transparency is harmful because the lower dispersion could reflect the beneficial effects from
greater transparency rather than the harmful effects from greater coordination. Of course,
since the survey we use only reports results of forecasts for inflation in the current year and
the next year, our results are unable to shed light on whether the distribution of private sector
forecasts of long-run inflation is lower. However, even if the inflation target is for the medium-
run, one would expect that the dispersion of inflation forecasts for ‘next year’ may still be
somewhat smaller than otherwise.

Calculation of the root-mean-squared-error of the inflation forecast


Let π jfi, t, c = inflation forecast (f) for country i, for the current year, made by forecaster j at time
t and π tai = actual inflation for country i at time t. Since the inflation forecasts are for
year/year (rather than month/month-year-ago), π tai is the same for each month in the year
corresponding to date t: π Jan
                           ai
                              1990 = π Feb1990 = K = π Dec1990 . Next, let E denote taking
                                       ai              ai                   j


expectations (average) over survey participants, j. Then, E j (π jfi, t, c ) = π t fi , c (which no longer
has the j subscript) is reported in Consensus Forecasts—namely the average forecast for
inflation in country i for the current year, made at time t. There is obviously a similar variable
for next year, replacing “c” with “n”. Finally, Sit (π , c) = Sπ t fi , c is reported in Consensus
Forecasts—the standard deviation of the private sector forecasts for the current year for
country i at date t. We have 3 observations for each country c at time t: π t fi ,c , Sπ t fi ,c ,and
π tai .

We calculate the variance of private sector forecasts = Vt fi , c (across forecasters) = [ Sπ t fi , c ]2
as follows:

V t fi , c = E j [π        fi , c
                          jt        − π t fi , c ] 2 = E j [π    fi , c
                                                                jt        ] 2 − [π t fi , c ] 2

We can use this equation to solve for E j [π jtfi ,c ]2 (since we have all terms on the RHS of the
equation):

E j [π jtfi , c ]2 = Vt fi , c + [π t fi , c ]2

We can now calculate the RMSE of the forecast for the “current” year as follows:




RMSEt fi , c = E j [π jtfi , c − π tai ]2 = Vt fi , c + [π t fi , c ]2 + [π tai ]2 − 2π t fi , cπ tai

Notice, we have all terms on the RHS of this equation. We can also calculate the RMSE of
the forecast for the “next” year as follows:




RMSEt fi , n = Vt fi , c + [π t fi , n ]2 + [π tai+1 ]2 − 2π t fi , nπ tai+1

where we use actual inflation at “t+1” rather than at “t”.




                                                                                 26
