                                             ABSTRACT

We introduce the information microstructure of a canonical noisy rational expectations model (Hellwig,
1980) into the framework of a conventional real business cycle model. Each household receives a
private signal about future productivity. In equilibrium, the stock price serves to aggregate and transmit
this information. We find that dispersed information about future productivity affects the quantitative
properties of our real business cycle model in three dimensions. First, households' ability to learn about
the future affects their consumption-savings decision. The equity premium falls and the risk-free interest
rate rises when the stock price perfectly reveals innovations to future productivity. Second, when noise
trader demand shocks limit the stock market's capacity to aggregate information, households hold
heterogeneous expectations in equilibrium. However, for a reasonable size of noise trader demand
shocks the model cannot generate the kind of disagreement observed in the data. Third, even moderate
heterogeneity in the equilibrium expectations held by households has a sizable effect on the level of
all economic aggregates and on the correlations and standard deviations produced by the model. For
example, the correlation between consumption and investment growth is 0.29 when households have
no information about the future, but 0.41 when information is dispersed.

1       Introduction
An efficient allocation of goods and services depends on the ability of financial markets to ag-
gregate dispersed information that is not available to any single economic agent in its totality
(Hayek, 1945). The way in which asset prices and economic aggregates reflect this dispersed
information has been the object of a large theoretical literature on “noisy rational expectations”
going back to Grossman (1976) and Hellwig (1980).
    This literature has produced a rich set of predictions. For example, inefficiencies may arise
when prices transmit information that is costly to acquire (Grossman and Stiglitz, 1980; Verrec-
chia, 1982), when agents must form expectations about the expectations of others (Allen, Morris,
and Shin, 2006; Bacchetta and Van Wincoop, 2008; Qiu and Wang, 2010; Angeletos, Lorenzoni,
and Pavan, 2012), or when agents learn about actions that are strategic complements to their
own actions (Amador and Weill, 2012; Goldstein, Ozdenoren, and Yuan, 2013).1
    Although this field of research has received a great deal of attention in recent years, quantify-
ing its results within the standard framework of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)
models has proven difficult. This relative scarcity of quantitative applications is the result of a
methodological barrier: the tools used to solve noisy rational expectations models are generally
perceived to be incompatible with the quantitative machinery of DSGE models. Noisy rational
expectations models typically combine normally distributed shocks with policy functions that
are (log) linear in the expectation of the shocks that agents learn about. This combination en-
sures that aggregate variables (e.g., prices or the capital stock) inherit the normal distribution,
allowing a straightforward application of the projection theorem when solving for equilibrium
expectations. By contrast, policy functions in contemporary DSGE models are inherently non-
linear in expectations of future variables (e.g., consumption, labor supply, and portfolio returns).
As a result, aggregate variables are not normally distributed in these models, even if they feature
normally distributed shocks. Consequently, the standard approach for solving noisy rational
expectations models is not directly applicable.
    In this paper, we develop an approach that breaks this methodological barrier and allows us
to apply the standard toolkit for solving noisy rational expectations models within the standard
DSGE framework that is typically used for welfare and policy analysis. We use our approach to
quantitatively estimate the seminal noisy rational expectations model by Hellwig (1980).2
    In noisy rational expectations models, households receive a private signal about future pro-

     We choose the framework by Hellwig (1980) mainly because the results are classics and require relatively little
introduction. However, we believe our methodological approach is applicable more broadly, and hope it paves
the way for a more general, quantitative evaluation of the noisy rational expectations literature. In addition to
the noisy rational expectations literature cited above, our approach may also be applicable to a range of related
dispersed information models in which agents learn from observing aggregate variables such as the capital stock
or investment flows.

ductivity and can infer information about the signals received by others from observing the
equilibrium stock price. The model has three main qualitative predictions: First, in a frictionless
environment in which the trading motives of all economic agents are known, asset prices perfectly
reveal all dispersed information (the Grossman (1976) equilibrium). Second, the trading activ-
ity of “noise traders” who randomly demand an unknown quantity of stocks interferes with the
market’s capacity to aggregate information and prevents the perfect revelation of information in
equilibrium. When information is not perfectly revealed, households differ in their equilibrium
expectation of future productivity. Third, noise trader demand that is solely contingent on vari-
ables that are observable by households does not affect equilibrium expectations as long as the
equilibrium price function remains monotonic in the productivity shock.
    In the first part of the paper, we set up a DSGE model with capital accumulation, flexible
labor supply, and Epstein-Zin utility in which households receive private signals about a future
productivity shock and can learn from the equilibrium stock price. In addition, outside “noise
traders” engage in stochastic asset purchases in the stock market, as in Hellwig (1980).
    We then introduce our solution method and formally derive the conditions under which
the three main predictions of the classical noisy rational expectations model carry over to the
DSGE framework. The main insight from this analysis is that, under an appropriate assumption
on the distribution of noise trader demand shocks, we can solve for households’ equilibrium
expectations as a function of only two variables: the standard deviation of noise trader demand
and the standard deviation of idiosyncratic noise in households’ private signal. Jointly, the two
variables fully determine the equilibrium posterior distribution of households’ expectations of
the productivity shock. In fact, we are able to derive a monotonic transformation of noise trader
demand such that households’ equilibrium expectations take the same form as in the linear
model.
    As a result, the three main qualitative insights from the linear model seamlessly carry over
to the DSGE framework. In particular, the equilibrium stock price becomes perfectly revealing
of the productivity shock if no noise traders are present. In addition, any policy interventions
(e.g., open market operations) in the stock market do not affect the equilibrium informativeness
of stock prices as long as they are fully contingent on observables.
    In the third part of the paper, we estimate and quantitatively evaluate the model. Relative
to a conventional DSGE model, we have two additional parameters: the standard deviation of
noise trader demand and the standard deviation of idiosyncratic noise in households’ private
signal. To get a benchmark value for the size of noise trader demand shocks, we calibrate their
size to the asset purchase program of the Federal Reserve. Although this estimate may not be
accurate, it serves as an interpretable reference. We then choose the remaining parameter to
match the cross-sectional variance of the expectation of annual GDP growth from the Survey of
Professional Forecasters. Based on these estimates, we analyze the comparative statics in the


                                                3
model. In a final step, we estimate both the standard deviation of noise trader demand and the
standard deviation of noise in the private signal to match a set of financial and business cycle
moments.
    Relative to the conventional DSGE literature, the choice of frequency of our calibration
is of particular importance as it determines the horizon at which households learn about the
future. In order to maximize transparency, we follow the existing DSGE literature and choose
the monthly frequency, such that households receive private information about productivity a
month in advance. However, we note that the quantitative effects of dispersed information are
likely to be proportionally larger if households learned about shocks a year or a decade in advance.
    We find that dispersed information about future productivity affects the quantitative results
of our DSGE model in four ways. First, households’ ability to learn about future productivity
affects their behavior, and especially their consumption-savings decision. In our calibration,
households receive private signals about the innovation to the long-run productivity shock one
month in advance. In the limit in which the standard deviation of the noise trader demand
shock goes to zero, the equilibrium stock price becomes perfectly revealing and all households
hold the same expectation in equilibrium. We compare this limiting case of perfect information
aggregation with a standard calibration in which households receive no information at all about
future productivity and find the equity premium falls by 1% and the risk-free interest rate rises
by 2% when the stock price perfectly reveals the productivity shock.
    Second, when noise trader demand shocks limit the stock market’s capacity to aggregate
information, the model cannot generate the kind of disagreement observed in the data for any
reasonable size of noise trader demand shocks. For example, in our standard specification, the
cross-sectional standard deviation in households’ expectations of future GDP growth is 0.05%,
compared to 0.27% in the survey of economic forecasters. Similarly, when we choose the precision
of households’ private signal to maximize the cross-sectional variance in household expectations,
the cross-sectional variation in households’ holdings of stocks does not exceed 0.04% in our
standard specification.
    Third, even moderate heterogeneity in household behavior affects the correlations and stan-
dard deviations produced by the model, as well as the level of all economic aggregates. For
example, the correlation between consumption growth and investment is 0.29 when households
have no information about the future, 0.27 when they have perfect information about the future,
but 0.41 in our standard specification.
    Fourth, aside from their effect on information aggregation, noise trader demand shocks affect
the model in their own right. When we choose the standard deviation of noise trader demand
shocks to maximize the overall fit of the model we find that, with sufficiently (albeit unreasonably)
large shocks, the model comes closer to matching the standard deviation of stock returns and
stock prices, as well as the cross-sectional standard deviation of expectations of future GDP


                                                 4
growth observed in the data.
    This last finding illustrates a number of difficulties that arise when transporting the concept
of noise traders into a general equilibrium setting. The first difficulty is that the non-fundamental
asset demand of noise traders has no clear counterpart in the data.
    Second, noise traders effectively act as foreign agents, adding and subtracting resources from
the economy at different points in time. When we change the standard deviation of noise trader
demand shocks, we also directly change the volatility of all macroeconomic aggregates, which
makes comparative statics with respect to the standard deviation of noise trader demand shocks
somewhat difficult to interpret.
    Finally, heterogeneous classes of agents, and in particular non-maximizing agents such as
noise traders, make thinking about welfare difficult. For example, it is unclear whether one
should include noise traders in a welfare measure, and if so, how to calculate their utility. On the
other hand, performing welfare analysis based on the utility of rational households alone may
lead to counterintuitive results as wealth transfers occur between the two groups in equilibrium.
    In a related paper (Hassan and Mertens, 2010) we address these issues by removing noise
traders from the model altogether, and instead work only with a single class of “near-rational”
households. Near-rational households are perfectly rational in all dimensions of their behavior,
but make small correlated errors when forming expectations about future productivity (they
are on average slightly too optimistic in some states of the world and slightly too pessimistic
in others). By the envelope theorem, such small errors are of little concern to an individual
household, because they have only a lower-order effect on its own utility. However, as a result
of these small errors being correlated across households, they affect the equilibrium stock price.
As households (rationally) attempt to learn from the equilibrium price, the common component
of households’ errors is amplified and has a first-order external effect on the market’s capacity
to aggregate information. The model thus endogenously generates non-fundamental noise in the
stock price through an information externality: a given household does not internalize the effect
of its own error on the equilibrium expectation of other households in the economy. Having
eliminated non-maximizing agents from the model, we are then able to address a number of
welfare-related questions that we sidestep in the current paper. In particular, we show that
a deterioration of the market’s capacity to aggregate information may cause large (first-order)
aggregate welfare losses. Mertens (2009) analyzes a range of policies that may mitigate the
information externality and improve the market’s capacity to aggregate information.
    In the interest of maintaining a maximum comparability to the most standard noisy rational
expectations model, we maintain the noise trader assumption in the current paper despite the
difficulties with its normative interpretation, and focus on the positive predictions of the model
throughout.
    The solution method we use in this paper generalizes a solution method we use in earlier


                                                 5
work (Mertens, 2009; Hassan and Mertens, 2010). It builds on Judd (1998) and Judd and Guu
(2001) in using an asymptotically valid higher-order expansion in all state variables around the
deterministic steady state of the model in combination with a nonlinear change of variables (Judd
(2002)). Tille and van Wincoop (2013) independently develop a similar solution method based
on perturbation methods.3 Albagli et al. (2011) develop an alternative approach in which they
constrain each agent’s asset purchases, such that the optimality conditions of only one marginal
agent holds in equilibrium.
    This paper is part of a large literature that strives for a richer representation of financial
markets within otherwise standard DSGE models. Examples include Bernanke and Gertler
(1989), Bernanke et al. (1999), Woodford and Curdia (2009), He and Krishnamurthy (2011),
and Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2013). We add to this literature by providing a simple way
to incorporate the notion that stock markets aggregate and transmit information into otherwise
standard quantitative models.
    Another closely related literature considers the effect of information about future fundamen-
tals in the form of exogenous news shocks within DSGE models (Jaimovich and Rebelo, 2009;
Barsky and Sims, 2011; Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2012). Blanchard et al. (2013) estimate the
relative contributions of noise shocks and information in the data. We add to this literature by
providing a means to quantify the extent to which asset markets endogenously transmit news
about future fundamentals.
    The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the classic noisy
rational expectations model and describes the usual steps in solving the linear model. Section 3
sets up the quantitative DSGE model and shows how we can follow the same steps when solving
for equilibrium expectations in the non-linear model. Section 4 characterizes the dynamic effects
of dispersed information in general terms. Section 5 quantitatively analyzes and estimates the
model. Section 6 concludes.


2         The Classic Noisy Rational Expectations Model
The model economy exists at two points in time t = 1, 2. It is populated by a continuum of
identical households indexed by i ∈ [0, 1]. At t = 1, each household is endowed with N units of
a numéraire good that can be stored until t = 2 and K units of capital. At t = 2, each unit of
capital returns η units of the numéraire
                                                                 

Before trading commences, each household receives a private signal about productivity:

                                                   si = η + ν i ,                                 (2)

where ν i represents i.i.d. draws from a normal distribution with zero mean and variance σ 2ν .
Given si , each household chooses to purchase zi units of capital to maximize expected utility
from terminal wealth,
                                                           ρ
                                  E1i [Ui ] = E1i [w2i ] − V1 [w2i ],                              (3)
                                                           2
where E1i [η] = E [η|si , Q] and V1 [w2i ] is the posterior variance of w2i conditional on the private
signal si and the stock price Q. The parameter ρ > 0 determines the degree of absolute risk
aversion. Terminal wealth is given by

                                             w2i = zi (η − Q) + N.                                (4)

Households thus optimally demand
                                                         E1i [η] − Q
                                                  zi =                                            (5)

units of capital.
   Market clearing requires that aggregate asset demand is equal to aggregate supply:

where T (Q) reflects asset purchases by noise traders that follow some policy rule contingent on Q
and τ are asset purchases by noise traders that are stochastic from the perspective of households.
Throughout, we focus on symmetric equilibria.
Assumption L1 Contingent asset purchases by noise traders are a linear function of Q

                                                 T (Q) = b0 + b1 Q.                               (7)

Assumption L2 Random asset purchases by noise traders follow the normal distribution

Assumption L3 Households can condition their expectation on prices (Q) but not on aggre-
                 R1
gate quantities ( 0 zi di).

2.1    Solving the Model
The standard approach to solving this “CARA-Gaussian” model proceeds in three steps. Because
the steps in the solution of the DSGE model are generalized versions of these same steps, we
derive them in detail to show the analogy in the procedure.

Step 1: Guess Equilibrium Price Function

We guess that the equilibrium price function is linear in η and τ

                                                    Q = π 0 + π 1 η + γτ ,                      (9)

where π 0 , π 1 , and γ are endogenous coefficients to be solved below.

Step 2: Bayesian Expectation Formation

Plugging (5) into (6) and rearranging terms yields
                             Z       1
                      q̂ ≡               E1i [η] di + τ ρV1 [η] = ρV1 [η] (K − T [Q]) + Q.     (10)
                                 0


Note that all variables on the right-hand side of the equation are known at t = 1. Observing Q
is thus equivalent to observing the average expectation of η across households with some error
τ ρV1 [η]. Without loss of generality, we refer to this monotonic transformation of the stock price
as q̂.
    Assuming our guess in (9) is correct, we can show that the rational expectation of η given
the private signal and q̂ takes a linear form

                                                 E1i [η] = α0 + α1 si + α2 q̂,                 (11)

where the constants α0 , α1 , and α2 are Bayesian weights households give to the prior, the private
signal, and the monotonic transformation of the market price of capital, respectively.
                                                                                     R
    Plugging the definition in (10) into (11), integrating on both sides, solving for E1i [η]di, and
then adding τ ρV1 [η] on both sides yields

                                                α0     α1         1
                                     q̂ =           +       η+        τ ρV1 [η].
                                              1 − α2 1 − α2    1 − α2

Observing the stock price is thus also equivalent to observing an unbiased signal of η
                                                          
                                                    α0         1 − α2     ρV1 [η]
                                             q̂ −                     =η+         τ.           (12)
                                                  1 − α2         α1        α1


                                                                 8
   We thus have a prior and two independent, unbiased signals of η. It follows that the posterior
variance is the inverse of the sum of the precision of these three elements4

2.2       Three Classical Results
From (16), we can readily read off the three main qualitative predictions of the noisy rational
expectations model.

      See Appendix A for a formal derivation using the projection theorem.




                                                                        9
Result 1. Absent stochastic noise trader demand, the stock price becomes perfectly revealing

                                          lim V1 [η] = 0.
                                         σ τ →0


Result 2. Noise trading reduces the market’s capacity to aggregate information,

                                           ∂V1 [η]
                                                   > 0.
                                            ∂σ τ

When information aggregation is less than perfect, households put weight on their private signal
and thus hold heterogeneous expectations in equilibrium. (This follows directly from (15).)

Result 3. Noise traders’ contingent asset purchases have no effect on price informativeness.
(Note that T (Q) does not feature in (16).)


3     A DSGE Model with Dispersed Information
We now generalize Results 1-3 to the context of a quantitative DSGE model. To this end, we set
up a decentralization of the real business cycle model by Croce (2013). We choose this model
because it performs well on matching quantities as well as asset prices and can readily be solved
using perturbation methods. However, in principle, we believe our method is applicable to any
DSGE model in which equilibrium policy functions are smooth.


3.1    Setup
Technology is characterized by a linear homogeneous production function that uses capital, Kt ,
and labor, Nt , as inputs
                                      Yt = Ktα (eat Nt )1−α ,                             (19)

where Yt stands for output of the consumption good. The growth rate of labor productivity,
∆at+1 = log (At+1 /At ), has a long-run risk component, ω, and a short-run risk component, ϕ,

                                  ∆at+1 = µa + ω t + σ ϕ ϕt+1 .                             (20)

where the long-run component follows

                                       ω t = ρω t−1 + σ η η t .                             (21)

Both shocks to productivity, ϕ and η, are i.i.d. standard normal.

   The equation of motion of the capital stock is

                                 Kt+1 = (1 − δ k )Kt + It − Gt Kt ,                             (22)

where It denotes aggregate investment and δ k is the rate of depreciation. Furthermore, convex
adjustment costs to capital arise following Jermann (1998)

where v1 , v2 , and ξ are positive constants.
    A representative firm purchases capital and labor services from households. As it rents
services from an existing capital stock, the firm’s objective collapses to a period-by-period max-
imization problem
                                       max Yt − dt Kt − wt Nt ,                                (24)
                                      Kt ,Nt

where Kt and Nt denote factor demands for capital and labor, respectively. First-order conditions
with respect to capital and labor pin down the market-clearing wage,

                                                               Yt
                                            wt = (1 − α)          ,                             (25)
                                                               Nt
                                       Yt
and the rental rate of capital, dt = α K t
                                           . Both factors receive their marginal product. Because the
production function is linear homogeneous, the representative firm makes zero economic profits
from producing the consumption good.
    The representative firm owns an investment goods sector that converts the consumption good
into units of capital, while incurring adjustment costs. It takes the price of capital as given and
then performs instantaneous arbitrage:

                                     max Qt (It − Gt Kt ) − It .                                (26)
                                       It


Taking the first-order condition of (26) gives us the equilibrium price of capital.

                                                         1
                                               Qt =           .                                 (27)
                                                      1 − G′t

Due to decreasing returns to scale in converting consumption goods to capital, the investment
goods sector earns positive profits in each period. Profits are paid to shareholders as a part of

where the weight of leisure scales with aggregate productivity, A, to ensure the existence of a
balanced growth path. At the beginning of every period, each household receives a private signal
about the shock to long-run productivity:

where ν it represents i.i.d. draws from a normal distribution with zero mean and variance σ 2ν .
   Given sit and their knowledge about the state of the economy, households maximize life-
time utility (29) by choosing a time path for consumption, labor, and their holdings of stocks
{Cit , nit , kit }∞
                  t=0 . Each household’s optimization is subject to a budget constraint:

Noise traders therefore trade goods with households and have a non-zero trade balance with the
economy. The trade balance corresponds to financial claims which are held in the form of noise
traders’ ownership of capital.
    Solving this model poses two main challenges. First, equilibrium quantities are non-linear
functions of the underlying shocks. Maintaining the assumption of normally distributed shocks
inevitably leads to a non-normal distribution of equilibrium variables. As a result, we can no
longer solve for conditional distributions in closed form based on these quantities. Second,
information dispersion results in a distribution of choices and state variables, which generates
a non-degenerate distribution of wealth across households. To focus our attention on the first
challenge, we side-step the second challenge by introducing contingent claims that households
can use to insure against the idiosyncratic risk they face due to their private signal.7
    At the beginning of each period (and before receiving their private signal), households can
trade claims that are contingent on the state of the economy and on the realization of the noise
they receive in their private signal, ν it . These claims are in zero net supply and pay off at the
beginning of the next period. Since they are traded before any information about η t+1 is known,
their prices cannot reveal any information about future productivity. Contingent claims trading
thus completes markets between periods, without affecting households’ signal extraction problem.
   6
     We introduce T k (St ) = 0 to show that result 1 continues to hold in the DSGE model. In our calibration we
set T k (St ) = 0.

3.2      Equilibrium
Definition 1. Given a time path of shocks, an equilibrium in this economy is a time path of
quantities, signals, and prices with the following properties:

   1. The time path of households’ consumption, stock holdings, and labor supply maximizes (29)
      given the vector of prices and signals.

   2. The demand for capital and labor services solve the representative firm’s maximization
      problem (24) given the vector of prices.

   3. The time path of capital investment solves the investment good sector’s problem (26) given
      the vector of prices.

   4. The time paths of stock prices, wages, and stock returns clear the markets for stocks, labor
      services, and capital services, respectively.

   We compute the first-order and envelope conditions for households in Appendix B.2. After
taking the ratio of the first-order conditions with respect to labor and consumption, we get the
marginal rate of substitution between labor supply and consumption

                                                1− ξ1            − ξ1

The optimal choice of stock holdings is determined by the familiar asset pricing equation,

                                             Eit [Mit+1 Rt+1 ] = 1,                                         (41)
   8
    To save space we directly use the equilibrium result that households will perfectly share the risk associated
with the noise in their private signal. Hit is thus the equilibrium net payoff received by household i from its
contingent claims trading.

and returns Rt+1 are defined in (33). Given these conditions of optimality, consumption follows
from the household’s budget constraint (32).
   For convenience, we write the average of stock holdings across households as
                                             Z
                                                     kit+1 di = K̄t+1 ,                                 (43)


such that we can rewrite the market-clearing condition for capital (34) as Kt+1 = K̄t+1 +T k (St )+
  τ
Tt+1 .
    The labor market clears when condition (35) holds. Again for convenience, we write aggregate
consumption and labor supply as
                                                 Z
                                      Xt =            Xit di, X = C, N.                                 (44)

    Note that noise trader demand shocks affect this system of equations via the resource con-
straint (36), which determines the amount of aggregate investment. Investment, in turn, influ-
ences the price of capital Q via equation (27).


3.3    Solving the Model
In this section, we generalize the three solution steps for the linear model in section 2 to solve
the DSGE model with dispersed information. The main trick is again to define a statistic q̂ that
aggregates all relevant information about η t+1 . We conjecture that this statistic takes analogous
form to the linear model,
                                                      V1 [η]
                                          q̂t ≡ Ēt +        τ t,                               (45)
                                                       σ 2η
              R
where Ēt = Eit [η t+1 ]di denotes the average expectation of η t+1 across households. We guess
that the equilibrium stock price is a function of known state variables of the economy and q̂, where
the mapping from q̂ into Q can now be non-linear. Using this guess, we show how households form
expectations in the non-linear model. We then show that the signal extraction problem remains
linear and Gaussian and can thus be solved in closed form. As an immediate consequence, the
three main theoretical results from the linear setting carry over to the dynamic economy. In a
third step, we confirm our initial guess and show that we find a recursive equilibrium. To complete
each of these steps, we need three assumptions, which generalize each of the assumptions L1-L3


                                                          15
in the linear model of section 2.
Assumption Q1 Contingent stock purchases by noise traders are a function of known state
variables,
                                  Ttk = T k (St ),

where
                                          St = {Kt , Tt , ω t−1 , η t , ϕt }.

Assumption Q2 The stochastic component of noise trader demand T τ , is a function of a
normally distributed shock to noise trader demand τ ∼ N (0, µ) and follows a state-dependent
distribution such that the following property holds

                             ˆ t , Ēt , q̂t ) + Qt T τ (St , q̂t , Ēt , τ t ) = I(St , q̂t ),
                             I(S                                                                         (46)

where T τ (St , q̂t , Ēt , τ t ) = 0 iff τ t = 0 and Iˆt = Yt −Qt−1 Rt Ttτ −Ct is the “fundamental” component
of aggregate investment.
    Just like we needed stochastic noise trader demand to be a linear function of a normally
distributed shock in section 2, we now need it to be a particular (non-linear) function of a
normally distributed shock. This function adds noise to the second argument of Iˆ such that
aggregate investment (and thus the equilibrium stock price) is a function of only q̂ and St . We
show below that this assumption uniquely determines T τ as a particular multivariate power series
in τ .
Assumption Q3 When forming expectations about future productivity, households condition
their expectations on their private information, the equilibrium stock price, and the commonly
known state variables of the economy St , but not on other quantities or prices.9

                                        Eit [η t+1 ] = E[η t+1 |St , sit , Qt ].                         (47)

     As L3 in the linear model, this assumption rules out that households condition their expecta-
tion on the “fundamental” demand for stocks or any quantity that reflects this information. In
the context of this general equilibrium model, it also implies that households cannot condition
their expectation of η on the wage rate or other prices. Households in our model thus act as
“Lucas households” where the member of the household charged with forecasting η t+1 observes
St , sit , and Q, forms her expectation based on this information, and then communicates it to
another household member who decides on the household’s labor supply.
     We make this assumption mainly for convenience. In the more general case in which house-
holds can condition their expectation on two prices, the model simply requires an additional
   9
    Agents also know the history of shocks which does not add any predictive power to expectations due to the
equilibrium being recursive and choices being determined by the state space.

source of non-fundamental noise.
   In addition to assumptions Q1-Q3, we require the following condition.

Condition 1. The equilibrium stock price, Q, is a strictly monotonic function of q̂.

This condition typically holds in a wide range of models. It states that, other things equal, the
stock price either strictly increases or strictly decreases when households expect higher produc-
tivity in the future. While we cannot solve for the mapping of q̂ into Q in closed form, we verify
this condition ex-post using the numerical solution of the model.

3.3.1     Step 1: Guess for state space

Analogously to the linear case, we start by guessing the form of equilibrium variables. The
solution of the model is a set of equilibrium quantities and prices that are functions of the
underlying state variables. We split these state variables into the commonly known set, St , and
a set that depends on expectations about η.

Lemma 1. There exists a recursive equilibrium satisfying the system of equations defined in
section 3.2 with the following properties:

  1. The equilibrium stock price, Qt , is a function of the current (commonly known) state of the
     economy, St , and q̂t .

  2. All other prices and aggregate quantities depend on St , the average expectation, Ēt , and q̂t

                                        Xt = X(S̄t ), X = C, N, K̄ ′ , w, d, R,                  (48)

        where we abbreviate S̄t = {St , q̂t , Ēt }.

  3. A household’s optimal behavior is a function of St , the household’s conditional expectation
     of next period’s innovation to long-run productivity Eit [η t+1 ], the average expectation, Ēt ,
     and the statistic q̂t . The conditional expectation, in turn, depends on the private signal sit
     as well as the demand statistic q̂t ,

                                               xit = x(Sit ), x = c, n, k,                       (49)

        where, for convenience, we write Sit = {S̄t , Eit }. In a slight abuse of notation, Eit =
        Eit [η t+1 ].

   In the remainder of the section, we verify the validity of the lemma.




                                                       17
Step 2: Bayesian Expectation Formation

Given Lemma 1, we invoke condition 1 (which ensures the stock price is a strictly monotonic
function of q̂) and assumption Q3 to arrive at the main insight of our solution method: learning
from the stock price Q is just as informative as learning from its monotonic transformation, q̂.
Since there is a one-to-one mapping between the stock price and q̂ conditional on all commonly
known state variables, St , households can infer the only unknown quantity q̂ from observing the
stock price. In other words, conditioning on Q and q̂ spans the same σ-algebra.

                         Eit [η t+1 ] = E[η t+1 |St , sit , Qt ] = E[η t+1 |St , sit , q̂t ].                       (50)

    The signal extraction problem is thus isomorphic to the one in section 2, despite the non-
linear nature of the quantitative model. As a result, we can solve for equilibrium expectations
independently of the aggregate dynamics of the model.

Lemma 2. Households’ equilibrium expectations of η t+1 are independent of the aggregate dy-
namics of the model. Conditioning on the (normally-distributed) demand statistic q̂ results in
expectations of the form
                                                                                                           

Proof: See Appendix B.4.

   As an immediate consequence, we get the following corollary.

Corollary 1. Given condition 1 and assumptions Q1-Q3, results 1-3 hold in the dynamic econ-
omy.

Corollary 1 shows that the main insights from the linear setting survive in the non-linear economy.
First, without stochastic shocks to noise trader demand, the economy becomes perfectly revealing.
In the context of a dynamic economy, this result means households know innovations to the long-
run component of productivity one period in advance. The expectations held by households then
act as they would in a “news shocks” model.
    The second result states that stochastic shocks to noise trader demand increase the con-
ditional variance of η t+1 . As a result, stock prices and all economic aggregates reflect both
information about the future and noise. Moreover, when information aggregation is less than
perfect, households put weight on their private signal and thus hold heterogeneous expecta-
tions in equilibrium. Heterogeneity in equilibrium expectations in turn generates cross-sectional
variation in consumption, investment, and labor supply decisions.
    Third, noise trading will only have an impact on expectations and information aggregation
insofar as it adds noise to the price process. Noise trades based on observable variables will not
affect equilibrium expectations.
    Since the part of noise trading conditioning only on observable variables, T k , does not affect
equilibrium expectations, we set it to zero for the remainder of the paper.

3.3.2   Step 3: Verification of guess

Whereas the previous two steps give us a framework for thinking about the equilibrium, we need
to make sure the guess for the equilibrium structure is indeed correct. We proceed in three steps
that demonstrate the consistency of each of the three statements in Lemma 2.

     The second and third statements in Lemma 1 posit that a household’s consumption, labor
supply, and investment decisions can only depend on the variables included in the vector Sit =
{S̄t , Eit }, whereas S̄t determines all aggregate variables and prices. Assuming these statements
are correct, we can write any individual choice as a function xi (Sit ) and all aggregate variables
                                   
and prices as functions as X S̄t . Plugging this structure into the model’s equilibrium conditions
and re-arranging terms results in a form

                                   gl (Sit ) = Eit [gr (Sit , Sit+1 )] ,                       (55)

where gl (·) and gr (·) are analytic, continuously differentiable functions, and we have used the
fact that S̄t ⊂ Sit . (See Appendix B.3 for the full list of equilibrium conditions and analytical
details.)
     Because the functions xi (Sit ) are the solution to the system of equations (55), the key to
showing the first part of Lemma 1 is to show we can rewrite Eit [gr (Sit , Sit+1 )] as a function of
Sit . If all equilibrium conditions depend only on Sit , the same must be true for the the optimal


                                                   19
behavior that is derived from these conditions. The proof follows from Taylor’s theorem and the
properties of the multivariate normal distribution.
   We begin by rewriting gr as a function of all elements of Sit
                                                                                

                                                                                           ϕjt+1

                                                                                                 q̂t+1   j7
                                                                                                       Ēt+1   j8
                                                                                                              Eit+1
                                     j
                                              j!

The first equality follows from assumptions Q1 and Q3, which implies that we can rewrite Tt+1 as
a function of state variables known in period t and the noise shock τ t+1 . For the second equality,
we replace gr with its infinite-order Taylor series expansion, where K0 is the level of capital at
the deterministic steady state, cj (Sit ) denotes the (state-t dependent) coefficients of the Taylor
series, and j = (j1 , j2 , j3 , j4 , j5 , j6 , j7 , j8 ) is a multi-index for the expansion. (Note that to save
space, we have absorbed all the terms depending on Sit into the coefficients of the expansion.)
     Now we take the expectation of gr conditional on St , sit , and Qt . The terms depending on Kt+1
and ω t are known at time t and can thus be taken outside the expectations operator. Moreover, we
get a series of terms depending on the conditional expectation of ϕt+1 . Since ϕt+1 is unpredictable
for an investor at time t and all shocks are uncorrelated with each other, the first-order term
is 0, and all the higher-order terms are known moments of the unconditional distribution of ϕ
Eit [ϕjt+1 ] = E[ϕjt+1 ] (recall that all higher-order moments of the normal distribution are fully
                                                                                                         j
determined by its mean and variance). The same is true for the terms depending on Eit [q̂t+1                ]=
     j            j           j                       j           j
E[q̂t+1 ], Eit [Ēt+1 ] = E[Ēt+1 ], and Eit [Eit+1 ] = E[Eit+1 ], because all three arguments are normally
distributed and have an unconditional mean and variance that follows directly from Lemma 2.
The only terms remaining inside the expectations operator are those depending on τ t and η t+1 .
We can thus write
                                              ∞ X ∞
                                             X       ĉjk (Sit , Kt+1 , ρω t−1 + σ η η t )
                  Eit [ĝr [Sit , Sit+1 ]] =                                               Eit [τ jt η kt+1 ]
                                             j=0 k=0
                                                                    j!k!                                              (56)
                                          = gl (Kt , Tt , ω t−1 , η t , ϕt , q̂t , Ēt , Eit ),

where the coefficients ĉjk (Sit , Kt+1 , ω t ) collect all the terms depending on Kt+1 , ω t , and the higher
unconditional moments of η t+1 , Ēt+1 , and Eit+1 .
    To deal with the remaining conditional term, Eit [τ jt η kt+1 ], we use the fact that the two random
variables are independent. As a result, their monomials τ jt and η kt+1 do not co-vary and we can
calculate them independently.
                                                                                               
                Eit [τ jt η kt+1 ] = Covit τ jt , η kt+1 + Eit [τ jt ]Eit η kt+1 = Eit τ jt Eit η kt+1 .


                                                               20
Now note from Lemma 2 that η t+1 is conditionally normal distributed, where its mean and
variance are given by (51) and (52), respectively. All higher moments, that is, the conditional
expectation of monomials η jt+1 for j > 2 are fully determined by the conditional mean and
variance. Since the conditional variance does not vary over time, we merely have to keep track
of the conditional mean to recover the entire conditional distribution.
    Similarly, the conditional distribution of τ t is normal, as we show in Appendix B.4. The
conditional variance is again constant and the conditional mean of τ t is simply a function of q̂
and the conditional mean of η t+1 . From (27), we can write

                                         Eit [τ t ] = (1 − α2 )q̂t − α1 Eit [η t+1 ].                                   (57)

Finally, in deriving the set of individual state variables, we notice that contingent claims trading
eliminates any meaningful distribution of capital across time, such that any heterogeneity in
equilibrium behavior arises exclusively due to cross-sectional variation in Eit . It follows that we
can write Eit [gr (Sit , Sit+1 )] as a function of Sit , concluding the proof of the first statement in
Lemma 1.
    The second part of Lemma 1 states that aggregate quantities and prices depend on Sit , Ēt ,
and q̂. To see this result, consider an aggregate variable of the form
                                                                Z
                                                 X(S̄t ) =            xi (Sit )di,                                      (58)

where X can represent aggregate capital (43), labor, or consumption (44). Again, without loss
of generality we rewrite the right-hand side of the equation as an infinite-order Taylor series
expansion in the elements of Sit ,
                      Z                     Z X
                                                cj
                          xi (Sit )di =                   (Kt − K0 )j1 ω jt−1
                                                                           2
                                                                              η jt 3 ϕjt 4 q̂tj5 Ētj6 Eitj7 di.        (59)
                                                 j
                                                     j!

Only the last term differs across households and thus all other variables can be taken outside the
integral. The integral over Eit can be rewritten as
                Z                 Z                                   j
                                                                            !       "            Z
                                                                      X         j
                    Eitj di   =                            j
                                      (Eit − Ēt + Ēt ) di =                           Ētj−k       (Eit − Ēt )k di   (60)
                                                                      k=0
                                                                                k

Now we can use the fact that Eit − Ēt = α1 ν i , such that we can replace the last remaining term
in the integral with the unconditional moments of ν i , which are known. Therefore, all aggregate
variables and prices are a function of q̂t and Ēt , but not a function of Eit , such that equation
(58) holds.
    Although households’ policies are non-linear in Eit = Ēt + α1 ν it , aggregate variables thus


                                                                 21
depend only on Ēt because the integral of a function of a conditionally normally distributed
variable depends only on its conditional mean (Ēt ) and its conditional variance which is invariant
over time and depends only on the parameters of the model.

     The first part of Lemma 1 states that Qt depends only on St and q̂t but not on the average
expectation, Ēt . We can see from (27) and (23) that Qt is fully determined by It /Kt . Because Kt
is itself a commonly known state variable (a part of St ), it follows that the equilibrium stock price
function will depend on the same arguments as aggregate investment. From assumption Q2, we
know that the state-dependent distribution of noise trader demand is such that It = I(St , q̂t ),
and therefore Qt = Q(St , q̂t ), concluding the proof of the Lemma.

    T τ has a state-dependent distribution such that the noise trading shock τ adds linearly to the
average expectation. The only remaining question is then what this state-dependent distribution
of noise trader demand must look like and how we can compute it. The resource constraint in
equation (46) links aggregate variables and noise trading with investment.
    To compute the state-dependent distribution explicitly, we rewrite (46) as

                                       ˆ t , Ēt , q̂t ) + T̂ τ (St , q̂t , Ēt , τ t ) = I(St , q̂t ),
                                       I(S                                                                                           (61)

where T̂ τ ≡ T τ /Qt . We can then replace the expressions on both sides of the equation with their
Taylor series and iteratively match the coefficients of T̂ τ such that the equation holds.

 T̂0τ + T̂Sτ Ŝt + T̂Ēτ Ē + T̂q̂τ q̂ + T̂ττ τ t + . . . + Iˆ0 + IˆS Ŝt + IˆĒ Ē + Iˆq̂ q̂ + . . . = I0 + IS Ŝt + Iq̂ q̂ + . . . , (62)

where we denote Fx as the derivative of the function F with respect to x. In particular, FS is the
vector of derivatives of F with respect to each element of the vector of commonly known state
variables St and Ŝt refers to deviations of the elements of St from their deterministic steady-
state values. To a first order, the implied distribution of T̂tτ only needs to add noise to average
expectation,

                                                                                                         Vt [η t+1 ]
                       T̂0τ = 0         T̂Sτ = 0          T̂Ēτ = 0        T̂q̂τ = 0         T̂ττ = IˆĒ             ,               (63)
                                                                                                             σ 2η

which then determines aggregate investment as a function of known state variables and q̂, such
that
                      I0 = Iˆ0    IS = T̂Sτ   Iq̂ = Iˆq̂ + T̂q̂τ + IˆĒ + T̂ττ .          (64)

The matching of higher-order coefficients is analogous.
   Using this procedure we can thus solve for T τ as a power series in τ and the state variables

As in the linear model, there is thus exactly one distribution of noise trader demand shocks which
closes the model.
    Using these insights, we solve the model using standard perturbation techniques. Perturbation
methods approximate equilibrium policy functions by their Taylor series around the deterministic
steady-state. To arrive at the coefficients of the Taylor series, we bring all equilibrium conditions
into the appropriate form shown in equation (55). Successively differentiating the equation,
evaluating at the steady-state, and solving the resulting system of equations for the coefficients
in the Taylor series delivers the approximate solutions for the equilibrium policy functions and
prices.


4     Qualitative Results
Upshot from the analysis above is that given Assumptions Q1-Q3, we can separate the solution
of the DSGE model from its information microstructure. Doing so allows us to characterize the
the dynamic effects of dispersed information with some generality.
    Contrary to a representative agent setting, the model with dispersed information leads to
a cross-sectional distribution of choices. A key statistic this distribution is the cross-sectional
variance of posterior expectations

    Recall from Lemma 1 that households’ policy functions can be characterized as a function
of the state vector {St , q̂t , Ēt , Eit }. Without loss of generality, we can use equation (45) and the
fact that Eit [η t+1 ] = α0 + α1 sit + α2 q̂t to re-write this state vector as {St , τ , Ēt , ν it }. Without
using any further information about the information microstructure, we can then use a standard
perturbation approach to solve for all endogenous variables of the model as a function of these

where the coefficients denoted c on the right-hand side are numbers that are determined by the
usual “macroeconomic” parameters of the model but independent of the parameters relating to
information and noise. In other words, any representative agent DSGE model implies such a series
of c’s, where we denote cx as the derivative of the equilibrium aggregate consumption function
with respect to x. In particular, cS is the vector of derivatives of the aggregate consumption
function with respect to each element of the vector of commonly known state variables St , and
Ŝt refers to deviations of the elements of St from their deterministic steady-state values.
     The grouping of terms on the right-hand side in (66) isolates the effect of the information
microstructure on aggregate consumption. (The effects on all other aggregate variables have the
same form, except that the coefficients c will be different when we consider output, investment,
or aggregate labor supply.) The first set of terms on the right-hand side give the solution for
aggregate consumption that would obtain in a standard RBC model containing no information
about the future, σ ν = ∞, and no noise trading, σ τ = 0. c0 + c′S Ŝt is the first-order Taylor
series in deviations of the commonly known state variables from their deterministic steady-state
values, and 12 cσ2 is the effect of risk on the level of consumption in the standard RBC model.
     The second set of terms gives the direct effect of noise trading. Even when households learn
nothing about the future (σ ν = ∞), τ has a direct effect on consumption (and all business-
cycle moments) as asset purchases and sales of stocks effectively add and subtract resources
from the economy. The second term in the grouping shows that when noise traders are active,
they effectively increase the risk faced by households and thus add to the level effect of risk on
consumption.
     The third grouping shows the effect of information provision in a model in which σ ν = 0. If
households are perfectly informed about η t+1 they fully react to this information in t, altering
the dynamic response of economic aggregates to the long-run productivity shock. In addition,
learning about the future reduces the uncertainty households face, and thus may mitigate the
effect of risk on the level of economic aggregates (the second term in the grouping).
     The fourth grouping gives the dynamic and level effects of dispersed information. When
information is dispersed and σ ν > 0, households need to rely on q̂t when learning about η t+1 .
When σ τ > 0, this inference is not perfect, such that (α1 + α2 ) < 1. Dispersion in households’


                                                      24
private information then dampens the reaction of economic aggregates to η t+1 (see the first term
in the round brackets). When α2 > 0, households also react to τ when making their equilibrium
consumption, labor-supply, and investment decisions (the second term in the round brackets).
    In addition, when α1 > 0, households rely on their (now noisy) private signal when making
decisions, such that equilibrium consumption will differ across households. Because households’
policy functions are non-linear, this dispersion in equilibrium behavior has itself a level-effect
on all economic aggregates. In particular, if individual households’ consumption is concave in
        
Eit η t+1 , the dispersion in household expectations lowers the level of aggregate consumption.


5     Quantitative Analysis
5.1    Calibration and Estimation
As is standard practice in the long-run risk literature, we calibrate our model to a monthly
frequency and focus on time-aggregated statistics matching the behavior of annualized moments
for the US economy 1929-2008 (Bansal and Yaron, 2004).
    Our model depends on 15 parameters, 13 of which are identical to the parameters in the
original real business cycle model by Croce (2013). To focus on the incremental effect of dispersed
information within this framework, we set all of these 13 parameters to equal the ones in Croce’s
benchmark calibration.

Notes: Values of the 13 technology and preference parameters used in all following calibrations
and estimations. α: capital share; δ k : capital depreciation rate; ξ: elasticity of the adjustment
cost function; µa : average growth of productivity; ρ: auto-correlation of long-run component
in productivity growth; σ η : standard deviation of shock to the long-run component in produc-
tivity growth; σ ϕ : standard deviation of short-run component in productivity; ξ l : consumption
bundle elasticity; o consumption share in the consumption bundle; γ: relative risk aversion; ψ:
intertemporal elasticity of substitution; δ: subjective discount factor and φlev : leverage of market
return.

   Table 1 lists the parameter values. On the technology side, α is set to match the capital
income share and δ k is set to match the annualized capital depreciation rate in the US economy

                                                 25
(6%). The elasticity of the adjustment cost function, ξ, is set to 7, such that investment can
be sufficiently volatile. In addition, Croce sets µa = 0.0015 to yield an annual average growth
of 1.8%. The long-run component in productivity, ω t , is calibrated so as to be relatively small
but persistent, where ρ is set to yield an annualized persistence of 0.80. To keep the long-run
component as small as in the data, he imposes σ η = 10% σ ϕ , where σ ϕ is set as 1% to obtain an
annual volatility of output growth of 3.34% under the benchmark calibration.
    On the preference side, the consumption bundle elasticity is ξ l = 1 for simplicity. The
parameter o is calibrated so that the labor share is 18% at the steady state. The relative risk
aversion and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution are set to values of 10 and 2, respectively.
The annualized subjective discount factor δ is fixed at 0.95.
    We also follow Croce (2013) in calculating excess stock returns as the excess returns on a
levered claim to capital
                                                         φlev
                                       LEV             f
                                     Rex,t = Rt − Rt−1          .                                (67)

This practice, again, is standard in the finance literature because, in the data, most claims
to equity are levered, where we set φlev = 2, consistent with the amount of financial leverage
measured by Rauh and Sufi (2012).
   Finally, the parameters v1 and v2 in the adjustment cost function are setsuch that, at the
                                                                                1
deterministic steady-state, Gt = 0 and ∂Gt /∂ (It /Kt ) = 0. This implies v0 = 1−ξ (δ + eµ − 1)
                          1
and v1 = (δ + eµ − 1) ξ .
   For parsimony, we also assume that noise trader make only random, and no conditional
purchases, such that T k (St ) = 0.
   Before the introduction of dispersed information, our calibration thus exactly coincides with
the one in Croce (2013).10 The two remaining parameters, σ ν and σ τ determine the size of
noise trader demand shocks, the dispersion in private signals, and therefore the equilibrium
expectations of all households. We estimate both parameters to minimize the loss function

                                             (m − θ) W (m − θ) ,                                              (68)

where m is a vector of moments generated by the model, θ is the vector of data targets for these
moments, and W is a diagonal matrix where each entry is θ12 , and θj is the j’th entry in θ. We
                                                              j
thus minimize a weighted sum of squared deviations from the target vector.
   We first present a set of results for which we calibrate noise trader demand shocks, σ τ , to a
reasonable ballpark and estimate only σ ν . In these specifications, we choose σ τ such that the
unconditional variance of T τ equals one half of the standard deviation of the growth rate of asset
  10
     The only way in which we deviate from his framework is that we do not introduce exogenous cash-flow shocks
to levered returns (67). We omit this detail for clarity, because our objective here is not to argue for or against
the ability of the long-run risk model to match the volatility of stock returns in the data.

purchases by the Federal Reserve between 1948 and 2008 (0.43% of GDP). In a second set of
results, we freely estimate both σ τ and σ ν to minimize the deviation from the target moments
given in equation (68).
    Although we do not explicitly allow households to trade in bonds, we measure the risk-free
rate of interest as the shadow rate implied by the stochastic discount factor of the household
that holds the average expectation Eit [η t+1 ] = Ēt .


5.2    Results
Table 2 shows our basic results for a range of parameters σ ν and σ τ . Throughout, lowercase
variables denote logs, σ (·) and corr (·) denote standard deviations and correlations, respectively,
and d stands for the first difference in the time series (e.g., σ(dy) stands for the standard deviation
of output growth). Column 2 lists the data targets and the remaining columns list the moments
generated by the model. All data targets except the one for σ xs (E [dy]) are generated using
annual data ranging from 1929-2008 following the procedure in Croce (2013) (see appendix C.1 for
details). σ xs (E [dy]) is our measure of the cross-sectional dispersion of equilibrium expectations.
We calculate it as the time-series average of the cross-sectional standard deviation in annualized
forecasts of GDP growth in Survey of Professional Forecasters for the period 1969-2008.
    The two remaining moments in the second panel have no direct counterpart in the data.
σ (kit /KSS ) is the time-series average of the cross-sectional standard deviation in equity portfolio
holdings relative to the deterministic steady state level of capital, which is a simple measure
of the dispersion in equilibrium behavior induced by dispersion in equilibrium expectations. In
the data, differences in behavior due to differences in expectations are of course conflated with
large differences in wealth across households, such that we have no obvious moment in the
data to which we can compare our model’s prediction. The same applies to our measure of
information revelation, Vt [η] /σ 2η , calculated as the ratio of the posterior variance of η, divided
by its unconditional variance. When this ratio is 1, no information is revealed in equilibrium.
When it is zero, households can perfectly infer η t+1 one period in advance.
    Column 3 (‘No Info’) shows Croce’s original calibration in which households receive no infor-
mation about the future productivity shock (σ ν = ∞). In this limit, our model coincides with
a standard DSGE model in which all shocks are unknown ex-ante. Column 4 (‘News Shocks’)
shows the opposite extreme in which households receive perfectly accurate private signals about
the future productivity shock (σ ν = 0). In both specifications all households have identical in-
formation sets (no information in the former and full information in the latter). The comparison
between these two specifications thus shows the effect of common information about η on the mo-
ments generated by the model (the third set of terms in (66)). Comparing the coefficients across
rows shows that the provision of common information has only a small effect on conventional
business cycle moments such as σ (dy) and σ (dc). However, it has a larger effect on all moments

that relate to the consumption/savings decision. For example, the equity premium falls from
4.54% in the case without information to 4.49% in the case of perfect information. Similarly,
the risk-free interest rate rises from 0.89% to 0.91% between these two scenarios. These effects
of information provision make intuitive sense. In our model, households worry about shocks to
long-run productivity. When these shocks are revealed one month in advance, the unconditional
variance of stock returns fall from 4.97% to 4.94%. In addition, households require a lower risk
premium for holding stocks and have less incentive to engage in precautionary savings behavior.
As a result, the equity premium falls and the risk-free rate rises.
    In column 5 (‘Grossman Eq.’), we show results for the case in which σ ν < ∞, while σ τ = 0.
In this case, the stock price becomes perfectly revealing of innovations to productivity η t+1 ,
as predicted by Corollary 1. Although households receive noisy private signals ex-ante, their
posterior expectation is perfectly accurate, such that the dispersion of information has no effect
on households’ equilibrium behavior. The moments given in this column thus are exactly the
same as those in column 3.
    Although the overall effect of information provision may appear small in this calibration, it
is important to keep in mind that we are evaluating the effects of learning about a small shock
to the long-run component of productivity. We show below that many moments of the model


                                                28
are more sensitive to the provision of information about the (much larger) short-run shock to
productivity. In addition, all our calculations consider learning about shocks one month, rather
than a year or a decade, in advance. While this experiment is a natural starting point because
long-run risk models are typically calibrated to monthly data, the model should be interesting
at any other frequency as well. In a calibration to annual data, for example, households would
learn a year in advance about a larger (annual-sized) shock, such that learning presumably would
have a much larger effect on all aspects of the model. Although an in-depth analysis of the effect
of information provision at different frequencies is beyond the scope of the present paper, we
believe it is an important avenue for future research.


5.3    Reasonably Sized Noise Trader Shocks
In column 6, we set the annualized standard deviation of noise trader demand shocks to 0.43%
of GDP11 and estimate σ ν to match the cross-sectional standard deviation of expectations of
GDP growth from the Survey of Economic Forecasters. The estimation returns σ ν = 3.2 · σ η , in
which case the model is able to generate a cross-sectional dispersion in equilibrium expectations
of 0.05% (compared to 0.28% in the data). Similarly, the cross-sectional dispersion of stock
holdings is small (0.04%).
    Figure 1 plots the comparative statics over σ ν for the three variables in the second panel
of Table 2. The comparative static for the objective of our estimation, σ xs (E[dy]), is given in
the middle of the figure. It shows that no heterogeneity occurs across households in equilibrium
expectations when households receive a perfectly revealing private signal (σ ν /σ η = 0). For
moderate amounts of noise in the private signal, this heterogeneity rapidly increases, peaks at
around (σ ν /σ η = 5), and then monotonically decreases.
    To gain intuition for this result, we can write using equations (65) and (53)
                                                                           2
                                                         Vt [η t+1 ]/σ 2η
                                   Vt [α1 ν it ] =                               σ 2η .             (69)
                                                             σ ν /σ η

To the left of the figure, Vt [η t+1 ]/σ 2η = 0 and the dispersion of equilibrium expectations is zero.
As we move to the right of the figure, the precision of the private signal decreases, the mar-
ket’s capacity to aggregate information deteriorates, and Vt [η t+1 ]/σ 2η rises, such that households
rely more on their private signal when forming expectations. Toward the middle of the graph,
Vt [η t+1 ]/σ 2η begins to converge to one and the increase in the denominator, σ ν /σ η , begins to dom-
inate. As the information content of stock prices and the precision of the private signal continue
to deteriorate, households rely more and more on their priors and reduce weight on their private
signal. Heterogeneity in equilibrium expectations thus peaks at an intermediate value of σ ν . For
  11
    As a rough reference, this corresponds to about one half of the standard deviation of government bond
purchases by the Federal Reserve 1970-2013.

                                                         29
a given size of the noise trader demand shock, the information microstructure thus requires that
heterogeneity in equilibrium behavior is bounded from above.
    The conclusion from our estimation in column 6 of Table 2 is that for a reasonable size of
noise trader demand shocks, this upper bound is about an order of magnitude smaller than the
dispersion of equilibrium expectations we observe in the data.
    Another interesting result in column 6 of Table 2 is that some moments, such as the equity
premium and the risk-free rate, fall into the range established by the “no information” case in
column 3 and the “full information” case in column 4. However, most other moments, such as
the standard deviation of output (3.53% vs. 3.58% and 3.57%) and the correlation of investment
growth with consumption growth (0.41 vs. 0.29 and 0.30) fall well outside of this range.
    To further investigate this finding, Figure 2 plots the comparative statics of selected moments
in column 6 of Table 2 over σ ν . In each panel of the figure, the horizontal dashed line represents
the moment generated in the “no information” case (column 3) and the horizontal dotted line
represents the same moment in the “full information” case (column 4).
    The figure shows that all moments coincide with the moment from the “full information”
case when the private signal is fully precise, and appear to converge to the moment from the “no
information” case as σ ν becomes large. However, for an intermediate range around σ ν /σ η = 3.2,
the standard deviation of output growth, the standard deviation of stock returns, and the ratios
of the standard deviations of output and investment growth to output growth are well below
that range. Similarly, the correlation of consumption growth and investment growth, as well as
the correlation of consumption growth with stock returns, are well above that range.
    Comparing these results with Figure 1 suggests the same forces that drive heterogeneity in
households’ equilibrium expectations also affect the quantitative results for these moments, be-
cause the same value of σ ν that maximizes dispersion in equilibrium expectations also maximizes
the effect of a given shock to noise trader demand on households’ expectations. To see this,
note from (51) that the coefficient on τ t in households’ equilibrium expectation is Vt [η t+1 ]α1 /σ 2τ .
Substituting (53) yields Vt [η t+1 ]2 /(σ 2ν σ 2τ ), which, for a given σ τ , has its maximum at the same
σ ν as (69). The patterns in Figure 1 can thus be explained by the effect of noise trader demand
shocks on the equilibrium expectations held by households (the fourth set of terms in (66)).
    Figure 3 shows the effect of a two-standard-deviation (positive) shock to the long-run compo-
nent of productivity in month 10, where again the dashed line corresponds to the no-information
case, the dotted line to the full-information case, and the solid line to the specification in column
6 of Table 2. The graph shows that the no-information and the full-information case look similar
in the sense that they show large effects on output growth in the period in which the shock
is revealed. By contrast, the solid line shows a partial adjustment in each period, and thus a
smoother adjustment to the shock. The reason is that households that see a rise in the stock
price are unsure whether this rise is a result of a noise trader demand shock or an productivity


                                                   30
shock. They thus partially adjust to potentially good news in month 9 and adjust fully only
when the shock is realized in period 10.
    The two panels on the left of Figure 4 show the effect of dispersion in equilibrium behavior
on the level of consumption and labor supply that corresponds to the fourth grouping of terms
on the right-hand side of (66). It shows that even moderate dispersion in equilibrium expec-
tations may have a surprisingly large effect on the level of both aggregate variables. Because
the consumption function is concave in Eit+1 [η t+1 ], the dispersion in consumption choices lowers
aggregate consumption by up to 0.015%. Similarly, dispersion in labor-supply decisions may
lower aggregate labor supply by up to 0.03% (note that households’ labor-supply decisions are
convex in Eit+1 [η t+1 ]).
    The two panels to the right of Figure 4 compare this level effect of dispersion with the level
effect of risk that is present even if the model has a representative agent (the first grouping of
terms in (66)). It shows that in both cases, the level effect of dispersion is up to an order of
magnitude larger than the level effect of risk in a representative agent framework.
    In column 4 of Table 3, we choose σ ν to minimize (68) for the full vector of data moments
in column 2. Since the “no-information” model in column 3 already gives a reasonably good
fit to the data, it is not surprising that we obtain a relatively large estimate σ ν /σ η = 6.4,
such that households learn little about future productivity in equilibrium (Vt [η]/σ 2η = 0.97). As
a result, the macroeconomic and financial moments remain close to those in column 2. The
only significant difference between the two specifications is that in column 4, the cross-sectional
variance of equilibrium expectations is non-degenerate with σ xs (E[dy]) = 0.04%.


5.4    Large Noise Trader Demand Shocks
In column 5, we repeat the same exercise, but now simultaneously estimate the standard deviation
of noise trader demand shocks and the precision of the private signal. Minimization of the
distance to target moments in equation (68) returns a standard deviation of noise trader demand
shocks of 4.3% of GDP and σ ν /σ η = 3.2. In equilibrium households again learn little about
the future productivity shock (Vt [η]/σ 2η = 0.95), but the very large noise trader demand shocks
significantly improve the overall fit of the model. In particular, large noise trader demand shocks
increase the equity premium to 4.66% (relative to 4.54% in column 2), while lowering the risk-free
rate to 0.82%.
    In column 6, we ask how much heterogeneity in equilibrium behavior the model can produce,
by choosing both the size of the noise trader demand shocks and the precision of the private signal
to match the cross-sectional standard deviation of equilibrium expectations. This estimation
again returns σ τ /σ η = 4.3 (the largest noise trader demand shocks on our grid) and σ ν /σ η = 1.6.
For this extreme set of parameters, the model generates a cross-sectional standard deviation of
expected GDP growth of 0.11%, which is about factor four larger than the dispersion we were

able to generate in Table 2. Nevertheless, the estimate is still less then half the size of the
dispersion observed in the data (0.28%).


5.5    Learning about the Short-Run Shock
Figure 5 shows the same comparative static as Figure 2 for the case in which households receive
private signals about the short-run shock to productivity, ϕ, rather than the long-run shock, η.
Both models coincide when households have no information about the future (the red dashed
line). In all panels the moments estimated for the dispersed information case are now in between
the bounds set by the “no information” and the “full information” specifications. In addition,
the overall effect of information provision on the standard deviation of output and the other four
moments shown on the top of the figure is now smaller than in Figure 2. However, learning about
the short-run shock has a much larger effect on the equity premium which now ranges between
4.53 in the “no information” case and 3.65 in the “full information” case. Similarly, the risk-free
rate now ranges between 0.89 and 1.32, showing a much larger effect than when households learn
about the long-run component of productivity.


                                                32
    The conclusion from this figure is that the effects of dispersed information on the moments
generated by the model vary depending on what kind of information households receive. In
our example, learning about a persistent shock has relatively larger effects on the dynamics
of household behavior, while learning about an i.i.d. shock has relatively larger effects on the
risk-free rate and the equity premium. Since modern DSGE models often feature a range of
different shocks that affect the economy at different frequencies, a more general analysis of these
relationships is beyond the scope of the current paper. However, we hope that our work will
facilitate future research in this area.


6    Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced a solution method that allows us to incorporate the information
microstructure of a standard noisy rational expectations model into the framework of a contem-
porary DSGE model. We showed that under mild assumptions on the distribution of noise trader
demand shocks, the main qualitative results of the canonical noisy rational expectations model
carry over to the non-linear framework. One of these findings is that any component of noise
trader demand that is contingent on variables that are observable by households does not affect
equilibrium expectations as long as the equilibrium price function remains monotonic in the pro-
ductivity shock. An immediate corollary to this result is that any monetary or fiscal policy that
conditions only on publicly observable variables does not affect the equilibrium informativeness
of stock prices.
    Our quantitative exercise yields four main insights. The first main insight is that households’
ability to learn about the future affects consumption-savings decisions. A major shortcoming of
the present framework is that it does not lend itself to a welfare analysis of these quantitative
effects, mainly because noise trading implies large wealth transfers between maximizing house-
holds and non-maximizing noise traders, which are hard to judge from a normative perspective.
In a related paper (Hassan and Mertens, 2010), we propose to solve this conceptual problem by
introducing a single class of near-rational households.
    The second main insight is that the differences in opinion about future GDP growth reflected
in the Survey of Professional Forecasters are hard to rationalize within a noisy rational expecta-
tions model. For a reasonable size of noise trader demand shocks, the dispersion of equilibrium
expectations in the model remains an order of magnitude smaller than that in the data.
    Third, even when households have moderate differences of opinion in equilibrium, their ex-
pectations about the future, and thus their behavior, may load on non-fundamental noise trader
demand shocks. As a result, the effect of the demand shocks on household expectations may dra-
matically change the moments generated by the model. Although these changes did not improve
the overall fit of the model to the data in the example we study in this paper, they may do so in


                                                33
a range of other applications. The main point is that the noisy rational expectations framework
predicts that households rationally respond to non-fundamental noise in equilibrium. Our quan-
titative exercise shows this response is large enough to affect the quantitative predictions of the
DSGE model.
    Fourth, when noise trader demand shocks are (unreasonably) large, these demand shocks no
longer have a large effect on household expectations but nevertheless directly affect the quanti-
tative predictions of the model.
    The objective of this paper was to merge the most standard information microstructure of a
noisy rational expectations model with a standard DSGE model. We view this effort as a first
step towards integrating the rich representations of financial markets developed by the noisy ra-
tional expectations literature into the standard macroeconomic framework that is conventionally
used for quantitative and policy analysis. Interesting avenues for future research include the
effect of fiscal and monetary policy on the informativeness of stock prices, the welfare effects of
information aggregation in financial markets, and an in-depth analysis of the dynamic effects of
private information about fundamental shocks at various frequencies. In addition, future work
may consider richer information microstructures that include dynamic learning and higher-order
uncertainty.

B.4      Proof of Lemma 2
Given Lemma 1, it follows immediately that
                                                                              

We can thus guess that the rational expectation of η t+1 to be the linear function

                                           Eit [η t+1 ] = α0 + α1 sit + α2 q̂t ,                           (83)

where α0 , α1 , and α2 are the optimal weights on the prior, the private signal and the average
expectation, respectively. Substituting in (45), taking the integral across individuals, and solving
   R          
for Eit η t+1 gives
                           Z

                               Eit [η t+1 ]di =         +       η t+1 +             τ t.                   (84)
                                                  1 − α2 1 − α2         1 − α2 σ 2η

         Vt [η]
Adding    σ 2η
                τt   on both sides of the equation, substituting (45) and simplifying yields

                                       1 − α2       α0           1 Vt [η]
                                              q̂t −    = η t+1 +          τ t.                             (85)

(η t+1 , sit , q̂t ) has an unconditional expectation of

C.1        Data Sources
Consumption (Ct ). Per-capita consumption data are from the National Income and Prod-
uct Accounts (NIPA) annual data reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The
data are constructed as the sum of consumption expenditures on nondurable goods and services
(Table 1.1.5, Lines 5 and 6) deflated by corresponding price deflators (Table 1.1.9, Lines 5 and 6).

Physical Investment (It ). Per-capita physical investment data are also from the NIPA tables.
We measure physical investment by fixed investment (Table 1.1.5, Line 8) minus information-
processing equipment (Table 5.5.5, Line 3) deflated by its price deflator (Table 1.1.9, Line 8).
Information-processing equipment is interpreted as investment in intangible capital and is there-
fore subtracted from fixed investment.

Output (Yt ). It is the sum of total consumption and investment, that is, Ct + It . We exclude
government expenditure and net export because they are not explicitly modeled in our economy.




                                                                                    45
Labor (Nt ). It is measured as the total number of full-time and part-time employees as reported
in the NIPA Table 6.4. Data are annual.

Stock market returns (Rt ) and Risk-free rate (Rtf ) The stock market return are from the
Fama-French dataset available online on K. French′ s webpage at
   http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/ftp/F-F Research Data Factors.zip.
The nominal risk-free rate is measured by the annual three-month T-bill return. The real stock
market returns and risk-free rate are computed by subtracting realized inflation (annual CPI
through FRED) from the nominal risk-free rate.

Price-dividends (pdt ) ratio and Tobin′ s Q (Qt ). Data on annual price-dividend ratio, and
dividend are obtained from CRSP. Annual dividends are obtained by time-aggregating monthly
dividends. Nominal dividends are turned into real dividends using the CPI index. Data on
Tobin′ s Q are from the Flow of Funds (FoF) and are obtained directly from the St. Louis Fed
by dividing the variable MVEONWMVBSNNCB (Line 35 of Table B.102 in the FoF report) by
TNWMVBSNNCB (Line 32 of table B.102 in the FoF report).

GDP Forecast (ŷit and ŷt ). GDP forecast data during 1969-2010 are from the Survey of
Professional Forecasters provided by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve at
   http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/survey-of-professional-forecasters/
