                                            ABSTRACT

This paper develops framework to estimate and interpret the factor content of equilibrium real
exchange rates. The framework – which builds on Backus, Foresi, and Telmer (2001) and Ang
Piazzesi (2003) – respects the restrictions imposed by stochastic discount factors that generate
standard, no arbitrage, essentially affine term structure models of inflation indexed bond yields in
a home and a foreign country. We derive a sufficient set of parameter restrictions on the SDFs
that deliver a stationary real exchange rate that is linear in the factors that govern the evolution of
the SDFs. Our model implies that both the real exchange rate, and the ex ante real exchange rate
risk premium at any horizon are linear functions of a “home” and ”foreign” factors and that
inflation indexed bond yields are functions of these factors as well as a “global” factor that
accounts for the observed correlation in bond yield levels across countries. Home and foreign
factors in turn are simple linear functions of the level slope and curvature factors extracted from
home and foreign yield curves a la Litterman and Scheinkman (1991). We find that a real
exchange rate risk premium accounts for about half the variance of the dollar – pound real
exchange rate and that this risk premium if fully accounted for by the traditional level, slope, and
curve curve factors in the UK linkers curve. We find that a home factor accounts for about 40
percent of the variance of the real exchange rate, and that this home factor is fully accounted for
by the US specific component of the LS level factor in the US TIPs curve.

1.      Introduction
        This paper develops framework to estimate and interpret the factor content of equilibrium real
exchange rates . The framework respects the restrictions on bond yields and the real exchange rate
imposed by stochastic discount factors that generate standard, no arbitrage, essentially affine term
structure models of inflation indexed bond yields in a home and a foreign country. It builds on the
pioneering contributions of Backus, Foresi, and Telmer (2001] and Ang and Piazzesi (2003) but extends
the literature along several dimensions that are of empirical and practical relevance. We show that , in
general, global equilibrium in a world comprised of countries with stochastic discount factors that
generate affine term structures will in general generate a non stationary real exchange rate that is a non
linear function of the state variables (factors) that govern the evolution of the SDFs. We derive
parameter restrictions on the SDFs that can generate a stationary real exchange rate which is a linear
function of the SDF factors and show how our system can be cast and estimated as a standard state
space model that accounts for the observed joint dynamics of inflation indexed bond yields in a home
and foreign country and the level of the real exchange rate. With the parameter estimates obtained
from that state space model, we use the results of BFT and AP to recover the deep parameters of the
home and foreign SDFs that are consistent with the joint dynamics of inflation indexed bond yields and
the level of the real exchange rate we observe in the data. An important feature of the data is that
benchmark (10 year maturity) bond yields are highly correlated across countries. One of the factors in
our model is a “ global “ factor that accounts for this correlation and that loads equally in the home and
foreign SDFs (as in the BFT (2001) , page 291; see also Lustig et. al. (2011) for a related framework that
can account for cross country variation in nominal exchange rate expected returns ). As a result, in our
specification, the global rates factor is “differenced” out and is not relevant for accounting for the real
exchange rate or the real exchange rate risk premium. The other two factors in our model are a “home
“ and a “foreign” factor that are necessary to account for the bond yield differential between the home
and foreign country and the level of the real exchange rate. Our framework also implies that any ex
ante real exchange rate risk premium that is present in the data must also be spanned by these home
and foreign factors.


        But what are these home and foreign factors? In our model the “home” factor can be written
as a linear combination of three factors : the Litterman Scheinkman (1991] “slope and “curve” factors
extracted via eigenvector decomposition from the home country yield curve plus the home country
specific component of the LS level factor. The “foreign “ factor can be decomposed in a similar fashion.

                                                                                                              2
Thus in its most general form our model predicts that up to six factors could be required to account for
the observed time series for bond yields in two counties and their real exchange rate and real exchange
rate risk premium. However, we show that as an empirical matter in our US UK data set , a much more
parsimonious factor structure can account for the data. We find that the “home factor” has a
correlation of 0.99 with the US specific component of the LS level factor extracted from the US TIPs yield
curve. We find that a stochastic risk premium accounts for about half the variance of the real exchange
rate , and that this risk premium can be fully accounted for by the UK slope , curve , and UK specific
component of the LS level factor. Finally, combining these two findings, we show that a special case of
our model which cannot be rejected empirically has a simple three factor structure that can fully
account for the real exchange rate and exchange rate risk premium time series in our data set.


        In the theoretical derivation and empirical implementation of our model, we study a three
variable system comprised benchmark inflation indexed bond yields in a home and a foreign country
and the CPI real exchange rate between those two countries. The reason for focusing on US “TIPS” and
UK “linkers” is that these are the two deepest markets for inflation indexed bonds with the longest
available time series (the US began issuing TIPS in 1997; the UK in the 1980s). But more importantly, the
theoretical linkage among real exchange rates and inflation indexed bond yields is very tight, whereas
the linkage among real exchange rates and nominal bond yields is much more complicated as it must
account for expected long horizon inflation as well the covariance between long horizon realized
inflation and the nominal SDF (see Engel (1996;2011); Campbell, Shiller, Viceira (2009)). Letting Z t,1
denote the real SDF , the nominal SDF satisfies M t,1 = Z t,1 P t/P t+1 (Cochrane (2009)). As our framework
estimates all the relevant parameters of Z t,1 from data on inflation indexed bond yields and the real
exchange rate, it can also be used to study real exchange rates and nominal bond yields given a
parametric specification of the stochastic evolution of inflation in each country. But that is a project for
future research.

1.      The Model


        Consider the following three equation block comprised of a real exchange rate and inflation
indexed bond yields in a home and a foreign country. This is a close cousin of a model studied by
Backus Foresi and Telmer (2001;page 293) that we embed in the essentially affine framework for yield
curve modeling pioneered by Ang and Piazzesi (2003). The home real stochastic discount factor (SDF) is
given by


(1)     ln Zt,1=-δ+ a(1-ρ)ht+ k(1-ρ)xt – aaet+1 – kεt+1-λht et+1 – ψ xt εt+1 – χ ft ξt+1 - 0.5vzt


The foreign real SDF is given by


(2)     ln Z*t ,1 =-δ* + b(1-ρ) ft + k(1-ρ)xt – bbξ+1 – kεt+1-λht et+1 –ψ xt εt+1 – χ ft ξt+1 - 0.5vz*t


Here ht (ft) is a ‘home’ (foreign) factor with innovation et (ξt) and xt is a global factor with innovation εt
and v t denotes conditional variance. The evolution of the log of the CPI real exchange rate under
complete markets is, by Backus and Smith (1993) , given by Δq t+1 = z*t,1 - zt,1


(3)     Δqt+1 = δ – δ* + a(ρ-1)ht – b(ρ-1)ft + aaλv h ht –bbχ v f ft + aaet+1 – bbξt+1 + 0.5(aa2vh – bb2vf)


where q t is the deviation of the real exchange rate from its unconditional mean. In what follows we
assume that δ* – δ =0.5(aa2vh – bb2vf) which is required for a stationary real exchange rate. If markets
are incomplete, a version of (3) can continue to hold with Δq t+1 = z*t,1 - zt,1 + Λt+1 with the stochastic
deviation of real exchange rate returns from complete markets Λt+1 a linear function of et+1 and ξt+1
(Brandt, Cochrane, Santa Clara (2006);BFT (2001)). This essentially affine model assumes that the state
variables h t f t and x t are independent, normal, with zero mean and evolve according to first order auto
regressions with parameter ρ (factor specific rho’s are easily handled). This implies that, in general, the
backward solution for the real exchange rate has a unit root. Suppose that these three equations are
imbedded in a larger general equilibrium model in which the real exchange rate is stationary with
constant unconditional mean. Then level of the real exchange relative to mean rate must be
determined by forward solution to equation (3) E t Δq t+1 = a(ρ-1)ht – b(ρ-1)ft + aaλv hht –bbχ v fft



                                                                                                                 4
        Using the method of undetermined coefficients the unique, stationary forward solution is


(4)     q t = {a + aa λ(ρ-1)-1}ht – {b + bbΧ(ρ-1)-1}ft


Note that this solution (4) reproduces the arbitrage dynamics for Δq t+1 if and only if aa = a + aa λ(ρ-1)-1
and bb = b + bbΧ(ρ-1)-1. Thus, given ρ which is pinned down by the physical dynamics of the state
variables, of the three SDF parameters a,aa, and λ only two can be independent if the equilibrium real
exchange rate is stationary (and similarly for b,bb, and χ). In what follows we assume these parameter
restrictions are satisfied. Thus if equations (1) to (3) are part of a general equilibrium model in which
the CPI real exchange rate is stationary, the admissible parameters of the home and foreign SDF are
restricted . Later we give an example of a simple two country general equilibrium model which satisfies
these restrictions and generates SDF’s and a real exchange rate which take the above essentially affine
structure.
         The essentially affine model has become the workhorse for studying bond yields because it
implies that yields and bond risk premia are linear in the factors even when the factors themselves are
conditionally homoscedastic. However, in general the EAM does not deliver a log real exchange that is
linear in the state but that instead, is quadratic in the state. For example, if the ‘foreign’ shock ξt is
absent from the home SDF and the’ home’ shock et is absent from the foreign SDF we will have
Δqt+1 = a(ρ-1)ht – b(ρ-1)ft + aaλht –bbχft + aaet+1 – bbξt+1 + 0.5 (λht)2 – 0.5 (χft)2.
         The inflation indexed short rate at home (relative to its mean) satisfies exp – rt - δ = Et (Z t+1)
which implies rt = a(ρ-1)ht+ k(ρ-1)xt and similarly, r*= b(ρ-1)f t+ k(ρ-1)xt . Since our SDF ‘s are of the
essentially affine class with short rates that are linear in factors, inflation linked bond yields of any
maturity will be linear in the factors. Let R t denote the yield on a benchmark inflation linked bond with
10 years to maturity expressed as a deviation from its unconditional mean. Given the structure of our
model, the loading on the ‘global’ factor x t for R t and for R*t will be identical . We will normalize this
common loading to unity. As we will show below, this normalization will facilitate interpreting our h t
and f t factors as functions of traditional level , slope, and curvature yield curve factors in the home and
foreign countries.




                                                                                                               5
        Based upon the above considerations, we will estimate the following state space model on a
monthly US and UK data set beginning in 1997:7 with the first issuance of TIPS by the US


        R t=Aht +xt
        R*t = B f t + x t
(5)     q   t   = aa h t – bb f t
        h t = ρ h t-1 + et
        f t = ρ f t-1 + ξt
        x t = ρ x t-1 + εt


        The first three equations are the measurement equations and the last three equations are the
transition equations . Under our assumptions, the model directly estimates the deep SDF parameters
aa and bb. Moreover, from AP (2003; Appendix A) and the parameter restrictions discussed above that
insure stationarity, we have A = A(aa, ρ,vh, λ) and B = B(bb , ρ,vf, χ ) which are defined by non-linear
recursions that can be solved numerically for λ and χ conditional on the estimates of the other
parameters. We impose v h = vf = v and set v0.5 = 1/12 (as we are using monthly data) and leave vx
unrestricted. Left for future research is adjusting for the relative illiquidity of inflation indexed bonds
and extending our framework in the direction of Abrahams, Adrian, Crump, and Moench (2016) to
jointly price nominal bonds, inflation indexed bonds, and real exchange rates. Also, beyond the scope of
this paper is a multi – country extension a la Hodrick and Vassalou (2002) to study real exchange rates
and inflation indexed bond yields in a panel of countries.    From (3) and the expressions for r t and r* t


(6)         Et Δqt+1 = r t – r*t + aaλv h ht –bbχ v f ft


with


(7)      θ t,1 = aaλv h ht –bbχ v f ft


the one period ex ante deviation from real uncovered interest parity for inflation linked bonds.




                                                                                                              6
        Our decomposition isolates a common global factor in inflation indexed bond yields that
satisfies the property that the common bond yield factor is “differenced out” when accounting for real
exchange rates. BFT, and more recently Lustig et. al. (2011), consider a similar structure for home and
foreign nominal interest rates and nominal exchange rate returns. BFT work with an extension of the
Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) ‘square root’ model and show that a common factor – common
coefficient SDF specification for modeling nominal interest rates and exchange rate depreciation
implies sample paths with negative nominal interest rates that are inconsistent with a square root
specification. What is new here is exploiting the level information in the real exchange rate, respecting
the parameter restrictions that insure it, and taking full advantage of the affine structure and the
advent of a global market in inflation indexed bonds to study a time series decomposition of the month
by month evolution of the real exchange rate and expected excess returns to currency speculation.
         The level of the real exchange rate as well as the ‘ Fama premium ‘ for the CPI real exchange
rate in a world with inflation indexed bonds will be linear the ht and f t factors, but what are these
factors? The most popular yield curve factor model is the model of Litterman and Scheinkman (1991)
in which the level slope and curvature factors are identified from an eigenvector decomposition of the
unconditional variance covariance matrix of bond yields at the different points along the yield curve.
Following Bliss (1997), the tradition is to achieve identification of the LS factors by assuming that
orthogonal factors have a unit variance. This is obviously arbitrary. An alternative identification which
is convenient for our purposes (and which allows for direct comparison with the decomposition
proposed by Diebold and Li (2006) as well as industry practice) is to assume factors are orthogonal with
common variance that results in a unit loading on the “level” factor in the decomposition of the
benchmark 10 year yield. This is also consistent with industry practice which defines the ‘level’ or
duration factor equal to the yield at the 10 year point on the yield curve. This normalization of variance
can always be done for any one factor at any one point on the yield curve and preserves factor
orthogonality. With this version of an LS decomposition, we will have R t = Lt + Ds St + Dc Ct with D s and
D c the loadings on the US slope and curve factors of the 10 year TIP yield and R*t = L*t + D* s S*t +
D*c C*t for the UK linker. Comparing with (5) we see immediately that h t = (Lt – xt)/A + (Ds St + D c Ct)/A
and f t = (L*t – xt)/B + (D SS*t + Dc C*t)/B. Substituting into (5) we can write the equilibrium real exchange
rate as an exact function of six factors : the slope and curve factors for each country plus the country
specific component of the home and foreign level factors.
(8)     qt = (aa/A)(Lt – xt) + (aa D s /A) St + (aa D c/A) Ct – (bb/B)(L*t – xt) – bb D* s/B) S*t -(bb D* c/B) C*t



                                                                                                                     7
2.        Empirical results
          With our assumptions (1) and (2) on the SDF’s, our model can written in state space form
given by (5) and estimated via maximum likelihood. Our data is monthly for the period 1997:7 –
2016:3 and we use published Fed and Bank of England time series on zero coupon inflation indexed
bond yields for US TIPS and UK linkers. We construct the real exchange rate from monthly data on
GBP and UK and US CPIs. We fix the common autoregressive parameter ρ = 0.98 (results are similar if
we estimate factor specific ρ’s) . We set ψ = 0 which pins down k from the assumption of unit loadings
on x t at the 10 year point. As discussed above, our model - along with the parameter restrictions
aa = a + aa λ(ρ-1)-1 and bb = b + bbΧ(ρ-1)-1 - provides a sufficient set of restrictions on the general EAM
to produce a linear state space representation with a stationary real exchange rate. As we discuss
below, we can talk rigorously about over or undervaluation of the real exchange rate relative to its
unconditional mean and quantify how much of any deviation from long run equilibrium is accounted for
by changes in risk premia , changes in term premia, and changes in ‘fair value’ implied by UIP.
Moreover, we can decompose each of these three components into the weighted sum of a home
and foreign factor which in turn are a function of the home and foreign slope, curve, and level factors
respectively via equation (8). Table 1 provides the parameter estimates along with estimated standard
errors.

          By construction our model attributes all the variation in the log real exchange rate to the home
and foreign factors q t = aa h t – bb f t with the common component of the US and UK level factors, xt ,
differencing out. Figure 1 plots the contribution of ht in accounting for qt and Figure 2 the contribution

         As discussed earlier, the home factor ht in our framework can be written as a linear combination
of the slope factor, the curve factor, and the country specific component of the level factor extracted
from the US TIPS curve: h t = (1/A)(Lt – xt) + (DS /A)St + (DC /A)Ct , with the loadings of a 10 year TIP on
the slope and curve factors extracted via eigenvector decomposition (with the variance normalization
described above) of the covariance matrix of 5,10, 20 year maturity TIPS yields in the Fed data set. The
foreign factor can be written similarly as f t = (1/B)(L*t – xt) + (D*S /B) S*t + (D*C /B) C*t . In our sample,
and not surprisingly, the extracted US and UK level factors are highly correlated (correlation equal 0.91).
However, the country specific level factors L t – x t and L* t – x t , much less so (correlation equal -.18).
So via the mapping (8) , what might appear to be a two factor model of the real exchange rate is in
reality up to a six factor model of the real exchange rate.      However, as we now show, empirically
virtually all the variation in the extracted h t factor is attributed to country specific component in the US
level factor (L t – x t ) and virtually none of the variation in h t is accounted for by the slope and curve
factors in the US TIPS curve.

         Figure 3 plots the home factor ht against the (scaled) home specific component of the home
country level factor (L t – xt)/A where L t is the LS first principal component of the US TIPS curve . As can
be seen, virtually all the variation in the home factor (correlation 0.99) is accounted for by the home
specific component of the level factor, extracted from the US TIPS curve. Figure 4 plots the foreign
factor ft against the (scaled) foreign specific component of the foreign country level factor (L* t – xt)/B
where L* t is the LS first principal component of the UK linkers curve.

As can be seen, most of the variation (correlation is 0.93) in the ft factor is accounted for by the UK
specific component (e.g. after subtracting the global factor x t recovered by our model) of the level
factor extracted from the UK linkers curves. That said, as we will show below, to account for the time
variation in long horizon dollar pound real exchange rate risk premium that we observe in the data, the
UK curve and slope factors turn out to be important as well.
        From the parameter estimates for aa and bb reported in Table 1, and the assumption of equal
factors variances for h t and f t, we see that the home factor is estimated to account for about 40
percent of the variance of q t while the foreign factors account for 60 percent of the variance. However,
given the estimated standard errors, we cannot reject aa = bb which would imply that each factor
accounts for half the variance of the real exchange rate. For this special case, which we will explore
below, the level is of the real exchange rate is simply proportional to the difference between the home
factor and the foreign factor. However, we can reject that the prices of risk parameters for the home
and foreign factors, λ and χ respectively, are equal. As we discuss below, this difference will be
essential to account for the risk and expected return regularities that we recover from the data.

3.       The Factor Structure of Real Exchange Rates and the Real Exchange Rate Risk Premium
         The expected gross real return to a US investor who buys and holds to maturity a UK linker of
maturity n is simply (E Q t+n/Qt) exp n(R*t + μ R*). The known gross real return to a US investor who buys
and holds to maturity a US TIP is exp n(Rt + μ R) Define


(14)     exp( ϴt,n. + n(μ R* – μ R )+ 0.5 var t q t+n ) = (Et Q t+n/Qt) exp n(R*t + μ R* - Rt – μ R)


as the ratio of the expected long horizon return real return to a US investor who buys and holds to
maturity a linker to the known real return to a US investor who buys and holds a TIP. We see that


(15)     Qt = exp n(R*t - Rt ) Et Q t+n exp – ( ϴt,n - 0.5 var t q t+n)


Taking logs we obtain


(16)     qt = n(R*t – Rt) + E t q t+n - ϴt,n


where ϴt,n is the ex-ante n horizon mean deviation from inflation indexed UIP which differs from the n
horizon real exchange rate risk premium by a constant equal to 0.5 var t q t+n . Adopting the
terminology in Clarida (2012), we refer to the term n(R*t – Rt) + E t q t+n = q fv t as the “fair value” of the
real exchange rate: the counterfactual level of q t at which expected long horizon returns would be
equalized across US and UK linker markets.
          Define qUIPt = E t Σi=0,n-1 (r*t+1 – r t+I ) + E t q t+n= [b(1-ρ 120 ) – bb ρ 120 ] f t – [a(1-ρ 120 ) – aa ρ 120 ]h t
as the counterfactual level of the real exchange rate at time t that satisfies, up to a constant,
uncovered interest parity period by period . Let τ t = R t – (1/n) E t Σi=0,n-1 rt+1 denote, up to a constant,
the term premium in a US TIP of maturity n and define τ* t similarly . Substituting into (16)


(17)     qt =    qUIPt + n(τ*t – τ t) - ϴt,n


with τ*t – τ t = [B – (1/n)b(1-ρ 120 )] f t - [A – (1/n)a(1-ρ 120 )] h t. Thus period by period we can
decompose the level of the real exchange relative to its mean into the sum of three components: a UIP
component, a relative term premium component , and a long horizon UIP deviation component. Note
that q fv t = qUIPt + n(τ*t – τ t)

                                                                                                                              12

         As with q uip t and (τ* t – τ t) , we can decompose the long horizon UIP deviation component into
the contributions of the ht and f t factor ϴ t,n = [120 B(χ) + bb (1 – ρ 120)] f t –120 A(λ) + aa (1- ρ120 )] h t
with notation to remind us that the TIPS (linkers) loading on h t (f t) is a function of the price of risk
parameter λ (χ). Figure 8 reveals a striking feature of our data set as interpreted by our model: virtually
all (correlation 0.99) of the time series variation in the long horizon dollar pound real exchange rate risk
premium θ t,n can be accounted for by the slope , curve and country – specific level factors extracted
from the UK linkers yield curve! Define θ FFOt,n = [120 B(χ) + bb (1 – ρ 120)] f t as the long horizon real
exchange rate risk premium that is accounted for by the foreign (UK) factors only via f t =(1/B) (L*t – xt)
+ (D* S /B) S*t + (D*c /B)C*t

the UK slope factor (Figure 11) and curve factor (Figure 12) extracted from the UK linkers curve.

        It is instructive to compare the quantitative decomposition of the level of the real exchange rate
with the decomposition of R* t – R t and θ t,n by plugging in our actual parameter estimates. With these
estimates, we have


                                   qt            = 19.03 h t – 23.62 f t
(18)                               n(R* t – R t) = 8.36 f t    + 19.58 h t
                                   Θ t,n         = 30.28 f t + 2.35 h t
                                   Rt            = -0.1642 h t + 1.00x t
                                   R* t          = 0.0733 f t + 1.00x t


A (positive) shock to f t that raises UK rates also raises the required risk premium Θ t,n .If the rise in R*t
were large enough the risk premium to a US investor could be achieved ex ante solely though
adjustment in the linkers market without any necessary adjustment to the real exchange rate. But
empirically, the rise in R* t to a rise in f t is insufficient to deliver the high risk premium and so the dollar
real exchange rate must appreciate to set up expectation of depreciation . By contrast a (negative)
shock to the h t factor which pushes up US rates appreciates the dollar pound real exchange rate ,
narrows the rate differential with the UK, and lowers the risk premium to invest in UK linkers. Our
model is capturing the fact that over our sample, periods of rising UK real rates relative to US are
associated with a weaker pound and a higher risk premium to hold UK assets, whereas periods of
rising US real rates relative to UK are associated with a weaker pound and a lower risk premium to hold
UK assets. Indeed, we can go further given the parameter estimates shown above: a home shock that
lowers R t relative to R * t widens the rate differential in favor of the foreign country by an amount almost
exactly equal to the depreciation of the real exchange rate as predicted by conditional UIP. Home shocks
in turn are due almost entirely to the US specific component of the TIPS level factor.
        There is an alternative interpretation of our model which some readers may find more intuitive.
In this interpretation , treat q t as an exogenous stationary zero mean AR(1) process and recover factors
h t f t and x t and find parameters as in (18) that are consistent with the data (including the time series
properties of q t) and respect the restrictions implied by the SDFs (1) and (2) and the BFT exchange rate
arbitrage equation (3). With this interpretation there is no factor content per se embed in the real
exchange rate. Instead there is a factor content embed in the inflation indexes bond yields and long
horizon expected real exchange rate excess returns that is consistent with the presumed exogenous
evolution of the real exchange rate.

                                                                                                               16
          As mentioned earlier, while our framework implies that up to six factors might be necessary to
account for real exchange rates and expected excess real exchange rate returns, in our US UK data set
the home factor h t is essentially proportional to the US specific level factor (Lt – x t) while the UK yield
curve factors account for the long horizon real exchange rate risk premium. Also, our parameter point
estimates for aa = 19.03 and bb = 23.62 differ only by one standard error. This suggest that a model
comprised of the relative country specific level factor (L t – x t)/A – (L* t – x t)/B, and the UK slope S* t and
curve C* t factors should account virtually all the observed variation in q t. We regress qt on (L t – x t)/A
– (L* t – x t)/B, S*t and C*t. The fitted value from this three factor model as well as q t are shown in
Figure 12. This 3 factor model accounts for 99 percent of the variance of q t.

          Given our finding that the long horizon risk premium ϴ t,n accounts for about half the variance of
the mean deviation in q t , long horizon UIP for inflation indexed bonds is rejected in our data set as is
short horizon (n = 1) UIP. Indeed, via (7) the ϴ t,1 implied by our parameter estimates is almost perfectly
correlated with ϴ t,n and thus in turn with f t. To get a sense of the magnitude of this violation, we
regress          E t q t +n – q t on a constant and n(Rt – R* t) with n= 120 and E t q t +n = ρ120 q t. The
estimated slope coefficient is positive 0.40 with standard error of 0.08, results that are reminiscent of

4.       Concluding Remarks


         This paper has developed framework to estimate and interpret the factor content of
equilibrium real exchange rates . The framework respects the restrictions on inflation indexed bond
yields and the real exchange rate imposed by stochastic discount factors that generate standard, no
arbitrage, essentially affine term structure models of inflation indexed bond yields in a home and a
foreign country. We derive a sufficient set of parameter restrictions on the SDFs that deliver a
stationary real exchange rate that is linear in the factors that govern the evolution of the SDFs. We cast
the model in state space form and recover the deep parameters of the home and foreign SDF using the
theory as set out in BFT and AP. Our model implies that both the real exchange rate, and the ex ante
real exchange rate risk premium at any horizon are linear functions of a “home” and ”foreign” factors
and that inflation indexed bond yields are functions of these factors as well as a global factor that
accounts for the observed correlation in bond yield levels across countries. Home and foreign factors in
turn are simple linear functions of the level slope and curvature factors extracted from home and
foreign yield curves a la Litterman and Scheinkman (1991). We find that a real exchange rate risk
premium accounts for about half the variance of the dollar – pound real exchange rate and that this risk
premium if dully accounted for by the traditional LS yield curve factors in the UK linkers curve. We find
that a home factor accounts for about 40 percent of the variance of the real exchange rate, and that this
home factor is fully accounted for by the US specific component of the LS level factor in the USA TIPs
curve.

A Model
        Consider a two country, three good, four asset model. Consumption in each country is a Cobb
Douglass aggregate of a basket comprised of a traded good – which serves as numeraire – and a
country specific non- traded good. The intertemporal elasticity of substitution is 1. Supply of the
traded good in each country is a stochastic dividend from a Lucas trees located in that country, and
shares in these trees are held and can be traded internationally. There is also a market in home and
foreign CPI linked bonds which are in zero net supply. The non-traded good in each country is produced
with labor (which is in inelastic supply normalized to unity) with a technology that is linear in labor
multiplied by a random productivity shifter. Thus the level of productivity is the level of non-traded
output in a country. The value of non-traded output in terms of the numeraire is the nominal (wage)
income of the household. Real wage income fluctuates with nominal wage income and the CPI. The CPI
is a function of the relative price of non-traded goods. The real exchange rate is the ratio of the foreign
CPI to the home CPI.
        Let a = b equal the share of spending on non-traded goods in each country and let k = 1- a = 1- b
equal the share of spending on the traded good in each country. Equity shares are initially equally
allocated to home and foreign households (so, for example, home households own half the share claims
on home traded good dividends and half the share claims on foreign traded good dividends). At an
optimum k(CTt)-1 = k(2Xt – CTt)-1 where Xt =0.5( Tt + T*t )is the per capita global supply of the traded good
in period t. Thus CTt = C*Tt = Xt period by period which can be replicated with the initial allocation of
equities. Clearly CNt = Ht and C*Nt = Ft period by period with Ht the level of productivity in the home non-
traded goods sector and Ft the level of productivity in the home non-traded goods sector. The relative
price of non-traded goods at home is PHt = (a/k)(Xt/Ht) and the relative price of non-traded goods abroad
is P*Ft = (a/k)(Xt /Ft). The home CPI is given by CPI = a- ak –k(PHt)a and foreign CPI is given by CPI* =
a- ak –k(P*Ft)b. The real exchange rate is given by Qt = (P*Ft)b(PHt)-a = Hta / Fbt. The real stochastic discount
factors in the home and foreign country and the real exchange rate are given by


        Zt,1 = e-δ(Ht)a(Xt)k(Ht+1)-a(Xt+1)-k
(12)    Z*t,1 = e-δ*(Ft)b(Xt)k(Ft+1)-b(Xt+1)-k
        Qt+1 = Ht+1a / Fbt+1




                                                                                                                19
Letting ht = ln Ht , ft, and xt evolve as in (5), this system becomes`


zt,1 = -δ+ a(1-ρ)ht+ k(1-ρ)xt – aet+1 – kεt+1
(13)     z*t,1 = -δ*+ b(1-ρ)ft+ k(1-ρ)xt – bξt+1 – kεt+1
∆qt+1 = δ- δ* + a(ρ-1)ht – b(ρ-1)ft + a et+1 – bξt+1


which is a special case of (1) – (3) with ψ = χ = λ = 0. This example can reproduce the common plus
home and foreign factor model presented above. It is also possible to extend this example by tacking
on a common conditionally heteroscedastic preference shock that generates time varying risk premia
while preserving the common plus home and foreign factor model presented above.
