Abstract




Over the years, there emerged two key policy differences between Europe and America, both

welfare and migration-states. The former has more generous welfare state and more liberal

migration policies than the latter. In this paper we attempt to provide a political-economy ex-

planation for these key differences, based on the degree of coordination among member states

of the economic union, and the different levels of population aging.




1. Introduction



Commodity prices vary across countries due to several reasons: different tax rates, market seg-

mentation, different standards, transportation costs, etc. However, the forces of free trade tend

to narrow these differences. These forces are enhanced by multi-lateral trade agreements

reached under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO); by regional trade agree-

ments, such as the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); or by other bilateral trade

agreements, such as the one between Switzerland and the European Union (the EU), and the

one between Norway and the EU.


                                               2
In contrast, wages on labor services of individuals with similar labor market traits differ con-

siderably across countries, especially between advanced and developing countries. Such high

differences cannot persist under free migration. They exist mostly because sovereign states re-

strict migration. There exists no WTO-like organization which can coordinate sustainable re-

ductions in the administrative barriers to migration.



Restrictions on the international mobility of labor are arguably the single largest policy distor-

tion that besets the international economy. A variety of studies suggests that even a small re-

duction in barriers to migration will result in large welfare benefits to the global economy.1

Unlike international trade in goods, or international financial flows, migration can change the

policy of the decision making in the economy. This is because population composition in terms

of income, age, etc., can alter the power balance between the native-born and the newcomers

in a way that changes the political-economic policy of the state.



Nevertheless, despite the potential big gains from easing restrictions on international labor mo-

bility, countries do not pursue the liberalization of migration flows unilaterally, or through ne-

gotiations, in a way that international trade negotiations do2. Why is this? Evidently, because

politicians face a backlash against immigration. Among several key explanations for this, is the

fiscal burden imposed by immigration on the native-born.



In this pivot monograph, we focus on a central tension faced by policy makers in countries that

receive migrants from lower wage countries. The former countries are typically highly produc-

tive and capital rich. The resulting high wages attract both high-skill and low-skill migrants.

Reinforcing this migration is the nature of the host country's welfare state: low-skill migrants

find a generous welfare state particularly attractive. Such a welfare state may turn also to be a

migration state. Low-skill migration imposes a fiscal burden on the native-born. In addition, a

generous welfare state may deter high-skill migration because heavy redistributive taxes must

accompany them. Indeed, over the last half-century, Europe's generous social benefits have

encouraged a massive surge of "welfare migration”, that is, of low-skill migrants. In contrast,

at the same period, the U.S. has attracted a major world portion of high-skill migrants, boosting

its innovative edge. While Europe ended up in the last two decades with 85 percent of all low-

skill migrants to developed countries, the US retains its innovative edge by attracting 55 percent

of the world-educated migrants.



Another fundamental factor which is inter-related with migration and the generosity of the wel-

fare state is the aging of the population. The old generally benefit from the generosity of the

welfare state (e.g. through the old-age social security benefits and Medicare in the U.S.). They

are also keen to admitting migrants, in particular high-skill migrants, as a way to alleviate the

finances of the welfare state. On the other hand, the working young, who finance the welfare

state through their payroll tax, are reluctant to support a generous welfare state. With respect to

migration, the young are less keen than the old to admitting migrants, because they may be

concerned about changes in the political balance in the future when they grow old and that could

endanger the old-age benefits they expect to receive. It is interesting to note in this context that

the current immigration debate in the U.S. about “the path to citizenship” of the undocumented

migrants is centered exactly about how they may tilt the political balance of power, once they

become citizens, concerning the “role of government” (i.e., the generosity of the welfare state).




                                                 4
This aging factor is another source of difference between the U.S. and the EU. In 2010, the

proportion of people 65 and older constituted 13.1% in the U.S., whereas in the core EU coun-

tries it is significantly larger: 20.8% in Germany, 20.3% in Italy, 16.8% in France, and 16.6%

in the UK (United Nations, 2013).

Although the population in the U.S. is getting older and growing more slowly than in the past,

the demographic future for the U.S. is younger in comparison with the core EU countries. In

particular, the U.S. population is projected to grow faster and age slower than the populations

of its major economic partners in Europe.



This pivot monograph explains key policy differences between two otherwise similar economic

unions, the U.S. and the EU: (i) higher generosity of the welfare-migration system in the EU,

relative to the U.S., (ii) the skill and the wealth bias of the migration to the U.S. relative to the

migration to EU, with the former receiving a higher portion of the high-skill and rich migrants.



This pivot monograph claims that the looser nature of the economic union in the EU, relative

to the U.S., and the relatively more aged population contribute a great deal to our understanding

of the two aforementioned policy differences.

2. Welfare State



The United States of America has organized its various states as a federation, since gaining

independence, over 200 years ago. The large expenditures incurred by the pre-independence

states during the war of independence and the consequent inability of the individual states to

repay the ensued debt, triggered the need and opportunity to establish an integrated federal

fiscal system. Congress then transferred the authority to levy taxes from the states to the federal

government. The federal government bailed out the states and effectively assumed their debts.

The 1790 congress empowered the federal government to raise enough revenues to service a

big government debt.




                                                6
Another wave of state fiscal crises in the mid of the nineteenth century enhanced the federal

government to take a leading role in financing infrastructure projects, allowing state govern-

ments to reduce their role. Following the debt crises, many states introduced some forms of

balanced budget rules into their constitutions; see Sargent (2012). This enhanced the role of the

federal government in the fiscal system. Nowadays, federal tax revenues constitute well over

one-half of all the tax revenues (federal, state and local) in the U.S.



In contrast, at the time the European Union is born, all the major individual countries have

already well-established solid fiscal systems and none was at a risk of default. As a result, the

individual countries preserved their fiscal independence from the outset. Later on, treaties (such

as the Maastricht Treaty of 1992) attempted to restrict the fiscal sovereignty of individual coun-

tries. However, restrictions apply merely to several aggregate variables, such as the budget def-

icit and the public debt. Each country was free to set its total expenditures and their composi-

tions. This effectively means that each country faced no restrictions on the level and composi-

tion of its social expenditures and taxes - key components of the welfare state. Furthermore,

these treaties were not effectively enforced, mostly because of the veto power granted to each

country on important fiscal policies. In contrast to the U.S., there are no EU-wide taxes or social

programs in the EU. There is no EU-wide income tax, no health care programs (such as, for

instance, Medicare, and Affordable Care in the U.S.), and no social security payroll taxes in the

EU. The EU budget amounts to no more than one percent of the GDP in the EU. Indeed, Figure

3.1, which depicts the social expenditures in EU core countries and the U.S, confirms that (i)

these expenditures are lower in the U.S., relative to the EU; (ii) there is a sizable difference

within the EU countries themselves. For instance, total social expenditures in 2000 amounted

to 8,618 USD in Denmark, 7,583 USD in Germany, 8,040 USD in France, 8,668 USD in Swe-

den, but only 5,838 USD in the U.S. (all figures are expressed in Purchasing Power Parity 2000

USD). These differences vary across the years but the pattern (i) and (ii) above remain.

3. Migration State



In setting up migration policy, one is certainly concerned by the skill composition of immi-

grants. Naturally, high-skill immigrants are more attractive to the destination countries than

low-skill immigrants for a variety of reasons. For instance, high-skill immigrants are expected

to pay taxes to the Fisc in excess of what the Fisc provides them with. These immigrants are

also expected to boost the technological edge of the destination countries. In contrast, low-skill

immigrants tend to depress low-skill wages of the native-born, and they also deemed to impose

a burden on the fiscal system.



However, if a migration policy that favors the high-skill is coupled with a generous family-

unification policy, then an influx of low-skill migration takes place too.



3.1 The U.S.



Migrants from Europe (the Old World) created the United States (the New World). Naturally,

migration to this new world was not restricted. Mass migration to the United States accelerated

starting in 1840 and peaked in the eve of World War I. Migration amounted to about 300,000

migrants a year in the mid-nineteenth century. It peaked to about 3,000,000 a year in the years

just before WWI.




                                                9
WWI signaled the end of free migration worldwide. The League of Nations, formed after WWI,

failed to provide any support for international migration. Many countries, especially the British

Empire, insisted on their rights to limit migration, against the desire of countries such as China,

Japan, and India who were all in favor of labor mobility. A series of migration restricting acts

were introduced in the U.S. after WWI. Migration to the U.S. fell to mere 50,000 a year in the

1930’s, during the Great Depression. The 1917 Immigration Act excluded Asian immigration.

The 1921 Emergency Quota Act limited migration to 350,000 a year. The 1924 Johnson-Reed

Act cut the quota to 150,000 a year. Following the Great Depression, the U.S. gradually cut the

quota to 50,000; see Goldin, Camero and Balarajan (2011). More recently, the U.S. tilted its

migration policy in favor of high-skill migrants. The 1990 U.S. Immigration Act increased the

number of temporary visas to high-skill workers.



In addition, the U.S. universities and research centers, significantly funded directly and indi-

rectly by the U.S. federal and state governments, attracted talented researchers from all over the

world. Many of them remained in the U.S. after completing their original term of education,

training or research. Many became citizens. By the mid of 1990s, 30% of documented immi-

grants to the U.S. were high-skill.




3.2 Europe



The birth of the welfare state is in Bismark Germany in the late nineteenth century. In the twenty

century, following two world wars, most of the European countries, that later formed the Euro-

pean Union, provided the world with their own model of the welfare state. The reconstruction

of continental Europe (and, in particular, of Germany and France) exhausted the native-born

labor force. This induced continental Europe to opt for guest workers from labor-rich countries
                                                10
in southern Europe, Turkey and North Africa. Exceptionally, France had from the beginning a

legal immigration policy that allowed the settlement of immigrant workers and their families

from its colonies in North Africa. Germany, at the other extreme, always attempted to maintain

strict rotation policies aimed at not allowing the guest workers to settle in Germany; see Holli-

field (2004). However, eventually, family reunification arrangements made the guest workers

effectively residents throughout the core European countries.



The removal of barriers to labor mobility within the EU, in the framework of the European

Single Market, coincided with increased restrictions by the EU member countries to the immi-

gration from outside the EU. EU member countries were the ones who invoke the latter re-

strictions, as they enable them to retain their sovereignty on non-EU immigration policy. The

collapse of the Soviet Bloc and the following enlargement of the EU to include Central and

East European countries brought additional migrants to the core-EU countries.



Overall, and unlike the U.S. migration, the European migration exhibit significant bias toward

low-skill migrants; see Boeri, Hanson and McCormick (2002) and Boeri (2008).Table 3.1 com-

pares the stocks of migrants, by educational attendance, between the EU-15 and the U.S. In-

deed, we can see that more than 40% of the stock of migrants in the U.S. are with tertiary

education, whereas the corresponding figure for the EU-15 is less than 25%. Similarly, about

48-59% of the stock of migrants in the EU-15 have only primary education, whereas the corre-

sponding figures for the U.S. are only 22-26%.

Data from the European Household Survey Panel reveals that in EU countries with high edu-

cation and income levels, such as Denmark, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, education

levels of non-EU foreigners is significantly below that of the native-born. The average skill-

composition of non-EU foreigners is well below that of EU individuals who moved from one

EU country to reside in another EU country.



It is worth noting that the effect of migration on the fiscal burden is not that much noticeable at

the aggregate level of the fiscal system. The impact rests mainly on the distribution of the bur-

den between the high-skill and the low-skill, between the poor and the rich, between the old

and young, among various regions, etc.

4. Free Versus Controlled Migration: Analytics



A union typically has free migration among its member states. For example, the U.S. constitu-

tion rules out any impediments to the free passage of goods, capital and people across states.

Similarly, a series of agreements dealing with migration, commencing with the 1985 Schengen

Agreement, opened intra-union borders to free migration. Nevertheless, a union or its member

states may still control immigration from third-party countries. In the U.S. such controls reside

with the union itself (the federal government), whereas in the EU the individual members have

more control over immigration from non-union countries.



As a prelude to our analysis of the interaction between the welfare state and the migration state

in the conjunction of free and controlled migration, we attempt to explain in this chapter the

simple analytics of free and controlled migration in the framework of a single representative

country. For this purpose, we present a parsimonious model of migration and welfare state.



4.1 A Parsimonious Model of Welfare and Migration State



We consider an economy with a single good and individuals with two skill levels: high-skill

(subscripted by “s”) and low-skill (subscripted with “u”). We assume that the good is produced


                                               14
by a Cobb-Douglas technology, exhibiting constant returns to scale, and employing the two

types of labor which are not perfect substitutes:

                            𝑌 = 𝐴𝐿𝛼𝑠 𝐿1−𝛼
                                      𝑢 ,             0< 𝛼 < 1,                                  (4.1)

where, Y is GDP, A denotes a Hicks-neutral productivity parameter, and 𝐿𝑖 denotes the input

of labor of skill level i, where I = s, u stands for high-skill and low-skill, respectively.



By the standard marginal productivity conditions, the competitive wages of high-skill and low-

skill labor are:

                                            𝑤𝑠 = 𝛼𝑌/𝐿𝑠

                                                                                         (4.2)

                                      𝑤𝑢 = (1 − 𝛼)𝑌/𝐿𝑢 ,

where 𝑤𝑖 is the wage rate of an individual with a skill level i = s, u.



Aggregate labor supply, for high-skill and low-skill workers, respectively, is:



                                         𝐿𝑠 = (𝑆 + 𝜎𝜇)𝑙𝑠

                                                                                         (4.3)

                                  𝐿𝑢 = (1 − 𝑆 + (1 − 𝜎)𝜇)𝑙𝑢. .



There is a continuum of workers. The number of native-born is normalized to 1; S denotes the

share of the native-born high-skill in the total native-born labor supply; 𝜎 denotes the share of

high-skill migrants in the total number of migrants; 𝜇 denotes the total number of migrants;

and 𝑙𝑖 is the labor supply of an individual with skill level i = s,u.




                                                 15
We assume that the well-beings of high-skill and low-skill migrants in the host country are

high enough to generate 𝜎𝜇 and (1 − 𝜎)𝜇 high-skill and low-skill migrants, respectively.



Total population (native-born and migrants) is as follows

                                           𝑁 = 1+𝜇 .                                         (4.4)

We specify a simple welfare-state system which levies a proportional labor income tax at the

rate 𝜏 with the revenues redistributed equally to all residents (native-born and migrants alike)

as a social benefit, b, per capita. This benefit captures not only a cash transfer, but may also

capture outlays on public services such as education, health, and other provisions, that benefit

all workers, regardless of their contribution to the finances of the system. Note that this benefit

is accorded to all, native-born and migrants alike. This is plausible, as there is a public and

political support both in Europe and in the U.S. to grant key components of the social benefits

(such as public education) to migrants too. In the U.S. it may also be unconstitutional to exclude

migrants from social assistance programs.



The tax-benefit system employed here is progressive in the conventional sense. The net tax

liability of an individual, namely the tax, minus the benefit, as a fraction of gross income is:

                                          (𝜏𝑤𝑖 𝑙𝑖 − 𝑏)/𝑤𝑖 𝑙𝑖                                 (4.5)

                                          = 𝜏 − 𝑏/𝑤𝑖 𝑙𝑖        .

Clearly, this average net tax liability is increasing in gross income (𝑤𝑖 𝑙𝑖 ). That is, the high-

skill rich individual pays in net taxes a higher fraction of this gross income, relative to the

low-skill individual. In fact, because the government budget must be balanced, the low-skill

individual is a net beneficiary of the welfare state, that is, his net tax liability, given in (4.5), is

negative, whereas the high-skill individuals is a net contributor to the welfare state, (that is,

her net tax liability, given in (4.5), is positive).


                                                   16
Strictly speaking, this model is a one-period model, and the government must therefore bal-

ance its budget3. More generally, it is a parsimonious model, which may be viewed as a re-

duced form of a stationary state of a dynamic model. The migrants in the welfare-migration

state are entitled to all benefits and are subjected to all its taxes.



The balanced budget constraint is therefore given by

                                               𝜏(𝑤𝑢 𝑙𝑢 +𝑤𝑠 𝑙𝑠 )       𝜏𝑌

That is, total benefits are equal to total tax revenues. Recall that GDP (Y) is equal to national

income, which consists of wage payments.



All individuals (native-born and migrants) have the same preferences given by

                                                                  𝜀

                                                                                 ,               (4.7)

where 𝑐𝑖 (i = s,u) denotes consumption of all types of goods (private goods, education and

health services, etc.), and 𝜀 is a positive parameter.



The budget constraint of an individual with skill level i is

                                   𝑐𝑖 = 𝑏 + (1 − 𝜏)𝑙𝑖 𝑤𝑖 ,                       𝑖 = 𝑠, 𝑢.              (4.8)



Individual utility-maximization yields the following individual labor supply equation

                                      𝑙𝑖 = ((1 − 𝜏)𝑤𝑖 )𝜀 ,                   𝑖 = 𝑠, 𝑢.                  (4.9)

Note that the labor supply elasticity with respect to the wage rate is constant and is given by

𝜀 > 0.



As usual, by substituting 𝑐𝑖 and 𝑙𝑖 from equations (4.8) and (4.9), respectively, into equation

(4.7), we obtain the indirect utility function:

                                                   ((1−𝜏)𝑤𝑖 )1+𝜀
                                        𝑉𝑖 = 𝑏 +                   ,   𝑖 = 𝑢, 𝑠     (4.10)
                                                        1+𝜀




There are two fiscal policy variables at the hand of the government- the tax rate (𝜏) and the

benefit per capita (b). However, given that the government faces a balanced budget constraint,

there is essentially only one policy variable at the hands of the government. That is, once the

government chooses, for instance, the benefit b, the tax rate must be determined at a level that

balances the budget, and vice versa: choosing the tax rate 𝜏 yields, through the budget con-

straint, the benefit level b. We henceforth suppress b.



In general, there are three independent policy variables in this model: the tax rate- 𝜏; the share

of high-skill migrants - 𝜎; and the total number of migrants - 𝜇. For each of level of these policy

triplet, we can find the equilibrium by equating supply and demand in the labor markets (for

high-skill and low-skill) indiviuals. This yields the equilibrium wage rates4

                                      𝑤𝑠 = 𝐴(𝐴𝛿 𝜀 𝜗1−𝛼 )1+𝜀



4
    In order to ensure that the high-skill wage always exceeds the low-skill wage (that is, 𝑤𝑠 >

𝑤𝑢 ), we assume that

                                        𝛼(1−𝑆+(1−𝜎)𝜇)
                                                        >1 .
                                          (1−𝛼)(𝑆+𝜎𝜇)

                                         𝑤𝑢 = 𝐴((1 − 𝛼)𝛿 𝜀 𝜗 −𝛼 )1+𝜀 ,                               (4.11)

The equilibrium levels of all the other endogenous variables - 𝑐𝑖 , 𝑙𝑖 , 𝐿𝑖 , 𝑏, 𝑁 and Y (where i =

s,u), are calculated by substituting the equilibrium wage equation (4.11) into equations (4.1),

(4.3), (4.4), (4.6), (4.8) and (4.9).



This general framework leads itself to two types of migration-policy regimes. One is of a con-

trolled migration (analyzed in section 4.3) in which 𝜎 and 𝜇 are determined endogenously

through an explicit upward-slopping supply functions for the two types of migrants. We as-

sume that policy (with respect to fiscal and migration issues) is determined by majority vot-

ing. Note that this policy is determined “in advance“, before the arrival of migrants. There-

fore, the migrants do not participate in the voting process.5


Note that there are only two types of identical individuals-voters: high-skill and low skill.

Therefore, the outcome of the voting is determined according to the preferences of the type

that forms the majority.


4.2 Gains to the Native-born from Migration


Like international trade in goods, there are also gains from opening national borders to labor

mobility. A simple figure (Figure 4.1) can serve to illustrate the gains from migration in our

model. For concreteness, we illustrate the gains to the native-born from low-skill migration.

For simplicity, we assume that there are no taxes and benefits.




5
See, for instance, Razin, Sadka and Swagel (2002) for an analysis of the case where migrants do participate in

the voting process in a similar model.

The downward slopping curve in this figure is the marginal product of low-skill labor. This

curve is also the demand for this type of labor6.

In a closed economy with no migration, the equilibrium low-skill wage is w u (Recall that

there are 1- S native-born low-skill individuals.)


GDP is equal to the area OGAD, of which the area HGA accrues to the native-born high-skill

and the area OHAD - to the native-born low-skill.


Suppose the low-skill migrants face a reservation wage of 𝑤𝑢𝐹𝑀 in their countries of origin,

which is below the closed-economy wage rate w u . If we allow for a free migration, then 𝐹𝑀𝑢

low-skill migrants will come. The equilibrium wage will drop to 𝑤𝑢𝐹𝑀 .




GDP (produced by both native-born and migrants) increases to the area of OGCF. The in-

crease is measured by the area DACF. A part of this increase (the area DKCF) accrues to the

low-skill migrants, so that the aggregate gains to all the native-born is the area AKC. Note,

however, that not all native-born gain. The income of native-born low-skill drops to the area

ORKD, so that they lose the area HAKR. On the other hand, the income of the native-born

high-skill rises to be the area GRC, so that the increase (the area RHAC) exceeds the loss to

the native-born low-skill.




                                               21
Therefore, with a perfect, non-distortionary system of redistribution (via lump sums), the na-

tive-born high-skill can more than compensate the low-skilled native-born low-skill, so that

all native-born can gain from migration. In our model, with a distortionary redistribution sys-

tem (via wage taxation), the compensation possibilities are more limited, so that it is not al-

ways the case that all native-born gain from migration. A similar conclusion holds in the case

of high-skill migration. Therefore, as we will see in later chapters, the political power balance

plays a major role in designing migration policies.


The above analysis referred to free migration. If migration of low-skill individuals is limited

to (1 − 𝜎)𝜇 migrants, then similar qualitative conclusions hold, though to a lesser quantitative

degree.


We assume that policy (with respect to fiscal and migration issues) is determined by majority

voting. Note that policy is determined in advance, before the arrival of migrants. Therefore,

the migrants do not participate in the voting process.




4.3 Controlled Migration


Recall that we assume in this case that the host country can receive as many migrants as it

wishes of each one of the two skill types, so that the host-country migration policy is the sole

determinant of migration flows.


Our focus in this treatise is the skill composition of migration. Therefore, we consider in the

controlled migration regime the total volume of migration (𝜇) as given7. We then analyze how

the controlled composition of migration responds to the controlled size or generosity of the




7
    To simplify the notation we suppress the variable 𝜇, when no confusion is thereby created.
                                                        22
welfare state (𝜏). Recall that once 𝜏 and 𝜎 are determined, then the benefit b is also deter-

mined, and we therefore denote it by b (𝜎, 𝜏).


Naturally, we assume that individuals vote on policy issues according to their self-interest.

That is, they vote to maximize their indirect utilities, as given in equation (4.10).These utili-

ties are also functions of 𝜎 and 𝜏:

                                                        1+𝜀
                                      ((1−𝜏)𝑤𝑖 (𝜎,𝜏))
        𝑉𝑖 (𝜎, 𝜏) = 𝑏(𝜎, 𝜏) +                                 ,            𝑖 = 𝑢, 𝑠 .       (4.12)
                                             1+𝜀



In order to find the attitude of the native-born regarding the skill composition of migration,

we first ask how this composition affects their utilities. For this purpose, we partially differen-

tiate the utility levels given in equation (4.12) with respect to 𝜎 to get:

     𝑑𝑉𝑖 (𝜎,𝜏)       𝑑𝑏(𝜎,𝜏)                             𝑑𝑤𝑖 (𝜎,𝜏)
                 =             + (1 − 𝜏)𝑙𝑖 𝑤𝑖 (𝜎, 𝜏)                   ,       𝑖 = 𝑠, 𝑢 .     (4.13)
       𝑑𝜎              𝑑𝜎                                     𝑑𝜎



Equation (4.13) suggests that a change in the share of high-skill migrants in the total number

of migrants (𝜎) affects utility levels through two channels. First, the first term in the right-

hand side of equation (4.13) captures the effect of 𝜎 on b. Naturally, an increase in the share

of the high-skill in the labor force raises total labor productivity and, consequently, tax reve-

nues. This, in turn, raises the benefit b. The second term in the right-hand side of equation

(4.13) captures the effect of 𝜎 on wages. Naturally, an increase of the share of the high-skill in

the labor force depresses the skill-premium in the labor market.


Recall that we plausibly assumed that only the native-born population is eligible to vote on

the migration policy, as the would-be migrants are not yet a part of the host country. If the de-

cisive voter is a low-skill individual, both of the above effects increase her utility. Thus, a

low-skill voter would like to set the skill composition of migrants at the maximal limit, that is,

𝜎, is set at one. This means that the share of the high-skill migrants preferred by the decisive

high-skill voter is typically lower than that preferred by the decisive low-skilled voter. On the
                                                                  23
one hand, the high-skill benefit from an increase in 𝜎 because it raises b. However, on the

other hand, an increase in 𝜎 depresses their wage 𝑤𝑠 . Therefore, we plausibly assume that the

decisive high-skill voter would like to set 𝜎 below one.


Defining 𝜎𝑖𝐶𝑀 as the share of skilled immigrants most preferred by an individual with skill

level i = s, u in the host country (keeping 𝜏 constant), we get:




                                 𝜎𝑠𝐶𝑀 < 𝜎𝑢𝐶𝑀 =1      .                                           (4.14)




Our goal is to find the effect of the change in the generosity of the welfare state on the migra-

tion policy concerning 𝜎. The generosity of the welfare state, captured by the magnitude of

the benefit b, depends positively on the tax rate, 𝜏. (We assume that economy is on the “cor-

rect side” of the Laffer curve.) We thus look for the effect of 𝜏 on the change in the desired

skill composition of the migrants, 𝜎. One can show that8




                                 𝑑 𝜎𝑢              𝑑 𝜎𝑠
                                        =0    ;           >0    .                                         (4.15)
                                  𝑑𝑡                𝑑𝑡



This means that if the decisive voter is a low-skill worker, then an exogenous increase in the

tax rate ,𝜏, would leave the skill migration policy unchanged, because it is always set at the

maximum possible limit. If, however, the decisive voter is a high-skill worker, an exogenous

increase in the tax rate, 𝜏, will change the policy concerning the skill composition of migrants

in the direction towards a larger share of high-skill migrants (and a lower share of low-skill

migrants). The reason is that when the tax rate is higher, the redistribution burden upon a

high-skilled decisive voter increases. Allowing additional high-skill migrants can ease this

rise in the fiscal burden, dominating the adverse effect on the high-skill wage9.




4.4 Free Migration


We now assume that no restrictions are placed on migration in the origin country. The level of

migration depends entirely on the choice of potential migrants. In choosing whether to mi-

grate or not, a potential migrant of skill i compares his prospective utility, 𝑉𝑖 , in the migration

destination (our host country), to the reservation utility, denoted by 𝑢̅𝑖 , in the origin country.

For each skill level i = s,u , we assume that there is a continuum of would-be migrants, differ-

ing with respect to the reservation utility level in the origin country. This heterogeneity of res-

ervation utilities in the origin country could stem from different traits of the potential migrants

(e.g., family size, age, moving costs, forms of portable pensions, housing, cultural ties, etc.).

Thus, the destination country faces an upward sloping supply curve, 𝑆 𝑖 (𝑉𝑖 ), of potential mi-

grants from the origin country for each skill level i.


To abbreviate notation in this section we let 𝑚𝑠 be the number of high-skill migrants, and 𝑚𝑢

the number of low-skill migrants. The proportion of high-skill migrants, 𝜎, is therefore given




                                                     𝑚𝑠

                                                           .                            (4.16)
                                                     𝑚𝑢
                                               𝜎=     𝑚
                                                    1+ 𝑠
                                                      𝑚𝑢

                                                      25
The indirect utility function in the destination country no longer depends on the policy varia-

ble 𝜎 because 𝜎 itself is now an endogenous variable, which depends on 𝜏, and is determined

in equilibrium. We thus have to add to the set of equations determining the equilibrium in the

preceding section a set of new equations that jointly with the first set determine also the num-

ber of migrants of each type (and, consequently, 𝜎). The indirect utility function becomes

now:




                                                        ((1−𝜏)𝑤𝑖 )1+𝜀
                                      𝑉𝑖 (𝜏) = 𝑏(𝜏) +                   .                  (4.17)
                                                              1+𝜀




The following equation determines, for each 𝜏, the cut-off levels of the reservation utilities,

𝑢̅ 𝑠 (𝜏) and 𝑢̅𝑢 (𝜏), for a would-be migrant of skill i = s,u, respectively:




                     𝑉𝑖 (𝜏) = 𝑢̅𝑖 (𝜏) ,          𝑖 = 𝑠, 𝑢 .                                 (4.18)




The number of migrants of each skill level, i = s,u, is then determined by the supply of mi-

grants, that is




          𝑚𝑖 (𝜏) = 𝑆 𝑖 (𝑢̅𝑖 (𝜏)) ,        i = s, u .                              (4.19)




                                                   26
Having defined the new, free-migration equilibrium, we can now investigate the effect of an

exogenous change in the generosity of the welfare state on the desired skill mixture of the mi-

grants (𝜎 𝐹𝑀 ). The generosity of the welfare state is again measured by the tax rate 𝜏, as the

benefit ,b, depends positively on 𝜏.


One can show that10




                                              𝑑𝜎𝐹𝑀
                                                     <0       .                               (4.20)
                                                𝑑𝜏



That is, the generosity of the welfare state attracts relatively low-skill migrants and discour-

ages high-skill migrants. The literature refers to the first effect as the “magnet effect", see,

e.g., Borjas (1999).


The rationale for this result is as follows. An increase in 𝜏 raises the benefit, b, but lowers the

net wages, (1- 𝜏) 𝑤𝑖 . For high-skill migrants, the fall in net wage outweighs the increase in the

benefit. Thus, an increase in 𝜏 reduces the cut-off reservation utility of the high-skill mi-

grants, 𝑢̅ 𝑠 (𝜏). As a result, those high-skill migrants with reservation utilities between the old

one the new (lower) cutoff levels will choose not to migrate. The opposite holds true for low-

skill migrants. Thus, an increase in the generosity of the welfare state under free migration de-

ters high-skill migrants and attracts low-skilled ones, thereby tilting the skill composition of

migration towards low-skill migrants.


Note that when comparing equation (4.15) to equation (4.20), we can unambiguously con-

clude that the generosity of the welfare state attracts relatively more high-skill migrants in the

controlled-migration regime than in the free-migration regime.

5. Free versus Controlled Migration: Evidence


We showed in the preceding chapter that the generosity of the welfare attracts a skill composi-

tion of migrants, which is tilted in the direction of high-skill migrants when migration is con-

trolled. This is true no matter whether the decisive voter is high-skill or low-skill. However,

when migration is free, then the generosity of the welfare state acts as a magnet to low-skill

migrants. As a result, the skill composition of migrants tilts in the direction of low-skill mi-

grants. In this chapter, we provide empirical evidence in support of these conclusions.


5.1 Brief Review of Early Literature


There are quite a few studies, which address the issue of how welfare state generosity works

as a magnet to migrants- the welfare migration phenomenon.


Khoudour-Castéras (2008), who studied nineteenth-century emigration in Europe, found that

the social insurance legislation adopted by Bismark in the 1880s reduced the incentives of

risk-averse Germans to emigrate. He estimated that in the absence of social insurance, the

German emigration rate from 1886 to 1913 would have been more than double its actual

level.




Southwick (1981) showed with U.S. data that the large welfare state benefit gap between

origin and destination regions increased the share of welfare-state benefit recipients among

migrants. Gramlich and Laren (1984) analyzed a data sample from 1980 U.S. census and

found that the high-benefit regions attracted more welfare-recipient migrants than the low-

benefit regions. Using the same data, Blank (1988) employed a multinomial logit model to

show that welfare benefits have a significant positive effect on the location choice of female-

                                                28
headed households. Similarly, Enchautegui (1997) found a positive effect of welfare benefits

on the migration decisions of women with young children. Meyer (2000) employed a condi-

tional logit model as well as a comparison-group method to analyze the 1980 and 1990 U.S.

census data and found significant welfare-induced migration, particularly for high school

dropouts. Borjas (1999), using the same data set, found that low-skill migrants are much more

heavily clustered in high-benefit states in comparison to other migrants or native-born. Gal-

bach (2000) found strong evidence of welfare migration in 1980, but less in 1990. Mckinnish

(2005, 2007) also found evidence for welfare migration, especially for those located close to

state borders (where migration costs are lower). Walker (1994), using the 1990 U.S. census

data, found strong evidence in support of welfare-induced migration. Levine and Zimmerman

(1999) estimated a probit model, using a data set for the period 1979-1992, and found, on the

contrary, that welfare benefits had little effect on the probability of female-headed households

(the recipients of the benefits) to relocate.


Peridy (2006) studied migration rates in eighteen OECD destination countries from sixty-

seven origin countries and found that the destination-origin ratio of welfare state benefits (as

measured by total public spending) had a significant positive effect on migration. De Giorgi

and Pellizzari (2006) conducted an empirical investigation of migration from outside the EU-

15. Using a conditional logit approach, they found that welfare-state benefits attracted mi-

grants. Welfare-state benefits exhibits also a positive effect on the probability of the lowest-

education group to migrate, when benefits interact with the education level. In contrast, mi-

gration probabilities of the secondary and tertiary education groups were not significantly af-

fected. Docquier and Marfouk (2006) and Docquier, Lohest and Marfouk (2006) studied the

determinants of migration stocks in the OECD countries in the year 2000, with migrants from

184 countries classified according to three education levels. They found that social welfare

programs encouraged the migration of both high-skill and low-skill workers. However, low-


                                                29
skill were motivated by social expenditures much more than high-skill migrants. Thus, they

concluded that the skill composition of migrants is adversely affected by welfare-state bene-

fits, that is, welfare benefits encourage migration biased toward the low-skill.


Recall that our parsimonious model predicts differential effect of the skill composition of mi-

gration, depending on whether migration is free or controlled. Therefore, in order to obtain

unbiased estimates of the effects of welfare stare generosity on the skill composition of migra-

tion, we must control for the migration regime (free versus controlled). This means that stud-

ies of migration among states within the U.S. (e,g., Borjas(1999)), which are evidently con-

fined to a single migration regime (free migration), can produce an unbiased result. Other

studies that employ samples confined to controlled migration, but at the same time employ a

model of migrants’ choice whether to migrate and to which country, are evidently incon-

sistent. In this case, the estimates convey little information on the migrants’ choice (and hence

on the welfare state as a magnet for low-skill migrants), but rather information on the migra-

tion policy choices of the destination country. Those studies that refer to both migration re-

gimes without controlling for them are not easily interpretable because they convey a mixture

of information on migration policies in the destination countries and on the individual mi-

grant’s migration choices in the origin countries.




5.2 Recent Literature


Two recent studies do indeed control for the migration regime when analyzing the generosity

of the welfare state on the skill composition of migration.




                                               30
Razin and Wahba (2014), following Cohen and Razin (2009), decompose a cross-country

sample into three categories. Each category has two groups of countries. The first group con-

tains countries which enable free mobility of labor among them. They also prohibit any kind

of discrimination between native-born and migrants, regarding labor market accessibility and

welfare-state benefits eligibility. These are 16 European countries, 14 of them are a part of the

EU (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Nether-

lands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and UK), and Norway and Switzerland. For notational brevity,

we will refer to this group as the EUR group. The second group includes non-European devel-

oped countries. These are the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Taiwan,

Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore. The third group consists of 23 developing countries: Ar-

gentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Columbia, Ecuador, Egypt, Jordan, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ma-

laysia, Mexico, Morocco, Lebanon, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Tunisia, South Africa, Thai-

land, Turkey and Venezuela.


The first category consists of pairs of destination and origin countries, all form the first group.

The second category consists of pairs of origin-destination countries, where the destination

countries come from the first group and the origin countries come from the second group. The

third category consists of pairs of destination-origin countries, where the destination countries

come from the first group and the origin countries come from the third group.


This decomposition enables to plausibly assume that migration is free among the 16 EUR

countries. Migration is effectively policy-controlled in the second and third categories. That

is, migration from either the second group of 10 non-EUR developed OECD countries or from

the third group of 23 developing countries into each one of the 16 EUR countries is effec-

tively policy-controlled by the respective EUR country.


Thus, these studies can identify the differential effect of the generosity of the welfare state on

the skill composition of migration in an unbiased way. The first category enables to study the
                                                31
generosity of the welfare state on the skill composition of migration under a free-migration

regime. The second and third categories enable to study the effect of the generosity of the

welfare state on the skill composition of migration when the latter is controlled.


The main reason why they distinguish between the second and third groups of countries (and,

consequently, between the second and the third category) has to do with differences between

the two groups such as cultural, institutional and other factors which are unobservable.


Because our interest is the effect of the generosity of the welfare state on the skill composition

of migration rates, controlling for the heterogeneity in the skill (education) measurement is

essential. The heterogeneity stems from the raw data, which measures skills by years of

schooling, disregarding differences in the quality of schooling. To address this potential prob-

lem, all the migration stocks and rates are adjusted for quality of education, using Hanushek

and Woessmann’s (2009) new measures of international differences of cognitive skills - aver-

age international assessment of student achievement in 12 international student achievement

tests (ISATs). Hanushek and Woessmann (2009) use their schooling quality measure to pro-

vide evidence on the robust association between cognitive skills and economic growth. They

also find that home-country cognitive-skill levels strongly affect the earnings of immigrants in

the U.S. labor market in a difference-in-differences model that compares home-educated im-

migrants to US-educated immigrants from the same country of origin. This suggests that con-

trolling for the quality of schooling is important.


Table 5.1 describes the average test score in math and science, primary through end of sec-

ondary school (EQ) in the countries in three groups, as calculated by Hanushek and Woess-

mann (1999). The average score in Taiwan is 5.452, whereas it is only 3.089 in South Africa.

The group average is 4.939, 5.132 and 3.999 in the first, second, and third group, respectively.

Razin and Wahba (2014) employ the EQ data in Table 5.1 in order to adjust the raw data on

migration rates of high-skilled individuals. Table 5.2 illustrates the adjustment for two origin-

destination pairs (U.K.-Egypt and Italy-Egypt).

The variable DM in table 5.2 is defined by the difference between high-skill and low-skill mi-

gration rates as follows

                                                 𝑠          𝑢

                                      𝐷𝑀𝑜,𝑑 =          −            ,                      (5.1)
                                                 𝑃𝑜𝑠       𝑃𝑜𝑢



where (o,d) stands for the origin-destination pair and and, as usual, s refers to high-skill and u

to low-skill. Accordingly, 𝑚𝑜,𝑑
                            𝑖
                                is the stock of migration from origin country o to destination


                                                37
country d of skill level i = s,u. 𝑃𝑜𝑖 is the total stock of individuals of skill level i = u,s in the

origin country o.


𝐷𝑀∗ is the DM that is adjusted for the quality of education, as follows.

                                  ∗
                                𝐷𝑀𝑜,𝑑 = 𝐷𝑀𝑜,𝑑 (𝐸𝑄𝑜 ⁄𝐸𝑄𝑑 ) .                                        (5.2)


In order to study the effect of the generosity of the welfare state on the skill composition of

migration under either free or controlled migration regimes, Razin and Wahba (2014) esti-

mated the following equation.

           ∗
         𝐷𝑀𝑜,𝑑 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝐼𝑜,𝑑 + 𝛽2 𝑏𝑑 + 𝛽3 𝐼𝑜,𝑑 𝑏𝑑 + 𝛽4 𝑥 + 𝛽5 𝐼𝑜,𝑑 𝑥 + 𝜖𝑜,𝑑              (5.3)


The variable 𝑏𝑑 is the log average social benefit pre-capita in the destination country d over

the period 1974-1990, 𝑥𝑡 is a vector of control variables which are listed in Table 5.3, consist-

ing of two groups - returns to skill and immigration policies. These variables refer to the desti-

nation country, the origin country, and jointly to both countries. 𝐼𝑜,𝑑 is an index function

which assumes a value of zero when (o,d) belong to the first category (free migration within

the EUR countries) and a value of one when (o, d) belongs to the second and third categories

(controlled migration). 𝜖𝑜,𝑑 is the residual variable. The dependent variable in this equation

(𝐷𝑀𝑜,𝑑
   ∗
       ) captures the skill composition of migration (a higher value indicates a composition

tilted in favor of the high-skill). The value of 𝐷𝑀𝑜,𝑑
                                                   ∗
                                                       in the estimation consists of the changes

in the values of the components 𝑚𝑜,𝑑
                                 𝑖
                                     and 𝑃𝑜𝑖 (i = s,u) defining 𝐷𝑀𝑜,𝑑 in equation (5.1) be-

tween the year 2000 and the year 1990. The explanatory variables consist of the social benefit

in the destination country and a bunch of other control variables. In a free migration regime

(𝐼𝑜,𝑑 = 0), the effect of the social benefit on regime skill composition of migrants is given by

the parameter 𝛽3 . In a controlled migration regime (𝐼𝑜,𝑑 = 1) , this effect is given by the sum

𝛽3 + 𝛽4 .

                                                   38
A potential endogeneity problem may arise, in particular between the level of social benefits

in the host country,𝑏𝑑 , and the skill difference in the migration rates, because high-skill immi-

grants can influence the potential economic equilibrium level of benefits. For example, more

immigration may lead to lower level of social spending per-capita, if migrants are more likely

to become unemployed, or if migrants come with large dependent families.


Therefore, the levels of social benefits that are employed in the estimation are not concurrent

levels, but rather those of the pre-sample period 1974-1990. In addition, an instrumental vari-

able method was employed, where the legal origin in the destination country serving as an in-

strument. The legal system indicates cultural and social features of the destination countries

and reflects basic constitutional notion regarding the attitude towards property rights on the

other hand and social rights on the other hand. Legal origin traces the different strategies of

common and civil law to different ideologies about law and its purpose and how those were

incorporated historically into specific legal rules and into the legal system shaping many

spheres of law making and regulations on the security of property rights and contract enforce-

ment. Hence, one can argue the legal origin has shaped welfare generosity.


Table 5.3 presents the estimates of the coefficients of a selected group of explanatory varia-

bles, which are at the focus of our analysis. The estimates of the coefficients of all the explan-

atory variables are given in appendix 5A.


First, note that the coefficient 𝑏𝑑 is negative. This means, as we hypothesized in the preceding

chapter, that the generosity of the welfare state tilts the skill composition of migration in favor

of the high-skill in the free migration regime - the magnet effect.


Next, note that 𝑏𝑑 𝐼𝑜,𝑑 is the additional effect of the generosity of the welfare state on the skill

composition of migrants in the controlled-migration regime, over and above the effect that ex-

ists in the free-migration regime. Note that the coefficient of 𝑏𝑑 𝐼𝑜,𝑑 is positive which means,

                                                 39
as hypothesized in the preceding chapter, that the generosity of the welfare state affects more

positively the skill composition of migrants in the direction of the high-skill in the controlled-

migration regime, than in the free-migration regime. Furthermore, Table 5.3 shows that Chi-

square test for 𝛽2 + 𝛽3 being positively holds. That is, the total effect of the generosity of the

welfare on the skill composition of migrants is positive in the controlled migration regime (in

both cases-- when the origin country is from the second or the third group). Note that in the

preceding chapter we hypothesized that this effect is non-negative; see equation (4.15).

6. Principles of International Taxation

                                              44
In a world with international flows of capital, labor, finance, etc. there arise two distinct in-

come tax issues that are absent in closed economies11.


Each tax jurisdiction must decides (i) whether, and at which rate, to tax its citizens/ residents

on their foreign-source income (e.g. wages, interests, dividends, etc.); and (ii) whether, and at

which rate, to tax foreigners on their income originating from sources within the jurisdiction.


There are two main principles of international taxation. Most countries employ, either statuto-

rily or effectively, some mixture of these two principles. The first principle is known as the

residence principle, whereby the country taxes its residents (and in the U.S. both residents and

citizens) on their world-wide income. To avoid double taxation, residents usually receive

some reliefs (typically, tax credits) on taxes paid to the country where the income was origi-

nated. Also, according to this principle, no taxes are levied on income originating in the coun-

try that accrued to non-residents. The second principle is known as the source principle,

whereby the country taxes all incomes originating within its borders, no matter whether they

accrue to residents or non-residents. According to this principle, income of residents from for-

eign sources is exempt from tax.


No country adheres exclusively to either one of these two principles. The rationale is simple.

A country would not like to exempt its residents on their foreign-source incomes in order not

to encourage its residents to divert their capital and work efforts away from home. Knowing

that foreigners usually receive anyway in their own countries credits against taxes paid in the

domestic country, the latter has no incentive to exempt them from domestic taxes. Such an ex-

emption amounts to transferring potential tax revenues from the domestic country to foreign

countries. Therefore, most countries tax non-residents on (at least, some of) their incomes




11
   Similar issues arise in the context of indirect taxes (e.g. excises value added taxes, etc.) with international
flows of goods.
                                                         45
originating within their boundaries. Thus, most countries employ some mixture of both princi-

ples.12


In the following sections we focus on economies employing the source principle, as we study

how taxation affects the volume of migration and its skill composition. In this context, it is

important and relevant to employ the source principle, as under this principle, the migrants are

treated for tax-benefit proposes as residents, whether or not they are indeed full-fledge resi-

dents. That is, they are taxed on their income and qualify for welfare benefits.


In a closed economy, the first optimality theorem of welfare economics suggests that competi-

tion leads through Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” to an efficient allocation of economic re-

sources. That is, there is no other allocation that can beat the competitive allocation in the

sense of making at least one individual better-off, without making any other individual worse-

off. Thus, the role of government is limited to providing public goods and services, law and

order, money, social insurance and redistribution of income, etc. There are several conditions

that have to be met in order for the first optimality theorem to hold. One important such a con-

dition is the absence of externalities, a condition which (like other conditions) often fails to

hold.


In our context, we deal not only with internal competition (that is, competition within each

country), but also with competition among a group of countries in the world economy. The

international competition is among governments with respect to tax and migration policies. In

this setup one may also expect such international competition to lead an efficient allocation of



12
  The international tax literature shows that if the residence principle is exclusively employed by all countries,
the world private investment in physical capital (machinery, equipment, etc.) is effectively allocated world-wide
when international flows of capital are free. That is, the pre-tax marginal productivity of capital is equated
accross all countries. Alternatively, if the source principle is emplyed everywhere , then the world private
saving is effectively allocated accross all countries. That is, the after-tax intertemporal (between present and
future consumption) marginal rate of substitution, governing saving-consumption decisions, is equated world-
wide, when international financial flows are free. For a treatise of international taxation, see Frenkel, Razin and
Sadka (1991).
                                                        46
resources among this group of countries (as well as an efficient allocation within each country

brought about domestic competition). When this is the case, then there can be no gains to

these countries from coordinating the tax and migration policies.13


However, in this context too, competition fails to bring about efficiency, if there are cross-

country externalities within this group of countries. Indeed, we identify in the following chap-

ters such an externality which is built-in in the welfare and migration competition, referred to

as a (cross-country) fiscal externality. Furthermore, if the group of countries, as a whole, is

big enough, so as to enjoy market power vis-à-vis the rest of the world economy, it may bene-

fit from collectively exploiting this power. In our setup, the rest of the world is a source of mi-

grants to the group. The supply of these migrants to the group of countries is typically up-

ward-slopping.


Therefore, the group can collectively exercise its market power with respect to the economic

conditions (wage, social benefits) offered to the migrants. Therefore, there may exist gains

from coordination among the countries in the group with respect to their tax/benefit and mi-

gration policies.




7. Migration and the Fiscal System: Intra-Union Competition


The pioneering framework for competition among jurisdictions is due to Tiebout (1956), who

dealt with localities. Tiebout’s model features many “utility-taking” localities, analogous to

the perfect competition setup of many “price-taking” agents. His focus was on the allocation

of a given population among competing localities.14




13
     See, for instance, Razin and Sadka (1991).
14
     A related issue, fiscal federalism, was first analyzed by Oates (1972).
                                                           47
Adopting a similar approach, we model a stylized economy with a group (union) of n small

countries. There is free mobility of goods and capital among them. They are also destination

countries for migrants from the rest of the world. These migrants are generally poorer than the

native-born residents of these countries. In this chapter we consider a competitive regime in

which each country in the union determines its own tax/ benefit and migration policies, in

competition with the other countries. The alternative of coordination among the union’s mem-

bers with respect to the fiscal and migration policies (the coordination regime) is dealt with in

the next chapter.


We turn now to a description of the union countries. For the sake of simplicity, we assume

that all these countries are identical and we specify the characteristics of a representative

country.


7.1 Representative Country


A representative country is similar to the representative country of chapter 5, except that we

introduce now an additional input capital (K), with an income share of 0<β<1.


7.1 Producers


With a capital input, the constant-returns-to-scale, Cobb-Douglas production function be-

comes now

                     (1−𝛽)𝛼 (1−𝛽)(1−𝛼)
           𝑌 = 𝐴𝐾𝛽 𝐿𝑠      𝐿𝑢          ,      0 < 𝛼 < 1, 0 < 𝛽 < 1 .                (7.1)


The income shares of the high-skill and low-skill, respectively, are now given by (1 − 𝛽)𝛼


and (1 − 𝛽)(1 − 𝛼), as can be seen from equations (7.2) below.




                                                48
The competitive wages of high-skill and low-skill labor are equal to their marginal productivi-

ties:




                                                 𝑤𝑠 = (1 − 𝛽)𝛼𝑌/𝐿𝑠

                                                                                                       (7.2)

                                           𝑤𝑢 = (1 − 𝛽)(1 − 𝛼)𝑌/𝐿𝑢            .

Note that the abundance of high-skill labor raises the wage of the low-skill whereas the abun-

dance of low-skill labor raises the wage of the high-skill.


As before, aggregate labor supply, for high-skill and low-skill workers, respectively, are given

by15:




                                                   𝐿𝑠 = (𝑆 + 𝜎𝜇)𝑙𝑠

                                                                                                       (7.3)

                                            𝐿𝑢 = (1 − 𝑆 + (1 − 𝜎)𝜇)𝑙𝑢.



As before, the size of the native-born population is normalized to one. Also, the total number

of workers, native-born and migrants, is given by:


                                                         𝑁 =1+𝜇         .                                (7.4)




15                         𝛼(1−𝑆+(1−𝜎)𝜇)
     We also assume that                   > 1, which ensures that the wage of the high-skill always exceeds the
                            (1−𝛼)(𝑆+𝜎𝜇)
wage of the low-skill (𝑤𝑠 > 𝑤𝑢 ).
                                                           49
For the sake of simplicity, we assume that physical capital does not depreciate. Firms rent

capital from individuals. In a competitive equilibrium the pre-tax rental price of capital (r)

will be equal to the marginal productivity of capital, that is

                                                            𝛽𝑌
                                                     𝑟=            .                                 (7.5)
                                                            𝐾



7.2 Individuals


Native-born high-skill individuals, and low-skill individuals, and migrants differ from one an-

other in their ownership of capital (wealth). Migrants of both types (high-skill and low-skill)

own no capital. The native-born high-skill are endowed with more capital than the native-born

low-skill. Denote by 𝐾𝑖 the stock of capital owned by a native-born individual with skill level

I = s,u , where 𝐾𝑠 > 𝐾𝑢 . Given that the high-skill earn a higher wage rate than the low-skill

(that is, 𝑤𝑠 > 𝑤𝑢 ), it follows that the native-born high-skill are unambiguously richer than the

native-born low-skill and all the migrants. Also, the native-born low-skill are richer than the

low-skill migrant. Such heterogeneity in income and wealth is crucial for the analysis below.




An individual can rent her capital either at home or at the other union countries. Thus, the to-

tal stock of capital, owned by residents, S𝐾𝑠 +(1-S) 𝐾𝑢 does not have to equal K, the total in-

put of capital as would be the case in a closed economy. As explained in the preceding chap-

ter, capital taxation is levied according to the source principle, according to which each coun-

try taxes only the capital employed in that country. Denoting the tax rate on capital income by

𝜏𝐾 , the net-of-tax rental price of capital is (1-𝜏𝐾 )r16.




16
  Note that due to our constant-returns-to scale assumption, there are no pure profits at the firm’s level that
can be taxed (as, for example, by a corporate tax).
                                                       50
We specify a simple welfare-state system in which there is a dual tax system: a tax at the rate

𝜏𝐿 on labor income and a tax at the rate 𝜏𝐾 on capital income. We allow for different rates of

taxation of labor and capital in order to examine the effects of migration and capital mobility

separately on capital and labor taxation. The welfare state provides also a uniform social ben-

efit (b). The latter may capture not only a cash transfer, but also outlays on public services

such as education, health, and other provisions. Thus, b is not necessarily a perfect substitute

to private consumption.




All individuals (irrespective of skill or national origin) have identical preferences over private

consumption (c), work efforts (l), and the social benefit (b), given by the following utility

function:

                                                           1+𝜀
                                                      𝜀
                                        𝑢𝑖 = 𝑐𝑖 − 1+𝜀 𝑙𝑖 𝜀 + ln(𝑏)             ,                             (7.6)




where 𝜖 > 0 is a preference coefficient that will turn out to be the individual labor supply

elasticity (see equation (7.8)). Recall that we interpret b not just as a pure cash transfer, but

rather as some social benefit that creates a utility of ln(b).17


The budget constraint of a native-born individual with skill level I = s,u is given by:


            𝑐𝑖 = (1 − 𝜏)𝑙𝑖 𝑤𝑖 + [1 + (1 − 𝜏𝐾 )r]𝐾𝑖               , 𝑖 = 𝑠, 𝑢                       (7.7)




17
  This quasi-linear utility function is quite common in the tax literature (e.g. Diamond (1998)). It implies that
there is no income effect on the labor supply; see equation (7.8) below.
                                                          51
We assume that migrants are fully entitled to the welfare system. That is, they pay the tax rate

𝜏𝐿 on their labor income (they own no capital) and receive the social benefit b. Thus, the

budget constraint of a migrant of a skill level i = s,u is given by:


                                                  𝑐𝑖 = (1 − 𝜏)𝑙𝑖 𝑤𝑖             ,                    (7.8)


In view of our quasi-linear utility function, capital income does not affect labor supplies.

Thus, all individuals (irrespective of skill or national origin) have the same labor supply:


                                    𝑙𝑖 = ((1 − 𝜏)𝑤𝑖 )𝜀 ,               𝑖 = 𝑠, 𝑢                         (7.9)


Note that the (fixed) coefficient 𝜀 is indeed equal to the labor supply elasticity.


In general, the indirect utility function gives the maximum level of utility that an individual

can obtain, given her budget constraint and the social benefit provided by the government. In

our case the indirect utility function is obtained by substituting the labor supply equation (7.9)

and the budget constraint (7.7) or (7.8) into the utility function (7.6). Thus, for a native-born

individual, this indirect utility function (𝑉𝑖 ) is given by:

                                            1+𝜀
                             ((1−𝜏𝐿 )𝑤𝑖 )
𝑉𝑖 (𝜏𝐿 , 𝜏𝐾 , 𝑏) = ln(𝑏) +                        + (1 + (1 − 𝜏𝐾 ))𝐾𝑖               , 𝑖 = 𝑢, 𝑠        (7.10)

In a static model, like the present one, it is common and natural to employ a balanced-budget

rule18. That is, the government employs all its revenues, from labor and capital taxation, to fi-

nance the uniform social benefit.


The government budget constraint is thus given by:


                            𝑏𝑁 = 𝜏𝐾 𝑟𝐾 + 𝜏𝐿 (𝑤𝑢 𝑙𝑢 + 𝑤𝑠 𝑙𝑠 )             .                         (7.12)


Note that source taxation is employed, so that the government obtains capital tax revenues

from the entire input of capital employed in domestic production.




7.4 Migrants




As we have already mentioned, migrants to the union member countries pay their dues to the

welfare system, but they also qualify for all the social benefits that the system provides.

Therefore, they are not merely driven by better wages, but also by the social benefits. Put dif-

ferently, migration is driven by the utility-gap rather than by merely the wage-gap. Note that

as all the countries of the union are assumed identical, there will be no intra-union migration.

Therefore we consider only migration from the rest of the world to union member countries19.


However, there is, as before, some cost to migration. As we explained in chapter 5, some cost

to migration. As we explained in chapter 5, this cost may depend on individual characteristics

such as age, family size, ethnicity, whether or not and to what extent pension benefits are

portable to the new destination, etc. Thus, the migration cost may vary not only for different



18
   This is the analogue of an intertemporal balanced budget rule, in present value terms, in a multi-period
model.
19
   For an extension to a union with non-identical countries and, consequently, intra-union migration from poor
to rich member countries (in addition to migration from the rest of the world), see Razin and Sadka (2013).
                                                      53
skill levels, but also within each skill level. Consequently, the reservation utility - the thresh-

old utility level in the destination country for migration to occur - varies accordingly. We as-

sume that would-be migrants are indifferent with respect to the identity of the would-be desti-

nation country. All they care about is the level of utility they will enjoy. Thus, the number of

migrants of each skill level who wish to emigrate to the union (as a whole) rises with the level

of utility (well-being) that they will enjoy in the union. (Note that utilities are identical across

the union member countries.)




Put differently, the union faces an upward-slopping migrant supply function for each skill

level:


                                           𝜎𝜇 = 𝑓𝑠 (𝑉𝑆𝑚 )


                                                                                      (7.13)


                                       (1-𝜎)𝜇 = 𝑓𝑢 (𝑉𝑢𝑚 )       ,


where 𝑓𝑖 is the supply function of migrants of skill level i and 𝑉𝑖𝑚 denotes the utility level ac-

corded to migrants of skill level i in the union, i=s,u.




7.5 Fiscal and Migration Policy of a Union Member Country


A representative union-member country determines its fiscal and migration policy by majority

voting among the native-born. For concreteness, we describe in details the case where the na-

tive-born, high-skill form the majority, that is S > 0.5 (the other case is specified similarly).




                                                 54
Being small enough, each union-member country naturally takes union-wide prices as given.

In the presence of free capital mobility there will be only one rental price of capital through-

out the union. Because source taxation is employed, the relevant price is the net-of-tax rental

price of capital20. Denote this price (market rate of return) by 𝑟̅ . Therefore:


                                           (1 − 𝜏𝐾 )𝑟 = 𝑟̅            .                               (7.14)


Prices in our case include also the utility levels of migrants and native-born, by skill.


Because of intra-union free migration, there are therefore also equal utilities, by skill and

origin, throughout the union. Each union-member country takes union-wide utility levels ad

given too; that is, each country is also a “utility-taker” (in analogy to being a “price-taker”).

Denote the (assumed given) union-wide utility level of a migrant of skill i by 𝑉̅𝑖𝑚 (i = s,u).

Then:




                                              𝑉𝑆𝑚 (𝜏𝐿 , 𝑏) = 𝑉̅𝑠𝑚


                                                                                                      (7.15)


                                          𝑉𝑢𝑚 (𝜏𝐿 , 𝑏) = 𝑉̅𝑢𝑚        .


(Note that because Vi and 𝑉𝑖𝑚 differ from one another only by the term (1+𝑟̅ )𝐾𝑖 (i = s,u),

which is uniform across the union, it follows that the utilities of the native-born, by skill, are

also uniform across the union.)


Each union-member country chooses its fiscal and migration policy variables (𝜏𝐿 , 𝜏𝐾 , 𝑏, 𝜇, and

𝜎), so as to maximize the utility of the native-born majority, subject to its budget constraint



20
  If instead residence taxation was employed, then the relevant price would be the pre-tax rental price of capi-
tal.
                                                      55
(7.12), the free capital mobility constraint (7.14), and the intra-union free migration constraint

(7.15).


We denote by an asterisk (*) the levels of the economic variables that ensue under the fiscal

and migration policy chosen by the government.


7.6 Competitive Policy Equilibrium


Each union-member country seeks to admit 𝜎 ∗ 𝜇 ∗ high-skill migrants and (1-𝜎 ∗ ) 𝜇 ∗ low-skill

migrants from the rest of the world. The union demands for high-skill and low-skill migrants

from the rest of the world are thus 𝜎 ∗ 𝜇 ∗ 𝑛 and (1-𝜎 ∗ ) 𝜇 ∗ 𝑛, respectively. Therefore, utility lev-

els that clear the market for migrants from the rest of the world are determined in equilibria by




                                          𝑛𝜎 ∗ 𝜇 ∗ = 𝑓𝑠 (𝑉𝑆𝑚 )




          (7.16)


                                    𝑛(1 − 𝜎 ∗ )𝜇 ∗ = 𝑓𝑢 (𝑉̅𝑢𝑚 )     .


These equations determine the utility levels of the migrants that each union member assumed

as given. Also, the world wide net-of-tax rental price of capital, 𝑟̅ , is determined so as to

equate the union demand for capital, 𝑛𝐾 ∗ , to the union supply, 𝑛(𝑆𝐾𝑆 + (1 − 𝑆)𝐾𝑢 ), that is:




                                𝑛𝐾 ∗ = 𝑛(𝑆𝐾𝑆 + (1 − 𝑆)𝐾𝑢 )                                 (7.17)




                                                   56
(Note that because all the countries in the union are identical, then in fact there is no move-

ment of capital from one country to another; each country employs the entire capital endow-

ment of its native-born.)




8. Intra-Union Coordination


So far, we assumed that the union-member countries compete with each other in an attempt to

provide as high as possible utility level for the majority. They compete in the sense that each

country determines its fiscal and migration policy variables (i.e. 𝜏𝐿 , , 𝜏𝐾 , 𝑏, 𝜇, 𝜎) independently

of the other union-member countries, taking their policies as given (a Nash-equilibrium).




Presumably, a low-skill majority voter opts to admit high-skill migrants, for two reasons: first,

such migrants are net contributors to the finances of the welfare state; that is, the tax that each

one pays (namely, 𝜏𝐿 𝑤𝑠 𝑙𝑠 ) exceeds the benefit she receives (namely, b). Second, for a given

stock of capital (and volume of migration), increasing the share of high-skill migrants raises

the wage of the low-skill (native-born and migrants alike), due to the factor-substitution built-

in in the Cobb-Douglas production function. Therefore, if the low-skill form the majority they

will admit only high-skill migrants21.




21
  This result hinges crucially on the assumption that migrants are not entitled to vote. If they were, then a low-
skill majority may opt to limit the number of high-skill migrants in order to preserve its majority. For an analyti-
cal treatment of this case, see Razin, Sadka and Suwankiri (2011).
                                                        57
On the other hand, the high-skill (who are assumed to form the majority) may opt for both

types of migrants. Low-skill migration raises the wage of the high-skill, due to a factor substi-

tution effect, but imposes a fiscal burden on the high-skill, because low-skill migrants are net

consumers of the welfare state. High-skill migration lowers the wage of the high-skill, but

contributes positively to the finances of the welfare state. All of these reinforcing or conflict-

ing forces are balanced in a competitive equilibrium. The aforementioned setup may capture

the gist of the policy competition that takes place among the members of the EU. An alterna-

tive institutional regime is for the union-member states to coordinate their fiscal and migration

policies to their mutual benefit.




This institutional regime of coordination among union-member states may capture the gist of

the federal system of the United States. In particular, the federal government is the governing

body that set migration policy and the bulk of the fiscal policy. Naturally, such coordination

can come only at the expense of the migrants from the rest of the world.




The very advantage of coordination over competition is that the former allows the union-

member countries (states) to take into account the effect of policy on economic variables

(prices) that each individual country takes as exogenous under competition. The union-mem-

ber countries are no longer price (utility) - takers in the coordination regime, as they were in

the competitive regime. In our case, there are three such variables: the utility level of the high-

skill (𝑉̅𝑠𝑚 ), the utility level of the low-skill (𝑉̅𝑢𝑚 ), and the net-of-tax rental price of capital (𝑟̅ ).

These variables govern the allocation of high-skill labor, low-skill labor and capital in the un-

ion.




                                                     58
The coordinating states now jointly determine their fiscal and migration policy variables

(𝜏𝐿 , , 𝜏𝐾 , 𝑏, 𝜇, 𝜎), as opposed to independently choosing them. In addition and simultaneously,

the coordinating states choose now also the “prices“ - 𝑉̅𝑠𝑚 , 𝑉̅𝑢𝑚 , and 𝑟̅ - subject to the market-

clearing conditions (7.16) and (7.17). As before, they are also bound by the budget constraints

(7.12). Note that as all the union-member states are alike, the issue of revenue-sharing among

states does not arise.




9. Competition versus Coordination: The U.S. and the EU


The focus of this monograph is hour coordination among countries (states) in an economic

union affects fiscal and migration policies, as compared to a competition among them. This

comparison may offer some explanation to the differences between the U.S. (coordination)

and the EU (competition) with respect to the size (generosity) of the welfare state and the

share of high-skill migration in total migration.


We consider the social benefit variable (b) as a proxy to the size (generosity) of the welfare

state22. As there are in our model economy only two types of workers (high-skill and low-

skill), we are interested only in the share of just one of these two types of migrants in total mi-

gration.




22
  Recall that with a balanced-budget the social benefit b are equal to (per-capita) tax revenues. Therefore, the
social benefit is more appropriate proxy to the size of the welfare state than the two tax parameters 𝜏𝐿 and 𝜏𝐾 ,
which do not always move in the same direction.
                                                       59
Specifically, we look at the high-skill share 𝜎. We carry out this comparison via numerical

simulations23. Figure 9.1 depicts the social benefit (b) under the two institutional regimes

(competition and coordination) for different levels of total factor productivity (A). Figure 9.2

depicts the share of high-skill migration in total migration (𝜎) under the two institutional re-

gimes for different levels of total factor productivity (A). As a side result, we note that the so-

cial benefit increases under both regimes when total factor productivity rises. This is ex-

pected: a richer economy can afford to accord its residents a higher level of social benefits.




23
   There is no attempt to calibrate the model to the EU and U.S. economies, as they are very stylized, abstract-
ing from many important features that are similar or different between them. Nevertheless, the simulations
offer a useful insight into the quantitative differences between the two unions with respect to fiscal and migra-
tion policies.

Figure 9.2: High-Skill Composition of Migration, by Total Factor Productivity: Competition

versus Coordination


Our main interest is to compare b and σ under the two regimes. Interestingly, coordinating the

fiscal and migration policies allows the union-member states to offer less generous social ben-

efits than when they compete with each other; see Figure 9.1. The rationale for this result is

rooted in a fiscal externality associated with migration.


There are gains and losses brought about by migration. A union-member country has an intra-

marginal gain from either high-skill or low-skill migration stemming, from the diminishing

productivity of either type of labor for a fixed stock of capital. This was illustrated in Figure
                                                62
4.1. The gain stems from the fact that each migrant (whether high-skill or low-skill) is paid

according to the productivity of the marginal migrant, which is smaller than the average

productivity of the migrants (of the same type). On the other hand, the native-born population

shares with migrants the tax collected from capital income (recall that migrants have no capi-

tal), because the transfer 𝑏 that the migrants receive is not financed fully by their labor income

tax. That is, the capital tax revenues paid by the native-born population ‘leak’ also to the mi-

grants24.


The fiscal burden imposed by migration on the native-born (both high-skill and low-skill) is

reinforced when this migration is composed of low-skill migrants. This is because the low-

skilled not only possess no capital, they also have low wages and accordingly pay low labor

income taxes25.


Each union-member country in a competitive regime evidently balances at the margin the

gains and losses from migration. In doing so, each country (being a “utility-taker”) takes the

well-being of the migrants, 𝑉̅𝑠𝑚 and 𝑉̅𝑢𝑚 , as given (see equation (7.15)). It thus ignores the fact

that when it adopts a fiscal-migration policy that admits an extra migrant, it raises the well-

being that must be accorded to migrants not only by it but also by all other union member

countries, in order to elicit the migrant to come in. as a result, it offers migrants too high level

of the social benefit (b), and admits a too high share of low-skilled migrants- a “fiscal leak-

age” externality. Indeed, Figure 9.2 demonstrates that the union member states admit a higher

share of low-skill migrants when they compete with each other than when they cooperate. As

expected, the cooperating states, facing an upward-slopping supply of migrants (of both

types) exploit their market power by admitting smaller numbers of high-skill and low-skill

migrants, as compared to the case when they compete with each other.




10. Aging and Migration: The U.S. and the EU


The aging of the population is another fundamental that set the EU and the U.S. apart. In

2010, the proportion of people 65 and older constituted 13.1% in the U.S., whereas in the core

EU countries it is significantly larger: 20.89% in Germany, 20.3% in Italy, 16.8% in France,

and 16.6% in the UK (United Nations, 2013).


Although the population in the U.S. is getting older and growing more slowly than in the past,

the demographic future for the U.S. is younger in comparison with core EU countries. In par-

ticular, the U.S. population is projected in the second-half of the twenty-first century to grow

faster and age slower than the populations of its major economic partners in Europe.


Immigrants have turned the U.S. population younger. They come at their working age,

whereas the native-born consist of both working-age and retires. Without immigration, U.S.

population growth from 2005 to 2050 would be only 8.5%, more on par with that of European

nations (pew global, 2014).


In this chapter we consider how the age composition of the population affects the politico-

economic choice of the fiscal and migration policies. In particular, we focus on the question

how the age composition affects the generosity of the welfare state.


To study the implications of aging population for the generosity of the welfare state, we have

to extend the analytical framework employed so far to a dynamic setup. In this case, the polit-

ical balance of power is no longer exogenous, as assumed so far; that is, fiscal and migration



                                               64
policies themselves affects the formation of coalitions, which in turn shape up the chosen pol-

icies by the electorate. In preceding chapters, the native-born high-skill formed one coalition,

and all the native-born low-skill formed another coalition. The new migrants, deprived of vot-

ing power, did not therefore affect the formation of coalitions that shaped up policy. It may be

perfectly admissible that new migrants are not allowed to vote, when they arrive, but they do

however vote when they turn order. Similarly, one should certainly reckon with the fact that

the next generations of migrants would be integrated in the society and would participate in

the democratic process. In this case, the existing native-born of the time the fiscal and migra-

tion policy is shaped (voted for) would take into account the effect that the policy may have

on the political power balance in the future. That is, the existing native-born will take into ac-

count how the current fiscal and migration policy will affect the outcome of the voting pro-

cess in the future. In reference to the current political debate in the U.S. about the path to citi-

zenship of the existing undocumented migrants, it is probably affected by current expectations

about how these new citizens may affect the composition of the future electorate.




10.1 The demographic framework


We draw upon the model developed in Razin, Sadka and Suwankiri (2011, ch.7; and 2014) to

examine the effect of future voting on today’s voting. We consider the familiar overlapping-

generations model, where the economy lives forever, but each generation lives for finite num-

ber of periods. This model has become, since its inception by Samuelson (1958), as the main

workhorse for analyzing economic issues that arise in an infinitely lasting world but finitely-

lived individuals. Among these issues are the role of money, old-age social security, fiscal im-

balances and more.




                                                 65
We assume for simplicity that each generation lives for two periods: in the first period they

are “young” and in the second “old”. The young work; the old retire. The young brings off-

spring who mature to be young and working in the next period. The fertility rate of the first

generation of migrants is higher than that of the native-born. This is consistent with the migra-

tion and demographic data. But the second generation of migrants is fully integrated in the

new destination country, and is thus identical in all respects (including fertility) to the native-

born from ages. Naturally, only young are allowed to immigrate. Skill is innate and passes

from one generation to the next. That is, the offspring of a high-skill are also high-skill, and

the offspring of a low-skill are also low-skill. Thus, in each period there may be six groups,

each consisting of identical voters: young native-born high-skill, young native-born low-skill,

old native-born high-skill, old native-born low-skill, old first-generation high-skill migrants

(from the preceding period), and old first-generation low-skill migrants (from the preceding

period); recall that the young first-generation migrants do not vote. To simplify, we further

assume that there is no physical capital; that the inter-temporal parameters are set so, as to

give no incentive to private saving; and that wages are fixed (because the marginal productiv-

ity of labor is assumed constant)26. In this case, there are no wealth differences among indi-

viduals (as there is no wealth at all), whether young or old or whether native-born or migrant

(as there is no wealth at all); there are only income differences. Therefore the number of dif-

ferent voting groups reduces from six to just three: young native-born high-skill; young na-

tive-born low-skill; and the old native-born and the old first-generation migrants (both high-

skill and low-skill).


10.2. Interaction between coalition formation and policy




26
 There is no evidence that the long-run effects of migration on wages is significant; see Boeri, Hanson and
McCormick (2002).
                                                      66
As before, in any given period t people vote on the labor income tax (𝜏𝐿𝑡 ) and the volume

(𝜇𝑡 ) and composition (𝜎𝑡 ) of migration. We denote this policy triplet by 𝑃𝑡 = (𝜏𝐿𝑡 , 𝜇𝑡 , 𝜎𝑡 ).

Note that the choice of this triplet determines the social benefit 𝑏𝑡 through the budget con-

straint. Denote by 𝑆𝑡 the fraction of native-born high-skill young in the total native-born

young population (the native-born labor force).


Each voter takes into account how her choice of the policy variables in period t will affect the

chosen policy variables in period t+1, which depends on 𝑆𝑡+1 (recall that the benefit she will

get in period t+1, that is 𝑏𝑡+1 , depends on the policy triplet 𝑃𝑡+1). Therefore, each voter will

cast her vote on the set of the policy triplet 𝑃𝑡 that maximizes her utility, given the value of 𝑆𝑡

and taking also into account how this will affect 𝑆𝑡+1 . Thus, there is a link between the policy

chosen in period t and the chosen in period t+1.


We adopt the electoral system studied by Osborne and Silvinsky (1996) and Besley and Coate

(1997), known as “political competition with citizens-candidates”27. Each of our three voting

groups presents a candidate who will implement the most preferred policy of her group, if

elected. When one of these groups enjoys an absolute majority (that is, it constitutes more

than 50% of the electorate), then it wins the elections and implements her most preferred pol-

icy. Note that the current preferred policy (especially with respect to migration) takes into ac-

count how migration may change the composition of the electorate and, consequently, the pol-

icy that will be implemented in the future. For instance, the current political debate in the U.S

about the path to citizenship of the existing illegal migrants is probably affected by current ex-

pectations about how these new citizens may affect the composition of the future electorate.


When no group enjoys an absolute majority, there will be a (second-round”) runoff between

the two largest groups. The third group, the smallest, will vote for the candidate of that one of



27
     For an alternative approach see Benhabib (1996).
                                                        67
the two largest groups whose most preferred policy is better for the third group, even though

this policy is not the most preferred by the third group.


This model is designed to make a three dimensional policy choice (𝑃𝑡 = (𝜏𝐿𝑡 , 𝜇𝑡 , 𝜎𝑡 )) in such

a way that there are a clear “left” group, a “center” group and a “right” group. The left group

consists of the old native-born and old first-generation migrants (both high-skill and low-skill)

who earn no income and wishes to extend as much as possible the generosity of the welfare

state. They vote to admit as much as possible high-skill migrants to help finance the generos-

ity of the welfare state.


The right group consists of the native-born high-skill who bear the lion share of financing the

welfare state and wish therefore to downscale its generosity as much as possible. The attitude

of this group toward high-skill migrants is subject to two conflicting considerations. On the

one hand, they benefit from the contribution of the high-skill migrants to the financing of the

welfare state which alleviate the burden on them. On the other hand, they are aware that the

offspring of the high-skill migrants will vote to downscale the generosity of the welfare state

in the next periods, when the members of this right group turn older and benefit from the gen-

erosity of the welfare state. This consideration is amplified by the fact that the fertility rate of

migrants is higher than that of the native-born.


The center group consists of the native-born low-skill young. They do like a generous welfare

state but not as much as the old, because they also pay for it. They like it more than the na-

tive-born, high-skill young because they pay for it less than them. With respect to migration,

they (like the native-born high-skill) face two conflicting effects. On the one hand, they would

like to admit high-skill migrants who contribute positively towards the finances of the welfare

state at the current period. But, on the other hand, they are concerned that the high-skill off-

spring of these migrants will tilt the political balance of power in favor of the high-skill in the


                                                 68
next period; and, consequently, against the generosity of the welfare state. The center group is

less pro high-skill migration than the “left” group, but similar in attitude to the right group.




10.3 Policy Dynamics


The evolution of the fiscal and migration policy of the economy over time depends naturally

on the state at which it starts. The state of this stylized economy depends exclusively on the

share 𝑆𝑡 of the native-born, high-skill young in the total native-born young population.




One can show (See Razin, Sadka and Suwankiri (2014)) that there are several different deci-

sive ranges for this share which determine which of the three groups most preferred policies

will be implemented. These ranges are arranged from the lowest values of 𝑆𝑡 (starting from 0)

to the largest values of 𝑆𝑡 (ending at 1). Note also that these ranges depend on the fertility

rates of the native-born and the first-generation migrants.




When 𝑆𝑡 falls in the lowest range, the most preferred policy that will be implemented is that

of the center group (the native-born low-skill young). In this case, this group forms a major-

ity28 and is able to implement its most preferred policy: moderate welfare-state generosity

with a large, but not extreme, influx of high-skill migrants only. Therefore, the share of na-

tive-born, high-skill migrants grows over time. Eventually, 𝑆𝑡 enters the next range.




28
     Note that because of positive population growth, the young are always more numerous than the old.
                                                       69
When 𝑆𝑡 falls in the next range, the center group is still the largest group, but does not consti-

tute a majority. The native-born high-skill is the smallest group in this case. The latter group,

being on the right, always prefers the most preferred policy of the center group than the most

preferred policy of the old (the left group). Therefore, the most preferred policy of the center

will still be a winning one, though by a coalition (with the right) in this case, rather than by a

sheer majority of the center group. Note that this policy increases over time the share 𝑆𝑡 of the

native-born, low-skill; and, eventually, 𝑆𝑡 enters the next range.


When 𝑆𝑡 falls in the next range, then the left group (the old) is the largest group, but does not

constitute a majority. The right group (the native-born high-skill) is the smallest group. In this

case, the center group (the native-born low-skill) will join a coalition led by the left. The most

preferred policy of the left will be implemented: an extreme generosity of the welfare state

and an extreme influx of high-skill migrants. Consequently, 𝑆𝑡 continues to rise, and so on.

Eventually, when 𝑆𝑡 become sufficiently large, the right group (the native-born high-skill) be-

comes the largest group and its most preferred policy will be implemented, that is the gener-

osity of the welfare state will be severely downscaled. All will be concerned that admitting

more high-skill migrants will render the high-skill in the next period an unbeatable majority

who will cut severely their benefit in the next period, when they grow old. This future threat

on the welfare-state balances the dynamic forces to drop 𝑆𝑡 and it stops rising. Only a limited

high-skill migration will be allowed, and 𝑆𝑡 will enter a steady state.


10.4 The EU and the US: Different Population Growth Rates


Naturally, a higher rate of population growth (that is, younger than aging population) reduces

the political clout of the old (the left group). In terms of the ranges of 𝑆𝑡 from the preceding

subsection, a higher rate of population growth shrinks the ranges in which the most preferred

policy of the old is implemented. Thus, the share 𝑆𝑡 will enter more quickly to the range in


                                                70
which the most preferred policy of the right (the native-born high-skill) will be implemented:

a downscaled welfare state and controlled migration. Furthermore, a higher population growth

rate brings more concern among the young (native-born) voters about possible future cut in

their old-age benefits, by the increasing number of next-generation young. This concern ap-

plies also to high-skill migrants and is shared by both native-born low-skill and native-born

high-skill. As a result, the native-born young are now less keen to migration, and would to

like to tighten migration quotes, even for high-skill migrants.


In a nutshell, one can say that the higher population growth rate of the U.S. tilts it ahead of the

EU to this political balance range of downscaled welfare state and controlled migration. This

is so even though a higher rate of population growth enables the welfare state to be more gen-

erous to the old.




11. Is the Net Fiscal Burden a Proper Predictor of the Political Attitude towards Migration?


In Section 4.2 we illustrated how a country can gain not only from high-skill migration, but

also from low-skill one. The driving force for the result is the infra-margin gain stemming

from the decline of the native-born low-skill (flexible) wage; see Figure 4.1. We also noted

that the native-born low-skill actually lose, whereas the native-born, high-skill gain; it is only

the net aggregate gain which is positive. We also noted in the preceding chapter that in prac-

tice long-term impact of migration on wages is rather small, so that the net aggregate gain is

likely to be small too.


We also noted throughout this monograph that there might be a distributive burden of low-

skill migration through the net fiscal burden they may impose on the various groups of the

economy. In particular, low-skill migration may tilt the political power balance in favor of



                                                71
“big” government, thereby giving rise to a political backlash. The literature on welfare migra-

tion has focused mainly on calculating the net fiscal burden of low-skill migration as a meas-

ure of the attitude of the native-born towards low-skill migration; see, for example, Smith and

Edmonston (1997), Auerbach and Oreopolus (1999), Barbone, Bontch-Osmolovsky and Zaidi

(2009), and Dustman, Frattini and Halls (2009).


Nevertheless, we show in this chapter that the net fiscal burden of low-skill migrants is not al-

ways a proper predictor of the political attitude of various groups towards low-skill migration.

This is particularly true with respect to an old-age security program, where the old may bene-

fit from an influx of low-skill migrants, even though these migrants impose a net fiscal burden

over their lifetime.29


11.1 An Overlapping Generations Model of Old-Age Social Security Program


We employ a simplified over-lapping generations model similar to that behind the analysis of

the preceding chapter.30 We continue to assume a fixed labor supply: one unit by each young

individual. Individuals are born either high-skill or low-skill and live for two periods. When

young, they supply one unit of labor, consume, and save for retirement. When old, they retire

and live on their private savings and social security benefits.


The social security system is pay-as-you-go (PAYG), where in every period the government

levies a flat tax on the young’s wage income (at the rate of 𝜏𝑡 ), which fully finances a social

security benefit (𝑏𝑡 ) paid to the old. With no loss of generality, we maintain 𝜏𝑡 constant over

time (and drop the subscript t), and let 𝑏𝑡 adjust, so as to keep the period-by-period balance of

the PAYG social security system.

We assume that the utility of the representative young is of the Cobb-Douglas form:

                                       𝑦                  𝑦
                                 𝑈(𝑐𝑡 , 𝑐𝑡𝑜 ) = log(𝑐𝑡 ) + 𝛽 log(𝑐𝑡𝑜 ) ,                     (11.1)

        𝑦
where 𝑐𝑡 is the consumpyion of the young in period t, 𝑐𝑡𝑜 is the consumption of the old (born

in period t) in period t+1; and 𝛽 is the subjective discount factor, which is between zero and

one.


The transfer payment to the old at period t, 𝑏𝑡 , is financed by collecting a wage tax, τ, from

the young individual’s wage income at the same period, 𝑤𝑖𝑡 , where 𝑤𝑖𝑡 denotes the wage rate

in period t of an individual with skill level = s,u. The interest rate and savings of a young in-

dividual of skill level i in period t are denoted by r and 𝑠𝑖𝑡 , respectively. The budget constraint

of a young individual of skill level i in period t are given by:

                                                 𝑦
                                           𝑠𝑖𝑡 + 𝑐𝑡 = (1 − τ)𝑤𝑖𝑡 ,                           (11.2)


                                           𝑐𝑡𝑜 = (1 + 𝑟)𝑠𝑖𝑡 + 𝑏𝑡+1 .                        (11.3)


These two constraints may be combined into one lifetime constraint, as follows:


                          𝑦      𝑐𝑡𝑜                          𝑏𝑡+1
                         𝑐𝑖𝑡 +         = (1 − τ)𝑤𝑖𝑡 +                ,   𝑖 = 𝑠, 𝑢 .          (11.4)
                                 1+𝑟                          1+𝑟



Maximization of the utility function (11.1) subject to the budget constraint (11.4) gives rise to

an indirect utility function of a young individual, V((1 − τ)𝑤𝑖𝑡 , 𝑟, 𝑏𝑡+1 ), which depends on

the net wage, the interest rate, and the old-age social security benefit. For an individual in pe-

riod 0, utility depends only on r and 𝑏0 .


As before, we denote the proportion of high-skill individuals in the native-born population by

S. With no loss of generality, we normalize to 1 the size of the native-born young population

in period 0. We consider just one wave of migrants, µ, in period 0. The migrants are all

young, and the proportion of the high-skill among them is denoted by σ. Each migrant bring
                                                     73
1+m offspring, where m>n, which is the birth rate of the native-born. We assume that the off-

spring of the migrants are perfectly assimilated into the native-born population, both in terms

of birth rates and skill distribution, so the proportion of young skill individuals (including the

offspring of the migrants from period 0) in period 1 and onward is S.


We assume free international borrowing and lending, so that the interest rate of interest is ex-

ogenously given for this economy in each period; and we further assume that is does not vary

over time. We assume that n < r, that is our economy is dynamically efficient. That is, we

precludes Ponzi games which can yield perverse situations.


A single good is produced each period by two inputs, high-skill and low-skill labor (𝐿𝑠 and

𝐿𝑢 , repectively), according to a linear production function (that generates fixed wage)


                                              Y=𝐿𝑠 + 𝑞𝐿𝑢         ,                      (11.5)

and where q < 1. That is, there is perfect substitution between high-skill and low-skill labor,

with low-skill labor having a fraction q<1 of the productivity of high-skill labor. In this case,

the wages are given by

11.2 Gains from Migration


The well-being of the old in period 0 (born in period -1), when the wave of migrants occur,

depends only on 𝑏0 . As is straightforward to see from equation (11.9), the benefits 𝑏0 depends

positively on 𝜇, no matter what is the skill composition (𝜎) of the migrants. That is, even

when all migrants are low-skill (namely 𝜎=0), still the old in period 0 are better off. Naturally,

the gain is higher when 𝜎 is higher.


Turning to the individual born in period 0, when the migrants arrive, his well-being is affected

only by 𝑏1 . It follows from equation (11.9) that 𝑏1 depends positively on m. That is, the

higher the birth trace of the first generation of migrants, the better off is the generation born in

period 0. Because m > n, it also follows from equation (11.9) that 𝑏1 depends positively on

𝜇. That is, the generation born in period 0 (both its high-skill and low-skill members) benefits

from migration. It also follows from equation (11.9) that for t ≥ 2, 𝑏𝑡 is unaffected by the mi-

gration wave of period 0. That is, generations born in period 1 and onward are unaffected by

migration. Naturally, if migration waves repeat themselves, then all future generations gain

too.




11.3 Net Fiscal Burden




                                                75
We have shown that migration, whether high-skill or low-skill, makes the native-born better

off. However, we now show that focusing the welfare implications of migration on its net fis-

cal burden is misleading. Specifically, we demonstrate that the gains that were shown to ac-

crue to the native-born hold even though there may be a net fiscal burden of migration, when

the latter is biased to the low-skill.


A migrant pays a social security tax in period 0, when she arrives and receives an old-age

benefit of 𝑏1 , when she retires in the next period. The net fiscal burden of a low-skill migrant

is therefore equal to

                                                                    𝑏
                                                               1
                                                𝑁𝐹𝐵𝑢 = −𝜏𝑞 + 1+𝑟        .                 (11.10)


Substituting for 𝑏1 from equation (11.9) yields

                                         𝜏(1+𝜇)                𝑤
                                𝑁𝐹𝐵𝑢 =    1+𝑟
                                                  𝑤𝑢 {(1 + 𝑔0 ) 𝑤 − (1 + 𝑟)},            (11.11)
                                                                𝑢




where

                                                  𝑛 + 𝜇𝑚
                                          𝑔0 =
                                                   1+𝜇


is the population growth rate from period 0 to period 1, and


𝑤 = 𝑆 + (1 − 𝑆)𝑞 = 𝑆𝑤𝑠 + (1 − 𝑆)𝑤𝑢


is the average wage in period 1. Now, if m or µ are large enough (so that 𝑔0 is large enough)

        𝑤
and/or 𝑤 is large enough, then the net fiscal burden of a low-skill migrant is positive. Nev-
         𝑢


erthe less,the native-born gain from migration, even if purely low-skill.


The rationale of this result is as follows. The young migrants (whether high-skill or low-skill)

work when they arrive (in period 0) and pay the payroll tax. They receive the old-age social


                                                  76
security benefit only in the next period, when they grow old. Therefore, the PAYG social se-

curity system has more revenues that allow it to pay a higher old-age benefit to the current old

(in period 0). Thus, the current old clearly gain. If the birth rate of the migrants in period 0 is

larger than that of the native-born, there will be more young in the next period (period 1), and

thereby also a higher old-age benefit. Therefore, the young at period 0 will get a higher old-

age benefit in period 1, when they grow older. Thus, they gain too. In period 2 and on, there is

no trace of the migration wave in period 0 and all variables return to their pre-migration lev-

els.




As expected, being low-skill, the migrants pay in payroll taxes in period 0 less than the dis-

counted value of the old-age benefit they receive in period 1. Thus, they do impose a net fiscal

burden. Nevertheless, this burden is postponed indefinitely; because the PAYG social security

lives indefinitely.31




12. Conclusion


In the era of the welfare state one can no longer envisage a world of free migration. Indeed,

for example, the U.S. has gradually ceased to freely admit migrants after World War I, when

it also started to gradually develop the institutions of the welfare state (e.g., the federal in-




31
   If this system is to be terminated at one point in the future, then the young at that time will lose, because
there will be no one to finance their old-age benefit in the next period when they grow old. Note that each
young will lose the same amount as if there were no migration in period 0, but there will be a larger number of
young due to the migration in period 0. Thus, the total loss is larger because of the migration, reflecting the net
fiscal burden of the migration in period 0.
                                                        77
come tax, the old-age security, etc.), culminating with the great social institutions in the six-

ties of the last century (e.g. Medicare) and more recently, in the affordable health care (known

as Obama Care). A welfare state is a magnet for migrants, especially the low-skill, the poor,

and the old. Therefore, there will arise a political backlash of the native-born against the

“free-riders”- the migrants. This does not mean that migration will be altogether banned


There are, after all, also some significant gains from migration. First, high-skill migration

does not impose a fiscal burden on the welfare state. To the contrary, the taxes paid by high-

skill migrants generally exceed the benefits they receive. Second, high-skill migration en-

hances the technological edge of the destination country. Furthermore, even low-skill mi-

grants may still alleviate the finances of a welfare state, which allocates a great deal of its re-

sources to old-age security. 32This led us to explore how migrating and fiscal (welfare) poli-

cies are jointly determined in a political-economic setup.


Evidently, both the U.S. and the E.U. from an economic union: There is a single market for

goods, capital, finance, and labor. That is, there is free mobility of goods, physical and finan-

cial capital, and labor among the member countries of the union. Nevertheless, there is much

higher degree of economic policy coordination among the member states of the U.S than of

the EU. For instance, the U.S. has a common (federal) income tax system which constitutes

the major source of revenues in the union. Similarly, the social security system is more or less

uniform across the U.S. There is also a single migration policy set up and enforced by the fed-

eral government. In contrast, there is very little coordination on these issues among the mem-

ber countries of the EU. In essence, they compete with each other on these issues.


Aging of the population is another key factor affecting the power balance among different in-

terest groups which shapes the generosity of the welfare state and thereby migration policy. A



32
     See Storesletten (2000) for a calibrated over-lapping generations model which analyzes this issue.
                                                         78
more aged society would naturally entail more political clout to the old who opt for a more

generous welfare state. But, on the other hand, the working young, who finance the welfare

state, are more reluctant to increase its generosity. Also, the old are keen to admit young mi-

grants, whereas the young are more reluctant to allow this. We note in this respect that the

U.S. population is younger than the EU population.


We argue that these two aforementioned differences between the U.S. and the EU - the degree

of coordination among the member states and the aging of the population - contribute a great

deal to our understanding of observed policy differences between the two unions: the generos-

ity of the welfare state and the skill composition of migration.




It is worth noting that the U.S. welfare system has undergone some reforms that gave the

states some more leeway in designing the structure and magnitude of public assistance. In par-

ticular, the 1996 welfare reform33. Substituted open-ended federal funds with block grants,

leaving the states some autonomy over individual eligibility criteria; see Blank (1997) for a

review of this reform. The reform somewhat weakened the degree of coordination among the

states of the U.S. with respect to public assistance programs, making a small step towards the

way the EU operates on these issues.
