Earnings Expectations in the COVID Crisis

NBER Working Paper No. 27160
May 2020
JEL No. G01,G32,G4

                                         ABSTRACT

We analyze firm-level analyst forecasts during the COVID crisis. First, we describe expectations
dynamics about future corporate earnings. Downward revisions have been sharp, mostly focused
on 2020, 2021 and 2022, but much less drastic than the lower bound estimated by Gormsen and
Koijen (2020). Analyst forecasts do not exhibit evidence of over-reaction: As of mid-May,
forecasts over 2020 earnings have progressively been reduced by 16%. Longer-run forecasts, as
well as expected “Long-Term Growth” have reacted much less than short-run forecasts, and
feature less disagreement. Second, we ask how much discount rate changes explain market
dynamics, in an exercise similar to Shiller (1981). Given forecast revisions and price movements,
we estimate an implicit discount rate going from 10% in mid-February, to 13% at the end of
March, back down to their initial level in mid-May. We then decompose discount rate changes
into three factors: changes in unlevered asset risk premium (0%), increased leverage (+1%) and
interest rate reduction (-1%). Overall, analyst forecast revisions explain all of the decrease in
equity values between January 2020 and mid May 2020, but they do not explain shorter term
movements.

           We analyze firm-level analyst forecasts during the COVID crisis. First, we describe ex-
        pectations dynamics about future corporate earnings. Downward revisions have been sharp,

        creased leverage (+1%) and interest rate reduction (-1%). Overall, analyst forecast revisions

1       Introduction
The stock-market market has fallen dramatically as a result of fears about the economic impact of
COVID-19. Gormsen and Koijen (2020) use dividend strips to infer the shift in the term structure
of expectations of future dividends. We propose instead to directly look at revisions of analyst
forecasts using IBES. There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods: Using prices

of dividend futures has the advantage of offering an analysis purely based on prices, which are
more likely to reflect investors’ beliefs. However, it forces to focus on the aggregate and only
provides a lower bound to changes in forecasts as shocks to risk-premia are not directly observed.
Using analyst forecasts allows for a firm-level analysis and a direct measure of revisions in beliefs.
However, to connect it to stock-prices, we need to assume that analyst forecasts are a reliable
proxy for investors’ beliefs.
    Our work is part of a fast growing set of papers looking at how the stock-market has reacted to
the COVID outbreak. Gormsen and Koijen (2020) provides lower bound on the change in expected
aggregate S&P500 dividends. Ramelli and Wagner (2020) and Ding et al. (2020) study in detail
how firm-level characteristics such as leverage, cash-holdings, supply-chain and industry affect
the cross-section of returns. Alfaro et al. (2020) show how unanticipated changes in predicted
infections forecast aggregate equity market returns. Albuquerque et al. (2020) find a positive
correlation between ESG ratings and abnormal returns through the crisis.
    We address two main issues that speak to the finance literature. First we show how the term
structure of earnings expectations has shifted over the course of March, April and May 2020.
Downward revision has occurred smoothly, but was mostly focused on 2020-2022 – longer-term
forecasts have remained quite stable. Analyst forecast dispersion has mostly increased for short-
term horizons. The smooth reaction of short-term forecasts, and the rather muted response of
long-term forecasts, paints a picture that is somewhat unusual when compared to the available
literature on expectations and stock returns. This literature indeed shows that (1) short term
EPS forecasts of analysts tend to underreact to news (Bouchaud et al. (2019), Ma et al. (2020))
while (2) long-term growth expectations overreact (Bordalo et al. (2018)). The fact that long-term
forecasts have reacted less (actually, not significantly so, beyond 2023) than short-term forecasts
might reflect the intrinsic short-term nature of the shock.
    Second, using stock prices, we back out the implied change over time in the discount rate for
each firm. If discount rates had not changed, by May 11, the decline in stock prices implied by
forecast revisionsis very close to realized returns (we compute unweighted returns in this paper).
We show that discount rate shocks are the main driver of the V-shaped evolution of stock-prices,
but, by mid May 2020, revisions were such that valuations were consistent with a discount rate
of about 10%, the same one as mid-February. This exercise is related to the large literature on
discount rates movements that was initiated by Shiller (1981). The difference between his analysis
and ours is twofold. First, we use forecasts of future cash-flows instead of ex post dividend realiza-
tions or model-predicted growth. Second, we decompose the increase in discount rate into three
terms: (1) interest rates, (2) unlevered asset risk premium and (3) the leverage effect (declining
stock prices lead to an increase in expected equity returns). We find that the leverage effect is
large: it contributes 2ppt to the increase in discount rate at the end of march, and 1ppt in mid

                                                  2
May after the market rebound. Overall, our decomposition suggests that the unlevered asset risk
premium has returned to its mid-February level by mid-May, so that (1) the increase in equity
premium is fully accounted for by the leverage effect and (2) it is fully offset by the 1ppt reduction
in interest rates. Last, we document that the sensitivity of cumulative returns to discount rates is
rather low in the cross-section of stocks. This suggests that the term structure of equity discount
rates is not flat, and that stock prices, combined with earnings forecasts, can be used to identify
it. This also suggests that non-flat equity risk premium term structure should be an important
component of firm valuation models (Ang and Liu (2004)).
    Section 2 presents the data. Section 3 analyzes analyst revisions. Section 4 connects forecast
revisions and returns. It also infers discount rates, decomposes them into leverage effect, risk
premium and interest rate. It also evaluates the sensitivity of returns to discount rate changes.
Finally, Section 5 concludes.


2    Data
Using CRSP (via WRDS), we select firms, which at the end of 2019 are traded on NYSE, Nasdaq
or Amex. Among them, we then retain the top 1000 by total market capitalization as of December
31, 2019. This gives us a list of Cusip identifiers, which we use to retrieve historical returns and
IBES forecasts through a Refinitiv-Eikon platform (Thomson-Reuters). We use Refinitiv to have
up-to-date forecasts and stock returns, which are not yet available on WRDS. We focus on forecasts
issued up until May, 11 2020 about Earnings per Share (EPS) for fiscal years 2020, 2021, 2022,
2023, 2024. We use forecasts averaged across analysts (i.e. the consensus forecast), as updated
on the Eikon platform on a daily basis. We also download Long-term growth forecasts (variable
LTG), providing expected annual growth in operating earnings over the next full business cycle.
We use market betas computed as of December 31, 2019, based on one year of daily returns. Data
on fundamentals (debt, total assets, GIC sector) are retrieved from Compustat.
    To give a sense of the data, we reproduce in Figure 1 the evolution of average EPS forecasts for
two large firms, Facebook and Ford. We show forecasts at five horizons (2020,..., 2024). We show
how these forecasts have evolved over time. First, we see that long-term expectations did not react
as much as short-term expectations. Second, forecast revisions differ across firms in expected ways:
small impact in the case of Facebook, while revisions of Ford’s earnings are strongly negative, even
for 2023.

3         Change in the Term Structure of Expectations
3.1        Term Structure of Implied Growth Forecasts
For each firm i at date t which has positive earnings in 2019, we compute the implicit annualized
growth at horizon h as:
                                                                     ˆ                                     ˙
                                                          1              Ft EP Si,h ´ EP Si,2019
                                            gi,t,h   “
                                                       h ´ 2019                EP Si,2019
This linearized growth formula allows to accommodate for negative future Ft EP Si,h , of which
there are many in particular during the COVID-19 crisis. To be in line with analyst forecasts1 ,
we use realized earnings as reported by IBES for EP Si,2019 .
   In Figure 2 we report the median implicit growth across all firms per horizon. We compute
the median of this implicit growth measure across firms, for each date t and each horizon. We see
that:

        • 2020 EPS growth expectations were slashed from 12% down to nearly -6%, or a 16% reduc-
          tion.

        • Longer-term growth expectations were reduced but to a much lesser extent. 2024 forecasts
          decreased from 13% annually to 10.2%.
    1
    IBES forecasts typically are about “street earnings” rather than GAAP earnings (reported in e.g. Compustat).
See Abarbanell and Lehavy (2007).



                                                                             4
This confirms the preliminary insights we gained from Figure 1. The bottom line is that analysts
have strongly reduced their forecasts, even for 2023.

                                                annual growth until 2024




     We then present again the above evidence in a different way, by looking at the term structure
of expectations of growth for two separate dates. In Figure 3, we plot the annualized growth rates
gi,t,h per horizon h for just two dates. This is essentially the same information as in Figure 2,
except that we show it only for two dates, and now report confidence bands.2 Consistent with
Figure 2, we find that forecasts have been revised downwards for 2020 (to slightly negative growth).
Analysts anticipate the COVID19 shock to last well into 2022. By 2023-2024, they expect the
economy to have returned to trend.


3.2       Disagreement among Analysts
IBES reports the standard deviation of earnings forecasts (across analysts) at the different hori-
zons, σi,t,h . This is a measure of disagreement among analysts and can be interpreted as reflecting
   2
    To be able to report confidence bands in a simple way, we trim the sample by removing observations 5 in-
terquartile range away from the median. On the chart, we report the mean (which after trimming does not differ
much from the median) and the confidence band as two times the standard error divided by the square root of the
number of observations.



                                                                       5

This figure shows the annualized growth rates gi,t,h per horizon h for two dates (February 15, 2020 and May 11, 2020), averaged across

computed as twice the standard error divided by the square root of the number of observations.

the level of economic uncertainty. We normalize this dispersion by dividing it by past realized earn-
ings (EP Si,2019 ) when they are positive. In Figure 4, we plot the median normalized disagreement
per horizon among firms in our sample. We observe a sharp increase in disagreement. Inter-
estingly, this increase is, until mid-April, stronger at shorter horizon, so that the term-structure
of disagreement is flipped-over: There is now more disagreement about short horizons than long
horizons, contrary to the pre-crisis period. Note that after April 15, we observe decreasing dis-
agreement about 2020 Earnings, reflecting the fact that Quarter 1 Earnings for 2020 are being
published, mechanically limiting uncertainty to the subsequent three quarters.


3.3      Analyst Biases
3.3.1      Optimism

The financial literature documents a positive bias in analyst forecasts (Dreman and Berry (1995)).
This upward bias can be partly explained by conflicts of interest (see e.g. Michaely and Womack
(1999), Dechow et al. (2000), Hong and Kubik (2003), Cowen et al. (2006)). It is tempting to shrink
analysts forecasts by an amount corresponding to the average bias, such as to use a more objective
forecast; However, while trying to do so, we found evidence that the upward bias of analysts has
been strongly reduced after the burst of the internet bubble: In Figure A.1, we computed for


                                                                            6

each year the average normalized difference between forecasted and realized earnings. While this
difference was strongly positive in the 90s, it has become quite close from zero, especially for
horizons of 1 and 2 years. This is in line with the view that regulations of sell-side research
introduced after the 2001 have reduced incentives for analysts to provide rosy views on companies
(Kadan et al. (2008)). It might also be related to an increased reliance of earnings guidance by
companies. We also investigated specifically analysts forecasts during the financial crisis, which
is the closest acute crisis episode: We observe in Figure A.2 drastic downward adjustments by
analysts after the Lehmann Bankruptcy, suggesting that conditional on updating, analysts do
not hesitate to slash their forecasts substantially3 . However, Figure A.2 also suggests that these
adjustments can be quite sluggish, raising the question of under-reaction, rather than optimism.

3.3.2      Over-reaction and Under-reaction

An old debate in the behavioral literature is whether stock analysts under-react or over-react to
news. Lakonishok et al. (1994), DeBondt and Thaler (1990), Laporta (1996) and Bordalo et al.
(2018) document extrapolative bias by analysts about glamor stocks. Abarbanell and Bernard
(1992) and Bouchaud et al. (2019) find evidence that analysts actually under-react, leading to
serial auto-correlation in revisions and predictability in forecast errors. The evidence so far in this
   3
     In a more general study of analysts forecasts in bad times, Loh and Stulz (2018) document that conditional
on a crisis, analysts are quite active in producing relevant information: forecast errors per unit of uncertainty fall,
and analyst publish more frequent and longer reports.


                                                                   7
paper shows that analyst consensus forecast is updated downward in a smooth manner, which
contrasts with the volatility of prices (see next section). This is interesting as over-reaction is
often associated to contexts of salient news, which the COVID crisis belongs to (See Ramelli and
Wagner (2020) for information on the spike of attention to COVID).
    The evidence that beliefs dynamics during the COVID crisis has been sluggish also applies
to the “Long Term Growth” (LTG) updates by analysts: This IBES variable, which corresponds
to average growth over the coming business cycle, is used in Laporta (1996) and Bordalo et al.
(2018). Figure 5 shows the evolution of median LTG (“Long term growth”) in our sample. We
restrict ourselves to firms for which an LTG is continuously present in the data.

                                                Figure 5: Long-Term Growth
This figure plots the the evolution of the LTG forecast (“Long term growth”) over time in our sample. We report the median (in %)
across all firms of the consensus LTG forecast reported by IBES (which is an average across analysts for each firm).

   Evidence from Figure 5 is consistent with evidence from the term structure of forecasts. Ex-
pectations for 2024 suggest a reduction in expected EPS growth until 2024 by about 1.5 ppt (see
Figure 3 for instance). Evidence from revisions in LTG does suggest a reduction of the same
amount.


3.4      Revisions across Industries
We highlight cross-industry dispersion if the COVID shock by showing how much forecasts at
different horizons have been revised in each´ sector. We ¯divide our sample of 1000 firms into

change in typical forecast of yearly EPS in a given industry for varions horizons. The different
bars allow to evaluate the relative persistence of the COVID shock across industries: Real estate
faces the strongest downward revision but only at short horizon. Utilities and Consumer Staples
are the sectors that are the least hit by the crisis, both in the short-term and the medium-term.
Some industries such as Consumer Discretionary face a very persistent shock (the revision in their
forecasted earnings is similar for 2020,2021,2022). Interestingly, the crisis has led to downward
revisions that are still visible at 4 years horizon: Analysts downgrade significantly their initial
forecasts even for 2023.

3.5       Revisions and Firm Leverage
The impact that a given cash-flow shock has on earnings should be larger for highly levered
companies. This is simply because debt interest are a larger fraction of total cash flows for these
companies, hence making earnings more sensitive to the shock. We test whether analysts do
indeed anticipate a sharper reduction of earnings for high leverage companies. To do this, we
sort companies in five leverage quintiles, using their market leverage as observed on December 31,
2019. We use the total book value´ of debt from¯ Compustat and market capitalization from CRSP.
                                   Ft EP Si,h
For each date t, we compute FT EP Si,h ´ 1 where T0 is February 15, and plot the median by
                                     0
(date, quintile of leverage) in Figure 7. This figure shows that downward revisions by analysts are

much stronger for highly levered companies. For 2020 earnings, companies in the highest leverage
quintile experiences a ´27% downward revision as of May 11, vs. ´8% for the lowest quintile of
leverage. For 2021 earnings, we also observe a large spread of ´21% for the high leverage quintile
vs. ´11% for the low leverage quintile.

4.1      Forecast-implied Prices vs Realized Prices
We now conduct an exercise similar to Shiller (1981) except that we use EPS forecast revisions
instead of ex post dividend realizations. We investigate the link between forecast revisions and
stock returns. As a motivating fact, we show in Figure 8 the strong positive relationship between
sector-level revisions in forecasts and cumulative returns over the same period.
    This suggests to directly analyze the link between changes in equity valuations and changes in
earnings forecasts. Specifically, for each firm-date we compute:

unweighted average cumulative returns (after trimming outliers). We assume gi is the average
sales growth rate at GICS industry level over 2015-2019. For each GICS sector, we compute the
average firm sales growth over 2015-2019, weighted by 2015 sales, after removing outliers. Because
of this cleaning procedure, such industry growth is well behaved, goes from 0.2% to 10%, with
an average of 3.5%. We estimate ri separately for each firm by imposing that P ViT0 “ PiT0 , at
the first date of the graph: This condition gives us one value of ri per firm, which is the implicit
discount rate in prices. Values of ri above 30% are excluded. We show the distribution of discount
rates in Appendix Figure A.3.
    We focus on 890 firms for which P Vit is continuously defined throughout the period. Forecast-
implied returns are down 9% since mid February while the (unweighted) average cumulative return
is down 20% since the same date. Put differently, the term structure of forecast shown above is
broadly consistent with half of the fall in the stock market on the entire period, but suggest a
large temporary increase in discount rates during that period.
    The forecast-implied estimate of -12% is robust to the choice of growth gi or discount rate ri .
In Appendix Figures A.4-A.5, we compute the implied cumulative return taking alternative values
of ri and gi . For simplicity, we assume in this robustness check only one discount rate for all firms,
so these figures should be interested as informative about elasticities, not level.

4.2      Discount Rates
We now provide an alternative presentation of Figure 9 where we compute the implicit firm
discount rate in market valuation at each point in time. Namely, for each firm i at date t we
compute the internal rate of return of buying one stock, which is the rit that solves:

                           Ft EP S2020,i Ft EP S2021,i Ft EP S2022,i p1 ` gi qFt EP S2022,i

                              1 ` rit     p1 ` rit q2   p1 ` rit q3   prit ´ gi qp1 ` rit q3
We set gi , as before, as the long-term growth rate at the industry level: We assume it is not
changed by the crisis. Note that by definition, rit “ ri , where ri is the discount rate used in
Equation (1). We solve equation (2) for each firm-year observation since mid February for which
all 3 forecasts and the price is available. This gives us a panel of discount rates which is the mirror
image of the difference between forecast-implied valuation and market valuation.
    We show the mean in Figure 10. The discount rate on stocks increases to 13%, down to about
10%, very close to its pre crisis level. This is consistent with the idea that fiscal and monetary
policy announcements managed to reduce the risk premium.
    To understand the dynamics of the IRR, we propose a simple decomposition which disentangles
three distinct effects: (1) changes in the risk-free rate, (2) the leverage effect and (3) changes in
economic risk-premia.

                                                                  12

stock-return from firms in our sample.

       To get to this decomposition, we write the change of IRR between time 0 and time t as:

                    it
                       is a measure of market leverage at dat t. This formula is an exact decomposition.
Its interpretation relies on the fact that even if the risk-premium asked by investors to bear
systematic risk does not change, the risk-premium on equity should mechanically be affected by
leverage. When values of assets drop, keeping debt unchanged, the exposure of equity to economic
risk increases due to the increase in market leverage4 . This effect is captured by the second term
of Equation (3), which is equal to zero if leverage has not changed between 0 and t.
    We implement this decomposition at the firm-level and after averaging at each date, we plot
the results in Figure 11, in which the thin black line (total change in IRR) is the sum of the three
thick gray lines. To compute the leverage variable lit , we use the firm’s market capitalization at
time t and the book value of total debt as of end of 2019.
    Figure 11 contains three main lessons: First, the Federal Reserve’s actions have reduced the

The thin black line is total change in IRR. It is an average at each time t over our sample of firms of IRRit computed above. We
decompose this line as the sum of the three thick gray lines, which represent effects coming from: (1) changes in the safe rate, (2)
leverage and (3) changes in economic risk-premium. These effects are measured by taking the cross-sectional average of respectively:
prtf ´ r0f q, p1 ´ lli0 qpIRRit ´ rtf q, and lli0 pIRRit ´ rtf q ´ pIRRi0 ´ r0f q, in line with Equation 3. Firm leverage at time t is based on

IRR by about 100bp via the safe rate of return. Second, the increase in unlevered asset risk
premium has been temporary: By mid-May, the unlevered premium has returned to its pre-crisis
level. Third, the leverage effect is quantitatively big, and contributes to all of the risk premium
effect. Overall, in mid May, the increase in risl due to the leverage effect was entirely offset by the
reduction in interest rates.
    Of course, these estimates are vulnerable to the fact that we assume that debt is safe, which
is not true during this period. We will include this adjustment in future work.


4.3       Cross-sectional Variation in Discount Rates

We find that the security market line implied by the cross section of discount rates is quite flat and
variable, as is well known (Fama and French, 2004). In Appendix Figure A.6, we take the panel
of firm-level discount rates, and regress the cross-section, every date, on firm-level betas supplied
by WRDS. The graph makes clear that the SML is lower than what the CAPM implies. It went
up and then back down.
    There is also considerable cross-industry heterogeneity. In Appendix Figure A.7, we report
the variation in discount rates across sectors: Energy and Real estate are the most impacted (real
estate discount rate goes up from 15% to nearly 25%). Information Technology goes up very


                                                                     14
slightly from 8 to 9%. Financials are in between, from 13 to 16%.


4.4    Decomposition of Returns During the COVID Crisis: Discount
       rates vs EPS forecasts
In this last section, we try to appraise the share of cross-section variation in returns that comes
from EPS forecast revisions, vs discount rates.
    We do this using the Campbell-Shiller decomposition (Campbell, 2017). It allows us to write
down prices as a function of dividend expectations and returns expectations where t is in years:

                               k            ÿ                  ÿ
                       pt “       ` p1 ´ ρq     ρj Et dt`1`j ´     ρj Et rt`1`j
                              1´ρ           jě0                jě0

so that log returns (between two consecutive dates excluding dividend payout) write:

                                              ÿ                      ÿ
                              rt “ p1 ´ ρq          ρj Rt dt`1`j ´         ρj Rt rt`1`j
                                              jě0                    jě0

where Rt ” Et ´ Es is the revision operator between two consecutive dates (in our data, two
consecutive days).
    Assume that term structure of expected returns follows an AR1 process Et rt`j`1 “ rjf ` µ `
pµt ´ µqφj . rjf is the safe rate of return at horizon j. The revision of expected returns becomes:

                                        Rt rt`1`j “ ∆rjf ` φj ∆µt

where ∆µt is the change in expected next year equity returns. To simplify the algebra – though
it is not necessary for the analysis, we assume here that the term structure of the revision of safe
returns is flat: ∆rjf “ ∆rf . In the beginning of 2020, the 3-month US Treasury bill and the 10
year Treasury have both decreased by 1.50 ppt.
     Thus, the return of firm i follows (adding firm subscripts):

                                      ÿ                          1           1
                      rit “ p1 ´ ρq         ρs Rt dit`1`s ´          ∆µit ´     ∆rf
                                      sě0
                                                              1 ´ ρφ        1´ρ

where ρ “ 1`e1d´p
               Ę and d ´ p is the mean log dividend yield. We assume ρ and φ are the same for
                         Ę
all stocks, but this first pass could be easily extended.
    We run this regression in Table 1. We define as sum of revisions for date d and firm i:

                                     1 ´ ρi

which implicitly assumes that there is no revision in earnings growth beyond 2022. This assumption
is supported by evidence from Figure 3. To simplify the exercise, we assume that ρi “ ρ “ .96
which is consistent with a P/D ratio of about 25.
    We also compute a risk premium measure as the internal rates of returns obtained from solving
Equation (2). This methodology, described in detail in the previous Section, assumes a flat term-
structure while the current decomposition allows for mean reversion in risk premium (φ ă 1). We
will work on making the two approaches more consistent in future research.

Note: We cluster error terms within observations of the same firm.

    The first key lesson of this Table is that the cross-section of cumulative reaction to the crisis
is mostly explained by discount rate. Focusing on EPS forecast revisions only, we only explain
about 10% of the variation.
    The second key lesson is that the model is sensitive, but not enough, to discount rate shocks.
One possible explanation is that expected returns are badly measured. A second explanation is that
φ ă 1, i.e. that discount rate shocks are expected to mean revert at long horizon. Combining the
coefficient on ∆µid and the coefficient on Revid , we can back out ρ and φ. Looking at the regression
in week 14 for instance, we obtain ρ “ .965 (which corresponds to a mean D/P ratio of about

                                                         16
3.5%), and φ ´ .92, which corresponds to a persistent, but not perfectly flat, risk premium. We
will study the implication of mean-reverting equity risk premium for valuation in future research
(see Ang and Liu (2004)).


5    Conclusion
Firm-level analysts’ consensus forecasts have been sluggishly revised down over March, April and
May 2020 before leveling off. Analysts expect a long-lasting impact of the crisis: Even at long
horizon, forecasts have been negatively impacted. Overall, assuming a constant discount rate,
downward revisions are consistent with a mean average return of -12%, very close to the observed
fall in equities. The actual discount rate started at 10% before the crisis, went all the way up to
13% in late March, back down to 10% in mid-May. This stability of the discount rate comes from
an increase in the equity premium of about 1ppt, fully offset by a reduction in interest rates by
1ppt over the period. We also observe that the entirety of the risk premium increase comes from
the leverage effect: Adverse news increase the cost of equity. Unlevered asset risk premium only
increased temporarily.

We use IBES for the 1,000 largest firms by stock market capitalization every year. For each firm, we compute the consensus forecast
error as the difference between median EPS forecast and realized EPS, normalized by median forecast. We ensure that the median
forecast is positive, and trim outliers more than 5 IQR away from the median. We compute the mean error across all firms over periods
of 5 years. A positive value indicates ex post optimism. We implement this exercise for 1,2 and 3 year horizon forecasts.

We focus on firms with whose fiscal year ends in dec 31. For each firm, each month and each horizon we compute the difference between
the median consensus forecast and actual realization, normalized by EPS in 2007. We impose that 2007 EPS is positive and trim
outliers. We do not report 2008 FY forecast, since FY 2008 was largely completed when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt (so forecasts
were not much revised). Reading: In September 2008, analyst EPS forecast for 2009/2010 were about 60% higher than the ex post
realization.          .8
