                The Role of Intergenerational Transfers
                    in Aggregate Capital Accumulation



                                 ABSTRACT



     This paper uses historical u.S. data to directly estimate the contri-

bution of intergenerational transfers to aggregate capital accumulation.

The evidence presented indicates that intergenerational transfers account

for the vast majority of aggregate U.S. capital formation; only a negligible

fraction of actual capital accumulation can be traced to life cycle or "hump"

savings.   ~   major difference between this study and previous investigations

of this issue is the use of actual rather than hypothetical longitudinal

age consumption profiles.     These profiles are simply too flat to generate

substantial life cycle savings.

     This paper suggests the importance of and need for substantially greater

research and data collection on intergenerational transfers.       Life~cle

 Brumberg presented their Life Cycle Theory of Saving.       During this period

 numerous articles either invoking or   testi~g   the Life Cycle Theory have been

 written.   Despite this research effort, the importance of pure life cycle

, or "hump" savings to the process of capital accumulation remains unresolved. 2

 This paper presents evidence that the pure life cycle component of aggregate

 u.S. savings is very small.   Intergenerational transfers appear to be the

major element determining capital accumulation in the United States.

       Distinguishing the roles of life cycle saving and intergenerational

 transfers in the capital accumulation process seems to be a sine qua non

for informed discussion of a number of important economic issues.        The

traditional Life Cycle Model which either assumes away or denigrates the

 importance of intergenerational transfers has been the principal paradigm

of savings behavior used in economic analysis for the past twenty years.

The Life Cycle Model provides a theory of the distribution of wealth as well
                                                       3
as theories of the incidence and optimality of taxation. It has been used

as the basis for studies of the effects of taxation,social

change, and stabilization policies on capital formation.         Economic models which

incorporate intergenerational transfers can generate strikingly different results

for a number of major economic issues, including the burden of the national debt,

the impact of sPcial security on savings, the incidence of taxation, the perpetu-

,ation of the inequality of wealth, and the optimal structuring of taxes to pro-
                        5
mote econanic growth.

      This paper uses historical U.S. data to directly estimate the importance

of intergenerationa.l transfers as opposed to life cycle savings fo the U.S.

capital stock.   Our finding that intergenerational transfers explain the
                                         -2-



great bulk of U.S. wealth holding is based on a new methodological approach
                    6
to the problem.         In particular, we make'use of a variety of historical

U.S. data detailing population, labor earnings, consumption, and government

taxes and transfers to directly estimate the shapes of historic age earn-

ings and age consumption ·profiles.        These profiles are then used in conjunc-

tion with data on rates of return to calculate a stock of life cycle wealth.

This stock of life .cyc1e wealth is compared with aggregate wealth holdings

in the United States.       If there were no·intergenerational transfers, the

stock of life cycle wealth would exactly equal total          U~S.wea1th.   When

intergenerationa1 transfers occur, these two stocks differ by an amount

equal to the stock of net received transfers.           Hence, comparing total wealth

with life cycle wealth indicates whether the life cycle model, by itself,

can explain aggregate U.S. capital formation.           We find that lifetime con-

sumption and earnings profiles do not exhibit the kind of shapes needed to

generate substantia11ife cycle savings.          Log linear approximations

to these profiles suggest that growth rates of          reale~rnings sl~ght1y

exceed    i~Qwth   rates of real   consUmpt~~n .over   the 1ife-
time.     Since the life cycle theory strongly relies ona lifetime growth

rate of consumption in excess of the growth rate of earnings, the life

cycle theory of savings with no intergenerationa1 transfersis a very poor

description of the process of capital accumulation in the U.S. economy.

        Our findings are in agreement with recent studies by Betsy White (1978)         !'


and Michael Darby (1979) which use different data and techniques to address

this issue.    White uses a life cycle simulation model and concludes,

                   For a wide range of parametric values, the simulated
                   (life cycle) values of aggregate savings fall sign-
                   ificantly short of the observed levels. At best the
                   simulated values are about 60 percent of the observed
                           7
                   values.

Darby's study is conceptually similar to our own.         Darby analyzes micro

data and divides current asset holdings into a part that will be used to

finance future streams of consumption less earned income and a part that

will be used to finance future intergenerationa1 transfers.        Darby indicates

that although,

                  ••• the method of estimation used in this analysis
                  tended to overestimate the portion held for 1ife-
                  cycle purposes, ••• these life cycle assets were
                  still only 13 to 29 percent of total assets depend-
                  ing on the interest rate used. 8

     Our results rationalize other stylized facts about the U.S. economy

which are at odds with the life cycle theory.        Mirer (1979) presents

evidence from social security data that, " ••• the aged do not run down

their wealth during their 1ifetime. rl9 -Indeed, ·after he adjusts for inter-

cohort differences in wealth at retirement, Mirer finds, " ••• that wealth
                                  10
clearly increases with age."           Darby (1979) points out that although the

ratio of expected retirement years to expected life span increased by 67

percent from 1890 to 1930, aggregate savings , rates showed
                                                        ,   no increase
                                                                         11
during this period as would be predicted by the life cycle theory.

Atkinson (1971) and·Ou1ton (1976) construct life cycle models to determine

how much of observed British inequality of wealth may be explained by

this theory.     The answer is very little.     After taking into account inequa1-

ity in age earnings profiles and realized rates of return, Ou1ton eon-

c1udes, "The results indicate that none of these factors,either singly or

in combination, are capable of accounting for a substantial proportion of
                             12
actual wealth iRequa1ity."

    We have two objectives in writing this paper.          One is simply to answer

an accounting question, viz.; Can Life Cycle Savings by itself account for

the U.S. capital stock?     The second goal is to answer the economic
                                        -4-


question, how important are intergenerational transfers to     u.s.   capital

accumulation?     These questions do not ask the same thing; decisions about
                                              ,
lifetime consumption and lifetimeintergenerational transfers are jointly

made, hence answering the latter question requires explicit recognition of

this interdependence.

      Section I presents a theoretical framework for considering the import-

ance of intergenerational transfers to aggregate capital accumulation.

We indicate here ,the difference between the accounting and the economic

questions posed above.     In Section II we discuss 'our procedure to estimate

the stock of life cycle wealth.     The data used in this calculation are described

in Section III.    Section IV presents and intuitively motivates our finding.

The sensitivity of our findings to reasonable possible errors in the data and

estimation procedure is also considered.      The fifth section is devoted to explain-

ing the residual between total U.S. "wealth and the stock of life cycle wealth.

This residual equals the stock of accumulated net received transfers.       Using

the limited information available, we attempt to show that the annual flow of

transfers   and the age difference between donors and   re~ipients    is consistent

with our estimate of transfer wealth.     The sixth and final section of the paper

presents the conclu~ions and discusses some of their implications.

I.    Life Cycle and Transfer Wealth -- A Theoretical Framework



        The division of the stock of wealth,'W, into life cycle and transfer

components, respectively Land T, is easily understood by considering a

three period model of economic growth witp identical individuals in each

age cohort.    At a point in time aggregate wealth in the economy is the sum

of individual wealth holdings.    Letting Wi stand for the wealth holdings of

a representative individual of age i'and P. for the population of individuals
                                              1

aged i, we can write:

       The Wi's equal, by definition, accumulated flows of net received

transfers, accumulated flows of earnings net of government taxes less govern-

ment transfers, and accumlated flows of consumption, where accumulation takes

old from individuals who were then two periods old. Let e         and c        represent

the earnings and consumption of k period old individuals when they were i

periods old.   Assuming that earnings and consumption occur at the end of

each period, WI' the wealth of age 1 individuals, equals zero.            Using

transfers, T would equal zero, and W would equal L.                                                  Our first goal is to

establish the relative magnitudes of the two components T and L and, thereby,

determine whether U.S. wealth holdings can be predominantly explained by

life cycle savings.              Since substantially less information is available about

the values of the T , most of'Jour efforts in this paper are devoted to
                   ij
calculating the value of L.                     In section V, however, we do attempt to estimate

T directly using fragmentary data and invok:l.ng-.steady state assumptions.

        If the economy is in a steady state, net intergenerational

transfers received at a given age are constant through time, so that:

Using (4), (5), (6), and (7), we may express T in the steady state as:

      If we further assume that r=n,T equals the yearly net flow of transfers
                                                       ,
from old to young cohorts, t, multiplied by the transfer weighted age gap,

g, between donors and recipients:

(9)


      If r exceeds (is less than) n, accumulated transfer wealth will exceed

(be less than) the annual flow of transfers times the weighted average age gap.

Equations (8). and (9) show that the contribution of transfers for the total

stock of wealth depends critically on both the volume of the annual flow of

transfers and the age span of transfers.   Equation (8) is used in section V

which attempts to directly estimate the size of T.

        The secDnd goal of this paper is to ask the economic question how would

the U.S. capital stock, W, change if, because of changes in taxes or tases,

intergenerational transfer wealth, T, was reduced.         That is, we recognize the

possibility that changes in transfers might induce changes in consumption

and earnings paths and thus alter the life cycle component of wealth.            This

question may be posed in both partial and general equilibrium contexts.            The

partial equilibrium change in W resulting from a reduction in T holds wage

rates and interest rates constant and corresponds to a shift in the household

supply curve of capital.

        For purposes of this paper we consider only the steady state partial

equilibrium impact of changes in transfers on the capital stock.         An empirical
calculation of the general equilibrium effect requires knowledge of the

responsiveness of the shapes of earnings, cortsumption, and lifetime transfer

profiles to changes'in interest rates and wages.

        The Steady State Partial Equilibrium Reduction in Capital Intensity

        Arising From a Reduction in Intergenerational Transfers

        In order to analyze the partial equilibrium reduction in the stock of
                                      ,                      ,
wealth we first note that life cycle wealth, L,equals accumulated earnings minus

accumulated consumption.    Accumulated earnings, iii"turn, equals accumulated wages

at full time work minus the accumulated value of leisure.        Letting C stand for

accumulated consumption, S for accumulated full· time wages, and M for the ac-

cumulated value of leisure, we rewrite (3) as:



(3' )          W= T + S - M - C

        The partial equilibrium percentage reduction in W for a percentage
                                           17
change in transfer wealth, T, equals:

Equation (10) indicates that the proportionate re9uction in the,capital stock

equals the share of transfer wealth in aggregate wealth, T/W, minus two

additional terms indicating how accumulated earnings and accumulated con-

sumption respond to changes in transfers.

         Our analysis of the response terms aM
                                             andaC     assume that the utility
                                                  aT    at
of consumption and leisure is separable from the utility derived from inter-

generational transfers.        This assumption implies that the marginal rates

of substitution between consumption and leisure at
different     p~ints   in time is independent of the level of intergenerational

transfers.        Two examples of utility functions exhibiting this property are:



                                    + alog T12 + alog T13 + alog T2l t alog T23

The term U stands for the utility of a representative individual of genera-

periods.      In (11) the individual derives utility directly from the level of

net transfers.        In (11') the individual derives utility from the utility,U ,

of his decedants.        This is an example of an "overlapping utility function."

For both types of separable utility functions the marginal rates of substitu-

tion between consumption and leisure are independent of the level of a,

the preference parameter influencing the size of transfers.                   In addition,

the first order conditions for the optimal choice of consumption and leisure

involve the equality between these marginal rates of substitution and the

relative prices of consumption and leisure at different ages.                  Hence,

neither changes in transfer preferences nor taxes on intergenerational

transfers which affect only the price of transfers, but not the price of

consumption or leisure, will alter the first order conditions.

      Given the     levelsof-trans~ers,             the utility maximizing levels of

consumption and leisure can be separately derived from these first order

conditions and the lifetime budget constraint given below:

         In (11) Ml , M2 , and M are the values of leisure in periods 1, 2, and
                                3
3 (by value of leisure we mean the number of units of leisure times the price (wage)

per unit).      The terms sl' s2' and s3 are full time wages in periods 1, 2,

and 3.      Equation (12) indicates that lifetime cOnsumption and leisure are

financed by full time lifetime earnings p'lus net lifetime received trans-
fers.       The separability assumption implies that changes in preferences or

taxes that alter the values of the T         have only an income effect on the
                                        ij
choices of consumption and leisure over the lifetime.

    We now demonstrate that this income effect of a change in transfers is
                                            l7b
identically zero for the case that r equals n. Using (5) and (6) to rewrite

(12) we obtain:

         We can also write the budget constraint (12') in terms of aggregate

transfer wealth T:

(12")


                                                 (r-n) (1+n)2 T

         As is clear from (12') -or (12"), when r=n, lifetime consumption and leisure are

financed solely out of lifetime full earnings, individuals effectively receive
                                            -11-




 their transfers, put them in the bank or other savings vehicles for a period

 of time, and then transfer the principle plus interest to the next genera-

 tion.     When the population growth rate equals the interest rate, all of the

 accrued interest on received transfers, as well as the principle itself,

 is used to maintain steady state transfers per head at a constant level.

 In the case that r=n; reducing transfers will have no impact on the steady state

 budget constraint.          This, in turn, means that the terms
                                                                     aM
                                                                     aT   and
                                                                                ac
                                                                                aT   in (10)

 are zero when r equals n; i.e., since lifetime consumption and earnings

paths stay the same when r=n, steady state life cycle wealth, L, will be

 unaltered by changes in steady state transfer wealth, T.             Thus, any decline

 in transfer wealth, T, will reduce total wealth, W, dollar for dollar in

partial equilibrium when r=n.

         Equation (12") indicates that when r differs from n, steady state

 changes in the level and pattern of transfers (the T   terms) affect the
                                                     ij
steady state budget;::cOl'fstrain-t only insofar as they alter the stock of

 transfer wealth T.          This is a general proposition   th~t   can easily be shown

 to hold independent of the number of periods in the model.               When r exceeds

n part of lifetime consumption and leisure is financed by lifetime transfers.

Again, under the separability assumption, the reduction in transfers has simply
an income effect on consumption and leisure, and,assuming both are normal

goods, will reduce lifetime consumption and raise lifetime earnings.                     In

For purposes of this calculation we consider a continuous time period model

in which individuals live for D years.                  D equals 55 in the calculations.

If we take age 18 as the age of adulthood, then an age of d.eatll of 55 corresponds

to a real world age of death of 73.                  The 1       terms in (13) are units of leisure

 growth.     In this paper we calculate a portfolio weighted net nominal

 rate of return for the U.S. economy from 1900 through 1974 (see Table B1).

 After subtracting inflation, the real annual net rate of return in the

 U.S. economy averaged 4.5 percent over the period 1900 to 1974. 21

         These figures suggest that the value of r has exceeded the value of n

 in recent U.S. experience.     Table II provides decade averages for population

 growth, productivity growth, and real net interest rates.

     Averages of real after tax rates of return exceed growth rates for each

of the pre-World War II periods: ~his relationship i~ reversed for

the post-war period with the exception of the .1950s.
     Another method of estimating the difference between nand r is to invoke the

steady state relationship that n-r equals the difference between aggregate annual

net earnings plus government transfers and aggregate annual consumption divided

by the stock of wealth.    We detail our sources for these series below.       The

average annual value for this ratio for the period 1929 to 1974 was -.0061, supporting

the view that r    has slightly excluded n during this century.

        The   fa~.   that real interest rates have on average exceeded growth rates sug-

gestS     that part of U.S. consumption and leisure may well have been financed by in-

terest earned on intergenerationa1 transfers. Hence, a dollar reduction in transfer
                                                ,
wealth ·can be expected to reduce aggregate wealth by less than one dollar.               The

calculated one        percent gap between rand n in conjunction with the numbers in Table

I suggests that eliminating transfer wealth in the U.S. economy would reduce total

wealth by about 70 percent of the amount of transfer wealth. While the 70 percent

figure is meant to be suggestive, rather than precise, it appears that almost any
                                                                                     22
choice of preferences would yield offset factors not far from 70 percent.

        To summarize this section, we have demonstrated how total U.S. wealth holdings

can be divided into transfers wealth and life cycle wealth components. We have also

indicated, using an illustrative utility function, how changes in the size of trans-

fer wealth can be expected to alter steady state wealth holdings in partial equi1-

ibrium. We now turn to the task o'f estimating the magnitudes of transfer and

life cycle wealth in the U.S. economy.

II. The Estimation of Life Cycle Wealth -       ~ethodo10gica1   Approach

        Total life cycle wealth in the U.S. economy equals the      SUttl   over all living

persons in the economy of life. cycle assets. Each person's life cycHe assets correspond

to his (her)    accumu1at~d   earnings less his (her) accumulated consumption where accumu-

1ation occurs at the actually realized rates of return.          If we had data detailing each

person's earnings, consumption, and realized rate of return on assets at each point

in time in the past, it would be easy to check whether U.S. wealth holdings could be

explained predominantly by life cycle accumulation.

        Obviously, such detailed individual specific data is not available. However,

historical data for the United States on aggregate earnings, aggregate consumption,

rates of return, age-earnings, and age-consumption profiles may be used to carry out

this life     cy~le   asset computation on a cohort-by-cohort basis. In this paper we treat

individuals of each sex within an age cohort as if they were identical. We estimate

for male and female age cohorts in 1974".the average excess of after tax earnings

plus government
                                               -16-




transfers over consumption experienced by members of that age-sex cohort

during each of their adult years in the past.         These differences are then

accumulated up to 1974 using historical net nominal interest rates.         The

total over all age-sex cohorts of these accumulated life cycle assets is

then compared with the 1974 value of total U.S. private net worth.

       Life cycle wealth of the age-sex cohort that is age a and sex j (j

        Calculation of Longitudinal Profiles of Net Earnings, Government

        Transfers, and Consumption

        The essential idea involved in these calculations is to use

cross sectional distribution profiles    t~   allocate aggregate flows of net earn-

ings, government transfers, and consumption to different age-sex cohorts in

a given year.    By performing this computation for each year from 1900 to

1974 we obtain the longitudinal profiles E (a,i) ,G (a, i) , and   Cj (a,i} as i

        To illustrate the computation for E.(a,ih we define the following
                                          J
terms:

e         - average earnings of 40 year old male workers in year t

g (a,t) - ratio of average earnings of male workers at age a in year t to
    m
            average earnings of 40 year old male workers in year t.

g'f(a,t) - ratio of average earnings of female workers at age a in year t

            to average earnings of 40 year old female workers in year t.

At        - ratio of average earnings of 40 year old female workers to average

            earnings of 40 year old male workers in year t.

a (a,t) - percentage of males age a with work experience in year t.

 (16)


           The procedure for computing the longitudinal profiles of consumption,

C.(a,i), is identical to that just described for earnings; we use cross
    J
sectional profiles of relative consumption by age and sex to distribute

aggregate U.S. consumption in each year to different age-sex cohorts.                 More

precisely, let us define:
                  ,
 c              - average consumption of a 40 year old male in year t
    L


~       (a,t)     ratio of average consumption of males at age a in year t to average

                  consumption of 40 year old males in year t

~f(a,t)         - ratio of average consumption of females at age a in year t to

                  average consumption of 40 year old females in year t.

y               - year t ratio of average 40 year old female £onsumption' to average
    t

                  40 year old male consumption

                  total U.S.' consumption in year t.

           Given information about all other variables, we use ,equation (17) to

solve for C :
           t

The terms Cm(a,i) and Cf(a,i) can now be computed as:

           Calculation of Net Nominal Interest Rates Series

           The interest rate term r(a,i) depends only on the year t since
                                                   ,
r(a,i)       = r(197 4-(a-i» = r(t).      We computed two different interest rate

time series, series I and series II, using two quite different methodologies.

Series I was calculated by dividing U.S. wealth holdings into six separate

assets, calculating a rate of return series for each asset, and then weight-

ing eachasset'srate of return by its share in the U.S. portfolio for the

particular year in question.

           Equation (2~); indicates that private U.S. net worth in year t+1. equals

U.S. net worth in year-t, plus savings in year t.             Savings in year tis,

in turn, equal to income on assets, rtW , plus after tax labor

III.      Description of the Data Used To Calculate Life Cycle Wealth

       Bureau of the Census estimates of tge U.S. population by age and sex

for every year from 1900 through 1974 is one of the key pieces of informa-
                           26
tion used in our analysis.    These population numbers are used in equations

(14) and (17) to generate the terms Ej(a,i), Gj(a,i)~ and Cj(a,i); they are
also used in (13) to compute each age-sex cohort's total life cycle wealth,

       Information on compensation of employees after 1929 is obtained from
                                  27
the National Income Accounts.          For the years 1909 to 1929 we use estimates

from Kuznets and Levin et. a1.         For years prior to 1909 employee compensation

is imputed from Kendrick ,·s estimates of net national product using the ratios

of employee compensation to nationa1product for the years 1909 to 1918. 28

To impute labor    i~come   to the self employed we follow Kravis (1959) and

Christensen (1971) and multiply the numbers of proprietors by the average

earnings of full time equivalent employees. 29         Christensen (1971) discusses
                                                                  30
possible biabes resulting from this type of imputation.                The chief bias

is simply that the self-employed may earn more or less on average than employees.

A second bias· is· that our enumeration .of :the··self .emjl10yed does ·not, include unpaid

         Accounts.         Combined employer and employee social security and health insurance

                                32
         for various years.

                 Estimates of the age earnings profiles for men and women were obtained

         by fitting separate         ~~essions   to social security estimates ,of median

         annual earnings of workers at different ages for the years 1950 through
                 33
         1975.         These regressions included higher order terms in age, time, and
         interactions between age and time.          The general shapes of the profiles pre-

         dicted by the regressions are quite similar throughout the 1950-1975 period.

         For the years prior to 1950, the predicted male and female age-earnings
                                                         34
         profiles for the year 1955 were used.

                 The value of At' the ratio of average earnings of 40 years old female

         workers to average earnings of 40 year old male workers in year t was taken

         to be .55 throughout the period.         This appears to be an upperbound value for
                                                                                      35

                 Values for work experience rates by age and sex, ,Qm(a,t) and Qf(a,t),

         are available only after 1959. 36         Substantially more information, especially

         for the early 1900's-is available on labor force participation rates by age

         and sex.     Regression analysis for the post-1959 period indicates that work

         experience rates can be predicted quite closely by functions of age and

         labor force participation rates.         We chose, therefore, to use this regression

          to estimate the a. function for each year from 1900 to 1974 by ..inserting
                                                                         37

             While we computed cross-sectional distribution functions by sex and

      age for social security and medicare transfers, we could not find data with

      which to compute these distributions for other types of transfers. 39            Henc~,
      we assumed that these other transfers which include veterans' benefits and

      welfare payments were distributed in the cross-section according to the age

      earnings distributions. 40

      durables to obtain true economic consumption.          The difficulties of implement-

      ing this for the pre-1929 years led us to simply use the consumer expenditure

      series.       In any case, there appears to be very little difference between
                                                                                           42

             To calculate the cross-sectional consumption distribution functions

      the 1960 and 1972-73 Consumer Expenditure SurveX (CES~ tapes.             The 1972-73

      survey indicates total household consumption as well as the ages and sexes

      of all household members.       The 1960 survey provides more limited information

      In distributing total household consumption to household members we

 assumed that household heads and their      s~ouses     consumed equally; all other

 household members, including children, were allocated fifty percent of the

 household head's consumption.       Having allocated a level of consumption to

 each household member, we then reallocated the total consumption of children

 under the age of 18 to the household head and spouse; assigniug each one: pa1f

 of children's consumption in the case of two spouses, or giving all the

 children's consumption to the head if he(she) was single.          The general shape

of the profiles was quite insensitive to whether we assumed that other house-

hold members and children consumed the same or only 50 percent of the consump-

 tion level of the household head.       The 50 percent assumption generated

slightly more life cycle wealth and is, therefore, the one we present.

      In order to make similar use of the 1960 CES tape we imputed missing

information about the sexes and ages of other household members from informa-
                                             46
- fion derived fromthe--19-n-73CES t-ape.          Figures I and II present the

male and female relative consumption profiles that we1constructed.           The

profiles for the two periods are quite similar for both the males and the

females.       Unfortunately, similar data is not available to generate these
                                47
profiles for earlier years.          Hence, we are forced to assume that the cross-

sectional age consumption profile for the earlier years had a shape similar

to that of the profiles in latter years.          Life cycle wealth is computed

using the 1972-73 cross-sectional profiles throughout the period 1900 to

1974.- The 1960 profiles generated essentially the same level of life cycle
          48
wealth.

     As an additional check that our CES consumption profiles were generally

accurate, we also used the 1962 Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances

       to construct profiles of relative consumption by age.        The Federal Reserve

       Survey does not report consumption directly, so we estimated consumption

       as the difference between income and savings.        As with the 1960 CES tape,

       we imputed age and sex information for other household members.        The Federal

       Reserve profiles are generally quite similar in shape to the CES profiles. 49

            Our-net nominal interest rate series I is constructed using data on

       historical rates of return and data from Goldsmith on portfolio shares.           From

       Goldsmith's balance sheets we generate seven asset categories plus liabilities. 50

       These are tangible, non-corporate business assets including land and

       structures, residential land and structures, money, short term claims

       (savings accounts and u.S. treasury bills), corporate stock, long term

       corporate bonds, and u.S. savings bonds.      A rate of return series was

       associated with each asset type as well as the liabilities.        A weighted rate

       of return was calculated taking the share of each item in net worth during

.. '   'the period considered as the weight.

            The rate of return on liabilities was taken to be, the prevailing mortgage
                                                   5l
       rate and entered with a negative weight.          Rates of return on stocks from

       1926-1974 are reported in Ibbotson and Singuefield (1976).        Prior to 1926

       we assume a 5 percent dividend and add in the capital gain on stocks indicated

       by the Standard and Poor's Index. 52     Long term corporate bonds returns are

       also available from 1926 from Ibbotson and Singuefield as are returns on

       u.S. Savings Bonds and Treasury Bills.      Prior to 1926 we follow Ibbotson

       and Singuefie1d and assume a 4 percent coupon on long term corporate bonds.

       -The percentage revaluation of corporate bonds is given by the Standard and

       Poor's Index of Aaa bond prices. 53     Prior to 1926 the U.S. savings bond

       return was assumed to equal the return on long term corporate bonds.

           The   u.s.   treasury bill return was applied to short term claims after 1926.

           For the earlier period the short-term rate of return was measured as the
                                                                                             54
           yield on corporate bonds with one year to maturity less 2 percent.

                   The return to residential land and structures was computed in two parts.

           The nominal capital gain was calculated after 1929 as the percentage incre-

           ment in the GNP price deflator for fixed investment. 55             Prior to 1929 we

           use Goldsmith's series on the value of one family houses. 56             The own rate

           of return to home ownership was estimated as the ratio of NIA imputed rent
                                                                                   57
           to the value of owner-occupied housing and residential 1and.                  These

           series are available only after 1946.             The computed own rate of return to

           home ownership from 1946 through'1974 averaged .0409.              We use this number as

           the own rate to home ownership for the period 1900 through 1946.                  Finally,

           we assumed that the rate of return to non-corporate tangible business assets

           equaled the overall rate of return to all other assets.

                   Our second net nominal interest rate series, series II, was computed

wealth series are constructed, in part, by use of the perpetual inventory

1Jlethod in conjunction with initial benchnfark estimates of the stocks of

different types of assets.
       The interest rate series I and II are reported in table Bl in Appendix

B.     Over the period 1900-1974 the series I interest rates averaged 6.43

percent.     From 1929-1974 series I averaged 5.43 percent,-while the

series II rates averaged 5.74 percent.      The correlation between the two series
 for this period is .665.    The fact that the series, II ,interest rates exhibit

reasonable magnitudes and correlate well with the series I rates reassures

us that our 1974 aggregate    u.s.   net worth number can be compared with our

 accumulated flows, although the net worth and aggregate flows numbers came

 from fairly different sources.      In our computations we fill in the series II

 rates with the series I values for the years 1900-1928.

 IV.    The Size of Life Cycle Wealth

       At the end of 1974 total net worth in the U.S. economy equaled 4.154 _

 trillion dollars.    Of the 4.154 trillion, 134 billiott dollars represents

 the tangible assets of non-profit institutions;60 in 1974 non-profit

institutions owned 4.4% bfcorporate equities. 61" -I~we assume that this same

percentage applies to all other financial assets, total net worth of non-

profit institutions in 1974 would equal $2-70 billion. 62    Subtracting $270 .. billion

from $4154':billion leave us with a 1974 net worth figure for the non-

institutional household sector of $3.884 trillion.      This is the number which

we compare with our life cycle wealth calculations.

       In addition to presenting total life cycle wealth of individuals,

which we call LCWI, we also present values of a secona life cycle wealth

concept, LCWII, which adds to LCWI an upper bound estimate 6f     acc~ulated

inter-spousal transfers.    Many economists would include within their definition
                                            -27-




of life cycle wealth the amount of accumulation that arises from inter-

spousal transfers.    Inter-spousal   transf~rs   gives rise to wealth accumulation

first because wives are on average younger than husbands and, secondly,

because females live longer than males.     Since it is conceptually difficult,

if not impossible, to exactly trace individual patterns of household formation

which involve marriage, divorce, and death, we added to LCWI what we believe

to be an upper bound estimate of the stock of interspousal accumulated

transfers.   To be specific, we assumed that all males      became married

at age 21 to females who were at the time age l8.6~ If either spouse died

prior to reaching age 75, all of his or her individual life cycle net worth

was assumed to be transfered to a surviving spouse; it was furthermore

assumed that the surviving spouse does not die prior to age 75.       Thus, for

example, if a 40 year old male dies in 1960 with $20,000 of 'life cycle wealth,

this $20,000 is transferred to a 37 year old female who is assumed still

to be alive 14 years later in 1974.     The $20,000 of received transfers

is accumulated up to 1974 at the prevailing interest ,rates.

     This procedure overestimates accumulated inter-spousal transfers for

three reasons.   First, not all transfers of decedents go to surviving spouses,

or even to surviving relatives in the same age cohort.       Secondly, not all

surviving spouses will, themselves, live until age 75.       Rather, many will

die much earlier, leaving the bulk of their residual wealth to children

or grandchildren.    Third, some decedents die without ever having married,

leaving their estates to younger cohorts.

     Table III reports the life cycle wealth numbers, LCWI and      LCWI~    that

we calculated using interest rate series I and series II, as well as

constant interest rates of 2, 4, 6, ,8; and 9 percent.      The series I values for
                                            -28-



LCWI and LCWII are, respectively, -1036 and 502 billion dollars. The series

II figures are -1229 and 733 billion dollars. These figures are strikingly

small; they are even more surprising in iight of the fact that we have made

a number ofassumpticms whieh would bias our calculation towards more
                   64
life cycle wealth.    Under the stricter definition of life cycle wealth,

LCWI, life cycle accumulated hump savings is a large, negative number.          The a11ow-

ance       for inter-spousal transfers yields positive, but very small estimates

of hump savings.    The 733 billion dollar series II LCWII figure for life cycle

wealth represents only 19 percent of the total 1974 U.s. wealth. Accumulated

intergenerationa1 transfers would, then, appear to represent the bulk of the

3884 billion dollars of U.S. wealth holdings in 1974.     By subtracting 733

from 3884 we arrive at 3151 billion dollars as the estimate of the 1974

stock of transfers wealth.     Taking the .7 (r exceeds n by about one percent)

adjustment factor as illustrative, entirely eliminating intergenerationa1

transfers would reduce U.S. wealth by about 2.2 trillion dollars in the

context of a partial equilibrium, long run steady state model.

        These small values for life cycle wealth do not appear to reflect the choice

of interest rates; no historically reasonable constant    nomina~    interest rate

will yield significant .positive life cycle wealth.
        To explain the large stock of U.S. wealth the life cycle

theory of savings must rely on a substantial excess of earnings

over consumption when young followed by an excess of consumption
                                          -29-



over earnings when old.        The historical reality for the U.S. is simply that

longitudinal earnings and consumption profiles have 'not exhibited the

kinds of shapes required for substantial, life cycle accumulation.       For males,

earnings profiles greatly exceed consumption profiles over most of the life

cycle.     For females, however, the opposite is true.     Life cycle wealth starts

out negative and remains negative allover ages. In figures III-VIII we

graph    longitu~inal   profiles of the sum of male and female average earnings plus gover,n-

ment transfer and average consumption for the different age cohorts.        The profiles are

presented in real 1967 dollars.        The diagrams clearly show that the male excess of

earnings over consumption is essentially offset by the female excess of consumption over

earnings.



        Contrary to the      life cycle simulation studies which have generated

substantial life cycle wealth, the actual growth rate of lifetime consump-

tion does not substantially exceed the actual growth rate in lifetime

earnings.' For example, the male age cohort that reached age 18 in 1920

experienced a growth rate of 2.93 percent in real eatnings between ages 18

and 65.     In comparison, the male growth in real consumption between ages 18

and 72 was only 2.32 percent.        For the corresponding female cohort, earnings

growth was 2.23 percent and consumption growth only 1. 72 percent.         Real

consumption profiles are fairly       fla~and    real earnings profiles peak in the

late middle ages, not at early ages.       Both of .these· faotors militate against

the life cycle theory of savings as an explanation of U. S. wealth holdings.

        The positive   m~e   and negative female life cycle wealth values generated

by these profiles       are displayed for a number of age-sex cohorts in table IV.

concepts. For males the LCWII values are smaller than the LCWI values because

the hypothetical spousal transfers from         d~cedent   females to surviving males

are negative.    Males, however, generally die with positive life cycle wealth

which leads to greater life cycle wealth (LCWII) for females when this male wealth

is passed on to surviving female age cohorts.

Table is based on the Series I interest rates.
     The large transfer wealth value of 3.151 trillion cannot SiMply be explained as
private transfers from old to young offsetting forced government social security
and medicare transfers from young to old.          Under the Barro (1974) view, introducing
                                                 -31-

       unfunded social security into an economy will lead to no change in consumption,

       but will increase private net transfers from old to young.             If Barro's view is

       correct, we can easily ask how large private transfers would have been with no

       Social Security and medicare system by. simply setting all historic social security

       and medicare benefits and taxes to zero in our calculation.              This procedure led to
       a series I value of 775 billion and a series II value of 1094 billion for               Lew   II.

       Hence, even if Barro is correct in his view about unfunded social security, transfer

       wealth would still have exceeded 2.79 trillion dollars in 1974 if there had never

       been a social security program.

           One possible problem with our calcuiLations is that the age consumption
                                                                                        ,
       profiles prior to 1960 may have looked substantially different from those

       after 1960.   We examined this issue by altering the shape of the cross-

       sectional age consumption profile.        To be precise, relative consumption

       prior to age 40 was reduced by 10 percent and relative consumption after'
.. - .-_. age 40 was increased by ·10 percent.    Thus , 60 year-olds were effectively

       assigned an extra 20 percent consumption relative to          ~O   year olds in every

       year from 1900 to 1974.     Altering consumption profiles in this manner produced

       values of -193 for LCWI and 1702 for LCWII using series I and -169 for                LCWI

       and 2178 for LCWII using series II.       These numbers are still quite small

       relative to the 3884 billion dollars of 1974 U.S. net worth.

           Another issue of concern is whether our data series on aggregate

       flows accurately describe U.S.experience in the 1900s.             As mentioned, to

       insure against under-estimation of the labor income of the self-employed,

       we have already increased our    es~fmates       (see Table Bl) by 20 percent.

       Raising this add on factor to 30 percent increases the series I values of

       LCln to -679 and LCWII to 872.     It is worth noting that eliminating any self-
       employment add on factor lowers LCWI to -1739, and LCWII to ~7l4.           A second data

       problem is the well known failure of the National Income Accounts to impute wages

 on the lawn and dishes d0 no t enter the
 calculation these types of errors concerning the size of earnings flows will

 be· offset by errors concerning the size,of consumption flows.

      Assuming other features of the national accounts were correctly         estimated~     large

non-cancelling errors in NIA reported flows of consumption and compensation of emp1oy-

ees would imply large values for the statistical discrepancy in the accounts. In             fact~


the statistical discrepancy has been and is extremely small.         In 1974 the statistical

discrepancy was only -.6 billion dollars.

      A final data issue concerns consumption expenditures of non-profit

institutions as well as contributions of individuals to such institutions.

Ideally we should subtract institutional consumption from aggregate consumption

and add contributions to these institutions to arrive at total household con-

sumption.    While not all the data needed for this adjustment is       avai1ab1e~    what

data is available suggests that the adjustment would be very        sma11~   and would
                                                        65
slightly lower our estimate of life cycle wealth.

      Our LCWII wealth concept effectively deals with possible bias arising

from differential survival probabilities between the richand the poor.

This calculation assumes that at least one member of 'each household survives

to age 75 and attributes all household life cycle accumulation to the surviv-

ing spouse(s).   Hence~   this procedure assumes that rich and poor households

have identical survival    probabi1ities~   which eliminates this issue of bias.

      Another type of aggregation error could arise if some households con-

tinua11y received higher rates of return on their assets than other households.

In order to investigate this issue one would need detailed knowledge of the

joint distribution of rates of return and household consumption and earnings

patterns.   Unfortunat1ey~   this information can not be obtained from existing
                                         -33-
micro data, and thisf-act precludes a reasonable assessment of the magnitude of

this source of error.

V.   Explaining the Residual -- The Stock of Transfer Wealth

        This section investigates the extent to which U.S. data on intergenerational

transfers can explain the large residual between total U.S. net worth and our

estimates of life cycle wealth.    The residual is, indeed, quite large.
      Unfortunately, there is very little data detailing non-taxed inter-

 generational transfers.           These non-enumerated transfers take many, many

forms.    Parents who lend money at below market rates to their children for a down pay-

ment on a house or a business are engaged in an intergenerational transfer.                    A

 father who makes his son a full partner in a lucrative business can effect-

 ively transfer large sums of money with no tax liability to the IRS.                    Parents

 who fully or partially support their children through college or after

 college are making transfers.            A grandmother's gift of her expensive wedding
 china and rings to her granddaughter is an intergenerational transfer.

 Transfersin these forms, as well as outright monetary gifts, are very rarely

 reported.

        To obtain some idea about how large aggregate                 i~tergenerational transfer
                                                                          ,   .


 flows need to be in order to explain a 3.151 tri 11 fon dollar stock of transfer

wealth, consider the multiperiod analogue to equation (8) which we develop

 in appendix A, equation          (a2~   and rewrite here:

                                (r-n)D
 (23)             T =   t
                            e
                                (r-n)
                                       (l_e(n-r) (G-I»


 Equation (23) is a simplified expression for the steady state stock of

 transfers; the formula assumes that            al~   transfers are given at age G and

 received at· age I.        t is the yearly flow of intergenerational transfers,

 D is the certain age of death, and r and n are respectively rates of interest

 and population plus productivity growth.              In the case r=n, this expression

 reduces to T=t(G-I), the analogue to equation               (9~:;"   'Xable V evaluates the age gap

 factor, i.e., the terms multiplying t for various.parameter values and taking

D to be 55. 65

                   To get a feeling for what these age gap factors mean, consider an age

             gap of 30 and a .01 excess of the interest rate over the population plus
                                                                                            67
             productivity growth rate.' Exactly which age gap is appropriate is unclear.

             An age gap of   30 would allow for some significant transfers to grandchildren

             as well as children.     The age gap factor for these parameters is 45. Hence,

             to explain 3151 billion dollars in transfer wealth the yearly flow of transfers

             would have to eqUal 3151 billion divided by 45, ·or 70 billion dollars. A

             2 percent differential between (r-n) again assuming a 30 year gap, would

             require only a 46 billion dollar annual transfer flow.


                   To estimate at least the bequest portion of the yearly transfer flow

             we made use of the 1962 Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances.

             Specif'fta11y;~we   firstr·determinedthe :distribution of net worth. holdings by

             age, sex, and marital status.       We then applied 1962 mortality probabilities

             to this distributio.n to arrive at an estimated distribution of bequests by
                                            68
             age, sex, and marital status.       Effectively, this procedure involves

             hypothetically killing off the people on the tape according to mortality
                                          -35-




 probabilities.     An additional adjustment to these figures was made in

 order to reconcile the U.S. aggregate net worth value estimated from the

 Federal Reserve    ~ape   with the RFT-MIT net worth data.

     Paul Menchik provided us with data from the Washington, D.C. Inheritance

 Tax File for the year 1967.       The data reveal that males who were married at

 the time of their death left 10 percent of their estate to their children.

 Married female decedents left 19 percent of their estates to their children.

 The proportion left to grandchildren and other young relatives is unclear,

 but it probably does not exceed 2 percent for males and 4 percent for females,

 which represents half of the percentage contribution to other relatives.

 For single male decedents 32 percent of the estate is left to children;

 the single female proportion is 37 percent.       Again taking half of the contri-

 butions to other relatives as "distant in age" intergenerational transfers,

 another 22 percent can be ascribed to single males and 23 percent to single

 females-.Usingthesefigures and the Federal Reserve simulated bequest distri-- --

 butions the estimated "distant in age" intergeneratio1)al bequest transfer flow

 in 1962 was 11.9 billion dollars.      Multiplying this figure by the 221.6 percent

 growth in the nominal value of total U.S. net worth between 1962 and 1974 gives

 us an estimate of the 1974 bequest transfer flow of 26.4 billion dollars.

     In 1974 the total value of life insurance death benefits equaled 8.885

 billion dollars.    In conjunction with .the Menchik numbers this raises our

 26.4 billion bequest flow figure to 28.9 billion.

     We also estimate the flow of intergenerational transfers from parents to

 children which occur in the form of f£nancial support during college.      In 1974

. college enrollment totaled 8.8 million students. 69    In 1976 parental contri-

 butions to college-enrolled children who were taken as tax deductions averaged
         70
$1738.             Assuming that non-tax dependent college-enrolled children received

one quarter,of this level of support, average support from parents in 1976 was

$1270.       Reducing this number by 15 percent, the growth in tuition between 1974
              71
and 1976           suggests a level of college support payments of about $1080 in 1974.

This type of intergenerational transfer"could then account for 10.3 billion

dollars of the total 1974 flow.          Adding the 10.3 to the 28.9 leaves us with

39.2 billion dollars of explained transfer flows.

      Another component of the intergenerational transfer flow are transfers made

in the form of trusts.          While we have not been able to locate direct data on

the value of new trusts formed in 1974, there is fiduciary income tax data for

~he   years 1965 and 1970 which permits a rough calculation of this transfer flow
               72
component.            Between 1965 and 1970 the number of new trusts established each

year averaged 35,098.          The 1970 income of the 152,398 existing trusts in 1970

totaled $7,513 billion.          The average 1970 trust had, therefore, an income of

$9,985.       Dividing this value by our 1970 series I interest rate of .0787 gives

an estimate of the average value of a 1970 trust of $126,874.            Multiplying this

figure by 35,098 leads t~ an estimate of 4.44 billion as the value of new trusts

established in 1974.          Multiplying this number by 1.395 to allow for the growth

in total wealth between 1970 and 1974, our estimate of the 1974 flow of inter-

ge~erational         transfers in the form of trusts is 6.19 billion dollars.    This

figure raises our explained transfer flow to 45.4 billion dollars.

      This    45~4    billion dollar figure seems small compared with the 70 billion

dollar total flow needed if the stock of transfer wealth is 3.151 trillion dol-

lars and the age gap factor is 45.          On   the other hand, it is not too far from

the 46 billion dollar total flow needed if r:exceeds n by 2 percent and the

age gap factor is 68.

    Unfortunately, before we can more precisely determine the total inter-

generational flow, substantially more information will have to be collected

about family gift giving and support payments to children and grandchildren.

This data may prove particularly difficult to obtain since it would involve

valuing the cedar chest passed from grandmother to grand-nephew, or the ·family

car given to son John as a college graduation   present~   or the value to sQn

Alex of making him a full partner in a lucrative family business. Since the

distribution of wealth is very highly skewed, such surveys need to be aimed at

the intergenerational transfer payments of the very wealthy.     However, the very

wealthy may be the least willing to disclose these types of transfers because

of potential estate and gift tax liabilities.



Summary and Conclusions

    The evidence presented in this paper rules out life cycle hump saving as

the major determinant of capital accumulation in the U.S. economy.     Longitudinal

age earnings and age consumption profiles do not exhibit the kinds of shapes
                                                       ,
needed to generate large amount of life cycle wealth accumulation.     The view

of U.S. capital formation as arising, in the main, from essentially homogenous

individuals or married spouses saving when young for their retirement is factually

incorrect.

    Intergenerational transfers appear to be the major element determining

wealth accumulation in the U.S.    Our best estimates of the 1974 stock of transfer

wealth after allowing for inter-spousal life cycle accumulation is approximately

3 ,trillion dollars.   Even after making a quite generous assumption that the

self -employed have 20 percent higher labor earnings than the non-self employed,

we estimate a stock of transfer wealth of at least 3 trillion dollars.

    While these estimates of the stock of transfer wealth are quite large,

totally eliminating transfers in the U.S. economy would not necessarily reduce
                                                                     -38-




                           total   u.s.   wealth by the full amount of transfer wealth.      We have demonstrated

                           within the contect of a steady state growth model that a dollar reduction in

                           the stock of transfer wealth may reduce total wealth by less than a dollar if

                           the steady state real interest rate exceeds the steady state growth rate.

                           Taking the U.S. historical real interest and growth rates as illustrative, elim-

                           inating a 3 trillions dollar U.S, stock of transfer wealth would reduce total

                           U.s. wealth by about 2.1     trillio~   dollars ina steady state context.       This, how-

                           ever, is a partial equilibrium analysis.         Substantially~more research    must be

                           undertaken before we can begin to attach probable numbers to full general equi-

                           librium responses to changes in transfers.

                               'Our paper has important implications for annual U.S. savings as well as the

                           stock ofU.S.--wealth." In.a,s-teady state framework total savings can be divided

                           into a part needed to augment the stock of transfer wealth and a part needed to

                           augment life cycle wealth.      To the extent that U.s. life cycle.wealth is negli-

                           gible, the great bulk of annual_savings can be attributed to savings for purposes

                           of intergenerational transfers.

                     Tobin (1967) and Boskin (1978) argue that Life Cycle Savings are the

                     Our methodological approach was greatly influenced by, and is similar

                 7White (1978), p. 547.     Indeed, White's estimates of life cycle savings

           may be substantially' upward biased, because she does not take into account

           the existence of the unfunded social security system during the period for-which

           savings is being simulated.      Kotlikoff (1979) has demonstrated that in a

           pure life cycle model, unfunded social security at a 10% tax rate would

           reduce steady state private wealth by about 20%.        I-f Whi.te -had eOBsidered. the

          'unfunded social security system, her life cycle model would have predicted

          - substantially less accU11'lul'a-tionand savings than she reported.      Tobin (1967)

           uses a simulation analysis similar to White's and concludes, "it seems quite

           possible that life cycle saving can account for the u.S. capital stock."

                                   Tobin's results, however, appear to reflect unrealistic assumptions about

                                   lifetime growth rates of consumption.

                                            Darby (1979), p. 3.       Darby's study relies exclusively on data from the

                                   1967 Survey of Economic Opportunity.             He uses estimates of savings and

                                   income to obtain estimates of the cross sectional profile of average consump-
                                   tion by age for cohorts over age 65.             Assuming that future cohorts"

                                   replicate (except for a growth factor) the current age consumption profile

                                   of the elderly, Darby calculates the amount of assets needed by current

                                   younger generations simply to finance their old age consumption.              These

                                   assets needed for old age consumption are then contrasted with total assets

                                   currently held by the pre-retirement cohorts.             While we found Darby's

                                   methodology very instructive, we do not consider his findings conclusive

                                   evidence; the analysis relies heavily on information contained in the older

           In the case of a tax on transfers the income effect of a change in

transfers when r   =n   will be zero only for the case of a compensated tax

on transfers.    Compensated, rather than uncompensated tax changes are the

appropriate focus of studies of government tax policies towards savings.        See

Diamond (1970) and Kotlikoff and Summers (1979).


     l8The utility function in (13).~orresponds only to that part of total utility

pertaining to consumption and leisure.     Any set of preferences for transfers

may be added to (13) as long as they do not influence the relative choices

of consumption and leisure at different points in time, i.e., as long as

utility of consumption and leisure is separable from the utility of .

transfers.    The assumption ofa steady state with productivity growth also requires

that the entire utility function be homothetic.

    The term"{ is the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption and

    leisure.      When Y equals one this utility function is logarithmic.              We tried a

    wide range of parameter values for "{ and P and found that for a 1 percent

    excess of rover n the values of (1- .~~ - ~i) ranged from .6 to .75.                  While

    it is unclear what       ut~lity       function is most appropriate, these parameter

    values cover a wide range of different shapes of consumption and leisure

    profiles and, we presume, bound the likely response.

    The assumption implicit in these utility functions
    that consumption and leisure respond homothetically to changes in transfers

    may be inappropriate.          In particular, even if the utility function is homo-

     thetic in consumption and leisure, the consumption and leisure response to a

     reduction in transfers may not be homothetic.                  This could arise because of

     capital market constraints precluding borrowing when young against future

    . earnings.    These capital market constraints may not be binding in the

                            young is financed by the received transfers.      Eliminating or reducing

                            transfers could make these'capital market constraints binding and require

                             proportionately less consumption and leisure when young than when old.

                                 A third issue is the extent to which the U.S. economy can be         sensi~ly

                            characterized as moving along a steady state.growth path.          To the extent that

                            underlying behavioral relations such as preferences for transferring wealth have

                            changed in recent years, our calcuiation of transfer wealth may over or under-

                            state future levels of transfer wealth, although our calculated number will
                            accurate~y    describe historic levels of transfer wealth.

                                       Treating consumption of children under age   l8   as their own life cycle

                            consumption would greatly. reduce our estimate of life cycle wealth and

                            greatly increase'our estimate of transfer wealth.       The age at which we take

                            adulthood to begin is somewhat arbitrary, but we feel that age 18 is a

                            reasonable number and of general interest.

Because of limitations on population estimates on individuals above age 85,

we treat all individuals who were above age 85 in 1974 as if they were age
85.     Since 85 year olds in 1974 did-not reach the age 18 until 1907, we

really don't use any data for the years prior to 1907 in this paper.         We

include-our estimates of certain data series back to i900 for possible use by

other researchers.
        29 The number of self employed for the years 1966 through 1974 is

available in the U.S. Statistical Abstracts for the years 1966-1975.         For

the years 1929 through 1965 the number of self employed is obtained by sub-

tracting the number of full time equivalent employees (NIA, 1965, p. 102)

from the number of persons engaged in production (NiA, 1965, p. 110).          For
1919-1928 we use Kuznet's (1941, p. 340) estimates.       King (1930, p. 162)
presents a series for the total number of entrepreneurs for the years 1909-

1927.    For the years in which Kuznet's and King's series overlap, Kuznet's
series averages 95.4% of King's.       For theyeam 1907-1918 we, therefore,

                    reduce King's series by 4.6%.          Budd (1960, p. 392) estimates the number of

                    entrepreneurs in 1900.           We assume a smooth 1. 4% growth in the number of

                    entrepreneurs from 1900 to 1909, the first year of King's series.                 Average

To adjust for this, we assumed constant relative earnings between ages 18

and 21 in all of our calculations.                 This   ~djustment     is somewhat greater than

necessary and biases our results towards more life cycle savings.

female-male ratio of median earnings at age 40.                      In 1937 this ratio took on

its highest value .462.          After 1950 the ratio never exceeds .410 and averages

.381.     1971 and 1972 BLS data (Annual Earnings and Employment Patterns)

at 40 was .402; in 1972 it was .395.                 The 1939 Census does, however, report

a much higher ratio.          The female-male ratio of median earnings for the age            t

       47we have been unable to locate the 1950 CES tape which represents the

 only other major study of consumption during this century.
       48 The 1960 profiles indicate less relative consumption when young

 which, by itself, means more life cycle accumulation.            However, they also

 exhibit less relative consumption when old, which, by itself leads to less

 life cycle wealth.         These two elements appear roughly to cancel.

             From the 1972-73 CES tape we catculated the average age gap between

husband and wife to be three years.        The number of deaths in an age sex cohort

in a particular year were obtained by multiplying age, sex, and year specific

death rates from the Census Bureau's population estimates.         We smoothed the

Historical Statistics, vol. I, death rates, series B 181-192, pp. 61-62.

       Even in the absence of marriage, our LCWII concept would be of interest

because it essentially treats individuals as if their wealth at each moment was

fully annuitized; i.e., given the uncertainty of the date of death, individuals

in a life cucle model with no bequest motive would always purchase annuities.

Hence, our procedure of essentially passing a cohort's bequest over to surviving

members mimics the operation of an annuitities market.         LCWII can then be thought

of as essentially the life cycle wealth of the U.S. economy if individuals always

purchased annuities.

            These include increasing the labor income of the self-employed by 20

percent, using a high value of .55 for the ratio of female to male earnings at

age 40, assuming that the age consumption profile is flat after age 75, and

assuming that all     ea~nings   after age 75 are zero.
       64b
             Roger Gordon has suggested to us that observed age earnings profiles

may differ from true age earnings profiles to the extent that firms and workers

are engaged in implicit contractual arrangements.         Firms could pay out to workers

less (more) thanthey truly earn when'young and more (less) than they truly earn

when old.     Some part of a worker's life cycle saving or dissaving would then be

accomplished,within th firm and would correspond to a claim (or liability)

attached to the firm's assets.       While we would strongly contest the empirical

validity of this proposition, certainly very upper bound estimate of life cycle

savings with firms would be the difference between the market and replacement

costs of capital in the corporate sector.        Using .819, the average value of q
                                        -54-



over the period 1952-1974 (von Furstenberg, 1977) and the 1974 replacement

value of corporate capital of 1.679 trillion dollars gives an upper bound esti-

mate of $304 billion for this effect.
       65
            In 1970 for example the level of philanthropic payments of individuals

totaled 16.09 billion (Historical Statistics, vol. I., series H 399-400, p. 359).

In comparison, the NIA (1974 p. 90, lines leland 102) reported 1970 expenditures \

of institutions for religious, educational and welfare activities totaled only

$11.32 billion.
       66
            If we take age 18 as the age of adulthood, the value of 55 for D

corresponds to a real world age of death of 73.

       67To precisely calculate a weighted. age gap we would need data detailing

age of donors and recipients as well as the size of the transfers.      Such data is

currently unavailable.

                Consumption and the Accumulated Value of Leisure for the

                Logrithmic Utility Function

       To simplify the exposition we assume that transfers are received at age I

only and that they are given at age G only.                      In the steady state b is the
transfer received at age I; ben(G-I) is therefore the transfer made at age G that is

needed to maintain transfers per person (or per effective worker when there is pro-

ductivity growth) constant.                 Letting P be the population of age zero
                                                     o
individuals, accumulated transfer wealth T is given by:

(al)

In (a1) aggregate T reflects transfers received less transfers made accumulated

up to the present at rate r and added up over the population.                      This equation

simplifies to:

                                         (r-n)D
(a2)              T       =P       b e            e-rI (l-e (n-r) (G-I»
                               o         r-n

       Note that in the case r=n, T=bPI(G-I); Le., T eijua1s the age gap (G-I)

times the flow of transfers, bPI.                    This is the same (r=n) formula that we

derived for the thre~ period example in the text, viz., equation (9).

       The lifetime budget constraint may be written as:

(a3)

Again~ the   termsC       and m are the values of expenditures on consumption and
                      t        t
leisure at time t.          The mt ' s can be written as l t times Wt' the number of

units of leisure, times the value of a unit of leisure at time t.                     S* is
the present value of full time earnings and be- rI (l-e (n-r) (G-I»                  equals

the present value excess of transfers received over transfers made during

the lifetime.    Note that when r=n this term equals zero, exactly as in equa-

tion (12'1    By maximizing the utility function' (13) subject to (a3) we obtain:
                                                                 -59-




(a4)


       Now accumulated consumption plus the                               acc~y.lated-value of     leisure can..be
expressed as:

(as)

Equations {a4) and (as) imply:

                                 P (S*+be-rI (l_e(n-r)(G-I»                        (r-n)D 1     (r-p-n)D

                    -M + C   =               (-PD)                    -           (r-n      -     r-p-fi
                                              l-e




       From (a6) and (a2) we obtain:

                                  P S*
                                   o
                                    (r-n)D
                                           -l    e                        (e(r-p-n)D_ l »
(a7)                M+ C =    -PD (   r-n
                           l-e                                                  r-P-n


                             +       T(r-n)      (e(r-n)D_1 _ (e(r-p-n)D_ 1 )
                                 e(r-n)D(l_e-PD)      r-n        r-p-n)

Hence, we derive:

                    a~M+Cj           r-n                                (e (r-n)D-1)       (e(r-p-n)D_ l »
