                        Israel1s Muted Baby Boom
                                ABSTRACT


 Cohorts born in Israel since the late 1910s were approximately 70
 percent larger than earlier cohorts. This brought about changes in the
age structure that are even more dramatic than the American baby boom.
This paper follows the impact of the large cohorts on the school
system and on the labor market, emphasizing the role played by the
public sector.

In terms of the number of teaching posts the school system
demonstrated on the whole a very prompt ability to adjust to the
pressure of high number of pupils. However, as rates of growth of
pupils decelerated, inputs in the school system failed to adujst down.
As a result, when the larger cohorts moved up the educational scale,

the combination of rapid adjustment where they arrived and sluggish

adjustment imparted an upward pressure to the aggregate expenditure on
education.

When the large cohorts arrived at the age of entry into the labor
force the impact was delayed and muted by a rapid expansion of the
army and of the universities. Relative earnings cf the young men 18_211

declined sharply during the decade. The earnings of the very young
seem to be responsive to the relative size of a broader age group
(18—3), as well as to        the size elderly (65      plus).

  MARKET, GOVERNMENT, AND ISRAEL'S MUTED BABY BOOM*




  Rapid changes arouse curiosity, and this paper is motivated by such

  curiosity. There is a great deal of
                                          variety in the rapid changes that we
  observe —   in   cohort size, age distribution, entry of women into the labor

  market, the level of education, ethnic
                                            composition, etc. Some of these
  changes are exogenous to the
                                  contemporary economic, demographic or social
  scene, some may result from other changes;
                                                some are expected and some come
 as a surprise.

      Generally, a problem is defined and
                                              a research program is designed
 around endogenous variables. In seeking explanations for a phenomenon
                                                                       we
 construct hypotheses, propose theories, or speculate about its causes

 which either predispose
                             one towards specific independent variables or

 impose a preselection of such variables.
                                             It is less clear how to chart a
 research project around an exogenous change: here is an exogenous
                                                                   variable
which may affect everything (or
                                    nothing) under the sun. If it appears in
many equations, what are we after?

     One argument in favor of
                                  focusing on large—scale changes is that they
may generate sufficiently robust findings
                                              that wIll show up even if the
analysis fails to take many other
                                  variables into account, so that they
provide more dramatic experiments for
                                      dealing with conventional questions.
Another is that rapid changes
                                 can reveal different aspects of social and
economic systems from those we learn about in the normal
                                                         course of events,
i.e., they invite different
                               types of questions. What we ask and what we

hope to learn has to do with the adaptability of society to rapid changes:
                                    absorb shocks, and the identification of
the assessment of the capacity to

bottlenecks and rigidities. This is a question of dynamics; the emphasis

                                          the phenomenon of rapid change. Now
is not on a particular variable but on
                                                                        of
it also makes sense to compare different cases of rapid change and ways

adjusting to them. While the exogenous shocks may stem from diverse
                                    and the relevant bottlenecks in each case
causes, the sets of protagonists

may have much in common.

     Several studies have examined the specific effect of cohort size on

unique experience of the baby boom generation. Louise Russel (1982) argues

 that on the whole the baby boom was not a very important phenomenon her

 judgement relates not to the presence or absence of partial effects but to

 the robustness or dominance of the phenomenon.

      Israel experienced a baby boom in the 1950s. In view of the keen

 interest in the American baby boom, one wonders whether the Israeli

 version had any effect. The sources of the Israeli baby boom were analyzed

 by Friedlander (1975). The potential significance of the rapid change in

 age structure was pointed out by Kop (1980).




 I. THE BOOM



 The Jewish population of Israel is based on immigrants, most of whom
                                         3



 arrived in the past century. Immigration occurred in waves, inducing

 uneven growth in the total population. The single most significant wave

 occurred in 1948—51 when the population doubled. Subsequent immigration

 rates fluctuated, but were much lower; between 1951 and 1973 the Jewish

 population grew at 3.8 percent annually, of which immigration directly

 contributed 47 percent. Between 1974 and 1980 the population grew at an

 annual rate of 2.1 percent, the migration balance contributing only 20

 percent.

      Looking at the age structure of the population in 1955 we see that

 the age group 0—4 numbered 214 thousand, while the age group 10—14, i.e.,

 those aged 0—4 in 1945, numbered only 122 thousand (Figure 1 and Table

A—i). Obviously, the jump in the size of cohorts is translated to big

spurts in the rate of increase over time of particular age groups (see

Table 1). The dramatic change was brought about by a combination of the

large and concentrated immigration, the higher fertility of immigrants, a

baby boom among immigrants (Friedlander, 1975), and perhaps some making up

of births delayed abroad prior to immigration (Ben—Porath, 1980).

     Most of the Jewish population in Palestine before 1948 was of

European origin (EA); only approximately one tenth originated from the

Arab countries of the Middle East (AA: Asia—Africa). Mass immigration was

more equally divided between these two groups. AA women bore far more

children than EA women —   in   1951 total fertilitjr of AA women was 6.31

while that of EA women was 3.16 and that of Israel—born women was 3.56.1

To these compositional differences there was added a baby boom within the

migrant population. The figures on age structure in 1950 for the European

born (not shown) indicate a deficiency in the size of the 5—19 age group

(i.e., those born in 1931—1945); the largest deficiency is for people born
                                   4



in 1941—1945, which partly reflects the effect of the war and the

holocaust on births and the creation and resumption of family life after

the war.2

     The subsequent changes in cohort size are a result of reduced

immigration and fertility, and an echo of the first boom.

     The crude birth rate declined sharply in the 1950s, increased between

1965 and 1975, and declined again from 1975 to 1980 (Table 2). The decline

in the 1950s was largely a result of the steep decline in age—specific

fertility coupled with a sharp drop in the share of women of the main

childbearing age (20—34) in the population. These outweighed the change in

the composition of women by continent of origin which, by itself, should

have raised fertility: because of the composition of immigration, the

share of women from AA among women of peak childbearing age, which must

have been less than 10 percent before 1948, rose to 22 percent in 1950, 35

percent in 1955, and 43 percent in 1960. This is only part of the story.

The decline in age—specific fertility rates continued throughout the

period, mostly among the immigrants from Asia and Africa whose fertility

converged down towards the levels of the European immigrants; only in

recent periods was there a decline also among the latter. Between 1965 and

 1975 we observe the echo of the original baby boom. The number of women

aged 20—34 rose from 215 thousand in 1965 to 347 thousand in 1975, an

 increase of 60 percent, while the total population of women rose by only

 30 percent. Children aged 0—4 increased in this period by 39 percent.

     There has been a trend towards postponed marriages which accounted

 for some of the decline in age—specific fertility rates. The marked

 decline in the proportion married between 1965 and 1970, coupled with a

 sharp narrowing of age differentials between brides and grooms, reflect
                                              5




 the coming of age of large cohorts of nubile women with some scarcity in

 the older male cohorts. Ben Moshe (1983) has found that the marriage

 squeeze brought about a decline in the age—specific marriage rates of

 women and an increase in the marriage rates of men.




 II. THE SCHOOL SYSTEM



 The relevant age group for elementary school is roughly 5—14. and the one

 relevant for high school is roughly 14—17. The evolution of these groups'

 sizes is as follows:




            1950     1955      1960    1965       1970     1975      1980

14—17      n.a.          5.8    6.3     8.8       8.2       8.2       6.9



Friedlander (1975) has demonstrated the effect           of mass   immigration and the
baby boom on Israel's school system by citing the absolute number of

children aged exactly 6 (in thousands): 1947 — 01.5; 1952 —             31.1; 1957 —
45.0;   1962 —   47.2.   During the 1950s the proportion of pupils out of this

rapidly growing population increased steeply, converging towards full

coverage in elementary schools by the end of the 1950s. Among those aged
                                   6



14—17 the proportion enrolled in schools rose from 43 percent in 1952 to

60 percent in 1960, fluctuated for several years when the population grew

at peak rates, and then resumed its growth in the mid—1960s to reach 80

percent in 1980. (Note that elementary education has been free and

compulsory in Israel since 1949; secondary—schooling is free since 1978).

     The most amazing thing occurred right at the start. There were 125

thousand pupils in the Hebrew educational system (excluding higher

education) in 1948/9. In 1951/2 the number reached 284 thousand, an

increase of 126 percent (or an annual rate of increase of 31.3 percent).

At the same time, the number of teachers' posts increased by 123 percent,

so that the average number of pupils per teaching—post hardly changed!

This, in a country whose total population had doubled, and where the

immigrant population was illiterate —   at   best in the language of the

country and often illiterate in general —    or   had relatively low levels of

schooling. The increased supply of teachers therefore had to come from the

absorbing population. It is a well—known fact that this rapid expansion

took its toll in terms of a deterioration in teachers' qualifications; it

is, in fact, remarkable that the response in quantities was so close to

perfect and that all the pressures translated into quality reduction. It

would have been reasonable to suppose that the quality—quantity tradeoff

would be more evenly balanced: a higher teaching load borne by few, but

better qualified teachers. We get a similar picture in the U.S. baby boom

where certification standards of teachers were lowered, and the student!

teacher ratio reflected only small pressures (Russell, 1982), p. 30.

     Let us now examine this response in greater detail. The wave of

increase 1948/9—1951/2 affected elementary and secondary schools more—or—

less to the same degree, with very little change in the student/teaching—
                                      7




 post ratio (Table 3). In the following years the number of elementary—

 school pupils kept rising, though at a decreasing rate, until around

 1964/5. During this period of rapid growth, which also included the entry

 of the baby—boom cohorts, the number of teaching—posts and classrooms

 increased proportionately with practically no change in the student!

 teacher/classes ratios. During the next 12 years of stability (or some

 decline) in the number of pupils — 1964—76   -,   the number of teaching—posts
 kept rising, sharply reducing the ratio of pupils to teaching—posts. This

 reduction continued when the growth of the student population resumed in

 1976—82, the echo of the first baby boom.

      The growth of the student population in secondary schools also

 decelerated gradually, but was nonetheless quite high throughout the

 period. In the l950s a significant part of this growth was caused by the

 increase in the rate of school enrolment
                                            among teenagers (secondary—school
enrolment rates for the 14—17 age group rose from 23.4 to 1952 to 46.5 in

1959). This is the only period in which the pressure of students was not

met by a proportional increase in teachers and classrooms (Table 3). The

early l960s marked the arrival of the large cohorts to secondary school

age. The age group 14—17 increased from 107 thousand in 1959 to 200

thousand in 1965. These new cohorts also differed by origin — a
                                                                higher
fraction of Asia—Africa origin. For the secondary school system this

growth meant several years in which school enrolment remained
                                                                  fairly
stable, probably due to the change in the composition of the teenage

population by origin rather than a supply constraint on the part of the

system itself. The figures in Table 3 show that the slightly higher rate

of increase of students in this period (compared to 1952—59) was matched

by an increase in both teachers and classrooms. When cohort size and
                                   8



                                       in enrolment rates was renewed (46.1
composition stabilized, the increase

in 1964, 64.4 in 1979), which meant that inputs (teachers, classrooms)

rose faster than students, improving the relevant input ratios.

     It is probably no accident that a reform that broke down the two—tier
                                                                       6—
system of 8 years of elementary and 4 years of secondary school into a

3—3 system was introduced in the late 1960s after the pressures exerted by

the growing number of pupils had subsided.

     Going back in time, we have to trace what happened to teenage
                                              two fifths of the boys and one

third of the girls aged 14—17 were in

school early and starting work, to be interrupted at age 18 by army

service for 2 to 3 years, and then returning

of labor force participation of the 14—17 age group was on the decline

between 1955 and 1960. In 1959 the growth of the 14—17 age group began

accelerating and, as noted, this influx was associated with a change in

 composition by origin and with a temporary halt in the increase in school

 enrolment. It was also associated with a halt in the declining trend of
                                                 1960 and 1965 the number of
 teenagers' labor force participation. Between

 teenage workers doubled and their proportion in the labor force increased

 from 3.2 to 5.6 for boys, and from 6.3 to 9.7 for girls. Still, the rate

 of unemployment of the group did not increase in response to this influx.

 III. ON THE REACTION OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR



 The above discussion indicates that in terms of the rough physical

 indicators there has been a very responsive accomodation of the change in

 cohort size by the public sector. There was one period in which pressure

 was felt in the secondary schools, and there was also an improvement in

 quantitative standards when pressures subsided. Of course, the quality

 aspect is not discussed here; the deterioration in teachers' quality in

 the period of undiscriminating recruitment may have affected the quality

 of education received by children who went to school in the 1950s.

     There is no general accepted framework within which the reaction of

 the public sector can be analyzed. Various models of the public sector can

 be examined: (a) a bureaucratic machine that has some quasi—firm responses

to changing prices or demand pressures, but also stickiness in certain

parameters (budgets or various indicators of performance); (b) a

benevolent maximizer of a perceived social welfare; (c) a political entity

intent on maximizing support or moved by self—seeking politicians and

bureaucrats. For any particular government response, one could find a

rationale in more than one view.

     Large—scale demographic changes cause large changes in the number of

clients the government serves: in schools (in the case of the baby boom),

in health services (for the elderly), etc. Such pressures can be expected

to lead to a deterioration of services for
                                             a variety of reasons: a quasi—
firm argument is based on upward sloping (and
                                                perhaps short—run) inelastic
supply curves of the factors used to provide the services. A bureaucratic

argument is based on short term stickiness of budget allocations which
                                    10



would impart an elasticity of —1 to the curve relating expenditure per

client to the number of clients. From a static political—economy point of
                                            the marginal cost of satisfying
view, if rapid pressures sharply increase
                                    there is an argument to seek the support
a particular group of supporters,

of others. A benevolent government, too, would shift the distribution of

its efforts in response to changes in relative costs. There are therefore

plenty of reasons to expect a short run downward sloping curve relating

government services per client to the number of clients.
                                                                 of crises
     What if the government copes swiftly with certain aspects

and shocks with little or no decline in the level of services, i.e., has a

short term elastic curve relating expenditures or performance to clients?

This may reflect some bureaucratic or public attachment to certain

parameters, it may reflect real social priorities of a benevolent

government, or it may reflect a political system which has a built—in bias

 towards handling crises. We can describe the political process in the

 following terms: governments seek support, which is presumed to depend on

 government actions. The support of most people is quite inert in the short

 run, and unresponsive to government activities in many fields, including

 thinly spread changes in taxation or the quality of services (see Olson,

 1982; and Peltzman, 1976). However, at different times certain topics can

 become political issues, i.e., the way in which the government handles a

 problem will significantly affect the support it gets. This may be so

 either because the topic is high on the minds of the public at large, or

 because a particular group in the population will sway its support based

 solely on the way a specific issue is resolved. The issues more likely to

 get government response are those where the group of beneficiaries is well

 defined while th cost is spread out thin, because of the inert reaction
                                           11



  described above. Obviously, there are advantages to government

  expenditures that have a public good property so that they satisfy nore

  than one group. Particularly notable is the convergence of interests of

  clients of services and their suppliers.

      Demographic structure and changes fit well into such a framework. For

 example, the elderly are likely to be highly responsive to how the

 government treats them because of their relatively high dependence on

 government support, which should afford them some protection against the

 adverse effects of their size. Shocks of the sort discussed here are a

 natural source of issues. By definition, they create problems relating

 directly or indirectly to well—defined groups in the population. (Often

 there is also an interested party of
                                            government employees.) The problems

 associated with a rapidly growing group may become an issue over which

 that group's support could easily sway, depending on government action.

 This may make the government's short run 'demand curve' more elastic,

 i.e., it   will   make an extra effort to minimize the reduction in the

 services   that it provides. In fact, there are indications here that such a
mechanism may make the government overly responsive to major challenges,
under the supposition that politically—induced rapid adjustment entails
neglect of other, less dramatic issues that the government is supposed to
take care of, neglect of less visible aspects of the problem, etc.

     The same rationale carries over to the role of government as an

employer. When young men     or   large numbers of women flood the labor market

and the government steps in to employ them, this too is open to

interpretation on several levels: (a) as the response of a quasi—firm

moving along a downward SloT)iflg demand curve for the factors it uses to

produce   services for the population; (b) as the response of a bureaucracy
                                  12



intent on keeping a claim to certain budgetary allocation slanting demand

towards unitary elasticity; (c) as the political concern of a government

with the ramifications of sharp declines in relative incomes or the

emergence of unemployment in groups that it is concerned about, providing
                                                   its functions as an
some kind of employment/income insurance through

employer. This ties in with our earlier comment on the double—barreled

effect of expenditures that both serve clients and provide government

employment. Certainly the most dedicated opponents of cuts in social

budgets include social workers, and the staunchest (if not always

successful) defenders of budgets for research and higher learning are

university professors.

     What happens when the tide ebbs? Is there symmetry in the reaction?

Or should we expect the level of services to continue to increase after

the number of clients has declined (or growth has levelled off)? The

quasi—firm argument probably says yes. The initial pressure on specific

factors supplying the services may create lagged supply response shifting

relative costs in favor of improvements in areas previously under

pressure. Bureaucratic arguments would predict the same — budgets

eventually respond to pressures and are certainly downward sticky. The

political argument works in the same direction: where government

employment was rapidly created to meet the growth in demand, the group of

suppliers has been strengthened. This asymmetry in the response to rising

and falling needs imparts an upward bias to public sector expenditures.

The figures on national expenditure on education are consistent with our

conjecture (Table 4): the shares of the different levels change in

 response to changing pressures, but this is done by upward pressure on

 total expenditure, accompanied by an increased share of GNP allocated to
                                    13




 education. Ofer (1983) has shown how the real expenditure per student in

 elementary and secondary education related to per capita GNP rose from

 12.9 percent in 1962 to 19.3 in 1978. His figures for the post—secondary

 level show a slight decline in expenditure per student (deflated by GNP

 per capita) when the system expanded (from 66.0 to 62.7 between 1962 and

 1972, respectively), and a sharp increase afterwards (it reached 73.7 in

 1978). As we shall see below, the higher education system also reacted

 swiftly to the increase in its clientelle.

     In the case of the education system, the employment aspect of an

expansion in this system should be discussed in conjunction with the

increase in women's labor force participation. The tremendous increase in

women's participation, particularly through the 1970s, could be viewed as

a quasi—shock in its own right (see Ben—Porath, 1983). But unlike the

changes in cohort size, there is some ambiguity in ascribing this shock to

purely exogenous causes. One hypothesis is that what we observe is largely

a long—term increase in demand that encouraged women's investment in

schooling, stimulated their entry into the labor force, and led to

associated changes in family—planning strategy. Alternatively, one could

place the responsibility on various supply—side factors —   schooling,
attitudes, etc. There may also have been some sort of an income effect

from the direction of young men, which would fit in with the decline in

fertility observed in the late 1970s, and be consistent with Easterlin's

interpretation (1980). Either way, the gestation period of schooling may

create excess supply in the short run.

     The government certainly played a major role in expanding the

opportunities for higher education by financing a large fraction of the

growth of that system. More to the point here, is its role on the demand
                                   14




side: the public sector is the major employer of women, and employs a

large fraction of the growth of women in the labor force. This was

accomplished partly by expanding of employment in public services and

partly by substitution of men. The public sector had a fairly elastic

demand curve and was thus ready to provide employment to the women whom it

helped educate. The growth of employment in the public sector occurred at

a time when it is more naturally interpreted as a response to supply than

to demand phenomena (see Klinov, 1983).

     The school system is an important element here. There has been a

strong feminization of the teaching profession, demonstrated in the

following figures: women's share in teachers' posts rose from 52.5 percent

in 1948/9, 58.3 percent in 1959/60, 63.7 percent in 1969/70 to 73.9

percent in 1981/2. The decline in the student/teacher ratio, noted above,

occurred when the student population had stopped growing (in elementary

and secondary schools), and while more and more educated women were

entering the labor market. These are probably connected. There is no

operational difference between the view that the government reacted to the

increased supply of women as a quasi—firm, with a fairly elastic demand

curve, and with the hypothesis that this elastic demand curve was   designed
to protect the level of employment and relative wages of an important part

of. the population.

     A similar phenomenon occurred in another sphere of demographic

change: the increase in the number of the elderly. Here are the rates of

growth of the old—age support per recipient provided by Israel's National

Insurance Institute, and of the number of recipients:

This is, however, a tentative picture and should be studied further.

Another case from a different field has to do with defense expenditure.

Berglas (1983), who analyzed the evolution of defense expenditure in

Israel, noted a step function marked by a series of wars. While the

increases may have been inevitable, the absence of downward adjustment is

part of the same asymmetry.




IV.   ENTRY INTO ADULT ACTIVITIES




The baby boom of the l950s had a dramatic effect on the age structure of

the adult population in the 1970s. This can be appreciated by comparing

the Israeli figures with those describing the American baby boom:

U.S. (Easterlin, 1980)      50.2          66.3          74.0




Adult activities consist of work and higher education, generally following

army service.

     This section refers mainly to the male population. For some general

background on the role of age changes and participation rates consult

Table A—2 and A—3 which show (a) that the ratio of employed persons to the

population aged 14+ has been on the decline since 1955, but more

emphatically so in 1965—75 and (b) that this was due to the change that

occurred in age structure, mostly in the period 1960—70, and to

significant reductions in labor participation in 1965—75. The main trends

of the employment history of young men are presented in Table 5 and Figure

2. The participation rate of the 18—24 age group dropped in three steps:

from 1966 to 1967, from 1968 to 1970, and from 1973 to 1974. Over the

whole period 1965—75 the drop was from 52.6 to 34.9 percent, a truly

remarkable change for such a short period. The result was that in spite of

a 66 percent increase in the mean population aged 18—24 the number

employed rose only moderately from 1965 to 1973, and in 1980 was more or

less equal to what it was fifteen years earlier.

     The most rapid increase in the size of the 25—29 age group occurred

between 1970 and 1975. Our data allow us to observe only the group aged
                                       17




  25—34 where we see a significant decline in participation (4.9 p.p.), more

  pronounced than before 1970 or after 1975, The annual data show that the

  decline occurred between 1968 and 1975 (7.8 p.p.). This was against a

  background of some, but milder decline in participation of older men.

      Thus, the major part of the story of the demographic shock is that

 entry into the labor market was delayed. The army played an important role

 here. Military service is compulsory and universal for both men and women

 (though exemptions are granted, mainly to women, on religious grounds).

 There is also a career army, and
                                    many conscripts sign up for an extended

 term of duty before going on to work or study, This is clearly a powerful

 instrument with which the public sector can affect the impact of changing

 cohort size on the rest of the system. Two of the sharp declines in the

 participation rate of the 18—24 group coincide with the wars fought in

 1967 and 1973, both of which were followed by increase in the size of the

 army. While we have no reliable estimates, there is a basis for
                                                                   arguing
 that a significant portion of the delay
                                            occurred through army service.
Obviously, the shift in demand by the military was autonomous; the ability

to satisfy this demand was, however, certainly enhanced by the demographic

context.

     The other obvious route to consider is
                                               schooling, The universities
grew most rapidly in the late 1960s and early l97Os (in 1965—75 the number

of students almost tripled). The share of students in the population aged

20—29 increased sharply from 1964/5 to 1972/3, and declined slightly after

1974/5. For the 20—24 age group, most of the increase in the enrolment

rate occurred between 1965 and 1969, while for
                                                  the age group 25—29 it
continued until 1972/3. The expansion was strongly reflected in resource

allocation: as already indicated, 12.9 percent of the national expenditure
                                     18



                                   and higher education in 1962, 16.4
were allocated to post—secondary

percent in 1965, peaking in 1975 at 25.1 percent, and then slowly
                                          of highest pressure the ratio of
declining (Table 4). During the period

students to academic staff did not deteriorate, and as the number of

students stablized the academic staff increased further (Table 6). As in
                                             the impact was absorbed with an
the case of the lower educational levels,

elastic response, and improvement occurred after the pressure subsided,

when inputs continued their growth.

     It should be noted that the activities described here may have not

exhausted the adjustment. Thus, we know that there was an increase in

emigration after the 1973 war (Lamdany, 1983). It may well be that
                                                       entering the labor
extended periods of absence from the countrybefore

market or university served as a buffer.

      In the U.S. between 1960 and 1970 the size of the age group 16—19

 increased by 44 percent, the number of employed increased by 11 percent;

 the age group 20—24 increased by 49 percent and employment by 26 percent.

 The educational system absorbed much of the excess, but the armed forces

 were also a significant factor (see Office of Science and Technology,

 1983, pp. 50—51).




 V. CONTEXT



 Before we explore whether the baby boom had any impact on the labor

 market, we have to clarify the demographic and economic context in which

 the change took place.
                                   19



Immigration: We have already noted the large and fluctuating waves of

immigration. In Table 7 we break down the sources of growth in the

population of Jewish men aged 20—64. We see how the contribution of the

young, both Israel—born and foreign—born (lines 4 and 5), to the growth of

the adult population rises abruptly between 1965 and 1970, while net

immigration falls steeply and the more mature foreign—born grow older. The

contribution of the Israel—born to the adult population increases over

time and becomes dominant in the 1970s. The foreign—born contribution

occurs first through immigration, then the weight shifts to the maturation

of the foreign—born young, reaching a peak in 1965—70 when the foreign—

born baby boom generation comes in. But at the same time growing numbers

exit from the 20—64 category, so that in the 1970s the process of

maturation of the foreign—born contributes negatively to the growth of the

adult population: as net immigration slows down in the late 1970s, the

foreign—born reduce rather than increase the adult population, offsetting

part of the very high increase in the Israeli—born. The successive 5 years

of growth of the 20—64 age group are less volatile than the rates of

change for the total population.

     The context of large and changing immigration has broader

implications. It means that the system is accustomed to shocks, that the

public sector has always had to rapidly alter the level of services that

it provides, and that the way it copes with the variety of social issues

raised by immigration was a primary criterion by which it was judged.



Women: In assessing the impact on the labor force of the entry of larger

cohorts of young persons it is important to note that at the same time

there has been a change in women's employment.
                                  20



    As in many other countries, the period under review was one of

significant increase in the labor force participation of women. When we

examine men alone, the share of men aged 18—34 in the change of all

employed men rises sharply after 1965, from approximately 1/7 to between

2/3 and 1.0 (Table 8 line 1). For both sexes the change is quite sharp

(line 3) after 1965, but more moderate than for men alone because in the

case of women there was significant increase in the number of women aged

25—44. Because of the jump from 1/3 to 2/3 in the share of women in the

increase in employment after 1965 (line 5), the contribution of young men

to the change in overall employment rises much more moderately than their

contribution to the rise in men's employment (line 6). We see in Table 8

that while all women and young men contributed less than half of the net

increase in the change in employment before 1965, they contributed 85—100

percent of the change in 1965—80. At the same time the proportion of men

aged 35—54 in employment has declined.

     Whether the influx of women aggravated or alleviated the position of

young men depends on whether they are substitutes or complements in the

labor force. Do young men compete with young women? With all women? The

ratio of young men to young women and to all women decline dramatically

through the 1970s while the relative hourly earnings of young men and

young women did not change. As the difference in schooling between men and

women both aged 25—34 in the labor force has not changed from 1970 to

1980, a high degree of substitution is suggested.5

Arabs from the occupied territories. A direct consequence of the 1967 war

was the occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and the entry of

Arab labor from these territories into the Israeli labor market,

increasing the supply of unskilled, manual labor. Again, this effect could
                                        21




  go either way —   the obvious substitution with unskilled domestic
                                                                     labor, or
  a complementary effect opening opportunities for low—level supervisory and

  middlemen positions for Jews. Amir (1981), who studied the changing

  returns to education, tends to argue that the effect
                                                           was positive, i.e.,
  that the unskilled Arab labor improved the
                                                 opportunities among Jews for
  domestic low— and medium—schooling labor.



  The macroeconomic picture. Israel experienced a continuous period of

  rapid economic growth until 1965. This
                                             was interrupted by a deep recession
  in 1965—67, with considerable
                                  unemployment. The young were hit
 particularly hard —   the rate of unemployment of men aged 18—24
                                                                  rose from
 10.7 in 1965 to 22.5 percent in
                                    1967, and for men aged 25—34 from 2.8 to
 7.8; the rate for men aged 45—54 rose from 1.1 to 4.9. The combination of

 continued slump and influx into the labor force of the young workers could

 have been disastrous. But, following the 1967 war the country
                                                               experienced
 a resumption of rapid growth until 1973. This created an environment that

 certainly eased the entry of new young cohorts into the labor force.

 Following the 1973 war and the energy crisis Israel was gripped by

 stagflation. With rising rates of unemployment towards the end of the

decade. The deterioration in the relative position of the
                                                          young in the
late l970s might reflect this change.




                        When we examine the impact on the labor market of a

sudden change in cohort size our main concern is with the elasticities
                                                                       of
substitution which reflect the
                                  uniqueness of particular types of labor. At
the same time, unemployment rates are also of interest,
                                                            particularly for
the identification of short—term
                                   difficulties (see Welch, 1979, 1983;
                                  22




Freeman, 1979; and Wachter, 1976). In addition, some groups tend to be

more sensitive than others to cyclical variations.

     The delay in the entry of people aged 20—24 into the labor force was

important enough in itself, but eventually it had its impact on the age

composition of the labor force once these people did enter it. In Table 5,

Part I, we see that from 1965 to 1970 the share of those aged 20—24 in the

population increased by 4.7 percentage points (p.p.) while their share in

employment rose by only 1.3 p.p. In 1970—80, however, the change in the

population share of the 25—34 age group was 7.5 p.p., and among the

employed it was 9.8 p.p.

     As is well demonstrated in Table 9, the relative earnings of young

men declined sharply during the 1970s. The relative earnings of men aged

25—34 and women aged 18—24 declined more moderately. The relative earnings

of older people declined too (sharply for women). The relative number of

men aged 18—24 did not increase and the relative number of young women

actually declined sharply. It is the 25—34 group and older men whose

numbers increased sharply during this period, which probably affected the

relative earnings of young men.

     Obviously, we have a change in the profile of earnings. This has been

confirmed in a comparative cross section study by Amir (1983) who

estimated earnings functions for 1970—72 and 1978—80 within education

categories and showed that the positive linear coefficient on experience

and negative coefficient on experience squared both increased in absolute

terms. The question is: what caused that change, and specifically, is it

related to the change in the size of the age groups.

      The series of regression equations presented in Table 10 reveal the

 following:
                                      23



      First, the relative earnings of young cohorts are adversely affected

by increases in the general level of unemployment (represented by the rate

of unemployment of men aged 35—54).

      Second, young men's relative earnings are adversely affected by

increases in their own share in total employment as well as by the

increases in the share of other groups — young women and older men and

women. This indicates a fair amount of substitution between these groups.

Welch (1983), studying U.S. data, also found that the relative wages of

the young react to the proportion of the old. Indeed, fairly good results

are obtained when we run relative wages on the proportion of young people

of both sexes, and also the proportion in employment of the elderly (65+)

of both sexes. It is hard to separate out the effect of different

demographic groups when the variables appear simultaneously, but when they

appear separately, the reaction of the young men's relative earnings to

changes in the proportion of young women or older men are certainly no

smaller than to their own numbers.

      Third, the age group 18—24 responds adversely to the size of the

whole group aged 18—34 rather than to its own size.

      Fourth, the response of relative earnings of men aged 25—34 to

changes in its share in employment is somewhat weaker than that of the 18—

34 age group.

     Similar results have been obtained when the dependent variable is

hourly rather than annual earnings and where instead of the ratios of the

age groups in employment we used as independent variables their ratios in

the labor force and (alternatively) in the population both as independent

variables and as instrumental variables (see regressions No. 4 and No. 11

in Table 10).

    The age group 18—24 seems to have suffered in relative terms not when

it was at its peak size but at the end of the decade, when it was smaller

and when the whole 18—34 group was at peak size. This means that the

vanguard of the larger cohort (aged 18—24 in the beginning of the 1970s),

most of whom were the 25—34 category in 1980, suffered much less than the

following (somewhat smaller) class that found the entry positions in the

labor market crowded with the very large 25—34 cohort.

     The data for the labor force extend over longer periods. For the

period   1955—80 there is a significant negative correlation between the
employment rate of persons aged 18—34 (the ratio of employed to
population)   and the share of that age group in the population. For the

period 1965—80 we can distinguish between age groups 18—24 and 25—34,

finding large negative correlations for the latter. For the period 1965—80

we find that the rate of unemployment of the 25—34 age group (relative to

age 35—54) is positively correlated with its share in the population and

in the labor force, and negatively related to its rate of labor force

participation. Several regressions show that the unemployment of the young

rises more in absolute terms and less in relative terms than the rate of

unemployment of men aged 35—54. In different variations it is also

positively associated with the relative weight of the young (18—34) and of

the old (65+) in the labor force (Table 11).

     In principle, the change in the age structure could have affected

demand. Some indication of this is seen in the regressions where the

proportion of the population aged 20—29 has a significant effect on

investment in dwelling.6 But it is quite clear that the net effect is

supply effect.

CONCLUS IONS




The entry of large cohorts into the labor market affected both relative

wages and unemployment. What merits attention is the larger role that the

government played in meeting the baby boom. This was demonstrated here by

following the evolution of the school system as it coped with the uneven

arrival of students at different levels. The entry of the large cohorts

into the labor market was delayed because of the expansion of the army,

another silent role of government. We presented some tentative ideas on

what could explain the behavior of the public sector, suggesting that

governments may be keen on responding quickly to big shocks, but unable to

adjust downward once the pressure subsides. Whatever the correct model, it

is important to unravel the role of the public sector and to pay more

attention to its behavior.

2. The 1950 figures for EA are: age 0—4, 27,400; age 5—9, 11—242; age 10—

      14, 18,095; age 15—19, 35,856; age 20—24, 51,124. The 0—4 category does

      not include children born to EA women after immigration. While the

      figures are also affected by the selectivity of immigrants by age and

      family status, the large 0—4 group relative to the 5—9 group most

      likely reflects the effect of the war.

 3. The inertia may be a result of the infra—marginal commitment because of

      ideology or interests, or it may reflect lack of information and care.

       See Olson (1982).

    4. Within the 25—34 age group the weight of those aged 25—29 changed in

       the following manner: 1965 —   51.0;   1970 —   53.0;   1975 —   61.7; 1980 —

       53.7.   The change in weights by itself could account for participation

       rates for the whoel group (92.0, 91.7, 90.8, 91.7), for the

       corresponding years (assuming that the LFPR of men aged 3034 was 97 in

   1965, and for men aged 25—29 —          87).    The sharp decline observed in 1970—
   75 is thus not just a matter of weighting.
