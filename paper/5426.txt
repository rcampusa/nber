       This paper reviews the literature on the relationship of economic growth to the education

levels of the labor force. The emphasis is on Ben-Porath's contribution to some of the issues in

this field: the endogeneity of schooling, the role of the public sector as an "absorber" of educated

labor, and the importance of personal human capital created by investments in reputation and

personal relationships, the F-connection.

     EDUCATION, HUMAN CAPITAL, AND GROWTH: A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE



           Yoram made a major contribution to the theory of human capital: he formalized the

 investment-in-education process and described its main determinants (Ben-Porath 1967). In his

 model an individual produces additions to his own human capital by combining his pre-existing

 human capital with his own time and other market resources. This process is subject to diminishing

 returns because cost rise as one attempts to speed up the production process and also, because returns

decline eventually as the result of the finiteness of life. If the initial human capital is low, the

maximizing individual will specialize first in the production of human capital, i.e., full time

schooling. Subsequent to the completion of the full-time, formal schooling phase, part-time

investment may continue in the form of on-the-job training. The resulting model of optimal

distribution of human capital investments over the life cycle yields the strong implication of

logarithmic concavity for age-earnings profiles. This was a seminal contribution, which had

important implications for subsequent empirical work.1

           I will discuss this contribution, however, only from a narrow and rather personal perspective:

How it entered into the discussion about the relative importance of education as a source of

economic growth, cspccially as it related to my own work on this subject. He also made a less well

appreciated but equally important contribution to the theory of economic and social organization in

his work on the F-connection (Beri-Porath 1980). 1 will speculate briefly, at the end of this paper, on

why this contribution has not had as much impact as the first, especially on the empirics of the

subject.

         When the "growth accountants" such as Fabricant, Abramovitz, Kendrick, and Solow found

 that most of the observed economic growth was not explained by conventional labor and capital

 measures, they pointed directly at the possibility that the changing quality of the labor force may be

 an important component oIthe explanation for the appearance oIthis "residual.2 The notion of

 investment in human capital as a major factor behind wage and income differences has a long

 history, going back to Adam Smith and before, and will not be reviewed here. The conceptual basis

 for much of the modern empirical work was laid down in Friedman and Kuznets (1945). The

availability of detailed earnings-by-schooling data from the 1940 and 1950 Censuses made possible

Mincer's (1958) pathbreaking contribution and related work by Houthakker (1959) and Miller

(1960). The emphasis of most of this work, and the later but most influential work by Becker (1962),

was primarily on the role of education in explaining aspects of the personal income distribution. It

was Schultz (1960) who, I think, first connected this work with the puzzle of the 'residual." He

made an estimate of the growth in total human capital in the U.S. created by the educationalsystem

and considered how much of the growth in output it could account for (about one fifth was his

estimate).

        A more direct way of adjusting the labor input for quality change due to thechanging

educational attainment of the labor force is to create a "weighted" measure of laborinput, weighting

different types (levels of schooling) of labor by their relative wages in the marketplace. This

approach fits well with the overall national accounting scheme where different outputs and different

investments are weighted in proportion to their prices. The idea is quite obvious, Its first

implementation was actually in the context of industry wage differentials by Kendrick (1956),
                                                                                                         4

implying a disequilibrium in the use of labor across industries and a gain in productivity From shifis

in employment from low wage to higher wage industries. But this type of adjustment is more

relevant for characteristics of individuals rather than the characteristics of their jobs. Working

independently, both I (Griliches 1960) and Denison (1962) produced estimates of quality change in

labor input, using data on the changing distribution of the workforce by educational attainment and

mean income by education as weights. My work on such labor qua'ity indexes was extended to

manufacturing in Griliches (1963) and to the economy as a whole in Jorgenson and Griliches (1967).

It was continued subsequently by Jorgenson and his associates (see especially Chinloy (1980) and

Jorgenson and Pachon (1983)). More recent estimates can be found in (BLS 1993) and (Jorgenson,

Ho, and Fraumeni 1994). The basic finding, both in Denison and Jorgenson-Griliches was that such

educational improvements in the U.S. labor force accounted, at that time, for about one-third of the

calculated residual TFP, or about a .5 percent per year contribution to the growth rate of aggregate

output. This contribution declined to about .2-.3 percent per year in the more recent decades but so

did also measured TFP growth, leaving the fraction accounted for by educational improvements in

the labor force at about the same level as before.

        A most interesting recent development has been the series of new estimates of human capital

produced by Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1992a,b). As distinct from Schultz's original computations,

their estimates are based on the present value of the increments in the future income flows produced

by the educational system, rather than on its costs. This provides a relevant output measure for the

educational sector and opens up the possibility for computing its changing productivity over time.

But it also points out the fact, that once incorporated into a wider definition of GDP, one which

includes also the investment in human capital, "education" and the improvements in the quality of

the labor force will become "inside" inputs and one will not be able to use them in accounting for the
                                                                                                            5

 growth in overall factor productivity, except to the extent that the social returns to such investments

 may exceed the private ones, both because of the possibility of capital rationing constraints, and the

 indirect externalities produced by education and the associated scientific enterprises.

         Two major assumptions underlie such computations: I. Differences in earnings correspond

 to differences in contribution (marginal products) to national and sectoral outputs. 2. These

 differences are in fact due to schooling and not to other factors such as native ability or family

 background which happen to be correlated with schooling. These assumptions are obviously

 controversial and were challenged from many directions. Feeling uneasy with "adjustments" for

 which there was no direct econometric evidence led me to pursue a number of studies whose main

 purpose was to investigate the validity of such labor quality adjustments.

        The main, and possibly, only, approach to testing the productivity of schooling directly is to

 include it as a separate variable in an estimated production function. If one defines a weighted

schooling-based labor quality index and includes it multiplicatively in a Cobb-Douglas production

function framework, one has the additional implication that the coefficient of such an index should

equal, approximately, the coefficient of labor quantity. This was the rationale behind a series of such

studies which I pursued, both in agriculture and manufacturing. The results of these studies,

summarized in Griliches (1970), Table 4, supported the productivity interpretation: the schooling

index coefficients were both statistically "significant" and of the right order of magnitude. Much of

the subsequent work that was done along these lines was done on agricultural data from various

developing countries with largely similar results (see Jamison and Lau (1982) for a survey). An

example of such work using Israeli data is presented in Table l,where the inclusion of a quality of

labor index, based on the occupational distribution of a firm's labor force, contributes significantly to

an explanation of inter-firm differences in productivity (Gritiches and Regev, 1995).
                                                                                                          6

        This work actually anticipated and responded to a strand of criticism which was to arise later

on under the label of "signaling" (Spence, 1974). It provided direct and, to my mind, the best

evidence on the productivity of education without using the a priori assertion that wage differences

are proportional to marginal products. There is also quite a bit of indirect evidence against the

empirical importance of"screening" or "signaling" as major determinants of the returns to schooling.

If the returns to schooling were largely due to the informational content of the certificate and not to

the process of schooling itself, one would expect that (1) cheaper ways of testing would be

developed by employers and employees; (2) returns to schooling would be lower or non-existent

among farmers and other self-employed, since they cannot collect on a false signal (Wolpin, 1977);

and (3), the returns to schooling should decline with age as more experience is accumulated by

employers about the true worth of their employees and the initial signal provided by schooling fades

away into insignificance. But little of that is observed in the data. (For a more recent analysis of

these issues see Kroch and Sjoblom (1994).)




                                                    II



        The most direct challenge to the original estimates of the contribution of schooling to

economic growth was the issue of "ability bias." To what extent did observed income differentials

exaggerate the contribution of schooling because of a positive correlation between native ability and

the levels of schooling attained by different groups in the population? There were conflicting views

on this at that time (early to mid-1960's) and it is still an issue which has not been fully settled.

Denison (1964) claimed, on the basis of very little data, that as much as 40 percent of the observed

income differentials could be due this "bias." This seemed rather high and I embarked on a search
                                                                                                             7


 for data that would throw some light on this topic. Stariing with Griliches (1970) and Griliches and

 Mason (1972), a number of papers tried to estimate the magnitude of this bias using large data sets

 with army test scores (AFQT), IQ type test scores collected from high schools, and data on siblings.

 The main results of this work are summarized in Griliches (1977) and Griliches (1979). They show

 that if 'ability' is measured (albeit imperfectly) by test scores, the bias from this source is small, on

 the order of .01 on a .06 or so coefficient, and that it possibly goes in the oppositedirection! If one

treats ability as an unobservable that is related to such test scores and on which family members are

positively correlated, then the unobservable that fits these requirements works primarily via

schooling and has little or no direct effect on earnings while the unobservable that is connected to

the family component of earnings appears to have little to do with test scores. In either case, the

original estimates of the contribution of schooling were largely upheld. If anything, recent work has

raised rather than lowered these estimates.4

        It is here that I connected first directly with Yoram's contribution (Ben-Porath, 1967). One

can think of the whole "ability bias" problem as just another example of the "simultaneity problem"

in economics: Schooling is not strictly exogenous. It may be related to the same unmeasured

components of human capital that also enter into the disturbance in the individual's earnings

equation, either because these components are rewarded in the market directly, above and beyond

their effect on schooling attainment, or because they represent unmeasured variables in the future

earnings equation forecasted by the individual but unobserved by the econometrician. To analyze

this effectively one needs not only decent estimates of the earning equation but also a relevant model

of the schooling decision itself which would provide the "other" equation for this system, and

indicate how other determinants of schooling might be used as instrumental variables to get a

consistent estimate of its coefficient. By setting up the investment-in-schooling problem for the
                                                                                                          8

individual in a rigorous fashion, Yoram provided a framework for discussing this problem and

deriving its implications. It did not have, however, a closed form solution. Using Sherwin Rosen's

(Rosen, 1973) extension of the Ben-Porath model, I showed (Griliches, 1977) that if one accepts

Yoram's assumption of"neutrality," that human capital is equally productive in learning and in the

market, this implies that the ability bias is negative! Given that human capital accumulation is

costly, those who start out with a larger initial pre-school endowment of it, which is one simple

definition of"ability," will actually invest less than those with a smaller initial endowment. To get a

positive bias one has to abandon the neutrality assumption and allow for the possibility that this type

of initial human capital is more productive if invested in learning than if it is taken directly to the

market. That would produce a positive correlation between ability and schooling, but leave little

room for a bias in the earnings equation because of the low direct value of such capital in the market.

        Recent work on this topic, using better twin samples (Ashenfelter and Krueger, 1992) and

better instrumental variables for schooling (Angrist and Krueger 1991 and Card 1995), has reached

similar conclusions. If anything, the schooling coefficient is underestimated within the standard OLS

earnings equation framework. The current attempt by Herrnstein and Murray (1994) to resurrect the

importance of "ability" (IQ) in The Bell Curve is largely besides the point, since it never considers

the role of education explicitly, especially the component of education that is not correlated with the

available test scores.5 There is some evidence that the role of measured IQ may have increased

somewhat in recent samples, but that may be largely a reflection of the same forces that have raised

the returns to higher schooling in genera!, which is my next topic.
                                                                                                            9

                                                   III



         The surprise of recent years has been the widening of educational wage differentials (see

Murphy and Welch (1992) and many others). The increasing number of educated workers in the

labor force should have driven down these differentials as the earlier discussion of the "overeducated

American" might have predicted (Freeman, 1976). But it did not, despite continued worries about

the declining quality of American labor. A number of only partially convincing explanations have

been offered for this increase in the educational premium. The ones I want to mention are "capital-

skill complementarity" (Griliches, 1969 and 1970), for which the evidence is rather weak (Berman,

Bound, and Griliches, 1994), and the technology-skill interaction. The latter hypothesis, enunciated

first by Nelson (1964), Nelson and Phelps (1966), and Welch (1970) asserts that education becomes

more valuable in periods of rapid technological change; that it takes more education to cope with the

ensuing upheavals and to figure Out what is the right thing to do. The actual empirical work on this

topic is not all that convincing, primarily because it is so difficult to get an independent and relevant

measure of technological change (see, e.g., I-luffman (1974), Mincer (1993), Bartel and Lichtenherg

(1987), Berman, Bound, and Griliches (1994), and Allen (1994)). Nevertheless, for lack of a more

decisive explanation, the recent literature has attributed this phenomenon to the rising price of"skill"

as the result of a technology induced rising demand for it (see, e.g., Katz and Murphy (1992), Juhn,

Murphy, and Pierce (1993), and Card and Lemieux (1995)).'

        Whether the weights used in the construction of the labor quality index are just right or a

little too high or a little too low does not make much difference, however, in assessing the direct

contribution of schooling to growth. Changing the weight structure a little has uually only second

order effects in index number construction. The major facts are relatively clear, at least in the U.S.
                                                                                                       l0
The changing education ofthe labor force during the last fifty years has accounted for a significant

proportion of overall productivity growth, perhaps as much as a third of it. But it has not accounted

for most of it, nor can it explain why productivity growth declined in the last two decades. The rate

of improvement in the average schooling of the labor force did not slow down significantly in the

U.S. in recent decades, or in most of the other countries. Nor is it likely that the quality of schooling

declined sharply enough, due to increased TV watching, declining homework, and the decline in

average ability due to the expansion of schooling in the last two decades, to account for the rather

sharp productivity declines that happened in the 1970's and 1980's in the U.S., Israel, and most

everyplace else. Moreover, as noted above, the private returns to schooling increased during this

period!

          It is also the case that, as conventionally measured, the growth in average education per

worker is bounded, both mechanically, by the finiteness of our measures of schooling, and more

substantively, by the finiteness of human life.7 Thus, investment in education cannot be a source of

indefinite growth in real income per capita unless one considers also the externalities produced by it,

in direct knowledge accumulation via investments in science and R&D and indirect effects via

learning by doing and other knowledge spillovers. That is were the "new growth theories" come in.8



                                                    lv


          Recently a new style of econometric research has become popular with the public release of

the Summers and Heston (1991) data on the growth experience of many countries. A robust finding

of that literature is the positive contribution to growth of the initial average level of schooling,

measured by literacy rates or primary and secondary school enrollment rates (Barro (1991), Barro
                                                                                                        11


 and Lee (1994), and Mankiw, Romer, and Well (1992)). But what was rather jarring is the repeated

 finding, in these international data, that changes in the estimated levels of schooling or human

capital do not contribute positively to growth, at least as measured over the 1965-1985 period (see

 Benhabib and Spiegel (1991), Jovanovic, Lath, and Lavy (1993), and Kyriacou (1991)). The

explanations for this in the literature, besides pointing to poor quality of the data, are not very

convincing. They tend to focus on the embodiment of human capital externalities in new physical

capital or in subsequent advances in knowledge and organization (Lucas, 1993). But the estimated

role of physical capital is not that large in these studies either. I would like to suggest another

possible answer to this puzzle, which is already implied in some of the earlier work by Yoram and

Ruth Klinov (Ben-Porath, 1986; Klinov, 1986): Much, if not most of the growth in human capital

was absorbed in the public sectors of many of these economies. This is definitely true of Israel,

where more than 80 percent of highly educated labor is employed in the public sector, in services,

and in other "unmeasurable" (as far as output is concerned) sectors such as construction (see Table

2). The story in the U.S. is similar though the magnitudes are smaller (see Murphy and Welch

(1993), Table 3.5): 65 percent of the 17 percent increase in the employment of workers with college

education were absorbed in such "unmeasurable" sectors. The role of the public sector was, however,

much smaller in the U.S.; it took only 13 percent of this increase. But in many of the LDC's, which

make up the majority of the Summers and Heston data, the role of the public sector in absorbing

highly educated workers is likely to be more similar to what it was in Israel, if not more so. This

does not necessarily mean that such workers are unproductive in these sectors, they may indeed

contribute a lot to the efficient functioning of the economy. But their contribution to productivity, to

growth in per capita real output is not reflected in such data, because we have no good measures of

real output in these sectors in the national income and product accounts of the various countries. At
                                                                                                          12


best, only their externalities could show up in the data, and that is unlikely, given that the estimated

first order effect of the size of the government sector on per capita income growth is negative! One

does not have to be a Marxist to worry whether in emphasizing the importance of education for

economic growth we may be somewhat self-serving, especially if we do not worry about the fact that

much of the highly educated labor winds up working for governments or various international

agencies and its subsequent contribution to economic growth may be problematic, at best. Thus, it is

not surprising that human capital change variables do not show up strongly in cross country

productivity growth regressions.



                                                    V



        In the F-connection paper (Ben-Porath 1980), Yoram emphasized the importance of another

kind of human capital, the specific human capital invested in institutions such as families, friends,

and firms, and in the creation of our own identities and reputations. The building blocks of his

model were the importance of transaction costs in an uncertain world, the non-anonymity of most of

the transactions in the market and outside of it, especially within families and firms, and hence also

the opportunity provided by such settings to invest in reputation and identity building as one possible

way of reducing such costs. Since "reputation" becomes a quasi-public-good capital, subject to

increasing returns, it fosters the creation of various identified groups, such as families, tribes, and

firms, which internalize, in part, the cost of creating such capital and provide the larger economic

framework for its utilization. Yoram emphasized the pervasiveness of such capital and its

importance to the functioning of the economy and society. He was excited by the vistas his work

opened up and was rather hurt by the profession's eventual cool reception of it. In spite of a
                                                                                                       13


favorable referee report, Stigler turned it down for the Journal of Political Economy (it was not

"sharp" enough for his taste), and it was published obscurely in a new and not widely read

demography journal, it is not cited in Parson's survey chapter on labor contracts in the Handbook of

Labor Economics or in the more recent literature on "social capital" (see Coleman 1990 and Putnam

1993). I think this happened because the paper had only "insights" but no clear or sharp model which

could be used directly in subsequent work. But the topic raised by Yoram, what makes for such

relationships and how they endure or collapse, is of great importance in our lives and has many

interesting economic implications. How do economics departments function in a non-profit

environment with no direct relationship between performance, either inside or outside, and

remuneration? Why is there esprit de corps in some departments for some of the time? What creates

it and how does it collapse, as it often does? What will be the consequence for labor relations, for

productivity, of the collapse of such standard setting firms as IBM, Digital, or Eastman Kodak,

where workers were socialized into the idea that they are part of the firm and that the firm will take

care of them, if they do their bit?

        Other aspects of our lives can also be looked through this lens. Urbanization leads to a loss

of identity and reduces the private costs of criminal activity. The communication revolution expands

the reach of relationships but also dilutes them, both by overload and distance. On the other hand, it

also increases the returns from a successful investment in reputation. For younger economists

entering the field today, both the costs and returns of reputation building are higher. For society as a

whole, such increasing emphasis on visible and less personal signals may actually involve a

significant diversion of resources into socially unproductive activities. In the meantime, many of the

institutions that Yoram talked about, such as families and firms, are fraying and it is hard to discern

what will take their place. Let us hope that the third category, the one that brought us together here,
                                                                                               14

                                                 Notes

This is a revised version of the paper read at the Memorial Conference for Yoram Ben-Porath in

Jerusalem, October 1993. The work on this paper was supported by the National Science and Mellon

foundations.

3. Tighter mathematical formulations followed quickly, see Oniki (1968) and Sheshinski (1968) and

Blinder and Weiss (1976) and the surveys by Willis (1986) and Weiss (1986). Subsequent important

empirical work such as Heckman (1976), Heckman and MaCurdy (1980), Mincer (1974) and Rosen

(1973) can also be viewed as building on and extending his framework further.

2. See, for example, footnote 6 in Solow (1957).

3. See also Hellerstein and Neumark (1995) for a related use of these same data.

4. See Willis (1986), Bishop (1992), and Card (1995) for later surveys and for some additional evidence

on this topic.

5. See Golberger and Manski (1995) for a review.

6. Another explanation is that the quality of the lower educated has declined relatively because of the

increasing number of high school completers. But the shift in the relative numbers is too small and the

timing is wrong to explain much of this differential. Also, about two thirds of the widening of the

differential has come from a rise in the real wage of the college educated, and only a third from the

decline in the real wage of the less educated.

7. Even if one extends the concept of"education" to the more inclusive "human capital" and includes

on the job training and learning by doing in it, still the rising opportunity cost of time and the fall in

remaining time over which such investments have to be amortized would result in the cessation of

investment at some point. That was one of Yorams original insights.

of "new growth theories."
