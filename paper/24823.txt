                                          ABSTRACT

Speculation is a critical channel through which credit supply expansion affects the housing cycle.
The surge in private label mortgage securitization in 2003 fueled a large expansion in mortgage
credit supply by lenders financed with non-core deposits. Areas more exposed to these lenders
experienced a large relative rise in transaction volume driven by a small group of speculators, and
these areas simultaneously witnessed an amplified housing boom and bust. Consistent with the
importance of belief heterogeneity, house price growth expectations of marginal buyers rose
during the boom, while housing market pessimism among the general population increased.

   The interaction between credit and speculation plays a leading role in the narrative of
financial cycles advanced by scholars such as Charles Kindleberger (1978) and Hyman Minsky
(1986). The Global Financial Crisis has led researchers to focus more on this narrative.
This study exploits a natural experiment centered on the rise of the private label mortgage
securitization market (the “PLS market”) in order to investigate the link between credit
supply expansion and housing speculation.
   In the language of Kindleberger and Minsky, a boom and bust cycle in asset prices often
begins with a “displacement” such as financial innovation or financial liberalization that
expands credit to speculators. The speculators use leverage to bid for an asset, and such
bidding boosts the asset’s price. The increase in price brings in more speculators creating a
positive feedback between credit and speculation. This feedback effect generates “euphoria”
or “mania” in the market as prices and trading volume rise rapidly.
   These dynamics imply that speculators are overly optimistic during the euphoric state
with many holding the asset purely on the belief that prices will continue to grow. Adam
Smith (1776) referred to this as “overtrading” where market-implied expectations are in
“error.” Consequently, the boom in credit and asset prices leads to a predictable bust.
Evidence from recent business cycle history is consistent with these ideas where housing
assets in particular are critical. For example, growth in mortgage credit is strongly correlated
with growth in house prices, and housing-related credit growth predicts financial crises and
a decline in GDP growth (e.g., Jordà et al. (2016) and Mian et al. (2017)).
   However, formally testing the details of the ideas in Kindleberger and Minsky remains
difficult for a number of reasons. First, identifying a credit supply shock is hard. It is difficult
to isolate a financial shock that might trigger a speculative cycle. Second, tracing the cycle
of speculation requires granular data on transaction volume, prices, and the characteristics
of individual traders who come into the market due to credit expansion. Third, an important
element of the Kindleberger-Minsky narrative is the expectations of speculators, and how
these expectations differ from average or rational expectations. This necessitates data on


                                                 1
expectations both for speculators who trade the underlying asset and the broader population
who stays out of the market.
   This study addresses these challenges by exploiting the global surge in shadow banking in
2003 that enabled lenders relying on non-core deposit financing to increase mortgage credit
supply more aggressively. Existing research shows how events in the late summer of 2003 led
to a sudden and large surge in the PLS market (e.g., Justiniano et al. (2017)). The sudden
acceleration of the PLS market created a natural experiment in which housing markets in
the United States that were more exposed to non-core deposit financed lenders (which we
refer to as non-core liability lenders, or “high NCL lenders”) experienced an immediate and
large relative rise in mortgage originations.
   Section 1 discusses the background of the natural experiment and explains why exposure
to high NCL lenders provides a plausibly exogenous source of variation in mortgage credit
supply expansion across housing markets. There was no differential pre-trend in any outcome
variable in more exposed markets, and the relative rise in mortgage originations in more
exposed markets occurred exactly in the same months as the aggregate surge in the PLS
market. Furthermore, as in Khwaja and Mian (2008), confounding shocks can be absorbed
at a granular census-tract level to show that the relative rise in mortgage originations in
locations more exposed to high NCL lenders was not driven by spurious credit demand
shocks.
   The empirical strategy uses administrative data from TransUnion to construct a new
individual-level data set of mortgage originations by both speculators and non-speculators.
Individuals buying a house are classified as speculators if they (a) buy multiple houses in
a short time period, (b) buy and sell a given house within one year, or (c) buy a house
when already having 2 or more first-lien mortgages on their balance sheet. The TransUnion
data also allows for an exploration of the age and credit score of the individuals buying
homes with a mortgage. In addition, data on average (population-wide) housing market
expectations at the MSA level from the Michigan Survey of Consumers are combined with


                                                2
data on housing market expectations of actual home buyers from Case et al. (2012). This
allows for a contrast between the marginal expectations of home buyers with average housing
market expectations in the broader population.
   The results from the natural experiment show that housing markets more exposed to
high NCL lenders witnessed a sharp increase in home-purchase mortgage originations and
housing transaction volume from 2002 to 2006. The magnitude of the effect was large.
Housing markets in the top quartile of NCL exposure experienced home purchase mortgage
origination growth that was 23.0 percentage points higher than mortgage origination in the
bottom quartile at the peak of the cycle. This effect translates into a 19.1 percentage point
larger increase in transaction volume.
   Who bought during the boom? The relative increase in transaction volume in high NCL
exposed areas was driven mainly by speculators. Depending on the precise definition of
a speculator, the share of the total relative increase in volume driven by speculators was
between 40% and 70%. If a speculator is defined in the broadest terms as fitting any of the
three definitions, then almost 100% of the relative increase in transaction volume in high
NCL lender exposed areas was driven by speculators. An alternative measure of speculation
based on how rapidly a given property is traded (following DeFusco et al. (2018)) yields
similar results. The speculators that were brought into the market tended to be younger and
riskier from an ex ante perspective. We interpet these findings as showing how an expansion
of mortgage credit supply helped instigate a speculative trading frenzy in areas most exposed
to high NCL lenders.
   Both house prices and construction rose more substantially in more exposed areas from
2003 to 2006. Moving from the bottom to top quartile of the NCL-lender exposure distri-
bution led to a 12.1 percentage point increase in house prices and a 19.0 percentage point
increase in construction of new housing units.
   However, the boom was short-lived; beginning in 2007, more exposed housing markets
suffered a larger collapse in mortgage origination, transaction volume, house prices, and


                                             3
construction activity. In fact, house prices and construction activity in more exposed areas
over-corrected relative to their pre-boom levels, consistent with the prediction of models of
speculation such as Glaeser et al. (2008). The origins of the mortgage default crisis were
closely linked to this cycle. Mortgage default rates began to rise as early as late 2006 in
high NCL lender exposed areas, and rose even further through 2009. In 2007, the share of
total mortgage delinquencies coming from zip codes in the top quartile of the NCL exposure
distribution increased by 5 percentage points.
   Speculators had a large effect on housing markets more exposed to high NCL lenders
even though they made up a small part of the overall population. Even under the broadest
definition, speculators made up less than 1.5% of the overall population. Furthermore,
the evidence suggests that high credit score traditional home-buyers experienced a relative
decline in home purchase activity in areas exposed to high NCL lenders. Taken together,
these facts motivate us to explore the idea that heterogeneity in beliefs about house price
growth may have been important in explaining how credit affected the housing market (e.g.,
Geanakoplos (2010), Simsek (2013)) .
   The results show that disagreement about future house price growth was a salient fea-
ture of the housing boom from 2002 to 2006. Recent home-buyers had high expectations of
house price growth (Case et al. (2012)), while the broader population actually became more
pessimistic about the prospect of buying a house (Piazzesi and Schneider (2009)). In the
cross-section, the average individual became more pessimistic about the direction of future
house prices in cities most exposed to high NCL lenders. Consistent with models of het-
erogeneous beliefs, credit expansion fueled purchases by more optimistic speculators while
pessimism increased among the general population.
   Overall, the results on expectations suggest that greater availability of credit allowed
optimistic speculators to increase demand and hence asset prices as in Geanakoplos (2010).
The increase in asset prices may have convinced more people to become speculators, as in
Burnside et al. (2016), which further boosted asset prices. However, the rest of the population


                                              4
agreed to disagree, becoming more pessimistic about the market as prices rose. In general,
the results are supportive of the idea that belief heterogeneity is critical to understanding
the relationship between credit, speculation, and asset prices.1
    There is a large body of empirical work aimed at understanding the causes and con-
sequences of the credit boom during the 2000s. Much of this research is discussed in the
next section in the context of the acceleration of the PLS market. This study is related to
research on the role of investors in explaining the housing cycle of 2000 to 2010. Bhutta
(2015), Gao et al. (2017), DeFusco et al. (2018), Haughwout et al. (2014), and Albanesi
et al. (2017) focus on investors, showing that areas with larger boom-bust cycle witnessed
greater increase in investor share and speculative behavior, and short-term investors ampli-
fied volume and price movements. Purnanandam (2011) shows that banks relying more on
the originate-to-distribute model increased originations of riskier credit.
    Mian and Sufi (2009) use a within-county empirical strategy to show that zip codes with
a higher initial share of subprime borrowers witnessed larger relative growth in mortgage
originations for home purchase and house prices from 2002 to 2005. The measure of exposure
to PLS used in this study, the 2002 NCL share of a zip code, is strongly correlated with the
share of subprime borrowers in 2000 within MSAs used in Mian and Sufi (2009).2 This implies
that many of the patterns shown in Mian and Sufi (2009) are related to the speculation
channel emphasized here.
    There is also prior work on credit expansion and house price growth, e.g. Adelino et al.
(2014), Favara and Imbs (2015), and Di Maggio and Kermani (2017). These research studies
use different instruments for credit growth to show a causal effect of credit growth on house
   1
       There is a large theoretical literature using asymmetric information and belief heterogeneity to generate
bubbles, e.g. Miller (1977), Harrison and Kreps (1978), Scheinkman and Xiong (2003), Abreu and Brunner-
meier (2003), Simsek (2013), Caballero and Simsek (2018), Piazzesi and Schneider (2009) and DeFusco et
al. (2018). Empirical support for the importance of leverage and belief heterogeneity from the 18th century
can be found in Koudijs and Voth (2016). Allen and Gorton (1993) and Allen and Gale (2000) argue that
easy credit further encourages speculators to pay more than the fundamental value of an asset because they
can shift downside risk to lenders.

       Figure A1 in the appendix plots the share of subprime borrowers in 2000 against the 2002 NCL share
in a zip code after demeaning these variables at the MSA level. Each zip code is weighted by its population
size. The within-MSA pairwise correlation coefficient is 0.57 and highly significant.

    To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to test how a specific source of vari-
ation in mortgage credit supply expansion fuels speculative trading activity, and as a result
affects house prices, construction, and delinquency.3 It is also the first to link credit supply
expansion to the evolution of differences in beliefs about the housing market between home-
buyers and the rest of the population. This study also contributes to the recent literature on
the role of financial and behavioral factors in driving economic cycles. This literature builds
on the seminal insights introduced by scholars such as Irving Fisher, Charles Kindleberger,
and Hyman Minsky by providing theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence on the mech-
anisms behind financial boom-bust cycles (see e.g., Bordalo et al. (2017), Greenwood and
Hanson (2013), Krishnamurthy and Muir (2017), and López-Salido et al. (2017)).



1       Research Design and First Stage

1.1       The surge in private label mortgage securitization

The starting point for the analysis is the large expansion in private label mortgage securiti-
zation documented by Justiniano et al. (2017). The left panel of Figure 1 shows the surge in
the PLS market starting in late 2003. The share of mortgage originations that were securi-
tized in the PLS market went from 16% in 2002 to 46% in 2006. The right panel shows that
the rise in private label securitization corresponded with a sharp fall in the PLS mortgage
interest spread relative to Treasuries. The spread is calculated by Justiniano et al. (2017)
in the spirit of Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012) by controlling for risk and other contractual
features.
    The simultaneous rise in quantity and decline in spread implies an expansion in the sup-

    3
     The empirical strategy used here is closest to Nadauld and Sherlund (2013) who measure a zip code’s
exposure to the growth in securitization of mortgages by the five largest broker/dealer investment banks
during the 2003 to 2005 period. They find that securitization affected mortgage originations and default
rates, but they do not focus on house prices, construction, housing market optimism, or speculation.

ply of credit. The expansion in total supply of mortgage credit to the economy can be seen in
Figure 2. It separates mortgage originations for home purchases into three types of origina-
tions: GSE-backed originations, originations held on bank balance sheets, and originations
securitized in the private label market.4 The flow of mortgage origination amounts increased
by $600 million in 2006 relative to 2002, and $500 million of the increase was mortgages
originated for the PLS market. The aggregate increase in mortgage originations from 2003
to 2006 was driven by the surge in the PLS market.5
    What lies behind the rise in the PLS market starting in 2003? Justiniano et al. (2017)

       HMDA requires lenders to report to whom an originated loan is sold if it is sold within one year
of origination. We group together five categories as a measure of mortgages sold into the PLS market.:
mortgages sold (1) into private securitization, (2) to a commercial bank, savings bank, or savings affiliation
affiliate, (3) to a life insurance company, credit union, mortgage bank, or finance company, (4) to an affiliate
institution, or (5) to other type of purchaser. Section A.1 in the appendix provides more details on HMDA
data construction.

       A recent body of research explores the rise of the level of household debt across the income and credit
score distribution during the housing boom (Mian and Sufi (2017b); Adelino et al. (2017); Foote et al. (2016);
Albanesi et al. (2017)). The results in this study focus instead on the extensive margin of house purchases,
whereas the rise in the level of household debt from 2000 to 2007 was due primarily to existing homeowners
borrowing against home equity (e.g., Mian and Sufi (2011), Mian and Sufi (2015), Bhutta and Keys (2016),
Mian and Sufi (2017b)).

                                                                                                   7
attribute the rise of PLS to the response of mortgage lenders to the end of the refinancing
wave. The authors argue that mortgage originators shifted their attention “to previously
underserved segments of the mortgage market by keeping mortgage rates low especially for
those borrowers.”6 Gurun et al. (2016) show evidence of a greater push by the mortgage in-
dustry to “sell” mortgages. For example, advertisement by the mortgage industry increased
six-fold from 2003 onward and induced people to take on mortgages that they otherwise
would not have. Mian et al. (2013) show political lobbying for sub-prime mortgage expan-
sion increased and resulted in favorable legislation, such as the safe harbor provision that
facilitated shadow financing (e.g., Perotti (2013)).

     Other related work showing declining spreads and rising origination volume includes Levitin and Wachter
(2013) and Demyanyk and Van Hemert (2011). Drechsler et al. (2017) and Xiao (2018) provide theory and
evidence that suggests that growth in the shadow banking sector was related to the end of the monetary
policy easing cycle in the summer of 2003. See also Landier et al. (2015) and Nagel (2016).

Chernenko et al. (2018) and Coval et al. (2009)). A BIS study shows that European banks
bought a large fraction of the private label non-agency mortgage debt (McCauley (2018)).
In highly influential work, Keys et al. (2010) and Keys et al. (2012) uncover a shift towards
lax screening in the PLS market around 2003. This shift encouraged lenders to originate new
non-conforming mortgages that the private label market was increasingly willing to absorb.
Rajan et al. (2015), Dell’Ariccia et al. (2012) and Ashcraft et al. (2010) show evidence
that holders of PLS mortgages took on mortgages with riskier soft-information attributes.
Piskorski et al. (2015), Griffin and Maturana (2016) and Mian and Sufi (2017a) show that
lenders and borrowers took advantage of neglected risk in the PLS market through fraudulent
behavior such as misreporting owner-occupied status and borrower income.
   The broader rise in shadow financing went beyond the PLS market to impact other
sectors as well (see Gorton and Metrick (2013) for a review). For example, Figure A2 in the
appendix shows that originated amounts in the collateralized loan obligation market, which
focuses exclusively on corporate debt with no direct link to residential mortgages, increased
from less than $20 billion to almost $90 billion from 2002 to 2006. The empirical strategy
does not need to take a stand on the precise source of the expansion in shadow financing
availability in 2003, as long as it reflects an expansion in credit supply.


1.2     Data on mortgage lenders and mortgage originations

The empirical strategy outlined below seeks to estimate the effect of the aggregate expan-
sion of the PLS market on lenders and geographic regions in the United States. It therefore
requires microeconomic data on mortgage lending and mortgage lenders. Mortgage origina-
tion information comes from HMDA. The HMDA data set records the universe of mortgage
originations for mortgage originators that have an office within metropolitan statistical areas
(MSAs).7 We identify each mortgage originator in the HMDA data, and we classify them

   7
     See guidelines for HMDA issued by the Federal Reserve in 2005: “a lender does not have to report
HMDA data unless it has an office in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA). As a result, reporting of home
loans in some rural areas may be relatively low.”

                                                    9
as either a “bank” or a “non-bank” based on whether they are regulated by the Federal
Reserve as a deposit-taking institution. Furthermore, we link these financial institutions to
Call Report data using a key provided to us by the Federal Reserve Board.
   Given the reporting restriction for originators in the HMDA data, we isolate our sample
to zip codes that are located within metropolitan statistical areas. For these zip codes, we
aggregate all HMDA originations by year, which gives us a zip-year level data set on mortgage
originations. There are two additions to the standard HMDA data. First, we use an MSA
by month level version of the HMDA data set below in some specifications. Second, for
home purchase mortgages, the HMDA data split first- and second-lien mortgages beginning
in 2004. For the years prior to 2004, we use data from Bhutta and Keys (2018) that split
first- and second-liens based on a methodology explained in their study.8 Summary statistics
are shown in Table A1 in the appendix.


1.3     First stage: High NCL lenders and the PLS expansion

The rise in the PLS market allowed lenders to originate more mortgages as they were able
to more easily originate and sell mortgages into securitization. However, lenders differed in
their funding models, which generated variation across lenders in the increase in the ability
to finance mortgages through securitization. For example, certain commercial banks relied
mainly on core deposits raised through their branch network for funding their balance sheets.
However, other banks relied less on core deposits (say because of a weaker depositor base)
and more on wholesale shadow financing. Non-bank mortgage lenders relied entirely on
non-core desposits to finance mortgage originations.
   The strategy employed in this study constructs a measure of dependence on shadow
financing at the lender level and tests if the rise in PLS boosted mortgage originations more
for shadow-financed lenders. The lender level measure is the ratio of non-core liabilities to
total liabilities (NCL for short) as of 2002. NCL is defined as one minus the ratio of core
   8
     We are extremely grateful to Neil Bhutta who provided us access to the key linking the HMDA Report
ID’s to the TFR bank ID’s and to the two additions to the standard HMDA data.

                                                  10
deposits to total liabilities, where core deposits are defined as FDIC insured deposits.9
   The rise in the PLS market would lead to stronger origination growth by high NCL
lenders under the assumption that it was difficult for lenders to change their funding structure
relatively quickly. This assumption is supported by the fact that there was a large degree
of persistence in the ranking of lenders by the NCL ratio during the boom. For example, a
regression of NCL ranking by lenders as of 2002 on NCL ranking from 2001 through 2007
yields a coefficient between 0.9 and 1 for every year.
   The dependence of lenders with a high NCL ratio on the PLS market for origination can
be seen in Figure 3. The figure splits lenders in the HMDA data set as “high NCL” if their
NCL ratio in 2002 was above the median and “low NCL” otherwise. We then plot the share
of total mortgage originations in 2002 by each lender type across the three categories shown
earlier in Figure 2. Lenders with a high NCL ratio sold 43.4% of their originated mortgages
into the PLS market as of 2002, while lenders with low NCL only sold 23.5% into the PLS
market. On the other hand low NCL lenders kept 39.5% of their originated mortgages on
balance sheet compared to only 19.2% for high NCL. The two types of banks did not differ in
the fraction of mortgage originations sold into GSE backed pools. Even before the expansion
of the PLS market, high NCL lenders heavily utilized the PLS market for funding mortgage
origination volume.
   The expansion in the PLS market led to a significant relative expansion of mortgage
lending by high NCL lenders. The upper panel in Figure 4 plots total mortgage originations
and home purchase mortgage originations separately for high and low NCL lenders. There
was almost no difference in mortgage origination between the two types of lenders prior to
2003. However, starting in 2003, high NCL lenders expanded mortgage supply by more.

    Notable high NCL banks as of 2002 were Countrywide Bank NA and IndyMac BK FSB. Notable non-
bank mortgage lenders, with an NCL equal to one by definition, as of 2002 were Ameriquest Mortgage
Company, New Century Mortgage Corp, and American Home Mortgage Company.

where ln(yb,t ) is the natural logarithm of total amount originated by lender b in year t. The
coefficients {βk } give the relative growth in mortgage amount originated by high NCL lenders
since 2002 (which is the omitted year). The estimated coefficients show that there was no
pre-trend and a sharp relative rise for high NCL lenders starting in 2003 and accelerating
during 2004 and 2005. These results confirm the presence of a strong first stage at the lender
level. Lenders with less access to core deposits relied more on the PLS market for mortgage
origination and consequently originated more mortgages with the rise of the shadow banking
sector.10

     In appendix figure A3, we present results separately for refinancing originations. The results are similar:
there is no significant pre-trend, and high NCL ratio lenders see stronger relative growth in refinancing
originations starting in 2003.

The top panel plots total mortgage originations (total and home purchase) for lenders above and below the
median NCL ratio as of 2002. The bottom left panel plots coefficients {βk } from equation 1. The specification
that generates the bottom right panel uses as a dependent variable Exitb,t , an indicator variable for whether
a lender that is in sample in 2002 is still in sample in year t for years 2003-2009. Regressions use HMDA data
and are weighted by the mortgage amount originated in 2002 by lender b. Robust standard errors reported.

   There was a relative decline in mortgage lending by high NCL lenders when the PLS
market collapsed in 2007. However, this decline is underestimated in the regression specifi-
cation because high NCL lenders were more likely to disappear from the sample after 2006.
If a lender disappeared, then it is not included in the sample for that year in the bottom left
panel. The bottom right panel presents regression coefficients for a linear probability model
that is similar to equation 1 except the left hand side variable is the probability of the lender
being absent from the HMDA data in that year. Results show that high NCL lenders have
a higher probability of exiting the sample in 2007.
   Column 1 of Table 1 summarizes the first stage effect of rise in PLS on shadow-financed
lenders by regressing:


                               ∆yb,02−05 = α + βN CLb,2002 + εb                              (2)


where ∆yb,02−05 is the percentage change in origination growth from 2002 to 2005 for lender
b. A lender NCL ratio going from 0 to 1 led to a 95.7 percentage point increase in mortgage
originations in 2005 relative to 2002.
   Columns 2 through 4 decompose the total effect into the three ways a lender can finance
a loan origination. Column 2 changes the dependent variable to the change in originated
mortgages that were sold into the PLS market divided by all 2002 originations. Columns 3
and 4 do likewise for originations sold to GSEs and originations kept on a lender’s balance
sheet. This decomposition ensures that the estimates in columns 2 through 4 add up to the
total effect in column 1. Decomposing the total effect shows that almost the entire effect
is driven by an in increase in originations by high NCL banks that were sold into the PLS
market. This further supports the view that the rise in the PLS market enabled high NCL
lenders to expand credit supply by originating and selling loans in the PLS market.

1.4     Exclusion restriction tests

The first stage impact of non-core deposit dependence on mortgage origination growth is
strong, and the timing lines up with the aggregate expansion in the shadow banking sector.
The identifying exclusion restriction assumption is that lenders with a higher NCL ratio
did not receive a spurious credit demand shock contemporaneously with the expansion of
the PLS market. For example, perhaps high NCL lenders focused on areas that for some
reason experienced a stronger housing demand shock in 2003. If that were the case, then
the exclusion restriction assumption would no longer hold and the first stage could not be
interpreted as identifying a credit supply effect.
   This section tests for concerns about spurious credit demand shocks for high NCL lenders.
One technique to address these concerns is saturating the main regression specification with
granular fixed effects to absorb credit demand shocks in the spirit of Khwaja and Mian
(2008). In particular, the following specification utilizes disaggregated mortgage origination
data at the lender-MSA and lender-census-tract level, and it includes MSA and census-tract
fixed effects:


                             ∆yb,g,02−t = αg,t + βt N CLb,2002 + εb,g,t                              (3)


where the outcome variable is the growth in originated mortgage amount by lender b in



                                                 15
geography g from 2002 to t. The geographical unit may be an MSA or a census tract.
Census tracts are small contiguous subdivisions of a county, with typical population size
between 1,200 and 8,000 with an average of about 4,000. The definition of census tracts
can potentially change every decennial census, and 2003 was the first year that HMDA used
2000 census definitions. The estimation therefore restricts itself to census tracts that did
not change materially between the 1990 and 2000 census definitions to compute mortgage
origination growth at the census tract level between 2002 and t.11
    The estimates of αg,t absorb any credit demand shocks at geographic level g between
2002 and year t. The coefficient βt is estimated from variation between two lenders that
differ in their exposure to the PLS market but service the same narrowly defined housing
market. Columns 5 and 6 in Table 1 estimate equation 3 for origination growth between
2002 and 2005. Column 5 estimates the equation at the bank-MSA level with MSA fixed
effects, and column 6 at the bank-census-tract level with census-tract fixed effects. The
estimated β is similar to the lender-level estimate in column 1, even though the specification
is now saturating possible credit demand shocks at a highly granular level. For example, the
R-squared in column 6 rises to 0.332 from 0.004 in column 1.12
    Another important point is that there was considerable overlap in the borrowers financed
by high versus low NCL lenders prior to the acceleration of the PLS market in 2003. Figure
5 compares the credit score distribution for originated mortgages in 2002 for high and low
NCL lenders. The credit score distribution is constructed using information from HMDA
on mortgage origination by a lender in a zip code and matching it with the average credit
score of borrowers in that zip code from the TransUnion credit bureau data. While high
NCL lenders tended to lend to lower credit score zip codes on average as of 2002, there was

  11
       We impose a restriction that a bank-census tract must have at least 10 mortgage originations in 2002
to be included in the sample. We also weigh each bank-census-tract observation within a census tract by
its origination share in 2002. This way the correct dollar-weighted census-tract-level credit demand shock is
differenced out.
    12
       It is important to recognize that the specifications in columns 5 and 6 are “over controlling” in the
sense that any spillovers in credit expansion due to competitive effects from one lender to another within a
narrowly defined housing market would tend to reduce the estimated coefficient.

1.5      Geographic exposure to high NCL lenders

The rise of the PLS market led high NCL lenders to increase mortgage originations signifi-
cantly more than low NCL lenders starting in 2003. In order to analyze its impact on local
housing markets, the rest of this study uses zip code or MSA level variation in exposure to
high NCL lenders. For each geographical area g, the exposure to the expansion of the PLS
market is calculated as the average of the 2002 NCL ratios of mortgage lenders in the area,
where the average is weighted by a lender’s amount of mortgage originations in 2002. More
specifically:

                                                  X

Table A.3 in the appendix shows the correlation matrix between the 2002 NCL share at
the zip code level to various zip code level attributes. The strongest correlation is with the
deposit to mortgage origination ratio. Zip codes with a stronger presence of high NCL lenders
are “deposit-poor,” in the sense that the supply of local retail deposits is low compared to
the demand for mortgage originations. Consequently these areas are more likely to rely on
lenders with non-core deposit sources of financing. Areas with high NCL lenders also tend
to have less elastic housing supply.
   Areas with high NCL exposure tend to have lower income, lower homeownership, lower
credit scores, and a younger population. The fact that high NCL lenders have large market
share in zip codes with a lower fraction of individuals over the age of 65 is consistent with
Becker (2007), who shows that seniors tend to save via deposits in local banks. Older zip
codes are therefore “deposit-rich,” and are less reliant on outside sources of funding. All
of these correlations make economic sense: deposit-poor areas are more likely to rely on
mortgages originated by lenders that rely on external funding. In this sense, we do not want
to control for these factors; they are the underlying source of variation in exposure to high
NCL lenders.
   The variation across geographical areas in the 2002 NCL share is used to test whether
the lender level first stage shown above passes through to the geographic level. The first
stage at the geographic level may not be strong if high NCL lenders simply captured existing
market share from low NCL lenders due to their easier access to the PLS market. Similarly,
a first stage at the geographic level would not be observed if lenders could costlessly start
lending in new areas and there was no segmentation in lending markets. However, there is
evidence of such segmentation. For example, the dependence of a geographical area on high
NCL lenders is highly persistent. As shown in the first row of Table A.3 in the appendix,
the correlation between the 1998 NCL share of the zip code and the 2002 NCL share of the
zip code is 0.84 with a small standard error.
   In order to test for the first stage at the geographical level, we first estimate specifications


                                                18
at the MSA by month level. We focus on the MSA level initially because of a new data set
available from the Federal Reserve which tracks HMDA mortgage originations at the county
by month level, which can easily be aggregated to the MSA by month level. It is not possible
at this time to obtain zip code by month level data. The use of monthly HMDA data allows
for the precise identification of the timing when high NCL share MSAs experienced stronger
mortgage origination growth. The exact specification is:


                                                       1t=k βk N CLSharem,2002 + εm,t
                                             X
                  ln(ym,t ) = αm + γt +                                                               (4)
                                           k6=2002m1


The dependent variable is log of mortgage originations in MSA m in month t. The coefficients
βk trace the relative growth of originated amounts in MSAs with a high NCL share as of
2002. One issue with monthly data is seasonality in the home purchase market that varies
from region to region (e.g., depending on weather). We address seasonality by including a
month of year fixed effect from the mortgage origination data for each MSA.13
   Figure 6a shows the estimated βk for home purchase mortgage originations, and Figure 6b
does the same for refinancing mortgage originations. Both figures show a strong first stage,
with the estimated coefficient rising sharply in September and October of 2003. Moreover,
there is no pre-trend prior to this period in the estimated coefficient. The magnitude of
the effect is large. Housing markets in the top quartile of the 2002 NCL share distribution
experienced home purchase mortgage origination that was 23.0 percentage points higher than
mortgage origination in the bottom quartile at the peak of the cycle.
   The right panel of both figures zooms in on 2003 and also includes the PLS mortgage
spread to Treasury rate residual from Justiniano et al. (2017) shown earlier in Figure 1. The
relative rise in amount originated in high NCL share MSAs starts at almost the exact same
time as the PLS spread drops. Our interpretation of this pattern is that the acceleration

of the PLS market lowered mortgage interest spreads and led to a sudden relative rise in
originations in high NCL share MSAs. The high frequency analysis supports the view that
high NCL share MSAs experienced a sudden rise in originations because of the acceleration
of the PLS market; it is unlikely that income prospects or housing market optimism increased
by more in high NCL share MSAs suddenly in August, September, and October of 2003.
   Given that the analysis in the rest of the study focuses primarily on variatoin at the zip
code level as opposed to MSA level, Figure A5 in the appendix shows estimates from the zip
code by year level version of the specification in equation 4. As mentioned above, zip code
level data cannot be measured in HMDA at a higher frequency than yearly. Nonetheless,
the results using the zip code by year level data set are similar. There was no differential
pre-trend in mortgage originations for high NCL share zip codes, and then a sudden rise in
2003 followed by a collapse starting in 2007.
   Table 2 further tests for pre-trends by regressing the change in various additional variables

of interest on a local housing market’s exposure to high NCL lenders in 2002.14 Columns
1 and 2 show that there was no differential change in housing market sentiment between
2000 and 2002. The dependent variable in column 1 is the overall change in optimism about
the housing market, where optimism is measured as the percentage of respondents in the
Michigan Survey of Consumer who think it is a favorable time to buy a house.15 Column
2 uses the change in the percentage of respondents who say that it is a good time to buy
a house because of price considerations. Both columns show that there is no evidence of a
change in housing market optimism prior to the sudden expansion of mortgage lending in
2003. The estimated coefficients also have small standard errors. Columns 3 through 6 show
that there is no differential growth in house prices or construction activity in high NCL areas
prior to 2003.

However, there is also evidence that mortgage contract terms were affected by the rise of the
PLS market. Motivated by the empirical analysis in this study, Dokko et al. (2019) show that
high NCL share counties witnessed a sudden relative increase in the use of non-traditional
mortgage features such as variable interest rates or interest only payments exactly in the
late summer and early fall of 2003.16
    In summary, there are a number of findings that support the exclusion restriction as-
sumption that the rise of the PLS market led to a relative credit supply expansion toward
high NCL share areas that was independent of spurious shifts in household demand. First,
the lender-level regressions can be saturated by census-tract fixed effects to control for de-
mand side factors in the spirit of Khwaja and Mian (2008), and high NCL ratio lenders
expand mortgage lending significantly more even with these detailed controls for demand.
Second, there was no evidence of differential pre-trends in mortgage originations, housing
market optimism, house price growth, or construction prior to 2002 in high NCL share areas.
Third, the relative increase in mortgage originations in high NCL share MSAs is perfectly
timed with the aggregate rise in the PLS market in August, September, and October of 2003.


  16
     The fact that high NCL share counties experienced a sharp rise in the use of mortgages with non-
traditional features is further support for the idea that mortgages originated in the PLS market facilitated
speculation in housing markets, e.g., Barlevy and Fisher (2018).

                                                     22
With this evidence in hand, the next three sections explore how this mortgage credit sup-
ply expansion affected speculative trading, house prices, construction, and housing market
optimism in areas most exposed to high NCL ratio lenders.



2         Speculative Trading Activity

2.1         Data and measurement of speculation

An advantage of the data set used in this study is that it allows for the measurement of the
marginal buyers brought into the market by the PLS-driven expansion in mortgage credit
supply. Such measures are calculated based on credit data provided by TransUnion, a global
information solutions company, through a relationship with the Kilts Center for Marketing
at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business
     The underlying TransUnion data set is at the individual-account level, and is available
from June 2000 through the end of the sample period in 2010. The data set records the
outstanding balance and delinquency status for each credit account that an individual has
every month. The available TransUnion data set is a 10% random sample of the universe,
where individuals are in the universe if they appear in the data at any point between June
2000 and 2016. This study uses a 5% random sample of the 10% sample for computational
reasons, giving us a 0.5% sample of the universe.
     We use the individual-account data set to construct a mortgage origination data set
similar to HMDA. However, the advantage of the TransUnion data is that it includes impor-
tant attributes of the borrower taking on the mortgage, such as her credit score, age, credit
market behavioral patterns, and delinquency status. The TransUnion data do not contain
any explicit flag for whether a mortgage is a refinancing, a home purchase loan, or a first-
lien. In the appendix, we describe how we classify mortgages into these categories, and we
provide evidence that our methodology produces aggregate statistics in line with HMDA.17
    17
         See Section A.2 and Figure A6 in the appendix for details. We are happy to share this code with any

                                                      23
The appendix also describes how zip codes of the house being purchased are assigned to an
individual in the TransUnion data. As shown below, specifications that can be estimated
with either the HMDA or TransUnion data produce similar results.
    Summary statistics for the TransUnion mortgage origination level data are shown in Table
A1 in the appendix. The average first-lien purchase mortgage in the TransUnion data set is
$188 thousand. The average VantageScore of an individual taking out a first-lien mortgage
between 2001 and 2010 is 692, which is in the prime category. The average age at origination
is 42 years, and 24% of individuals that take out a first-lien mortgage default on a mortgage
at some point in 2006 or after.
    The TransUnion data set allows us to construct measures of speculation. We measure
speculators in the TransUnion data in three ways. First, a mortgage origination is classified
as being taken out by a speculator if the individual taking out the mortgage in question
also takes out another distinct first-lien purchase mortgage in a two year period around
the origination in question. We refer to this as the “multiple houses” categorization of a
speculator.
    Second, a given first-lien purchase origination is classified as being taken out by a spec-
ulator if the first-lien purchase mortgage is subsequently closed within a year, and there is
no associated refinancing for the individual in the six months after the purchase mortgage
is closed. We refer to such an individual as a “short-term” trader, where we are making
the assumption that the closed mortgage reflects a sale. Third, a given first-lien purchase
origination is classified as being taken out as a speculator if the individual taking out the
mortgage already has at least two existing first-lien mortgages on his balance sheet at the
time of the new origination. We refer to such an individual as a “2+ mortgage” speculator.
    How common are speculators in the data? Just over 4% of individuals in the TransUnion
data as of 2005 or 2006 obtain a new first lien purchase mortgage. For the “multiple houses,”
“short-term,” and “2+ mortgage” categories, 0.5%, 0.7%, and 0.6% of all individuals in the


other researchers that have permission to use the TransUnion data set at the Kilts Center at Chicago Booth.

                                                    24
TransUnion data in 2005 or 2006 are classified as speculators, respectively. If a speculator
is defined as an individual having any of these attributes, speculators make up 1.3% of
individuals in the TransUnion data in 2005 or 2006. By any measure, speculators represent
a small fraction of the overall population, a point to which we return to below in Section 4.
   These three definitions of speculation are not mutually exclusive, and indeed they are
highly correlated. If we condition the sample to individuals who take out a first lien mortgage
in 2005 or 2006, there is a 0.37 correlation across individuals for the 2+ mortgage and multiple
houses definitions, a 0.29 correlation for the short-term and multiple houses definitions, and a
0.15 correlation between the short-term and 2+ mortgage definitions. All of these correlations
are significant at the 1% confidence level.
   This section also uses a measure of total housing transaction volume, which comes from
CoreLogic, a private vendor that collects and standardizes publicly available tax assessments
and deed records from municipalities across the United States. Using the original CoreLogic
files, we replicate the DeFusco et al. (2018) version of this data set, which is filtered to get
the most accurate measure of volume at the zip code level.18 In robustness tests, we use the
measure of speculation from DeFusco et al. (2018), which is based on how frequently a given
property is sold.


2.2     The effect on transaction volume

Cross-sectional variation across zip codes in the 2002 NCL share is used to estimate the effect
of PLS-driven credit expansion on trading volume. Figure 7 plots βk from the regression,


                                                       1t=k βk N CLSharez,2002 + εz,t

     We are extremely grateful to the authors for sharing the zip-year level version of their total volume
variable, which we were able to successfully replicate using the original CoreLogic files. Please see the
appendix of DeFusco et al. (2018) for more information on the data construction.

where yz,t is the number of first lien mortgage originations for home purchase in zip code z
in year t in the left panel, and the number of housing transactions in the right panel.19
    Both panels in Figure 7 show a large relative increase in first-lien mortgage growth and
the volume of housing transactions from 2003 to 2006 in high NCL share zip codes. The
relative increase began exactly when the PLS market accelerated in 2003. The magnitude of
the impact on volume is quite large. Going from a zip code in the bottom quartile of 2002
NCL share distribution to a zip code at the top quartile leads to an increase in transaction
volume of 19.1%.
    Moreover, the increase in the number of first-lien purchase mortgages was almost identical
to the increase in housing transaction volume in terms of magnitude. This implies that the
relative rise in transaction volume in high NCL share zip codes was driven entirely by a
rise in transactions using a first-lien purchase mortgage, highlighting the importance of the
credit supply expansion in driving the rise in volume.
    Both the number of first-lien purchase mortgage originations and volume collapsed in
2007 in high NCL share zip codes. In 2009 and 2010, volume again rose in high NCL share
zip codes, but the number of first-lien mortgages continued to collapse. This suggests that
cash buyers moved into the market after the crash. The results are in-line with the “leverage
cycles” of Geanakoplos (2010). Growth in housing transactions in high NCL areas was driven
by mortgage financing during the boom but a larger share of transactions in these areas were
financed with cash during the bust.




  19
     First lien mortgages can be measured in both the HMDA and the TransUnion data. HMDA splits home
purchase mortgages into first- and second-lien mortgages beginning in 2004. For the years prior to 2004, we
use data from Bhutta and Keys (2018) that split first- and second-liens based on a methodology explained in
their study. We are extremely grateful to Neil Bhutta for sharing with us his data. In TransUnion, first-lien
home purchase mortgages capture a transaction financed with a mortgage, and does not include second-lien
“piggy-back” mortgages. See appendix for more details on data construction and comparison of the HMDA
and Transunion measure of first-lien mortgages.

The figure plots the coefficients {βk } from equation 5. The dependent variable in the left panel is the natural
logarithm of first-lien home purchase mortgages and the dependent variable in the right panel is housing
transaction volume. The regressions are weighted by the share of total occupied housing units in zip code z
in 2000. 95% confidence intervals are from clustered standard errors at the MSA level.




2.3     Speculators as marginal buyers

The mortgage transaction level TransUnion data set allows us to understand the marginal
buyers brought into the housing market by the acceleration of the PLS market. Formally, let
yz,t represent the number of first-lien mortgage originations for home purchase in zip code
z at time t. As shown above, yz,t closely tracks the growth in overall housing transactions
during the housing boom period. For any partition of the population, e.g. partitioning the
population into high and low credit score individuals, the total change in yz,t between years
t − h and t can be decomposed as,

                                                              i
                                                        X ∆yz,t
                                               ∆yz,t
                                                      =
                                               yz,t−h   i
                                                          yz,t−h

where ∆yz,t = yz,t − yz,t−h . Each term on the right hand side of the above expression
represents the contribution to growth coming from each sub-group i of the partition. This
decomposition can be used to estimate the contribution of each sub-group i to the total

gages,

                               yz,0102

where 0102 and 0506 represent the sum of y from 2001 to 2002 and 2005 to 2006, respec-
tively.20 Columns 1 and 2 in panel A report specifications where i reflects the universe of
first lien mortgages in the HMDA data and the TransUnion data, respectively. For the spec-
ifications reported in these columns, the left hand side variable is just the percentage change
in first-lien mortgages in zip code z during the boom. A zero to one change in the 2002
NCL share is associated with a 176 percentage point increase in first-lien mortgage origina-
tions in the HMDA data set, and 168 percentage point increase in the TransUnion data set.
The estimates are similar across the two types of data sets, which gives us confidence that
the measurement of first-lien purchase mortgages in the TransUnion data set is similar to
the HMDA data.21 The TransUnion data estimate implies that housing markets in the top
quartile of NCL exposure experience an increase in mortgage-financed home purchases that
is 23.0 percentage points higher than mortgage-financed purchases in the bottom quartile at
the peak of the cycle.
   Columns 3 through 5 of panel A examine how much of this total effect is coming from
speculators. A substantial fraction of the overall rise in volume is driven by speculators, with
the largest fraction of the overall effect coming from speculators according to the multiple
houses definition. The point estimates suggest that between 30 and 70% of the relative rise
in volume in high NCL share zip codes was due to speculators. The estimation in column 6
classifies a first-lien mortgage as being taken out by a speculator if the individual taking out

      The TransUnion data set begins in June 2000, which means 2001 is the first full year available to
calculate yz,t .

sets; the results are similar across the two data sets.

the mortgage fits any of the three definitions. As the estimate shows, under the broadest
definition of a speculator, the entire rise in transaction volume in high NCL share zip codes
is driven by speculative trading activity.

This figure plots the share of the relative growth in first-lien purchase mortgage originations in high NCL

               f irstlienmortgagesz,m,0102            where f irstlienmortgagesi is a subset of first-lien mortgages
such as first lien mortgages taken out by speculators. For each group i, the coefficient β i is divided by the total
                                    f irstlienmortgagesz,m,0506 −f irstlienmortgagesz,m,0102

β i for each group i from equation 6 scaled by the total effect of 1.680 reported in column 2
of Panel A of Table 3. As it shows, under the broadest definition, speculators accounted for
nearly 100% of the relative growth in volume in high NCL share zip codes.
    Table 3 also shows that the marginal house buyers brought in by the PLS market were
riskier from an ex ante perspective. As Panel B shows, most of the effect comes from
individuals with a subprime credit score as of 2000 and individuals with no credit score as
of 2000.22 Individuals with a prime credit score as of 2000 in high NCL share zip codes did
not witness stronger growth in first-lien mortgage originations relative to individuals with a
prime credit score as of 2000 in low NCL share zip codes.

   22
    When individuals with no credit score as of 2000 eventually enter the TransUnion data set, the average
and median score are both in the near prime category.

                                                                                                                                     30
   In order to learn more about these speculators, Panel C of Table 3 does a double sort of
the data based on the broad measure of speculation and the credit score of the individual
as of 2000. Non-prime in Panel C includes those with a missing score as of 2000 and those
with a near-prime or subprime credit score as of 2000. As Panel C shows, most of the rise in
speculative trading activity came from individuals with a non-prime credit score as of 2000.
Interestingly, as column 3 shows, the PLS market appears to have brought in non-prime
individuals who did not engage in speculative trading activity. Furthermore, column 4 of
Panel C indicates that there was a relative decline in house purchases in high NCL share
zip codes by individuals with a prime credit score as of 2000 who were not engaging in
speculative trading activity. In other words, individuals in high 2002 NCL share zip codes
with high credit scores that were not engaging in speculative trading activity experienced a
relative decline in house buying relative to their counter-parts in low NCL share zip codes.
High credit score traditional home-buyers in zip codes seeing a trading frenzy appear to have
been sitting out, a point to which we will return in Section 4.
   As Panel D shows, there was a slight tilt toward young individuals in accounting for the
relative increase in first-lien purchase mortgage origination growth in high NCL share zip
codes. The median age at origination of a first-lien mortgage from 2001 to 2010 was 40,
and the results in Panel C indicate that 65% of the relative growth in first-lien purchase
originations in high NCL share zip codes was driven by individuals below 40 at origination.
   Table A3 in the appendix replicates Table 3 with the inclusion of MSA fixed effects. Such
specifications exploit only within MSA variation in the NCL share of a zip code as of 2002
to see the effect of credit supply expansion on the marginal buyers brought into the housing
market. As the table in the appendix shows, the coefficient estimate on the 2002 NCL share
is similar and even somewhat larger in the specifications with MSA fixed effects. Omitted
variables at the MSA level do not appear to be responsible for the coefficient estimates in
Table 3.

2.4     A property-based measure of speculation

An alternative approach to measuring speculative trading activity is presented in DeFusco
et al. (2018). More specifically, using the CoreLogic deed records transactions, one can
measure how many times a given property is bought and sold in some short time period.
This approach is entirely independent of the TransUnion data, and as a result provides a
useful check on the results above. Following DeFusco et al. (2018), we classify each house
transaction by whether the house is subsequently sold within one, two, or three years of the
purchase. This allows for a decomposition of total transaction volume by whether the house
will be quickly “flipped” again.

This table presents zip-code level regressions of the percentage change in volume from 2001 to 2005 on
the 2002 NCL Share. Following DeFusco et al. (2018), we split transactions by whether the property is
subsequently sold within a certain number of years. More specifically, the coefficients reported in columns 2
through 4 are β i from the following specification: yz,01−05
                                                     i
                                                             = α + β i N CLSharez,2002 + εz from zip code z.
              i         volumei   −volumeiz,01
The variable yz,01−05 =      z,05
                            volumez,01           where volumei is a subset of all volume based on whether and
when the property is subsequently sold.



    Table 4 focuses on the increase in volume from 2001 to 2005. Given the manner in which
the DeFusco et al. (2018) measure is constructed, the left hand side variable in the regres-
sions represents the increase in the number of transactions of properties that subsequently
transacted again within a certain number of years. As in Table 3 above, the specifications
follow equation 6 in decomposing the total rise in volume into the share of the rise coming
from properties that were transacted again within 1, 2, and 3 years.

                                                        32
     As Table 4 shows, 40% of the differential increase in volume for high NCL share zip
codes comes from the rise in transactions of houses that will be subsequently sold within
two years, and over half of the total effect comes from those that will be subsequently
sold within three years. Figure A8 in the appendix shows estimates of equation 5 for total
volume and volume of houses subsequently sold again in one, two, or three years. As the
figure shows, the coefficients on the 2002 NCL share of the zip code are two to three times
larger for transaction volume of houses that are sold again in one or two years relative to all
transactions. Property-based measures of speculation confirm that exposure to high NCL
lenders led to a credit-driven rise in speculative trading activity in the housing market.



3        House prices, Construction, and Defaults

How did the rise in credit supply-driven speculative trading activity affect housing markets
more broadly? The left panel of Figure 9 presents estimates of βk from the estimation of
equation 5 with the natural logarithm of house prices as the left hand side variable.23 This
estimation is conducted using the zip by year level data set. As the estimates show, high
NCL share zip codes experience positive relative growth in house prices in 2003, which then
accelerates rapidly in 2004, 2005, and 2006. Going from a zip code in the bottom quartile of
NCL exposure to a zip code in the top quartile of NCL exposure leads to a 12.1 percentage
point increase in house prices.
     The PLS market collapsed in 2007, which corresponds to a collapse in house prices in
high NCL share zip codes. In fact, the collapse was severe enough that the log house price
level ended up lower in 2009 and 2010 than its 2002 level relative to low NCL share zip codes.
     The right panel of Figure 9 presents estimates of βk using the natural logarithm of new
housing units as the left hand side variable. This specification is estimated at the MSA
by year level, given that new housing permit data is only available from the Census at the
    23
     House price data used in Figure 9 comes from CoreLogic and is recorded at the zip code level. Housing
units data comes from the Census Building Permits Survey and is recorded at the county level, which we
aggregate up to the MSA level. Housing supply elasticity is measured as in Saiz (2010).

The figure plots the coefficients {βk } from equation 5. The left panel uses the natural logarithm of house
prices in a zip code and the right panel uses the natural logarithm of new housing permits in an MSA as the
dependent variable. The regressions are weighted by the share of total occupied housing units in zip code z
or MSA m in 2000. Standard errors are clustered at the MSA level.




county level. It shows a similar pattern: high 2002 NCL share MSAs witnessed a substantial
boom and bust in construction. As with house prices, construction during the bust fell even
below the 2002 level relative to low 2002 NCL share MSAs.
    The evidence is supportive of the argument in Glaeser et al. (2008). They argue that in the
presence of speculators, the boom in house prices will lead to excess speculative investment
in construction of new homes during the boom. Consequently when prices collapse, they
will “over shoot” by going below their pre-boom levels. This is needed to absorb the excess
inventory built up during the boom.
    Table 5 presents regression estimates corresponding to Figure 9. The boom and bust in
house prices and construction activity was significantly pronounced in high NCL share areas.
The third and sixth column of Table 5 test the long run “over-correction” hypothesis put
forth in Glaeser et al. (2008). While the statistical power is weaker, there does appear to
have been lower growth in both house prices and construction activity from 2002 to 2010 in
high NCL share areas. Not only did house prices and construction activity collapse in high

NCL share areas from 2006 to 2010, but the collapse was large enough to bring the relative
level below where they began in 2002.24

    As a side note, it is worth mentioning that credit expansion fueled by the PLS market
boosted house prices even in cities such as Las Vegas and Phoenix that experienced substan-
tial new construction during the boom. The phenomenon of high house price growth in such
cities has puzzled researchers given that in standard models the ability to cheaply construct
more housing units should put a lid on house price growth (e.g. Davidoff (2013), Nathanson
and Zwick (2017)). There is a related body of research focusing on anomalous elastic housing
supply MSAs with both a boom in construction and house prices.25 Nathanson and Zwick
(2017) point to the importance of supply-side speculation and Chinco and Mayer (2015)
point to the importance of out-of-town investors. The results presented here suggest that
the expansion of the PLS market also played an important role.
    The collapse of the housing market from 2006 to 2010 led to a dramatic rise in mortgage
default rates in high NCL share zip codes. The left panel of Figure 10 plots βk from the
estimation of equation 5 with the mortgage default rate of the zip code as the outcome
  24
       An important caveat is that the negative effect of defaults and foreclosures on house prices during the
bust may bring prices even below long-run fundamental value. This force is not contained in the Glaeser et
al. (2008) model.

The left panel plots the coefficients {βk } from equation 5 with the mortgage default rate in a zip code as the
left hand side variable. The regression is weighted by the share of total occupied housing units in zip code z,
and standard errors are clustered at the MSA level. The middle panel plots total delinquent mortgage debt
in zip codes by N CLSharez,2002 quartiles. The quartiles are weighted by total mortgage debt outstanding
as of 2006. The right panel plots the mortgage default rate for individuals that speculated in 2005 and 2006
in the top quartile NCL zip codes.




variable. As early as year end 2006, there was an uptick in defaults in high NCL share zip
codes that is marginally statistically distinct from zero. By the end of 2007, there was a
large relative increase in mortgage default rates in high NCL share zip codes that continued
to rise until 2010.
               The middle panel shows total delinquent mortgage debt by zip code quartiles of the 2002
NCL share ratio. From 2006 to 2007, total mortgage delinquent debt rose substantially
more in high NCL share zip codes relative to the rest of the country. As a share of total
delinquencies, the top quartile zip codes by the 2002 NCL share increased by almost 5
percentage points from 2006 to 2007. By 2008 and 2009, the mortgage default crisis spread
to the rest of the country (e.g., Ferreira and Gyourko (2015)), but Figure 10 shows that the
earliest stage of the mortgage default crisis was driven by defaults in zip codes most exposed
to the PLS market. This is consistent with widespread evidence that the mortgage default
crisis was initiated with defaults in the PLS market.26
               The right panel of Figure 10 examines the default rate of individuals classified as specu-

lators in 2005 or 2006 according to any of the three definitions above. The sample is limited
to the top quartile zip codes by the 2002 NCL share. The default rate of speculators in high
NCL share zip codes increased substantially from 2005 to 2006, and reached nearly 20% in
2007. This is another piece of evidence supporting the importance of speculation driven by
the PLS market in instigating the mortgage default crisis.



4     Heterogeneity in Beliefs

It is difficult to discuss speculative trading activity without discussing house price growth
expectations. Indeed, models in which credit availability affects asset prices often assume het-
erogeneity in beliefs about future asset values (e.g., Geanakoplos (2010) and Simsek (2013)).
There is also some evidence of this type of heterogeneity in Table 3; the results in that table
suggest that individuals with prime credit scores not engaging in speculative trading actually
reduced purchases in high NCL share zip codes.
    We are also motivated to examine evidence on belief heterogeneity given the fact that
only a small part of the overall population engaged in speculative trading activity during the
housing boom of 2005 and 2006. As mentioned above, even under the most broad definition
of a speculator, only 1.3% of all individuals in TransUnion in 2005 and 2006 engaged in
speculative trading activity in the housing market. A small group of individuals had a large
effect on the overall housing market, which suggests that an overall rise in optimism about
the housing market may not have been necessary to generate a boom in prices and volume.


4.1    Data on beliefs

Unfortunately, there is no information on house price expectations in the data sets used
above. Furthermore, there is limited individual level data on house price beliefs during
the housing boom from 2002 to 2006 that can be linked to measures of speculation at the




                                              37
individual level.27 As a result, the analysis in this section is conducted at the aggregate and
MSA level.
    Two data sets are used to measure beliefs. First, following Piazzesi and Schneider (2009),
the Michigan Survey of Consumers is used to measure beliefs about the housing market. We
use county identifiers in the individual level Michigan survey data to construct housing
market belief data at the MSA-year level. We measure average housing market beliefs using
questions such as the fraction of respondents saying whether it is good time to buy a house,
and for what reason. See Section A.3 in the appendix for more details.
    Second, data on house price expectations of recent home-buyers come from Case et al.
(2012), who survey individuals who have bought a house in the preceding year.28 The
main advantage of this data set is that it provides house price expectations of the marginal
trader. That is, it measures the expectations of the individuals that have recently bought
a house. It therefore allows a comparison of the expectations of the marginal buyer with
average expectations taken from the Michigan survey. One important limitation of the Case
et al. (2012) data is that it only covers four metropolitan areas that the authors considered
representative of the broader U.S. market. Summary statistics for all of these data sets are
shown in Table A1 in the appendix.


4.2     Evolution of beliefs during the housing boom

The aggregate evidence on housing market optimism from the Michigan survey is consistent
with the importance of belief heterogeneity during the housing boom. As the left panel of
Figure 11 shows, during the heart of the PLS acceleration period of 2003 to 2006, the fraction
of individuals saying that now is a bad time to buy a house rose from 15% to 35%. This
finding replicates the analysis in Piazzesi and Schneider (2009), which is difficult to reconcile
with the view that widespread optimism about housing among the general population was
  27
      There has been a substantial increase in data availability on house price expectations since 2009 (e.g.,
Bailey et al. (2016), Fuster et al. (2018), and Adelino et al. (2018)) but almost all of these new data sets
cover information only after the 2002 to 2006 housing boom.
   28
      We are grateful to Anne Thompson for sharing these data with us.

responsible for the rise in house prices from 2003 to 2006.29
    The right panel uses information from the Michigan survey covering why an individual
believes it is either a good or bad time to buy a house. In particular, individuals can
specifically think it is a good time to buy a house because of positive house price growth
expectations, or they can also specifically think it is a bad time to buy a house because
of negative house price growth expectations.30 Even though the fraction of the population
saying that it is a good time to buy a house is falling (which is one minus the fraction saying
it is a bad time in the left panel), the fraction of the population saying it is a good time to
buy a house because of positive price expectations is actually rising (right panel). The right
panel shows that there is a rise in both the fraction of the population saying it is a good
time to buy because of positive price expectations and the fraction saying it is a bad time
to buy because of negative price expectations, which is also consistent with the findings of
Piazzesi and Schneider (2009).
    The same heterogeneity in beliefs can be seen when using the Case et al. (2012) data set, as
is done in Figure 12. As the left panel shows, from 2003 to 2006, the house price expectations
of individuals who recently bought a home increased. However, the fraction of the population
saying it is a bad time to buy a home because of negative price expectations also rose. The
marginal home-buyers in the market had high house price growth expectations, while the
average individuals in the economy were becoming more pessimistic about the evolution
of house prices. This suggests that heterogeneity in beliefs was an important part of the
housing boom.
    The right panel of Figure 12 uses MSA-by-year level variation in both the Michigan
survey and the Case et al. (2012) data set.31 It plots the house price growth expectations of

      This does not dispute the observation in the literature that a change in expectations by lenders was
an important part of the lending boom, see, e.g., Gerardi et al. (2008), Gennaioli et al. (2012), Landvoigt
(2016), Kaplan et al. (2017). For example, an overall neglect of downside risks as in Gennaioli et al. (2012)
could explain the rise in asset-backed securitization across many markets from 2003 to 2006.

are classified.

recent home-buyers against the fraction of individuals in the general population saying now
is a bad time to buy because of negative house price growth expectations. There is a robust
positive correlation, providing further support the importance of belief heterogeneity.
   How was housing market optimism related to the acceleration of the PLS market? The
Michigan data allow for the use of cross-sectional variation in housing market optimism
across MSAs by the 2002 NCL share to answer this question. Table 6 reports the following
specification on the evolution of optimism on the housing market in high versus low NCL
share MSAs during the housing boom:


                  ∆Optimismm,BOOM = αm + β ∗ HP Growthm,0206 + εz,m


where ∆Optimismm,BOOM is the MSA-level average of the survey responses to a given Michi-
gan question in MSA m in years 2004 through 2006 minus the average of the survey responses
to the same question in MSA m in years 2000 to 2002. Columns 1 and 3 present the OLS es-
timates, and columns 2 and 4 present instrumental variable estimates where the instrument
for house price growth is the 2002 NCL share of the MSA.
   The OLS and IV estimates convey a consistent message: the average household in high
house price growth areas became more pessimistic about the housing market in 2004 through
2006 relative to 2000 to 2002. In terms of magnitudes, a one standard deviation increase in
house price growth leads to a 6 to 8 percentage point increase in the share of individuals
expressing pessimism on the housing market. The increasing pessimism was driven by people
who became more pessimistic because of house price considerations.
   In Table A4 of the appendix, we split the “bad time to buy because of prices consider-
ations” into the two separate subcomponent answers: “bad time to buy because prices are
too high,” and “bad time to buy because prices will fall.” For both components, we find
that there was a relative increase in the fraction of individuals expressing pessimism in high
house price growth MSAs during the boom.

Regression results for the specification ym = α+βHP growthm,0206 +εm from MSA m. For columns
1 and 2, ym is the 2004-2006 average share of respondents saying it is a bad time to purchase a
home minus the 2000-2002 average share. For columns 3 and 4, ym is the 2004-2006 average share
of respondents saying it is a bad time to purchase a home because of price considerations minus
the 2000-2002 average share. HP growthm,0206 is house price growth in MSA m from 2002 to 2006.
The regressions are weighted by the number of survey participants in an MSA m. In columns 2
and 4, HP growthm,0206 is instrumented using the NCL share of the MSA as of 2002. The NCL at
the MSA level is defined as the weighted average of NCL at the lender-level where the weights are
the share of loans originated in 2002 by a lender b in msa m.



     The results are consistent with the view that higher house price growth, fueled by the
acceleration of the PLS market, made the average individual in these MSAs more pessimistic
about house prices. This provides further evidence that the PLS market affected the housing
market not through a general rise in house price expectations, but instead through boosting
the buying power of a smaller group of individuals.32



5        Conclusion

The narrative approach to economic history by Charles Kindleberger and Hyman Minsky
shows a close connection between credit and speculation. Both scholars point to several

    32
     We also examine whether there is evidence of a small cluster of optimists in high house price growth
MSAs using the Michigan survey. We find that there is a positive correlation between house price growth and
the share of individuals saying it is a good time to buy because of positive house price growth expectations,
but it is not statistically distinct from zero at a reasonable confidence level. It is not surprising that the
Michigan survey at the MSA level cannot detect a rise in optimistic speculators in high NCL share MSAs;
recall that these speculators make up a small fraction of the overall population.

examples in history in which a sudden change in credit conditions was the spark that led to
a speculative boom and bust in asset prices. This study tests for such a connection using the
surge of the PLS market in 2003 and cross-sectional variation across geographical areas in the
United States in exposure to this surge. The natural experiment allows for the isolation of a
plausibly exogenous increase in mortgage credit supply, and it shows that this expansion in
mortgage credit supply affected the housing market primarily through a speculation channel.
   A small group of speculators used newly available credit to buy houses, which boosted
both house prices and construction activity in the exposed areas. The crash was particularly
painful in these areas, and defaults coming from the PLS market initiated the mortgage de-
fault crisis. Differences in beliefs about the evolution of house prices appear to be important
in explaining these overall patterns. The marginal buyers of homes became more optimistic
during the boom, whereas the average individuals in the overall economy became more pes-
simistic about the housing market. There are a number of new data sets recording house
price growth expectations of individuals; the results presented in this study suggest that a
promising avenue for future empirical research is to explore the importance of heterogeneous
beliefs in more detail using these new data sets.

A      Further details on the data

A.1      HMDA match to lenders

The HMDA data set records the universe of mortgage originations for mortgage originators
                                                                            33
that have an office within metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs).                We identify each mort-
gage originator in the HMDA data, and link these financial institutions to Call Report data
using a key provided to us by the Federal Reserve Board.
    In the HMDA data, financial institutions report any mortgage loans to their regulatory
agency, and they are given a unique ID number and agency code in the loan-level data.
The financial institutions we focus on are regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency (OCC, agency code 1), the Federal Reserve System (FRS, agency code 2), and
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC, agency code 3); thrifts regulated by the
Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS, agency code 4); and independent mortgage companies
regulated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD, agency code 7).
This only leaves out credit unions, who make up a small portion of lending, and institutions
regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency that was only created
at the end of the decade as a response to the financial crisis. What we call banks are those
institutions regulated by agencies corresponding to agency codes 1-4 since these are asso-
ciated with a depository institution. Non-banks are non-depository independent mortgage
lending companies and correspond to agency code 7.
    We link lenders in the HMDA data to regulatory data filed by banks in the Report of
Condition and Income (the Call Report) and by thrifts in the OTS Thrift Financial Report
(TFR). Financial institutions that submit one of these forms are given a unique ID. If a
  33
     See guidelines for HMDA issued by the Federal Reserve in 2005: “a lender does not have to report
HMDA data unless it has an office in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA). As a result, reporting of home
loans in some rural areas may be relatively low.”

                                                   50
bank (thrift) is part of a multi-bank (multi-thrift) holding company then each form provides
a holding company ID which corresponds to the regulatory high holding company of the
institution. For our analysis, we use the bank-holding or thift-holding company ID when
an institution is part of a holding company and its unique ID otherwise. The HMDA ID is
used for independent mortgage companies. Using a key of the HMDA Report ID’s and the
Call Report and TFR bank ID’s provided to us by the Federal Reserve Board, we match the
loan-level HMDA data to the bank level report data.


A.2     TransUnion details

There are three main challenges in using the TransUnion data relative to HMDA. First,
the HMDA data set records the address of the property being purchased, whereas in the
TransUnion data we can only see the address of the individual taking out the mortgage.
We impute the address of the house being purchased in TransUnion as the address of the
individual six months after the home purchase mortgage origination. An obvious concern
is that many individuals are buying second houses and therefore the address in the credit
bureau data does not reflect the address of the house being purchased. While this is a valid
concern, we find remarkably similar zip-code level results using the HMDA and TransUnion
data, which suggests that this issue does not materially affect our results. For example,
Figure A7 below shows the evolution of first-lien mortgages by the NCL share of a zip code
as of 2002, and the coefficients are similar across the two data sets.
   The second and third challenges are related: the TransUnion data do not contain infor-
mation on whether the originated mortgage is a refinancing or a home purchase, nor does
it contain information on whether the mortgage is a first-lien or second-lien. Home equity
loans are recorded separately, so the latter concern is only with “piggy-back” second liens
used at purchase.
   We begin by classifying a mortgage origination as a refinancing if any of the following
four conditions are met:


                                              51
   • for the individual taking out the mortgage, the TU data set records the same census
     tract for the individual one month before to six months after the origination and the
     number of mortgages outstanding for the individual is the same from one month before
     to six months after the origination.

   • for the individual taking out the mortgage, the TU data set records the same census
     tract for the individual one month before to three months after the origination and
     the number of mortgages outstanding for the individual is the same from one month
     before to three months after the origination.

   • for the individual taking out the mortgage, the TU data set records the same census
     tract for the individual one month before to six months after the origination and the
     number of mortgages outstanding for the individual is reduced from one month before
     to six months after the origination. The assumption is that such a refinancing was
     used to pay off multiple mortgages outstanding prior to the refinancing.

   • for the individual taking out the mortgage, the TU data set records the same census
     tract for the individual one month before to three months after the origination and
     the number of mortgages outstanding for the individual is zero one month before the
     origination and one six months after the origination. This last step ensures we capture
     cash-out refinancings by individuals who had no mortgage prior to the refinancing.


   The complement of this set is defined to be a purchase mortgage. To separate a “piggy-
back” second lien from a first lien purchase mortgage, we classify a second-lien as a mortgage
that is less than or equal to 30% of the total mortgage amount taken out by the individual
in the same month.
   The top left panel of Appendix Figure A6 shows total mortgages originated in the HMDA
and TransUnion data sets, which match closely. The rest of the panels show the share of
refinancing, home-purchase, and first-lien home-purchase, to total originations in both data



                                             52
sets. Our methodology seems to over-estimate the refinancing share during the heart of the
housing boom, but otherwise it is a relatively close match.


A.3     Measuring housing market optimism in Michigan survey

The Michigan survey asks the following question to respondents: “Generally speaking, do you
think now is a good time or bad time to buy a house?” Almost 99% of survey respondents
answer this question by saying it is either a “good” or “bad” time. In addition to this
question, respondents are asked a follow up question: “Why do you say so?” In response to
this question, respondents give up to two answers. The survey questioners record a number
of different responses, which we classify into sub-groups as follows.
   If an individual responds that now is a good time to buy a house because “prices are
going up,” “prices are low/stable/not too high,” “prices won’t get any lower,” or “good buys
available,” we classify the response as being favorable because of house price considerations.
If an individual answers that now is a bad time to buy a house because “prices will fall later,
will come down” or “prices are too high, houses cost too much,” we classify the response
as being unfavorable because of house price considerations. If an individual answers that
now is a good time to buy a house because “credit easy to get, easy money,” “credit will be
tighter later,” or “lower down payment,” we classify the response as being favorable because
credit is loose. Note that there are many other responses to the follow up question; the
most common response given is that now is a good time to buy a home because “interest
rates are low.” As a result, the fractions of respondents saying now is a good time versus a
bad time to buy because of house prices considerations will not add up to one. Further, the
total fraction mentioning prices as a consideration will vary over time. From 2000 onward,
it is possible to match individual respondents to the county in which they live. We use this
match to construct MSA-by-year level measures of housing market optimism.

     to the total volume of home purchase mortgages originated in MSA m in month t. The right panel uses the same specification but ym,t refers to the
     total volume of refinancing mortgages . NCL at the MSA-level is defined as the weighted average of NCL at the lender-level where the weights are
     the share of loans originated in 2002 by a lender b in MSA m. The regressions are weighted by the share of total occupied housing units in MSA m
     in 2000. MSA and time fixed effects are included in the panel regressions.

This table presents summary statistics at the lender, zip, mortgage, and MSA level. ∆BOOM is defined as the
log change in outcome y from 2000-2002 to 2004-2006. For the Zip level: TransUnion data panel, ∆BOOM
is defined as the log change in outcome y from 2001-2002 to 2005-2006. This change is made because the
TransUnion data are not available for 2000. Summary statistics at the lender level are weighted by total
mortgage origination amount as of 2002. Summary statistics for the zip level and MSA level are weighted
by total number of households as of 2000.

     Correlation coefficients of the non-core liabilities share (NCL) in 2002 to observable variables at the zip-code level. The NCL ratio at the geographical-
     level is defined as the weighted average of NCL at the lender-level where the weights are the share of loans originated in 2002 by lender b in geography
     g. The Saiz elasticity measure and the deposit to purch amount originated ratio are measured at the MSA level given data availability.
