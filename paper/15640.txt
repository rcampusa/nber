The Long Reach of Childhood Health and Circumstance: Evidence from the Whitehall II Study

                                               ABSTRACT

We use data from the Whitehall II study to examine the potential role played by early-life health and
circumstances in determining health and employment status in middle and older ages. The population
from which the Whitehall II cohort was drawn consisted almost exclusively of white collar civil servants.
We demonstrate that estimates of the impact of early-life conditions based on the Whitehall II cohort
provide a lower bound on the effect of early-life circumstances on adult health and economic status
for the population as a whole. That said, using the Whitehall II cohort data, we find early life circumstances
are all predictive of entry grade and promotion to higher grade in Whitehall. Even with controls for
entry grade or current grade, we find that childhood circumstances predict cohort members' current
health status. Using fixed effect and first-difference models of self-assessed health status and civil
service employment grade, we find no evidence of civil service grade affecting future self-assessed
health. However, we find self-assessed health has a significant effect on future civil service grade.

That early-life health and environment can have life-long effects on cognitive function, health

and wellbeing has been documented by researchers from many disciplines, using data from many

countries collected over the last century. In a series of papers, David Barker and colleagues

underscore the importance of nutrition in utero for health at older ages, reporting that early-life

deprivation is associated with the onset of a number of chronic conditions in late-middle age,

including coronary heart disease and diabetes. 1 They argue that different physical systems and

organs may not be able to fully recover from lack of adequate nutrition at critical periods in fetal

life and infancy. Exposure to disease in utero and childhood has also been shown to be

associated with morbidity and mortality in adulthood (Almond 2006).

        Recent research has also highlighted the impact of infant and childhood health on

cognitive function, and its consequent impact on occupation and earnings in adulthood. 2 In work

related to our analysis here, Case and Paxson (2008a) document that, in the UK, every inch of

height is associated on average with a 1.5 to 2 percent increase in earnings for both men and

women, and that this labor market height premium can be explained by the higher cognitive test

scores taller adults attained as children. Case and Paxson hypothesize that early life environment

– nutrition and health in utero and childhood – affects children’s ability to reach both their

physical (height) potential and their cognitive potential.

        Height, as a marker for health and nutrition in childhood, has been shown to be highly

correlated with many outcomes of interest, including later-life cognitive function, health, and

depression in the US Health and Retirement Study (Case and Paxson, 2008b); earnings among

(Deaton and Arora, 2009).

       Some social epidemiologists, while recognizing that early-life health and circumstance

may play a role in later-life outcomes, argue that their effects are dwarfed by the impact of adult

socioeconomic status on adult health. In a series of influential papers, Michael Marmot and

colleagues use longitudinal data collected on a cohort of British civil servants to argue that the

impact of social position on changes in health status (the social causation of health) is more

important, measured using a number of metrics, than is the impact of health on social position

(the health selection hypothesis). (See, for example, discussion in Chandola et al. 2003.) In their

analysis of the relative importance of childhood and adult circumstance in predicting

cardiovascular disease among civil servants, the Whitehall II team concludes that “whatever the

salient features of the adult socioeconomic environment may be, it seems they are equally or

more important than circumstances in childhood” in determining cardiovascular risk in British

civil servants (Brunner et al. 1999, page 762). Early life is important, these researchers argue,

because “childhood circumstances determine adult circumstances and these, in turn, affect

disease risk” (Marmot et al. 2001, p. 305).

       For many analyses, the Whitehall II Study of British civil servants is well designed. All

individuals in the study work for the same employer; they all have access to Britain’s National

Health Service; and, at the beginning of the study period, they were all employed in London.

Marmot and colleagues appeal to the relative homogeneity of their sample to suggest that

differences in health outcomes between civil servants cannot be due to differences in access to


                                                 1
(or quality of) medical care. Instead, they argue, differences in health outcomes between civil

servants of higher and lower rank are due primarily to working conditions: seniority in the

employment hierarchy predicts longer life, and “high demands and low control at work” predict

poor health. 3 The contribution of the Whitehall II study in documenting the links between adult

health status and social status has been large indeed.

          In this paper, using data from the Whitehall II study, we concentrate on the potential role

played by early-life health and socioeconomic status as determinants of cohort members’ health

and employment status at Whitehall. We find that, because the population from which this cohort

was drawn consisted almost exclusively of white collar civil servants, 4 the Whitehall II sample is

not well suited for quantifying the importance of childhood conditions for the population as a

whole. Children from poor backgrounds who find white collar positions in Whitehall are

different in many dimensions from other poor children, and these differences lead to a systematic

underestimate of the impact of early-life health and circumstances on later-life health and social

status.

          That said, we find parents’ socioeconomic status, cohort members’ heights, and reports of

their childhood health are all predictive of entry grade and promotion to higher grade in

Whitehall. Even with controls for entry grade or current grade we find that cohort members’

educational qualifications, their economic and health status as children, mother’s education and

care-giving, and parents’ illness predict health status in middle age and older age. Given that the

Whitehall II sample is composed of individuals who were selected into white collar jobs at

 Virtanen et al. (2009) note that “participants in the Whitehall II study are almost exclusively white-collar civil
servants” (page 597). Similarly, Singh-Manoux et al. (2004) refer to the Whitehall II cohort as “white collar
employees” (page 1073).

Whitehall, we shall show that our estimates provide a lower bound on the impact of early-life

health and circumstances on later life health and socioeconomic status for the population as a

whole.

         Entry grade and current occupational grade at Whitehall are significantly related to self-

assessed health in later years of the Study. However, their significance is eliminated by the

addition of controls for members’ future occupational grades, suggesting that occupational grade

may be more of a marker of poorer health than a cause of poorer health. We examine this further

by estimating fixed effect models and first-difference models of health status and occupational

grade, where we quantify the extent to which change in health status predicts change in civil

service grade, and the extent to which change in civil service grade predicts change in health

status. We find no evidence of civil service grade affecting future self-assessed health. In

contrast, we find robust evidence of self-assessed health affecting future civil service grade.

         We begin with an introduction to the Whitehall II data and a comparison of the Whitehall

II cohort to two nationally representative British birth cohorts – the National Child Development

Study of 1958 (NCDS) and the British Cohort Study of 1970 (BCS). Section 3 presents estimates

of the effect of family background and own-health in childhood on placement at Whitehall, and

promotion to higher grades. Section 4 investigates the impact of civil service grade and family

background on self-assessed health in later phases of Whitehall II, before turning to fixed effect

and first difference estimates of the impact of civil service grade on self-assessed health, and the

impact of health on civil service grade.



1. The Whitehall II Study


                                                  3
Since its inception in 1985, the Whitehall II Study has followed a cohort of British civil servants,

10308 men and women who, at the beginning of the study, were aged 35 to 55 and employed in

20 London-based white collar civil service departments. The Study currently allows researchers

to request data from the first six waves (phases) of data collection on health, mental health,

working conditions, and health-related behaviors. Phases 1 (1985-88), 3 (1991-94) and 5 (1997-

99) had both a self-administered questionnaire and a medical examination, and phases 2 (1989-

90), 4 (1995-96) and 6 (2001) had mail-in questionnaires. At different phases, cohort members

were also asked retrospective questions about their childhoods. (An introduction to these data,

and a link to a comprehensive list of Whitehall II publications, is available at

http://www.ucl.ac.uk/whitehallII. A description of the variables we use, and the phases from

which they are drawn, is presented in Appendix Table 1.)

       Summary statistics about this cohort are presented in Table 1, together with information

about the two birth cohorts we will use in comparison. The NCDS has followed all children born

in England, Scotland and Wales in the week of March 3, 1958 from birth through to middle-age.

In a similar fashion, the BCS has been following all individuals living in Great Britain born in

the week of April 5, 1970.

       Comparison between the Whitehall II cohort and the British birth cohorts is complicated

by the fact that employment class in the Whitehall II study is categorized by civil service grade,

which is based on salary, while employment class in the birth cohort studies is based on the

British Registrar General’s occupation classifications. In describing the Whitehall II data,

Marmot et al. (1991) write:

    On the basis of salary the civil service identifies twelve non-industrial grades which, in
    order of decreasing salary, comprise seven "unified grades", and senior executive

                                                  4
    officer (SEO), higher executive officer (HEO), executive officer (EO), clerical officer,
    and clerical assistant. Other professional and technical staff are assigned by the civil
    service to one of these grades on the basis of salary. For analysis, we have combined
    unified grades 1-6 into one group and the bottom two clerical grades into another, thus
    producing six categories. (page 1388)

The Whitehall II team then combines these six categories to create three grades, which they use

in most of their analyses: unified grades 1-6 and unified grade 7 define the (highest)

“Administrative” grade; the SEO, HEO, and EO define the (second-highest) “Professional and

Executive” grade; and the clerical category (which they note includes a small number of office-

support staff) defines the “Clerical/Office Support” grade.

       Although these civil service grades do not align with the British Registrar General’s

occupation scale, it is clear that all but a handful of Whitehall II cohort members would be

classified in the Registrar General’s top three occupational categories: professional occupations

(Class I); managerial and lower professional occupations (Class II); and skilled non-manual

occupations (Class III-N). (The example often used to characterize skilled non-manual

occupations is “office workers.”) In belonging to one of the top three occupational classes, the

Whitehall II cohort is different from the population at large. Approximately a third of NCDS and

BCS cohort members, for example, report that they are employed in the lower three occupational

classes (skilled manual (Class III-M), semi-skilled (Class IV) or unskilled (Class V)).

       The distribution of fathers’ occupational status in the Whitehall II study is also

significantly different from the distributions in the NCDS and BCS, despite the fact that fathers’

occupation status is defined the same way across the studies. There has been a shift toward

higher status occupations in the UK, which can be seen in the difference in reports of fathers’

status between the 1958 and 1970 cohorts. Seventy three percent of fathers were reported to be in


                                                 5
the lowest three classes in the 1958 cohort – true for 62 percent of the 1970 cohort. However, in

the Whitehall cohort, which contains individuals who are older than members of either of these

birth cohorts, only 45 percent of fathers were reported in the lowest three classes. As the

Whitehall II team notes, although the fathers of cohort members are disproportionately drawn

from upper classes, there are still many fathers from lower status occupations (Marmot et al.

2001, page 305). In Section 2 we argue that the absolute number of fathers from lower status

occupations is less important than the fact that, in order to be selected for a position at Whitehall,

cohort members whose fathers come from lower status occupations must have had higher draws

on unobservable variables that influence occupational grade and, potentially, health outcomes.

We set out a simple model to demonstrate the effect of selection into Whitehall, and we use the

British birth cohorts to investigate the empirical importance of the concentration of the Whitehall

II cohort into the top three occupational grades. We present evidence that selection is likely to

affect the impact we estimate for father’s social class.


2. Selection into Whitehall and estimation of the impact of childhood conditions

Selection into white collar positions at Whitehall will depend on an individual’s characteristics

that are observable to researchers, C , and characteristics that make a person a more attractive

candidate, but which are not observable to researchers, u . Observable characteristics may

include measures of family background, such as father’s social class, and childhood health. A

person is offered a white collar position in the civil service if the probability that the weighted

bundle of his or her characteristics W * passes some threshold which, without loss of generality,

we set to zero. The probability of employment in a white collar position in Whitehall (W = 1)

can be written
                                                  6
(1)     pr (W = 1) = pr (W * > 0) = pr (α ' C + u > 0) .



Among individuals employed at Whitehall in white collar jobs, we would expect a negative

correlation between observable characteristics C and unobservables u . An individual with poor

observable characteristics would only land a position at Whitehall if his or her unobservable

characteristics were especially strong, strong enough that (α ' C + u > 0). Other outcomes of

interest for an individual, y , such as health in adulthood, also depend on an individual’s

characteristics, a subset of which may be the same variables that helped to determine

employment status at Whitehall, C , and unobservable characteristics, ε , where ε = θ u + v :



(2)     y = γ ' X + β 'C + θu + v .



Correlation in the unobservable variables that determine outcomes in (2) and selection into

Whitehall in (1) will lead the ordinary least squares estimates of the impact of C in equation (2)

to be inconsistent. Ignoring for ease of exposition the other determinants of individuals’

outcomes, we can write the probability limit of our OLS estimate of β as



                                      −1
                          ⎡ C 'C ⎤              ⎡ C 'ε ⎤
(3)    plim βˆ = β + plim ⎢                plim ⎢
                          ⎣ n ⎥⎦                ⎣ n ⎥⎦




                                                           7
Selection into Whitehall induces negative correlation between observables C and unobservables

u in the Whitehall II cohort. Positive correlation between unobservables in the selection

                                                                        C 'ε
equation and those for other outcomes of interest would lead the plim        to be negative, which
                                                                         n

would lead in turn to an underestimate of the impact of individual characteristics and family

background on outcomes in adulthood.

       With data from two nationally representative birth cohorts, we can test whether

truncation by occupational status leads to a significantly lower estimate of the impact of family

background. Table 2 presents results of OLS regressions in which cohort members’ adult height

is regressed on indicators for father’s occupational status, with the benchmark (omitted category)

being that for unskilled work. For the NCDS and BCS cohorts, we control for whether cohort

members were white, and male. For the Whitehall II cohort members, we control in addition for

age and age squared.

       The NCDS and the BCS allow us to run regressions for the whole cohort, and for the

cohort restricted to the three highest occupational classes, which are the classes to which almost

all of the Whitehall II cohort belong. When we use the full samples, we find that cohort members

with fathers whose positions were of higher status are taller in adulthood. Relative to cohort

members whose fathers were unskilled in the BCS, members whose fathers were in the highest

class are on average 1.8 centimeters taller (3.3 centimeters taller in the NCDS).

       Turning to the subsample of birth cohort members working in the top three occupational

classes, we find that the coefficients for father’s occupational grade are smaller than those for the

cohort as a whole. This is true for both the BCS and the NCDS. When we restrict the BCS

sample to cohort members who report that they work in the top three classes, we find that
                                                 8
coefficients for father’s class become smaller and, for almost all grades, insignificantly different

from zero. However, the indicators for father’s occupational class continue to be jointly

significant, and their joint significance is not much different from that estimated for the

Whitehall II sample. For the NCDS, when we use the restricted sample we find that the

coefficients on the indicators for fathers’ social class are jointly significant and often individually

significant. However, they are uniformly smaller than the coefficients obtained with the full

sample. For both the BCS and the NCDS, we present chi-square tests of the hypothesis that the

coefficients for the indicators of fathers’ social class are identical across the full and restricted

samples. For the BCS, the hypothesis of equal coefficients cannot be rejected. This is not

surprising, given the large standard errors that are obtained using the restricted sample. For the

NCDS, the hypothesis that the coefficients are equal can be rejected.

        Table 3 presents results for educational attainment in the NCDS birth cohort and the

Whitehall II cohort. (Educational categories for the BCS cohort were quite different from the

other two surveys, and so we restrict our attention in Table 3 to the NCDS and Whitehall II

cohorts.) The NCDS asked cohort members in Stage 5 about their highest educational

qualification at age 23. Whitehall II, in phase 5, asked cohort members about their level of

academic qualification when they first left full-time education. The answers are scored in a

similar fashion in the two surveys. In Whitehall II, these are ranked from “no qualification”

(equal to 1), “school certificate” (2), matriculation (3), “O levels” (4) through to “masters degree

or higher” (8). We run ordered probit regressions for the two cohorts, since these academic

qualifications can be ordered, but the progression from one qualification to the next cannot be

easily quantified.


                                                   9
       For the full NCDS cohort, we find a highly significant set of coefficients for father’s

social class, with a monotonic increase in cohort member’s educational attainment by father’s

occupational status. Moving from the full NCDS cohort to that reporting that their own

occupational status is in the top 3 classes dampens the coefficients on father’s occupational

status, and renders them similar to those observed for the Whitehall II cohort. We reject the

hypothesis that the coefficients in the unrestricted and restricted NCDS samples are identical. For

the Whitehall II cohort and for the NCDS cohort under the restriction of own-occupation being

in one of the top three grades, father’s occupational status remains a strong predictor of

educational qualification.

       To provide a sense of whether restricting analysis to the top three occupational classes

makes a significant difference to results measuring the impact of father’s occupational status, we

run regressions of height, self-assessed health, and educational qualifications on a linear measure

of father’s occupational status, with higher status occupations given a higher number (6 = father

was of professional status, 1= father was an unskilled laborer). The top panel of Table 4 presents

results for the BCS and NCDS samples as a whole, and tests whether father’s status has a

significantly different effect for these cohorts than it does for the Whitehall II cohort. Height in

adulthood, and educational qualification are as discussed above. Self-assessed health in the

Whitehall II study was asked using a five point scale (excellent, very good, good, fair and poor),

while the birth cohort studies used four point scales (excellent, good, fair and poor). For

Whitehall II, we combine “excellent” and “very good” and compare reports of health between

the highest category and reports of “good, fair, or poor” health using an indicator variable.




                                                 10
       Consistent with the estimates presented in Tables 2 and 3 we find, for all three outcomes,

that cohort members whose fathers were in higher status occupations report significantly better

outcomes: cohort members whose fathers were of higher status are taller, they report better

health, and their educational qualifications are higher.

       The panels of Table 4 allow us to test whether the Whitehall II estimates are different

from those of the NCDS and the BCS. For all three outcomes, we find in panel 1 that father’s

social class has a significantly larger effect in the BCS and the NCDS than is true for the

Whitehall II cohort. However, when we restrict the sample to BCS and NCDS cohort members

in professional, managerial and skilled,non-manual classes, we find no significant difference

between the impact of father’s status in the birth cohorts and in Whitehall II. We conclude from

this that the selection into white collar positions in Whitehall diminishes the estimated impact of

family background.

       The problem identified here – that analyses based on a select group may not provide

unbiased information for the population as a whole – affects many more analyses than just those

based on the Whitehall data. For example, Davey Smith et al. (1998) use longitudinal data on a

sample of adults originally selected from 27 workplaces in the west of Scotland to examine the

relative importance of education and adult occupational (social) class as determinants of

mortality. To investigate this issue, they stratify their data on occupational status, and measure

the strength of the relationships between education and mortality. They also stratify their data on

education, and measure the strength of the relationships between occupational status and

mortality. They observe “the … association between social class and all cause mortality remains

strong within education strata, whereas within social class strata the relation between education


                                                 11
and mortality is less clear” (page 153). From this they conclude that although both education and

social class are important determinants of morbidity and mortality, “occupational class is more

strongly associated with overall … mortality than is the education measure” (page 158). In turn,

this evidence is cited by Singh-Manoux et al. (2004) that “research clearly shows adult measures

of SEP [socioeconomic position] to be more powerful predictors of health than SEP measures

from earlier in the life course” (page 1073).

       For reasons outlined above, however, because this analysis does not account for selection

into occupational status, the estimated associations between education and health within social

strata will be biased toward zero and the estimated associations between occupational status and

health within education strata will be biased away from zero. That is, for school leavers at age

16 (say), those who are stronger on dimensions not measured in our data will be selected into

higher classes and will be healthier, so that an analysis of the association between occupational

class and health within an educational stratum will overestimate the association between class

and health. Within an occupational class, for those with lower educational attainment to reach

any given occupational stratum, they must have been strong in dimensions that are not measured

in our data. This will lead to an underestimate of the association between education and health.

       Bearing this in mind, we turn next to examine the association between childhood

background and economic wellbeing in adulthood, measured using initial occupational grade and

promotion at Whitehall II.



3. The economic consequences of childhood health and circumstance




                                                12
We begin by investigating the extent to which family background is associated with cohort

members’ first occupational grade in Whitehall, and promotion to a higher grade over time.

Several elements of family background may be associated with initial grade assignment,

including father’s social class; the cohort member’s report on whether his or her family owned a

car when the member was less than 16; reports on whether the cohort member spent 4 or more

weeks in the hospital when less than 16; and the member’s adult height. Together with father’s

social class, car ownership gives us a window onto the cohort member’s socioeconomic status in

childhood. Reports on hospitalization tell us something about health in childhood, as does the

member’s height. 5

           That height is associated with cohort members’ initial placement at Whitehall can be

seen in Figure 1, which presents non-parametric regression results of initial grade (1=clerical,

2=professional/executive, 3=administrative) regressed on height, separately for men and women.

Women are more likely to start in a lower grade than are men, but throughout the distribution of

women’s heights, we find a linear positive relationship between height and initial placement. For

men, the relationship is positive up to heights of approximately 180 centimeters (the 75th

percentile of height for men). The slopes for women and men (through 180 centimeters for men)

are remarkably similar. We examine this association further in Table 5.

           Columns 1 and 3 of Table 5 present OLS regression results on the association between

family and cohort member’s characteristics and initial placement at Whitehall. Column 1 reports

results without educational qualifications included as controls. Results in column 3 include

indicators of academic qualifications. Father’s occupational status is strongly correlated with a

cohort member’s starting grade. Members whose fathers were in the highest occupational class

were on average almost half an occupational grade (0.425) higher at entry than were cohort

members whose fathers were unskilled laborers (the omitted occupational category). There is a

monotonic relationship between father’s occupational class and starting grade. Jointly, these

variables are significant (F-test= 27.4, p-value=0.000). Coming from a family that owned a car

also predicts higher entry grade, while reporting that one spent more than 4 weeks in the hospital

as a child predicts lower entry grade. These two background variables are also jointly significant

(F-test=14.6, p-value=0.000).

       Much of the association between family background and initial placement appears to

work through educational attainment. Column 3 of Table 5 adds a complete set of indicators for

highest academic qualification when first leaving full-time education. Jointly, these variables are

highly significant in the initial placement regression (F-test=150.7, p-value=0.000), and their

inclusion reduces the estimated association between entry grade and father’s occupational class,

and between entry grade and other childhood variables. We know from Table 3 that father’s

occupational class is highly correlated with a cohort member’s educational qualification.

Spending time in the hospital as a child is negatively associated with educational attainment,

while car ownership is positively associated with educational qualification. Even with controls

for educational attainment, height continues to predict grade at entry.

       We present the regression coefficients on our education qualification variables in Figure

2. Additional qualifications strongly predict higher entry grade into Whitehall, with those

entering with a Bachelor’s degree on average reporting more than 0.6 grades higher than those




                                                14
entering with no academic qualifications (the benchmark group), and those with a Master’s

degree or PhD reporting more than 0.8 grades higher.

           The second set of regressions in Table 5 investigates the relationship between reporting

promotion to a higher grade at Whitehall, and family and individual characteristics. We define

promotion as a member reporting a higher occupational grade the last time this member is

observed than the grade he or she reported as their starting grade. Each cohort member appears

once in these regressions, even if he or she had more than one promotion. Column 2 reports

results without educational qualifications added as controls, and column 4 with indicators of

academic qualifications included. We restrict the sample here to individuals who entered

Whitehall at a grade lower than the top grade (it is rare for people to be demoted at Whitehall),

and we control for starting grade (allowing a level difference in the probability of moving from a

‘clerical’ to a ‘professional’ grade from that of moving from a ‘professional’ to an

‘administrative’ grade). 6

           We also include a control for self-assessed health in phase 1 of the Study. Specifically,

we include an indicator that the individual reports they were “moderately” or “very” satisfied

with their health at phase 1 (true for two-thirds of respondents). These respondents are

significantly more likely to report promotion. Three variables that are associated with health –

self-assessment of health at the beginning of the Study, an individual’s height, and his or her

report of having spent time in the hospital as a child – are all significantly associated with

promotion at Whitehall. This is true with or without controls for educational attainment.




6
    Results that do not include controls for entry grade are very similar to those presented in columns 2 and 4.
                                                            15
       Figure 3 examines whether height matters for promotion throughout the distribution, or is

only important for especially short or especially tall cohort members. We find for both men and

women, throughout the distribution of heights, an additional centimeter of height is associated

with an increased probability of promotion.

       Father’s occupational status is highly associated with grade promotion. This effect

appears to work through cohort members’ educational attainment. The impact of education on

the probability of promotion is presented in Figure 4, where regression coefficients are presented

for educational qualifications relative to no academic qualification (the benchmark group).

Members with a Bachelor’s degree are fifty percent more likely to report a promotion than are

those who lack educational qualifications. Those with a Master’s or PhD are nearly sixty percent

more likely to report promotion.

       Results in Table 5 demonstrate that, even in this sample of white collar workers,

childhood socioeconomic status, measured using father’s occupational status, and family car

ownership during childhood, are strongly associated with entry grade and with promotion. Their

effects appear to work through the impact that they have on cohort members’ education, which is

strongly associated with both initial grade and promotion. Results in Table 5 also demonstrate

that childhood health, as measured using height and reports of hospitalization before age 16, also

affects entry grade and promotion in Whitehall. Part of the impact of childhood health on entry

grade appears to work through education, However, childhood health appears to have effects on

promotion independent of educational attainment, and even controlling for satisfaction with

health at phase 1.




                                                16
        Childhood health and circumstances not only put Whitehall white collar workers at

different grades initially, but also lead to a widening in earnings gaps over time: those who were

healthy in childhood, and those from higher SES backgrounds are significantly more likely to be

promoted. We turn next to see whether the long reach of childhood extends to health in

adulthood, before turning to the timing of changes in health and changes in adult socioeconomic

status, as measured by employment grade.



4. Childhood circumstances and adult health

Cohort members were asked to assess their health in phase 3 (1991-1994), phase 4 (1995-1996),

phase 5 (1997-1999) and phase 6 (2001). Specifically, they were to answer “in general would

you say your health is … excellent, very good, good, fair or poor.” A poor self-report of health is

a powerful predictor of mortality, even when controlling for physician assessed health status and

health-related behaviors. Poor self-reports of health are also a significant predictor of future

changes in functioning among the elderly. 7 We code self-assessed health so that a higher number

corresponds to better self-reported health (1=poor, 5=excellent). In phase 3, 12 percent of

respondents reported their health was ‘excellent;’ 36 percent ‘very good;’ 40 percent ‘good;’ 10

percent ‘fair;’ and 1 percent ‘poor.’ We run ordered probit regressions to examine the

associations between childhood circumstances, economic status in adulthood, and self-assessed

health. The results presented are robust to estimating the models using ordinary least squares,

using an indicator that health is reported to be ‘excellent’ or ‘very good’ as the dependent

variable.

 Idler and Kasl (1995) and Bowling (2005) provide extensive references on studies that have employed self reported
health status.
                                                       17
         Table 6 presents results on the correlates of self-assessed health, including measures of

occupational status at different points in time, cohort members’ heights, an indicator for whether

the member reports having spent more than 4 weeks in the hospital as a child; and an indicator

for whether the member reports the family owned a car when he or she was less than 16. Case

and Paxson (2001) find that mother’s characteristics are associated with health-related behaviors,

and for this reason we include controls for members’ reports that their mothers gave them ‘a

great deal of time’ when growing up, and controls for mothers’ school leaving age and that age

squared. We include members’ reports that a parent suffered from high blood pressure, stroke,

angina, and diabetes. We continue to include a complete set of indicators for highest academic

qualification when first leaving full-time education, and members’ ethnicity, sex, age and age

squared. For ease of exposition, Table 6 displays only some of the ordered probit coefficients,

and at the bottom of the table we show chi-square test statistics for the joint significance of

subsets of coefficients.

         Table 6 shows that self-assessed health is strongly related to occupational status at

Whitehall. Column 1 shows that cohort members’ initial grades are significantly related to their

current health. In addition, even with a control for starting grade, conditions of childhood are

significantly associated with self-assessed health. Children who report having spent time in the

hospital as a child are 7 percentage points less likely to report ‘excellent’ or ‘very good’ health.

Mother’s variables, parental illness, and academic qualifications are all strongly associated with

cohort members’ health. 8

 Similar results on the importance of education are presented by Smith (2007), who finds education critical to future
health outcomes in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
                                                         18
       To examine whether childhood circumstances may act through their effects on promotion

in Whitehall, we include current grade at Whitehall in our ordered probit regression in column 2.

Current grade is strongly related to current health status, and its inclusion eliminates the

association between starting grade and health status. Moving up one grade is associated with a 7

percentage point increase in the probability of reporting excellent or very good health. However,

its inclusion does little to dampen the impact of childhood circumstances on current health:

coefficients change little, and the subsets continue to be highly jointly significant.

       These results lead us back to the stubborn question of whether occupational grade is high

because health is good, or whether health is good because occupational grade is high. Results in

Table 5 suggest that promotion is related to health: promotion is predicted by better health in

phase 1; by not reporting childhood hospitalizations; and by adult height. To get some purchase

on this question, we add to our probit regressions measures of future occupational status.

Specifically, column 3 adds occupational grade at the next phase of the Study. Future grade is

highly and significantly correlated with current health, and its inclusion eliminates the

association between current grade and health status. These results hold whether we include grade

at the next phase of Whitehall (column 3), or the phase after that (column 4). It is difficult to

make a case for future grade having a direct effect on current health. One might anticipate not

being eligible for promotion, and this may lead to poorer health today, but it seems unlikely that

one will anticipate equally well promotion in the next 3 year (occupational grade next phase)

and in the next 6 years (occupational grade two phases into the future). An alternative

explanation is that those in better health today are more likely to be promoted between the phases

of the study.


                                                 19
       We pursue this by estimating fixed effect regression models for health status (H) and civil

service grade (G) for cohort member i observed at time t of the form:

(4)     H it = γ 1 ' Gi ,t −1 + γ 2 ' Gi ,t − 2 + β ' ait + α i + ε i ,t

and

(5)     Git = θ1 ' H i ,t −1 + θ 2 ' H i ,t − 2 + λ ' ait + δ i + ui ,t .

Equation (4) regresses an indicator that the cohort member currently reports ‘excellent’ or ‘very

good’ health on lags of civil service grade, age a at time t , and individual fixed effects, while

equation (5) regresses current civil service grade on lags in health status (indicators of reporting

‘excellent’ or ‘very good’ health), age at time t , and individual fixed effects. Fixed effects will

absorb aspects about individuals’ backgrounds that may determine both health status and

economic status in adulthood, such as parents’ educations, occupations and health status; health

and economic status in childhood; and educational attainment.

       We present fixed effect results for health status in the first two columns of Table 7, and

those for civil service grade in columns 4 and 5. We find no evidence that lagged civil service

grade affects health status. The coefficients on lagged civil service grade are small and

insignificantly different from zero. In contrast, cohort members who report ‘excellent’ or ‘very

good’ health are significantly more likely to be promoted.

       Fixed effect estimation requires the stringent assumption that all explanatory variables

are strictly exogenous, an assumption that is unlikely to be true for our model of health and

occupational status. For this reason, we also estimate equations (4) and (5) using first difference

models of the form:

(6)     H it − H i ,t −1 = γ 2 '(Gi ,t − 2 − Gi ,t −3 ) + β '( ait − ai ,t −1 ) + (ε i ,t − ε i ,t −1 )

                                                                        20
and

(7)     Git − Gi ,t −1 = θ 2 '( H i ,t − 2 − H i ,t −3 ) + λ '( ait − ai ,t −1 ) + (ui ,t − ui ,t −1 ) .

Here, we rely only on the second lag of employment grade (for equation 6) and health status (for

equation 7), to minimize the odds that these right side variables are correlated with the first-

differenced error term. Our first-difference results are very similar to our fixed effect estimates.

We find no effect of civil service grade on future health. However, consistent with the results

presented in Tables 5 and 6, we find a significant effect of health on future civil service grade.



5. Conclusions

The results in this paper highlight three important issues for research on health and economic

status over the life-course. The first finding is cautionary: samples of individuals who have been

selected into certain occupational groups are not adequate to draw inference about the effects of

childhood circumstance on adult outcomes for the population as a whole. Whitehall II is a

remarkable study that has generated important insights about the evolution of health in

adulthood. However, it is important to keep in mind that the Study is not representative of the

population. Instead, it consists of people who entered white collar jobs in the British civil service

in London. Our results from the NCDS and BCS indicate that, as theory predicts, the estimated

effects of childhood factors on adult health and economic outcomes are biased toward zero when

samples are restricted to include only individuals from higher-status occupations. We find that

results based on selected samples of higher-occupation individuals from the NCDS and BCS are

very similar to those based on the Whitehall II data. Our estimates suggest that the effects of




                                                                       21
childhood circumstances on adult outcomes for the population at large are larger than those

indicated by Whitehall II results.

       Our second major finding is that, despite the downward biases that are likely to result

from selection into Whitehall II, we still find evidence that health in childhood influences

occupational status in adulthood. Adults who had better childhood health—as measured by adult

height and hospitalizations in childhood—start at higher grades in the civil service, and are

promoted to higher grades after they enter the civil service. The association between height and

occupational status in adulthood is robust to controls for education, implying that childhood

health does not operate solely through its effects on educational attainment.

       Finally, we present evidence that changes in self-assessed health are related to future

changes in employment grade, and that changes in employment grade are not related to changes

in future health. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the strong correlation

between health and employment grade reflects the effects of health on success in the workplace.

It should be noted that this finding, although striking, is based on only one measure of health—

self-assessed health status. Although self-assessed health status is highly predictive of future

mortality and is strongly correlated with a range of health conditions, different results may be

obtained using different measures of health. In the future, it would be useful to examine whether

similar results are obtained when different measures of health, such as cardiovascular disease or

depression, are used in place of self-assessed health.

These estimates are coefficients from a regression of promotion to a higher grade at Whitehall
between the first and last time each cohort member was observed. The regression includes a
complete set of indicators for educational qualification, father’s occupational class, an indicator
that the cohort member reports his or her family had a car when he/she was less that 16, an
indicator that the cohort member reports being in the hospital for 4 or more weeks when he/she
was less than 16, report of being “moderately” or “very” satisfied with their health at phase 1,
adult height, initial grade at Whitehall, and controls for race, sex, age and age squared at phase 1.
The sample is restricted to those cohort members who initially reported clerical or
professional/executive grades. (Those who entered in the top grade cannot be promoted.)

regressions include indicators for ethnicity and sex. Whitehall II regressions also include controls
for age and age squared at phase 1. In all regressions, the benchmark for father’s social class is
unskilled. The chi-square tests for equality of coefficients test the null hypothesis that the coefficients
on the father’s class indicators are equal across columns 1 and 2 (BCS) and across columns 3 and 4
(NCDS).

Notes. Ordered probit regression coefficients reported, with standard errors presented in
parentheses. All regressions include indicators for ethnicity and sex. Whitehall II regressions also
include controls for age and age squared at phase 1. The NCDS asked about the highest
qualification a cohort member had obtained by age 23. The Whitehall II asked about the level of
qualification when the individual first left full-time education. In all regressions, the benchmark
for father’s social class is unskilled. The chi-square test for equality of coefficients tests the null
hypothesis that the coefficients on the father’s class indicators are equal across columns 1 and 2.

Notes. Height regressions and self-assessed health status regressions present OLS coefficients, with standard errors in parentheses. Educational
attainment regressions present ordererd probit coefficients with standard errors in parenthesis. In all regressions, father’s social class is entered
linearly (6=professional; 5=managerial; 4= skilled, non-manual; 3= skilled, manual; 2=semi-skilled; 1=unskilled). Self-assessed health is reported
at age 30 in the BCS, age 42 in the NCDS, and is reported between phases 3 and 6 for the Whitehall II data. Whitehall II health is an indicator of
“Excellent or very good health” on a five-point scale. NCDS and BCS health is an indicator of “Excellent” health on a 4-point scale.
All regressions include indicators for ethnicity and sex. Whitehall II regressions also include controls for age and age squared. Whitehall II
regressions for self-assessed health also include indicators for the phase in which the response was given, and cluster the standard errors by
individual.

Notes. Ordered probit regression coefficients are presented, with standard errors in parentheses.
Standard errors are clustered at the individual level. All regressions include controls for
ethnicity, sex, age and age squared; a complete set of educational qualification indicators;
members’ reports that their family had a car when less than 16; mother’s school-leaving age and
school-leaving age squared; and indicators for members’ reports that either parent had had high
blood pressure, diabetes, angina and stroke. Civil service grades are recorded: 1= clerical or
office support; 2=professional or executive; 3= administrative.
