                      Economic Well—being and Child Labor: The

                                        ABSTRACT


         How did industrialization in the nineteenth century affect the well-

    being of children among American working class families? Two revealing

    surveys from 1890 and 1907 are used to examine the implications of child

    labor on schooling decisions and on possible offsetting intrafamily transfers,

    in the form of current "retained" earnings or future asset transfers. Both

    issues are analyzed within the context of a formal model of family labor

    supply, in which returns to schooling accrue after the youth has left the

    household and thus the interests of the parents and the child need not

    coincide. Parents working in the industries examined did not, it appears,

    compensate their children for the reduced future earnings implied by child

    labor, in either the current or in future time periods. But, in addition,

    the migration of families in which parental altruism was weak may have

    eliminated much of the apparent increase in family income due to higher

    child earnings. We end with a note reconciling our findings with the long

    term trend away from child labor.

1.0. Introduction

      The process of industrialization altered radically the types of work

activities demanded of the labor force. As Marx noted in the quotation

above, industries developed in which sheer physical strength was relatively

less valuable and nimbleness and dexterity relatively more productive than

in the agricultural economy within which industrialization occurred. As a

result the ratios of the wages of young people and of females of all ages

to that of adult males rose substantially in the transition from agri-

culture to industry       (Coldin and Sokoloff, 1980). The increase in the

demand for female and teenage labor had important social consequences that

have been intensively studied since the time of Marx. In this paper we

explore both theoretically and empirically the effect of this increased

demand on the well—being of the family, particularly of the young, and on

intra—family relations.

      The two data sets we employ for this study are derived from surveys

undertaken in the U.S. around 1900. Both surveys were bases for seminal

studies of working—class or industrial families, living mainly (although
                                  —2—

not ho11y) in nonurban areas. Our empirical analysis therefore should

be useful in understanding the impact of industrialization on iptrafamily

relations during much of the nineteenth century, when industry evolved out-

side the large commercial centers.

      In the early stages of mechanization in the U.S., the percentage of

the industrial labor force that was young and/or female was extremely high,

but it began a secular decline as early as 1840 (Goldin and Sokoloff, 1980).

By 1900 the simple generalization proposed by Marx, that mechanization en-

hanced the usefulness of child labor, is not completely supported by evi-

dence for the U.S. A cross—state analysis of 1900 Census of Population data

indicates that the labor force participation rate of males 10 to 15 years

old was not significantly higher in the manufacturing and mining sectors

than in agriculture, although the rate for females 10 to 15 years was higher

in manufacturing.1 Certain industries, for example textiles, boots and

shoes, paper,. and clothing, did employ substantially more young labor, par-

ticularly female labor, than did others, such as iron and steel and mining.

      The data in Table 1 make clear that the location of working—class

families in 1890 was a prime determinant of the employment of their chil-

dren. The likelihood that a boy of age 11 to 13 would be in the labor

force if the father was in textiles was just over 40 percent; if the father's

industrial employment was not in textiles, only 11 percent,   For females,

the likelihood that a daughter of a textile worker was in the labor force

rose from 34.5 percent for those 11 to 13 to 97.7 percent for those 16—17,

the rise for daughters from nontextile families only from 1.4 percent to

21.8 percent. These dramatic differences are not simply a reflection of

differences in parental income. Even among textile families with father's

earnings above the mean for textile workers (approximately $400 , 1890$),

almost two—thirds (64.2 percent) of the young women 16—17 worked.

     What were the consequences for the family and for the young of this

"opportunity" for child labor that the textile industry offered? The ef-

fect on current family income was substantial. Average earnings E child

were approximately $50 per year higher for males 14 to 17 in textiles than

elsewhere (Table 2, columns 1 and 2); average adult male earnings in the

sample were only slightly more than $500 per year. For females 14 to 17,

the difference in earnings was more than $100 per year between sectors.

      The cost to family members of the increased child earnings, however,

was also real. Schooling was the principal alternative time use for chil-

dren. Among males 11 to 13, those in textile families were only half as

likely to be attending school as those in nontextile families, 41.3 per-

cent and 75.6 percent respectively (see below, Table 4). The same wide

disparity existed for female offspring.    The likelihood that a

daughter 11—13 was in school was 48.8 percent in textile families, 86.3

percent in nontextile.families. This attenuated schooling must surely •have

reduced the future.earning capacity of the children of textile workers.

      Section 2.0 develops more formally a model of faEiily labor supply

with emphasis on the schooling—work decision of children and young adults.

In Section 3.0 industry effects on the future economic well—being of off-

spring in the U.S. at the turn of the century are estimated. In particular

the implications of child labor for schooling and subsequent earnings are

more carefully assessed. Since the returns to schooling accrue largely

after the youth has left the household, the interests of the parents (the

presumed decision—makers) and the interests of the young are not necessarily

identical.2 Interests coincide only to the extent parents perceive the

    future wealth of their offspring as an increase in their own well—being.

    Parental altruism therefore is obviously critical.

            The possibility of offsetting intra—family physical asset transfers

    for the reduced earnings capacity of those with less schooling is also con-

    sidered, since parents may have compensated children for reduced schooling

    with larger physical wealth transfers. Such does not appear to be the

    case.     The results indicate that parents working in industrial

    sectors where the demand for child labor was high did not compensate their

    children for the reduced schooling and future earnings capacity implied by

    the child labor. Any compensation to the child apparently caine from the

    additional current consumption that the family as a whole may have enjoyed.

            We also show that the increased earnings of the children need not even be

    translated into an equivalent increase in family consumption if parental

    altruism is weak. Competition among families in the labor market may have

    eliminated much of the apparent increase in family income due to higher

    child earnings. Many manufacturing centers in nineteenth century America

    were oriented around a single industry because of natural resource require-

    ments (e.g. water power, coal, iron ore). The geographical isolation of

    these industries made labor supply mainly a product of family migration.

    If enough parents were unconcerned about the sacrificed future earnings of

    their offspring, the equilibrium wage of a father in textiles would be lower

    dollar for dollar for each dollar of earnings of their working children.

    But to the extent that reduced schooling and implicitly reduced future in—

•   come of the child were valued by the parents, equilibrium adult wages would

    not fall dollar for dollar with the earnings gained by increased child labor.

            En Section 4.0 we explore this interaction between child labor oppor-

    tunities and adult (male) wages to determine the extent to which adult wages
                                   —7—

were reduced by the potential for child labor. The brief conclusion,

Section 5.0, reviews and interprets our findings in light of the remark-

able expansion in educational attainment during the second decade of this

century.

      The principal data source we have used in this paper is derived from

the Sixth and Seventh Annu4p2Ltsof the Commissioner of Labor, namely

Carroll Wright, a pioneer in modern labor statistics. This detailed survey

of 6,800 industrial families in 1889—90 was undertaken to provide infor-

mation for the McKinley Tariff of l890. But it was also the first exten-

sive national survey of family budgets, a precurser to our modern cost of

living surveys. We will refer to this report as the Wright 1890 Stu4y. A

second data source has been employed which gives information on the fraction

of earnings working children retained for their own use.   It is the exten—

sive 19 Volume Senate Report on the Condition of Woman and Child Wage

Earners conducted in 1907 and will be referred to as the 1907 Report.



2.0. Child Labor and Child Economic Well—being:
      A Model

      The evidence presented in the introduction, on the unusually high em—

ployment of child labor in the textile industry and the correspondingly low

level of schooling attainment, raises the issue posed by Marx and others;

Was child well—being reduced by industrialization? Certainly no theorem on

the operation of the market system guarantees that technological advances

will improve the economic well—being of all groups, particularly the young.

The market "guarantees" little to children whose well—being is principally

dependent on the altruism of the parents. As discussed at length in

Eshikawa (1915) and Parsons (1977), the dependence of child well—being on

parental altruism is particularly important in the child labor decision
                                   —8—

since the principal cost of child labor is the foregone schooling and future

(adult) income of the child. The mortality of the parents and, more im-

portantly, the absence of enforceable long run human service contracts

make the evaluation of the long run benefits of schooling critically de-

pendent on the altruism (or lack thereof) of the parents. The current earn-

ings of the child are, within limits, the parents to allocate; the child's

future earnings are not.

      Child labor need not imply a complete absence of parental concern nor

need it reflect family economic desparation. Even a wealth maximizing in-

dividual (or purely altruistic parent) will be sensitive to current as well

as future income prospects. The higher the wage rate of children, ceteris

paribus, the less valuable (net) is a given schooling investment. Rational

parents who intend to transfer wealth to their offspring will presumably

transfer wealth to the child in human investment form until the returns de-

cline to the level of the rate of return on physical assets. Beyond that

point, all transfers will be in the form of physical assets.4 A rise in

current child earning power may therefore only signal that it is optimal to

reallocate intergenerational transfers from human to physical.form.

      A simple model will illustrate the family decision process and will

provide the basis for the discussion of the family labor market in Section

4.O. Imagine a parent—child world in which the parent has complete au-

thority to allocate resources, including the child's time. Assume moreover

that the parent's utility (U) is a function of current family consumption

and future child wealth, to be concrete the geometric mean with weights

a and $ respectively,

                                               —9--


        The parent must make two interdependent decisions:                     (1) choose the

amount of total family earning capacity to allocate to current family

consumption and to future child wealth, and (2) choose the composition of

transfers to the child, consisting of both schooling and physical assets.

Pantily income in the current period will be the sum of parent and child

earnings or

the schooling elasticity of earnings.

        The parental decision problem, then, is to choose levels of current

consumption (C), physical transfers to the child (T), and schooling (S)

        If physical transfers to the youth ate positive, so that equation

(8) holds as an equality, then it is easy to derive the behavioral func-

tion for schooling from equations (7) and' (8), since these reduce to the

simple wealth maximizing rule that schooling will be undertaken until the

increment in future earnings is just offset by the foregone current earn-

ings (,ySY1 w0). Therefore

where the asterisk denotes the optimizing level of S. Optimal schooling

increases with -y, the elasticity of earnings with respect to schooling,

and decreases with w0, current wage levels. Total family income affects

total child future wealth, but not schooling levels when optimal physical

transfers are positive. The optimal schooling is undertaken and the re-

mainder transferred in physical asset form.

        In the simple utility function assumed here, the optimal family

consumption and child wealth levels can be derived as follows:

Clearly F is total family wealth, including the future earnings of the

child. Family consumption and child wealth increase proportionately with

F, where the proportions are ci/(ct +           )   and /(cc +   ) respectively.   The

elasticity of parental utility with respect to child wealth (e)               could be

considered a measure of parental altruism.

        Physical transfers (T) are the residual of child wealth less human

capital transfers (S*'), or

Clearly if family wealth (F) or family altruism (13) are sufficiently low,

the total transfers that the parents choose to make to the child are less

than the child's future earnings alone.               Since we assume that parents cannot capture
                                    —12—

the child's future earnings (or borrow on them), they can increase cur-

rent family tonsuinption only by having the child work more (undertake less

schooling) than a simple wealth maximizing rule would indicate. In this

In    this constrained environment, optimal schooling will increase linearly

with earnings of the male head (E) and decline with the child's wage (w0).

        In the next section we explore these family decisions empirically.

In particular we estimate the effect of child labor on schooling and on

subsequent earnings capacity and then attempt to determine the extent to

which this reduction in future earnings is offset by physical asset trans-

fers to the child made possible by the family's higher current earnings.



3.0. The Future Well—being of Children:
      Empirical Estimates

        The future wealth position of one's offspring will depend on two

types of transfers, earning capacity (schooling and other forms of skill

acquisition) and physical assets (gifts and bequests). In this section

we explore the effect of child labor on these two types of transfers to

the child in the U.S. around 1900. In Section 3.1 we consider the effect

of child labor on schooling attainment and on future earnings. Sections

3.21 and 3.22 explore the issue of whether working children are compen-

sated within the family by gifts (principally "retained" earnings) and by

bequests later in life, controlling for parental income.

3.1. Child Schooling and Future Earnings

     Most children of industrial workers in the Wright 1890 Study were

engaged either in work or in school by the age of eleven (see Table 3).

Thus it is almost definitional that child labor reduced the amount of

schooling and perhaps the ultimate earning capacity of the child. The

data on the fraction in school by age in Table 3 are indirect estimates

obtained by regressing the number of children per family in school on the

age—sex composition of the family, since the observation units are the

family and not the individual members.9 The probability that a male child

11—13 was in school, 0.60, is the coefficient of number of male children

11—13 in a "number of children in school" regression. The sum of the

estimated work and schooling probabilities is tolerably close to one,

even for females, which makes us confident in the results from this pro-

cedure. Furthermore, the schooling probabilities for industries other

than textiles (see Table 4) are strikingly similar to those for youths in

the entire U.S. in 1890.

      Schooling probability estimates by industry (textile, nontextile)

are reported in Table 4. The frequency of child labor among textile

families is clearly reflected in the probability that a child of a given age

was in school. The probability that a male child between the ages of 11

and 13 would be in school was 41.3 percent in textile families and 75.6

percent in nontextile industrial families. By 14 to 15, only 13.1 percent

of male youtlEin textiles were in school, while 36.5 percent of males of.

this age were in school in nontextile industries. The differentials in

schooling attendance are even larger for females in these age intervals.

        Separating the sample by father's income less than or equal to $400

(1890$) and greater than $400 (Table 4, columns 3—6)J1    reveals   that both

industry and parental income had powerful effects on the likelihood that

the child was in school. Among low wage families in textiles 27.7 percent

of males 11—13 were in school, in nontextiles 50.5 percent. Among high

wage families, the corresponding percentages are 72.2 percent and 84.3 per-

cent.

        A more precise estimate of the industry effects on median schooling,

controlling for father's income, can be obtained by estimating separately

(by industry) the number of children in school per family, including inter-

action terms between father's earnings and the sex—age composition of the

household. Ordinary least squares estimates are reported in Table 5. It

is clear that father's earnings strongly and significantly increased the

likelihood that a child of either sex was in school at any particular age.

        With these estimates (Table 5), it is possible to compute the indus-

try effect on median schooling or, more precisely, to estimate the median

age of schooling departure, controlling for differences in income. Using

male offspring of textile workers as an exacuple, the estimates in Table 5,

column 2 give the probability that a male child will be in school as:


15)     Prob(male in school;textiles) = 0.689 — 0.044 Age
                                        + 0.00049 Father's Earnings.

Substituting mean father's earnings in the full sample ($517.68) into the

equation, permits us to calculate the age at which the probability of being

in school is 0.5, namely 10.1 years of age. Similar calculations can be

made for females and for children of both sexes in nontextile families.

These are reported in Table 6. The median age of school departure is 3.1

     Most estimates of the pecuniary return to education (e.g. Becker,

1975, Hansen, 1963) pertain to a relatively modern period in the evolution

of the American economy, but .many have asserted that returns to education

were even higher at the turn of this century than at its midpoint. The in-

dividuals we have been analyzing lived just prior to a great watershed in

schooling attainment in the U.S.; median years schooling increased by over

one—third during the brief period from about 1915 to 1930.12 This rapid

expansion of more educated workers is reflected in the substantial drop in

the skilled to unskilled wage ratio throughout the first half of this

century and particularly during the period of most rapid advance in edu-

cational attainment.13

      Education clearly augmented mean earnings for individuals

of the schooling vintage we have been analyzing. This was true, if less

pronounced even for females. The 1907 Report, briefly described in Section

1.0, contains information on months schooling and literacy for young,
                                        —19—

unmarried female workers. Log earnings equation (16) indicates that

schooling increased earnings for females about 2 percent per year around

the mean, controlling for experience, age, and region. Equation (17)

shows that literacy, by itself, augmented earnings by over 13 percent.

      Although education may have enhanced a young woman's home produc-

tivity and may have led to a more lucrative marriage, the eventual penalty

from reduced schooling was probably not as great as it was for a young

man, whose labor force experience continued far beyond his unmarried

yearsJ4 The penalty of not continuing schooling to high school for young

men at this time must have been on the order of 10 to 15 percent of their

future yearly earnings.



3.20. Physical Wealth Transfers to Offspring

       The question obviously arises whether the reduced schooling for

children of textile workers reflected a shift in the composition of asset
                                  —20—

transfers to the offspring rather than a reduction in total asset trans-

fers. Parents may simply have been optimally reallocating between human

and physical capital in response to higher youth earning prospects. In

this section we explore the effect of child labor on parental gifts and

      Among the most important of parental gifts was the amount of earn-

ings the child was permitted to retain for its own use.15 Although it

would be preferable to have data on actual consumption, such data do not

exist and would in any event be difficult to measure since there were

many public goods within the household. The concept of "retained earn-

ings" was frequently used in budget studies during this time period, and

although its definition is clear there is some ambiguity in its inter-

pretation. Retained earnings was that part of earnings a child kept for

its own discretionary use. It is not known, however, the degree to

which it substituted for in—kind transfers. Thus families that allowed

their working children no retained earnings may have compensated them

with goods such as clothing. It is our reading of secular trends in the

data and of the literature that in—kind transfers were poor substitutes

for retained earnings and that retained earnings are a good measure of

wealth transfers to a child while it labored for payJ6

      Two unique data sets collected in 1907 as part of extensive Senate

hearings into the conditions of female and child labor permit us to ex-

plore retained earnings and its determinants. One set of data consists

of information on individual unmarried working women living at home with

their parents and gives •data on earnings, retained earnings, and age,
                                  —21—

but not, unfortunately, any information on the youth's household. A

second data set consists of information about the families of working

children of both sexes in textiles and the clothing industry. The second

set of data contains a figure for retained earnings by all children in

the family over 15 years old, but no information on retained earnings by

individual child. Thus the first set of data will enable the study of

retained earnings by age for females and the second the determinants of

retained earnings by family and individual characteristicsJ7

      Age profiles of weekly earnings and of the percentage of daughters

who retained some earnings from the first data set are reported in Figure

1. Weekly earnings (the dotted lines) rise continuously to age 30, from

approximately $4 (1907$) per week at age 15 to $8—9 per week at age 30.

Average earnings are somewhat higher for daughters who retained positive

earnings. Of greater interest, the percentage of daughters who retained

some earnings never exceeded 50 percent. The percentage approached 50

percent only when the young women were in. their late twenties. At age

21, the percentage was closer to 15 percent. The average percentage of

earnings that were retained by those who retained any earnings at all was

substantial, 51.7 percent, and was relatively invariant with Thspect to

ageJ8 Of weekly earnings of roughly $7, approximately SO cents was re-

tained by the average 21 year old working daughter ($7 x .5 x .15 =   $0.53),
that is, 7.5 percent of her earnings, although an average of $3.62 was

retained by those for whom retained earnings was positive.

      These data have two deficiencies in terms of providing empirical

content for our model: they deal only with females and they do not have

information on the youth's household, and therefore cannot be used to

measure the impact of father's income, number of siblings, and other

variables. A related data set for 1907 does contain information on the

faintly characteristics of children working in the clothing and cotton

textiles industries as well as information on the value of earnings re-

tained by all children over 15 years in each family. We have estimated

the following relationship over all households having a child older than

15 years:

        The model of Section 2.0 has suggested the importance and the signs

of most of these variables, particularly CII?, the earnings of children,

and POP?, the earnings of the father. The presence of younger siblings

should be equivalent in effect to a decrease in family income; the pres-

ence of older siblings may reduce RET by decreasing the bargaining

strength of other adolescents. The ownership of a home might indicate

more public goods or an environment that would be fairly expensive for a

youth to duplicate in the housing market. and thus it should decrease RET.
                                 — 25—


How the presence or absence of the mother affects RET is an interesting

empirical question.

      Because RET can take on a zero value, and does with considerable

frequency (in 77.5 percent of the families), estimation of equation (18)

was performed using a TOBIT procedure. The results are given in Table 7.

There are two ways of interpreting the coefficients and related elas-

ticities from this estimation, and this issue is related to that raised

above on the meaning of retained earnings. It is possible that RET might

not have been reported by families that rewarded children with in—kind

transfers rather than with cash. If this were the case, interest should

center on the coefficients and the elasticities of the index (I), that is

on the values conditional on RET >   0.   However, if zero values are indeed

meaningful, as we believe they are, the elasticity of the expected value

of RET, E(Y), would be of interest.19

      Increases in father's income increase RET, and for E(Y) the elas-

ticity of POP? is 0.184. The change in E(Y) is considerably larger for

changes in CHY than it is for changes in POP?, and the amount of earnings

retained by these children rose considerably with increases in their

earnings.20 The coefficient on the child's earnings is 0.62, greater

than the value of 0.52 obtained from the previous sample restricted to

females. Because the data analyzed here are for both males and females,

this indicates that males must have retained a greater percentage of

their income. Younger siblings reduced RET, and so did older ones, but

not with statistical significance. The ownership of a home substantially

reduced RET, as one might expect if children "paid" for the amenity value

of such ownership.21 Finally, the presence of a mother had a profoundly

philanthropic affect on her children.

      Therefore although children retained a greater percentage of their

earnings as their earnings rose and as their parents' earnings rose, the

fraction who received such transfers and the amounts they received were

small relative to the earnings that were implicitly foregone in the

process.



3.2. Family Assets (Potential Bequests)

      That on average such a small fraction of earnings was retained by

these children may have reflected more the timing than the nature of the

asset transfer to the child. It is possible, for example, that the family

simply held the child's earning in trust and intended to bestow the assets

on the child at a later time, perhaps through bequests.

      The Wright 1890 Study provides evidence on the likelihood that such

a process occurred. Although the survey did not secure estimates of net

family assets (assets minus liabilities), it did include a question con-

cerning the household's financial status, whether it was "in debt," held

a "surplus," or had "accounts balance."22 A probit analysis of the like-

lihood that the household held a surplus can indicate whether the savings

rate out of child income was indeed higher than that out of other family

income sources.

      The probit estimates are reported in Table 8. Family income was

divided into •three components: father's earnings, children's earnings,

and other income.23 All three had powerful positive impacts on the like-

lihood that a family reported positive net family assets. But of more

interest from the current perspective is that the estimated coefficient on

children's earnings is less, not more, than the coefficient on father's

earnings. The hypothesis that children's incomewas simply accumulated by

the ,arents for later transmission to the offspring is not supported in

this sample. Future wealth was apparently lower for children who worked.



4.0. Child Labor and the Wages of Adults

      The heavy demand for child labor in the textile industry apparently

induced a major reallocation of family resources from the future wealth

of the offspring to the family's current consumption. As discussed in

Section 1.0, these gains to current family income were apparently sub-

stantial. In the wright 1890 Study the average family in textiles re-

ported $173 (1890$) per year in child earnings, the average family in non—

textiles only $51 or $122 less. By comparison the average earnings of

the male household head in the sample was $518. The differential child

earnings corresponded to one quarter of the male head's earnings, clearly

suggesting a major difference in current family economic well—being.

      This higher current family income may have been illusory. The U.S.,

even at the turn of this century, was primarily agricultural and the in-

dustrial work force had to be attracted largely from the agriculture

sector. The attractiveness of job offers would involve the family's as-

sessment of various characteristics of the location, including the father's
                                           24
earnings and the possibility of child work.

      To the extent families viewed the gain in child labor income as a

simple increase in family income, it i likely they would have migrated

to areas where the demand for child labor was plentiful. Such migration

would have put downward pressure on adult wage rates in industries with

high child labor demands. Such a downward adjustment in adult wages is

consistent, for instance, with the earnings of unskilled labor in the

Wright 1890 Study. In textiles, child earnings per family averaged $199,
                                   —30—

in nontextiles, $57. The annual earnings of the father, however, were

$293 in textiles and $447 in nontextile industries, (The endogeneity of the

labor force participation of children will be accounted for in the em-

pirical analysis below..)

      IndeS if parents felt no concern for the future well—being of their

offspring, family incomes from all sources would presumably have been

equalized dollar for dollar in the long run. Any gain in family income

due to child labor opportunities would have been completely offset by a

lower wage to the household head. If, however, parental concern for the

child's future welfare were more substantial, the father's earnings would

have dropped less in industries with a high potential for child labor.

The future earnings reductions of the child would partly or totally off-

set the gain in child earnings in the evaluation of the family's compen-

sation bundle.

      The process suggested can be formalized using the model developed in

Section 2.0. To attract labor to an industrial location, the firms in the

industry must offer a compensation package equal to or exceeding that of

other firms in the economy. The labor market establishes an equilibrium

compensation level (say V in utility units) and the industry must offer a

rate of adult wages and child labor opportunities that permit the family

to achieve that level. Presumably the equilibrium compensation package

offered workers depends on their skill, age, and other "quality" attributes
                             25
so equilibrium requires

Assuming   a fixed child wage rate (w0), variations tn child earniocs will

        The extent of adult earnings reductions, then, reduces to an em—
pirical issue. Lcnation(22)would sugaest escinating an adult earnings
function dependent on child earnings and the arguments in V, namely, skill,
age, regional wage levels. etc. Since the child work constraint may not
be binding,     particularly for high income families, it is not reasonable
tc treat child work (and therefore earnings) as exogenous. In particular,
the earnings of the father may influence child work hours and earnings.
Thined sincle evidence of such an effect was nresented in Section 3.0.

      It is necessary, therefore, to. estimate a simultaneous model of

father's    earnings CE) and children earnings (E0) of the form
      E=
                ffE0, skill, age, regional wage levels, demographic structure
                      of children].

      E0
                       wage levels, industry].

Estimates of a linear approximation to this model are presented in Table

9. The simultaneous structure was estimated using two stage least

squares.

      The most interesting coefficient from our viewpoint is the estimate

of the effect of child earnings on father's earnings, —0.714. Controlling

for skill, age, regional wage levels, and nativity, we find a powerfully

significant negative impact of children's earnings on adult wages. Indeed

the annual earnings of the male household head was reduced $0.71 for every

$1.00 increase in children's earnings. Apparently the greater part of the

family's current income gains from child work was offset by the reduced

earnings of the father. From a behavioral perspective, it would appear that

the family did not require a substantial increase in total family earnings

to sacrifice a reasonably large amount of schooling opportunity for their

children.

      Briefly reviewing the other estimated coefficients, adult male wages

do increase appreciably with skill level (particularly in the highly craft—

oriented glass industry). Industrial wages are also powerfully correlated

with the labor income of agricultural workers in the state of residence;

Adult earnings reduce children's work effort as well as the reverse (column

2). Children's earnings are also influenced by wage levels in the state,

but much less so than adult wages are. The textile effect is strongest for

female offspring and young (age 11—15) males.

5.0 Conclusion

     The structure of industry and the social relationships among family

members have had powerful interactive effects. In the U.S. at the turn of

this century not only did child labor have an almost definitional, negative

effect on schooling, but in addition families provided little in the way

of physical asset transfers (gifts or bequests) to compensate children for

the lost schooling and future earnings. Thus the presence of industries

with a high demand for child labor reduced the future wealth position of

the offspring. The increased family income was apparently absorbed in higher

current family consumption.

     But even that economic gain was largely offset by the effect of child

labor possibilities on adult wage rates. Any lack of concern by parents

for lost schooling and future earnings of their children would, in equil-

ibrium, be reflected in lower adult earnings, as families migrated to areas

where child labor was prevalent. If enough parents were totally uncaring,

families would continue to migrate to regions of high child labor until their

own wages were forced down precisely to offset the higher earnings of their

children. The estimates presented show that in the U.S. in 1890 each

$1.00 increase in "child" earnings reduced the earnings of the male head of

the household by $0.71, implying a willingness of some parents to "sell" the

future income of their offspring for current consumption.

     We have concentrated on aspects of intrafamily relations among working

class families in the late nineteenth century. Yet, how do our results

illuminate change over time in child labor, schooling, and retained earnings?

Long term trends in all three suggest that parents exhibited substantial con-

cern for the present and future well-being of their offspring. Our results do
                                        -36-




yield positive income elasticities for both schooling and retained earnings.

But    our sample   contains only working class families ,and had we one including

families   not employed in these industries the impact of income would have
been greater and     more   applicable to long run analysis. More importantly,     we

believe, many changes       over time cannot be encompassed in cross sectional
analysis. Industries which were previously in the hinterland,        became part

of    urban America, as electrification diffused.     And as industrial families

left    their rural heritages and   became   urbanized, the perceived costs and
benefits    of schooling may have been radically altered. Furthermore, increases

in the skilled-unskilled wage ratio and the rise of the non-domestic service

sector encouraged parents to keep their children in school longer, as did

the legal incentives of school attendance laws. Alternatively the substantial

increase    in schooling over time may have been the result of simple good
fortune, that most advanced industrial technologies place little value on
the unskilled labor of children.

        2Economic implications of the lack of identity of interests between

parents and children have been developed in Ishikawa (1975), Parsons

(1975, 1977), and Blinder (1976).

        3Families in several other industrial countries were also included

in the sample but were excluded from the current analysis. Michael Haines

kindly provided us with the data set. It should be noted that the families

were not a random sample. See Ilaines (1979) Chapter 5 for a more detailed

discussion of it.

        4Schooling investment models of this form are discussed in Becker

(1967), Ishikawa (1975), Parsons (1975), and Blinder (1976).

     5lmplicit in this model is the assumption that parents have authority

over minor children and can, in fact, direct their activities and secure

for their own use as much or as little of the child's earnings as they

feel is appropriate. We believe this captures the essence of the child

labor process. Among young adults living in the household of origin, a

more explicit exchange system might be appropriate. See, for example,

Homey and McElroy (1978) and Manser and Brown (1980) for applications of

bargaining models to family processes. We raise some of these issues in

Goldin and Parsons (1980) in relation to the age at which children exit

from the household.

     6One might assume that consumption within the household is distributed

in fixed proportions among family members; a higher living standard for

the parents implies a higher living standard for others in the household

as well. We ignore leisure in this model.

     7Data from the 1907 Report indicate that transfers from unmarried

young women to their parents drop of f considerably once they leave home

but continue to work.

     8The child wealth and wage/schooling relationships are treated (im-

plicitly) by substitution although they obviously could be treated sym-

metrically with the family income constraint. The potential upper bound

on schooling time in the parental household (H > 5) is ignored here, an

internal solution is assumed.

in school and the age and sex composition of the family, with the sex of

the children reported only for those eleven years of age or older.

        2The cohort of women born from 1893 to 1902 reported,when they were

45—54 years old,that they completed 8.8 years of schooling, but the cohort

born between 1908 to 1917 reported ,when they were 45—54 years old,that they

completed 12.0 years. The data for women are 8.6 and 11.3 years schooling

respectively. The source used is Series P—20 Current Population Reports,

        150bviously children also consume goods and services in the household.

This is true of children who do not work, however, as well as those who

do. We know of no evidence that suggests that working children consume

a relatively greater share of family expenditures on goods and services

than do nonworking children (for given total family expenditures and

family size and composition).

     16Although some percentage of children who live at home with their

parents continue to work for pay, the income they regularly give over to

their parents seems to have declined considerably since the early twen-

tieth century. Women's Bureau Report No. 183 (1940),which surveyed Cleve-

land, indicated that only 32.8 percent of all daughters under 21 years

living at home and working gave their parents all their earnings. For

those 21 years old to under 30, the percentage was only 18.1. Thus there

was a substantial decrease in the contributions of children to the family

from 1907 to 1940.

Age2 has an R2 =   0.003.

     19The difference between the two slopes is the Probability (Y>0X.'s).

That is, E(Y)/BX. =    .Prob(Y>0X.'s),    while aI/ax =


     20The   elasticity of retained earnings with respect to earnings (for
RET > 0)   was about 1 in the sample of working females, that is the per-
centage retained was independent of earnings. The difference in the two

samples with respect to this elasticity results from the characteristics

of the children each includes. Observations in the sample of Table 7

are for all children over 15 years old in a family. Thus even though one

child retained earnings, all may not have.

     21We are avoiding the issue of bequests here. Children may have ac-

cepted less current wealth in the form of retained earnings to avoid con-

flict where the expected value of a bequest was large.

     22The response rate to this question was less than one half that for

questions on family income and other family characteristics. The results

should, therefore, be viewed with correspondingly greater caution.

     23The analysis also includes various demographic characteristics of

the family, including age of the father and age and sec of the children.

     24For recent work on the economics of family migration see the work

by Sandell (1977) and Mincer (1978).

     251n this discussion we assume that incomes are sufficiently low that

all transfers to the child are in the form of schooling (T =   0).
