We provide the first analysis of the relationship between economic conditions and the use of
illicit drugs other than marijuana. Drawing on US data from 2002-2013, we find mixed evidence
with regard to the cyclicality of illicit drug use. However, there is strong evidence that economic
downturns lead to increases in substance use disorders involving hallucinogens and prescription
pain relievers. These effects are robust to a variety of specification choices and are concentrated
among prime-age white males with low educational attainment. We conclude that the returns to
spending on the treatment of substance use disorders are particularly high during economic
downturns.

1. Introduction

        The United States has recently experienced surges in the prevalence of

certain illicit drugs other than marijuana (henceforth illicit drugs), in particular the

non-medical use of prescription pain relievers and heroin. From 2001-2013, there

was a three-fold increase in overdose deaths involving prescription pain relievers

and a five-fold increase in overdose deaths involving heroin (NIDA 2015).

Although some observers have attributed these trends, at least in part, to the Great

Recession (Farrell 2009; Bernstein et al. 2014; Seelye 2014; Douthat 2015;

Mencimer 2015), research on this issue has been hindered by a lack of credible

data on illicit drug use at the state-year level. Instead, researchers have focused

on how economic conditions affect alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use,

information on which is more readily available.

        The current study examines the relationship between economic conditions

and the use of illicit drugs such as analgesics (i.e., prescription pain relievers),

cocaine, and heroin. Our data source is the National Surveys on Drug Use and

Health (NSDUH), which are used to produce the primary estimates of substance

use and misuse in the United States (Muhuri et al. 2013).             Every year, the

NSDUH surveys almost 70,000 residents of the United States about their drug

consumption and other health behaviors (Morton et al. 2013). Pooling NSDUH

data from the years 2002-2013, we obtain a sample composed of over 800,000

respondents, which is critical for studying illicit drugs with very low rates of use.




                                           1
Because the NSDUH questionnaire contains items specifically designed to

measure the symptoms of substance use disorder, we are able to study the effects

of economic conditions on a variety of clinically relevant outcomes related to

substance use disorders, which have been linked to premature mortality from HIV

and hepatitis infections, overdoses, suicide, and traffic fatalities (Degenhardt and

Hall 2012). 1 The NSDUH data also span the Great Recession of 2007-2008,

allowing us to explore how one of the most severe economic downturns in the

past century influenced the use and abuse of illicit drugs.

         Documenting the relationship between economic conditions and the use of

illicit drugs is important for several reasons. First, theory does not provide clear

predictions with regard to how macroeconomic fluctuations relate to substance

use (Arkes 2011), and the results of previous studies have been mixed (Pabilonia

2014, Tekin et al. 2013). Second, public funding for drug treatment programs is

often at risk of being cut when state and local governments are faced with budget

shortfalls (Richman 2009; Dresser 2015; Keilman 2015; McNamara 2015).

Accurately predicting the consequences of such cuts requires a better

understanding of how economic conditions relate to substance use and abuse. 2


1
  The NSDUH items designed to measure substance use disorder are described below and are
based on the criteria contained in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM-4).
2
  Accurately predicting the consequences of funding cuts to drug treatment programs also depends
upon knowing something about the effectiveness of these programs. Several well-designed
studies have concluded that treatment in both outpatient and residential programs leads to
substantial and long-lasting reductions in substance use (Hubbard et al. 1997; Simpson et al. 1999;
Gossop et al. 2003; Hser et al. 2004). Swensen (2015) uses county level information on substance




                                                2
Third, there is evidence that deaths from accidental poisoning, or drug overdoses,

have become strongly countercyclical since the early 1980s (Ruhm 2015). Ruhm

(2015) argued that increased access to opioid analgesics coupled with recession-

induced mental health problems is likely responsible for this phenomenon, but

because of lack of data could not explore its causes. Below, we estimate the

relationship between economic conditions and the use of prescription pain

relievers such as OxyContin and Percocet, providing the first direct support for

Ruhm’s argument.

        Using standard difference-in-differences models, we find that economic

downturns are associated with statistically significant increases in the use of

ecstasy and reductions in LSD use. Estimates of the relationship between state

economic conditions and use of drugs other than ecstasy or LSD are generally

inconclusive. Examining outcomes based on more clinically relevant measures of

substance use disorder, we find clear evidence that disorders involving analgesics

and hallucinogens are strongly countercyclical, substantial in terms of magnitude,

and concentrated among non-elderly adult white males with low educational

attainment. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that economic

downturns lead to increases in the use and abuse of illicit drugs and suggest that

the returns to state and local government spending to treat substance abuse

disorders are particularly high during economic downturns.

        The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides a

brief literature review, and section 3 describes the data and outlines the empirical

approach. Section 4 presents the results, and Section 5 discusses and concludes.



2. Literature Review

        Our work builds upon a voluminous literature on how health behaviors

and health outcomes vary with economic conditions; we provide only a very brief

review here, as this work has been summarized elsewhere (Ruhm 2012, Cawley

and Ruhm 2012). Since Ruhm’s (2000) study showing that mortality in the

United States was strongly procyclical, researchers have extended this basic result

in several directions. For example, researchers have documented procyclical

mortality in other countries (Lin 2009; Gertdham and Ruhm 2006; Tapa Granado

2005) and have explored changes in the relationship between economic conditions

and mortality over time (Ruhm 2015). To examine mechanisms, researchers have

estimated the effects of macroeconomic conditions on health insurance coverage

(Cawley and Simon 2005; Cawley et al. 2015) and healthcare quality (Stevens et

al. 2015, forthcoming).         Researchers have also examined how risky health

behaviors such as poor diet and nutrition choices respond to macroeconomic

fluctuations (Colman and Dave 2014, forthcoming).




reduce drug-induced mortality rates.




                                           4
       A large number of studies have examined how alcohol consumption varies

with the macroeconomy, including methodologically sophisticated studies that

control for both time and geography-specific fixed effects. These studies identify

the effects of economic conditions by within-area (typically state) changes in the

unemployment rate. The broad pattern that emerges from pre-Great Recession

business cycles is that heavy drinkers consume less during economic downturns

while light drinkers consume more (see Dee 2001, Ruhm 1995, Ruhm and Black

2002, and others; for a recent review see Pacula 2011), although there are some

exceptions (Davalos et al. 2012).

       Several recent studies have studied the relationship between economic

conditions and alcohol consumption using data from the Great Recession.

Drawing upon data Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data,

Bor et al. (2013) found that there was an increase in abstention from drinking

coupled with an increase in binge drinking during the period 2008-2009. Tekin et

al. (2013) also found evidence that binge drinking increased during the Great

Recession using BRFSS data, although they argued the effect was trivial in terms

of magnitude (that is, they argued that the actual incidence of binge drinking did

not increase by an economically significant amount). Finally, recent work by

Cotti et al. (2015, forthcoming) using household scanner data found that, among




                                        5
households with any alcohol purchases, demand for packaged alcohol was

significantly procyclical during the Great Recession. 3

        There have been far fewer studies examining the relationship between

economic conditions and illicit drug use, mainly due to the lack of data. In fact,

we are aware of only three studies that have examined this relationship using U.S.

data, all of which focused on youths and none of which examined specific illicit

drugs other than marijuana. 4 Pabilonia (2014) analyzed YRBS data on 15-17

year-olds for the period 2003-2011. She found little evidence of a relationship

between economic conditions and marijuana use among white respondents,

although there was a significant countercylical relationship among black males.

Arkes (2007, 2011) examined drug use among youths and young adults using data

from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth 1997 (NLSY97). Controlling

for unobserved heterogeneity at the state level, he found that the use of marijuana

and illicit drugs among teenagers was strongly countercyclical. Among 20-24

year-olds, marijuana use appeared to be countercyclical, but the relationship

between economic conditions and illicit drugs was much weaker (Arkes 2011).



3
  At least two studies have focused on the relationship between economic conditions and youth
drinking. Using Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data for the period 1991-2011, Argys et al.
(2014) found that drinking participation and binge drinking both increased during economic
downturns. In contrast, Pabilonia (2014) did not find evidence of counter cyclicality for drinking
among 15-17 year-olds using YRBS data for a shorter period (2003-2011).
4
  We are only aware of one study that has examined economic conditions and drug use using non-
U.S. data. Chalmers and Ritter (2011) focused on alcohol and cannabis use in Australia from
1991-2007. These authors found that economic downturns were positively related to the number
of youths who used cannabis as well as their frequency of use.




                                                6
         Data limitations did not permit Arkes to separately identify specific illicit

drugs, and the relevant question in the NLSY also explicitly excludes use of drugs

prescribed by physicians, which is of particular interest to public health officials

in light of the increase in prescription drug misuse. 5 As we will show below: 1)

the relationship between economic conditions and substance use differs markedly

across drug types; 2) the use of some drugs (e.g., LSD) is procyclical while use of

others is countercyclical (e.g., ecstasy), suggesting that an aggregate ‘any illicit

drug’ outcome could mask important relationships; and 3) there is a strong

relationship between economic conditions and prescription pain relievers that

likely would not be included in the NLSY measure. These patterns – along with

our disorder outcomes described in detail below – highlight the unique value of

the NSDUH data.

         To summarize, while there are numerous well-designed studies that

evaluate the effects of economic conditions on alcohol consumption among both

adults and youths, there are only three studies that have examined population rates

of illicit drug use, all of which focused on teenagers or young adults and only one

of which used data spanning the Great Recession. 6 None of the prior work on

  Specifically, individuals are asked: “Excluding cannabis and alcohol, since the date of the last
interview, have you used any drugs like cocaine or crack or heroin, or any other substance not
prescribed by a doctor, in order to get high or achieve an altered state?”
6
  Maclean et al. (2013) used data from the Treatment Episodes Data Set (TEDS) for the period
1992-2010 to examine the relationship between economic conditions and admissions to specialty
substance abuse treatment facilities for alcohol and illicit drugs. They found that both alcohol and
drug treatment admissions declined during economic downturns, but could not rule out the
possibility that “reductions in (substance abuse) treatment supply mechanically lower admissions”

illicit drugs examines substance use disorder as based on professionally-

developed diagnostic criteria 7, an outcome that is more clinically relevant than

simple participation. Our study fills these gaps by using NSDUH data to provide

the first comprehensive evidence on the relationship between economic

conditions and the use of specific illicit drugs, and by providing the first estimates

of the relationship between economic conditions and substance use disorders.



3. Data Description and Empirical Approach

        As noted above, our primary data source is the National Survey on Drug

Use and Health (NSDUH); we use restricted versions from 2002-2013. 8                         The

federal government uses these data for determining drug use prevalence in the

United States. The NSDUH is a survey of individuals in non-institutional settings

and was designed to be representative at the state level.

        NSDUH respondents are asked a series of questions about their use of

tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and illicit drugs, including prescription painkillers.

Specifically, NSDUH respondents are asked: “Now think about the past 12

months, from [DATEFILL] through today. We want to know how many days


(p. 14). Substance abuse treatment use may respond differentially than that of other healthcare
because income effects, which appear to dominate general healthcare utilization decisions during
downturns, may be more than offset by true need for substance abuse treatment (i.e., psychological
stress related to downturns can lead individuals to misuse substances).
7
  Davalos et al. (2012) examine alcohol use and/or dependence (using the DSM-4 criteria) with
data from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol Related Conditions
(NESARC). They find that higher state unemployment rates are significantly related to increased
likelihood of alcohol abuse and/or dependence.




                                                8
you've used {drug} during the past 12 months.” 9 Based on answers to these

questions, NSDUH statisticians create participation indicators, which are defined

as equal to one if the respondent reported any past year use of the relevant

substance and equal to zero otherwise. The survey also identifies whether the

substance use occurred in the past month, and we create associated indicators for

more recent use accordingly.

          We examine several outcomes reflecting different groupings of drugs

based on well-accepted classifications. For alcohol and marijuana, we measure

any past month and past year use of each substance. For illicit drugs, we first

consider a broad participation indicator equal to one if a respondent reported

taking any drug other than alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana in the prior year

(including prescription painkillers), which we call ‘Any Illicit Drug Use’. We

then separate illicit drugs into 7 mutually exclusive categories: cocaine (including

crack);      other   stimulants    (including       methamphetamine);     analgesics    (i.e.,

prescription pain relievers); heroin; sedatives and tranquilizers; hallucinogens;

and inhalants. Table 1 reports mean participation by these 7 categories.

          Stimulants are drugs such as cocaine and ‘meth’ that stimulate or

accelerate the central nervous system. Analgesics are drugs used to relieve pain,

and sedatives/tranquilizers are drugs with a sedating effect on the central nervous

    NSDUH underwent a major redesign between 2001 and 2002; earlier waves are not comparable.




                                                9
system. 10 Within the category of analgesics we consider oxycontin separately.

Hallucinogens are drugs that produce hallucinations when taken; so-called “club

drugs” such as Special K, LSD, and ecstasy fall into this category.                     Within

hallucinogens we separately consider LSD, PCP, and ecstasy. Inhalants comprise

a broad class of substances such as gases, solvents, aerosols, and nitrites that

produce mind-altering effects and share a common route of administration (i.e.,

breathing them in); there are no subcategories for inhalants or heroin.

        In addition to recent use, which is the focus of most prior research, a major

strength of the NSDUH is that it also asks respondents a series of questions about

abuse and dependence of various substances (alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin,

hallucinogens, inhalants, pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives)

over the past year. These include the following problems related to use of the

substance: 1) hazardous use; 2) social/interpersonal problems related to use; 3)

neglected major roles to use; 4) withdrawal (not defined for cannabis, inhalants,

or hallucinogens); 4) tolerance; 5) used larger amounts/longer; 6) repeated

attempts to quit/control use; 7) great deal of time spent using or in associated

activities; 8) physical/psychological problems related to use; and 9) activities


9
   Many drugs have multiple ‘street names’; the survey instrument uses these alternate names in
attempting to measure drug use prevalence. Although all of the drug use outcomes are self-
reported, these data have been validated by other research (SAMHSA 2012).
10
   The wording of the NSDUH questionnaire does not allow us to distinguish the use of opioid
analgesics from the use of non-opioid analgesics such as Fioricet and Fiorinal. However, NSDUH
respondents are asked to identify which prescription drug they have ever used. The use of non-
opioid prescription pain relievers appears to be at extremely lows levels: only 0.14 and 0.11
percent of respondents indicate any lifetime use of Fioricet and Fiorinal (respectively) in 2013.




                                               10
given up to use. A recent substantive update to the Diagnostic and Statistical

Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) no longer differentiates between abuse and

dependence, but instead adopts a substance use disorder rubric that combines

elements of each and places the disorder on a severity continuum (Hasin et al.

2013).    While future NSDUH questionnaires will have DSM-5 criteria for a

revised set of questions as part of a larger redesign of the survey, only DSM-4

criteria are currently available. To reflect the new understanding that substance

use disorder is not separable into abuse and dependence, but should be viewed on

a continuum, we use the DSM-4 diagnostic criteria that overlap with the DSM-5

criteria for questions asked during the period 2002-2013 to calculate a substance

use disorder estimate that attempts to be consistent with the current DSM-5

algorithm 11.

         Specifically, we define an individual as having a substance use disorder if

the respondent reported fulfilling two or more criteria of the DSM-4. In addition,

we follow DSM-5 classification scheme by separately examining mild substance

use disorder (2 or 3 criteria), moderate substance use disorder (4 or 5 criteria), and

severe substance use disorder (6 or more criteria). Although slightly different

from the DSM-5 measure, these measures anticipate the DSM-5 changes allowing


11
   The DSM-4 and DSM-5 share nearly all substance disorder criteria. Notably, the DSM-5
classification removes a ‘legal problems’ criterion and adds a ‘craving’ criterion. The major
change between the versions is how those criteria are classified into certain diagnoses. Since the
NSDUH does not include questions for the ‘craving’ criterion, we denote our measure as a
‘pseudo’ substance abuse diagnosis measure.




                                               11
us to extend the analysis from simple use patterns to the more consequential

outcomes of substance use dependence. Because the NSDUH does not include

the craving measure in the DSM-5, we will underestimate substance use disorders

based on these criteria.     However, this measurement error should not be

systematically related to economic conditions.

       To estimate the effects of economic conditions on the outcomes described

above, we estimate standard two-way fixed effects models that rely on plausibly

exogenous variation in the timing and extent of macroeconomic fluctuations

across states. Specifically, we estimate:

   (1) Yist = π0 + π1State Unemployment Ratest + Xistβ + vs + wt + θst + εist,

where Yist are the substance use and disorder outcomes available in the NSDUH

data for individual i in state s at time t. Because some drug participation rates are

very low (i.e., near the 0 boundary), we estimate logistic regression models on the

dichotomous NSDUH outcomes and report marginal effects evaluated at the

sample means.     Xist is a vector of individual characteristics available in the

NSDUH, including: gender, age, race, ethnicity, education, family income, and

marital status. State Unemployment Ratest is the twelve month moving average of

the monthly state unemployment rate prior to the month of the interview date

from the Bureau of Labor Statistics; this is a standard approach in the literature




                                         12
(Tekin et al. 2013). 12 In some specifications, we allow for state-specific linear

time trends by interacting a linear trend variable (equal to 1 in 2002, 2 in 2003,

and so forth) with the state fixed effects.           Standard errors are corrected for

clustering at the state level (Bertrand et al. 2004).



4. Results

a. Descriptive Statistics, Substance Use Outcomes and Demographics

We begin by presenting descriptive statistics on drug use in Table 1. Columns 1-

4 present weighted means for past month use, past year use, past year disorder,

and past year disorder conditional on past year use, respectively, for each

substance.

        Alcohol and marijuana are by far the most commonly used substances in

the US population. Two thirds of the population reported consuming alcohol in

the past year, and 11 percent reported consuming marijuana. In comparison, 8

percent reported using any illicit drug other than marijuana in the past year, with

nearly 5 percent reporting the use of analgesics.

        Turning to substance use disorder, we find that 8 percent of the population

meets the criteria for having a clinically relevant alcohol use disorder, while 1.65

percent of the population had a substance use disorder for an illicit drug. Column


12
   In robustness analyses, we explore models that replace the state unemployment rate with the
state employment to population ratio or state per capita GDP, and we also explore models that
measure the unemployment rate at the county level as opposed to the state level.




                                             13
4 reveals that substance use disorders are very common among past-year users of

each substance. For example, while only 0.14 percent of the population reported

having used heroin in the past year, fully 61 percent of past year heroin users meet

the pseudo DSM-5 definition for disorder. Similarly, while only 0.28 percent of

the population reported using sedatives and tranquilizers, nearly 68 percent of past

year users met the definition for disorder. Thus, while the prevalence of past year

use of illicit drugs is rare, clinical disorder is very common among past year

substance users.

       Table 2 presents means for the individual demographic characteristics and

state unemployment rate. The majority is white, non-elderly adult (18-64), and

employed, with about half the population having at least some college education

and about half being married. The average state unemployment rate over this

period was approximately 6.7 percent.



b. Results: Economic conditions and substance use

We begin the discussion of our results with the results for substance use, followed

by results for substance use disorder, and concluding with results from several

extensions, robustness checks, and heterogeneous sub-populations.          Table 3

shows our main results on the relationship between economic conditions and

substance use for the major drug categories.       Each entry in Table 3 is the

coefficient on the state unemployment rate variable in a model that includes




                                        14
controls for all the individual demographic characteristics and state and year fixed

effects. In columns (2) and (4) of Table 3, we include state-specific linear trends

as additional controls. In columns (1) and (2), we report results for past-month

outcomes, while in columns (3) and (4) we report results for past-year outcomes.

       For alcohol, which has been the subject of most prior work on this topic,

there is some evidence of a procyclical relationship. Specifically, three out of

four estimates of π1 are negative, but only one is significant at conventional

levels: controlling for state-specific trends, a one percentage point increase in the

unemployment rate is associated with a decrease in the probability of past-month

alcohol participation of .0034. Estimates of π1 for marijuana use are small and

statistically insignificant. Similarly, when we consider the use of any illicit drug

in the third row of Table 3, there is no evidence of a relationship with state

unemployment rates using either past-month or past-year outcomes.

       The general pattern of null findings is repeated when we turn our attention

to the major drug classes. For example, we find no statistically or economically

meaningful relationships between state economic conditions and use of

analgesics, sedatives and tranquilizers, or inhalants using either past year or past

month measures. We do, however, find a statistically significant procyclical

relationship for stimulants using past-month measures, although the past-year

relationships are not statistically significant.     We also find a statistically

significant countercyclical relationship for hallucinogens using both the past-




                                         15
month and past-year measures (although the past-month relationship is not robust

to including state trends).

         In Table 4, we focus on several drug subcategories (e.g., LSD and PCP

instead of the broad category of hallucinogens). The most consistent finding in

Table 4 is that ecstasy use is strongly countercyclical: coefficient estimates on the

state unemployment rate for both past-month and past-year use are positive,

statistically significant, and robust to the inclusion of state trends. Specifically,

controlling for state-specific linear trends, a one- percentage point increase in the

state unemployment rate is associated with a .00049 increase in the probability of

ecstasy use in the past year, or a five percent increase relative to the mean

(.049/.98 = .05). Results in Table 4 also indicate that past-month LSD use is

significantly procyclical, and this relationship holds when examining past-year

use in the model with state trends. There is also some evidence of a procyclical

relationship for PCP, although these results only hold in models with state-

specific trends. Overall, the results in Table 4 indicate that ecstasy use is strongly

countercyclical, LSD use is strongly procyclical, and other subcategories of illicit

drugs exhibit a less consistent relationship with state unemployment rates. 13




13
   These same general patterns (i.e., mixed evidence on use) remained when we examined
outcomes reflecting ‘regular’ use, such as the probability of reporting at least four uses in the past
month (i.e., approximately once per week) or the probability of reporting at least 12 uses in the
past year (i.e., approximately once per month). These results are available upon request.




                                                 16
c. Results: Economic conditions and substance use disorder

In Table 5, we turn to our attention to substance use disorders. Recall that the

disorder questions were only asked regarding outcomes over the past year for the

major drug classes. Results in Table 5 indicate that substance use disorders for

most major drug classes are not related to economic conditions.            Estimated

coefficients of the state unemployment rate for disorders involving marijuana,

cocaine, stimulants, heroin, sedatives and tranquilizers, and inhalants are

consistently small and statistically insignificant. There is some evidence of a

statistically significant countercyclical relationship for alcohol disorders, although

this estimate is not significant in the model with linear state trends.

       Table 5 also indicates that disorders involving the use of analgesics and

hallucinogens are significantly countercyclical: controlling for state-specific

linear trends, a one percentage point increase in the state unemployment rate is

associated with an increase in the probability of having a disorder involving

analgesics of .00049 and increase in the probability of having a disorder involving

hallucinogens of .00017.       For each percentage point increase in the state

unemployment rate, these estimates represent about a six percent increase in the

likelihood of having a disorder involving analgesics and an 11 percent increase in

the likelihood of having a disorder involving hallucinogens.

       Next, we investigate robustness of, and extensions to, the key findings on

analgesics and hallucinogens disorders documented in Table 5. These results are




                                          17
reported in Table 6, which shows the results of several extensions and robustness

analyses in the rows. In each row, we report the coefficient of the relevant

economic-conditions variable for analgesics disorder in columns (1) and (2) (with

and without trends, respectively) and for hallucinogens disorder in columns (3)

and (4).

        In the first row of Table 6, we report the baseline estimate from Table 5

documenting that         analgesics     and    hallucinogens       disorders    are strongly

countercyclical. Rows (2)-(4) show results separately for mild, moderate, and

severe disorders. 14 These results are somewhat sensitive to the inclusion of state-

specific linear trends, although severe disorders involving hallucinogens are

clearly countercyclical with or without controlling for state trends. In row (5), we

again focus on any disorder, but we restrict our attention to individuals whose

NSDUH responses were not imputed to check if SAMHSA imputation procedures

impart any bias to the outcomes. This affects very small share of observations in

the sample with either missing data or logical imputations performed on their

substance use responses; in each case, the estimated coefficient on the state

unemployment rate is nearly identical to the baseline estimate in row (1). In row

(6), we restrict the sample to past-year users of each substance and find that




14
  Severity of dependence is determined by the number of dependence criteria the individual
meets, with 2-3 criteria indicating mild dependence, 4-5 indicating moderate dependence, and 6 or
more indicating severe dependence.




                                               18
positive relationship between the unemployment rate and disorders involving

analgesics remains.

        In rows (7) and (8) of Table 6, we explore alternative estimation strategies

and show that the findings with regard to analgesics and heroin disorders are

robust to using either a linear probability model or a probit. In rows (9) and (10),

we explore other ways to measure state economic conditions. 15 Although state

unemployment rates are standard in the literature, we also examine state

employment to population ratios in row (9) and state log GDP per capita in row

(10). The results of this exercise suggest that our findings are generally robust to

alternative choices of specification with respect to expected sign and magnitude,

but statistical significance is affected in rows (9) and (10) for analgesics and

hallucinogens, respectively. 16 Finally, in row (11) we show that our results are

similar to outcomes using the DSM-4 classification of abuse and dependence. 17




15
   We also examined whether the level of aggregation matters for our estimates by measuring
economic conditions using county (as opposed to state) unemployment rates (Lindo 2015).
Notably, in these models we also replaced the state fixed effects with county fixed effects.
Results indicated that aggregation choices do not alter our core finding that higher unemployment
rates are associated with significant increases in substance use disorders involving analgesics and
hallucinogens. These results are available upon request.
16
    We also estimated similarly specified differences-in-differences models relating state
unemployment rates to the likelihood an individual reports she is employed and to the
respondent’s reported household income. State unemployment rates were statistically significant
(negative) predictors of each. These results are available upon request.
17
   The NSDUH also asks whether individuals sought treatment for substance use abuse or
dependence in the prior year. In results not reported but available upon request, we did not find
statistically significant relationships between state economic conditions and the likelihood of
seeking treatment for substance use disorders.




                                               19
d. Results: Economic conditions and substance use in heterogeneous sub-

populations

        In Table 7, we take our core findings on analgesics and hallucinogen

disorders and estimate models separately by demographic characteristics to

examine possible differential treatment effects on sub-populations. The format of

Table 7 follows that of Table 6: in the top row we reprint the main estimates from

Table 5 for analgesics and hallucinogens. The subsequent rows of Table 7 report

results from estimation of equation (1) separately for: men, women, whites,

nonwhites, individuals with a high school degree or less, individuals with some

college or more, individuals under the age of 18, individuals age 18-64, and

individuals in the 15 states with the highest use rates of each drug. 18 The results

show that state unemployment rates are significantly positively related to

analgesics and hallucinogens disorders for men, whites, less educated individuals,

and 18-64 year olds. 19


18
   We also examined whether the disorder results varied according to the individual’s reported
occupation. Interpretation of these analyses is complicated by the fact that economic conditions
change who is employed (and thus who is reporting an occupation), but we did find robust
evidence that the countercyclical relationship for substance use disorders involving analgesics is
driven by people in sales/service occupations as opposed to professionals or blue collar workers.
Notably, we also found that among blue collar workers (construction, maintenance, machine
operators, transportation workers, and the armed forces), substance use disorders involving heroin
were also strongly countercyclical. These results are available upon request.
19
   We also estimated models for individuals age 65 and older. Estimates of the effect of state
unemployment rates on substance use disorders involving analgesics were not statistically
significant, and there were too few individuals age 65 and older who reported using hallucinogens
to meaningfully estimate similar models for that outcome. We also estimated models separately
for 18-34 year olds and 35-64 year olds but did not find robust differences in the effects across
these age groups for disorders involving analgesics or hallucinogens. We did, however, find that
higher state unemployment rates were significantly related to increases in the likelihood of both




                                               20
        In row (10) of Table 7, we restrict our attention to NSDUH respondents

from the 15 states with the highest participation rates for the period 2002-2013.

This restriction is intended to address the concern that use of these drugs may be

highly regional – and thus that many states are mainly contributing noise to the

relationship between economic conditions and the outcomes under study. When

we restrict our attention to the 15 states with the highest rates of hallucinogen use,

we find that disorders involving hallucinogens                       are still significantly

countercyclical; when we restrict our attention to the 15 states with the highest

rates of analgesics use, the estimated relationship between the unemployment rate

and disorders involving analgesics is positive with or without state-specific

trends, but only significant in column (1). 20



e. Did the Great Recession change these relationships?

Having demonstrated that disorders relating to analgesics and hallucinogens were

strongly countercyclical over the period 2002-2013, we now ask whether the

Great Recession occasioned a change in the relationship between the

unemployment rate and these disorders. That is, we ask whether the association



heroin use and heroin-related substance use disorders for 18-34 year olds, consistent with the
results for blue collar workers described above. These results are available upon request.
20
   For analgesics, the 15 states with the highest rates of use are: West Virginia, Idaho, Michigan,
Alabama, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky,
Washington, Oregon, and Oklahoma. For hallucinogens, the 15 states with the highest rates of use
are: California, Connecticut, Arizona, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts, Washington, Alaska, New
Mexico, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Montana, Oregon, Vermont, and Colorado.




                                               21
between the unemployment rate and these disorders was more (or less)

pronounced during the period December 2007 – June 2009, when the United

States experienced one of the most pronounced recessions in its history.

Specifically, we modify equation (1) by adding a control for whether the

respondent reported on substance use behavior that would have occurred between

December 2007 and June 2009, as well as an interaction between the state

unemployment rate and the Great Recession indicator:

   (2)   Yist = π0 + π1State Unemployment Ratest + π2Great Recessiont + π3(State

         Unemployment Rate*Great Recession)st + Xβist + vs + wt + θst + εist,

where all variables are as defined above.           If the relationship changed

fundamentally during the recession, we would expect it to be observed on the

interaction term between the unemployment rates and the Great Recession.

         We present the results of this exercise in Table 8 for analgesics disorder

(column 1) and hallucinogens disorder (column 2).         For both outcomes, we

confirm the countercyclicality of disorder but fail to find meaningful interactions

between unemployment rates and the Great Recession period. This suggests that

although economic conditions play a strong role in substance use disorder, the

Great Recession period did not fundamentally alter this relationship.



5. Discussion and Conclusion




                                         22
The results above provide the first comprehensive evidence on economic

conditions and illicit drug use in the United States. We overcome inherent data

limitations of prior work by using restricted data from the 2002-2013 National

Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and standard two-way fixed effects

models of illicit drug use and abuse. Prior work has focused nearly exclusively

on alcohol, marijuana, or used a broad categorization of ‘any illicit drug’;

NSDUH data allow us to examine all major drug classes as well as specific

subcategories of illicit drugs.    Results from difference-in-differences models

relating past year use to past year state unemployment rates provide evidence that

recent use of ecstasy is significantly countercyclical, while LSD use is

significantly procyclical. Results for other classes of drugs are mixed and not

consistent.

       Our most important results concern clinically meaningful NSDUH

outcomes relating to substance use disorders that are based on (though not

identical to) DSM-5 criteria such as withdrawal, physical/psychological problems

related to use, and hazardous use. To our knowledge, no prior study has linked

economic conditions to substance use disorders for illicit drugs. Individuals with

substance use disorders comprise the disproportionate share of social costs

associated with illicit drug use and represent the main targets of substance use

treatment (Degenhardt and Hall 2012). We find clear evidence that substance use

disorders     involving   analgesics   and   hallucinogens   are   both   strongly




                                        23
countercyclical. These findings, which are highly robust and strongest among

non-elderly adult white men with low levels of education (who were hit hard by

recent economic downturns), are consistent with the observation that deaths from

accidental poisoning have become strongly countercyclical since the 1980s

(Ruhm 2015).

       Our results are important for understanding optimal policy responses to

economic booms and busts. Most debates over public funding for drug treatment,

penalties for illicit drug use, and other drug policy levers ignore the role of

economic conditions. Our results highlight the perils of this omission.        For

example, as state budgets contract during economic downturns, drug treatment

funding is particularly vulnerable. Our findings suggest that such funding cuts, if

untargeted, could lead to significant adverse effects on individuals with substance

use disorders.
