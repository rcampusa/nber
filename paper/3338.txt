                      PUBLIC POLICY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH:
                     DEVELOPING NEOCLASSICAL IMPLICATIONS


                                    ABSTRACT

     Why do the countries of the world display considerable disparity in long
term growth rates? This paper examines the hypothesis that the answer lies in
differences in national public policies which affect the incentives that
individuals have to accumulate capital in both its physical and human forms.
Our analysis shows that these incentive effects can induce large difference in
long run growth rates. Since many of the key tax rates are difficult to
measure, our procedure is an indirect one   We work within a calibrated, two
sector endogenous growth model, which has its origins in the microeconomic
literature on human capital formation.  We show that national taxation can
substantially affect long run growth rates.  In particular, for small open
economies with substantial capital mobility, national taxation can readily lead
to "development traps" (in which countries stagnate or regress) or to "growth
miracles" (in which countries shift from little growth to rapid expansion)
This influence of taxation on the rate of economic growth has important welfare
implications:  in basic endogenous growth models, the welfare cost of a 10 %
increase in the rate of income tax can be 40 times larger than in the basic
neoclassical model.

I.     Introduction

       Economists have long suspected that there is a link between national

policies and       long   term rates of economic growth.      For example, Schultz [1981]

suggests that many public policies contain disincentives for growth because

they reduce the rewards to accumulation of a comprehensive concept of capital

encompassing human as well as physical capital.              In this paper, ye show that

a basic Schultzian model has the property that modest variations in tax rates
are associated with large variations in long run growth rates. Our model
follows leads provided by Uzawa [1965], Lucas [1988b], and Rebelo [1987]. In
our analysis, changes in public policy can potentially explain periods of
secular stagnation or high economic growth. Public policy is particularly
powerful     in affecting small       open economies with   freely mobile capital. For
these   economies, taxes can         easily shut down the growth process, leading to

"development traps         in which countries stagnate or even regress for lengthy
periods.
     The   specific   model   that    we   construct belongs to an important class of
endogenous growth models based on work by Uzawa [1965] and             retains   the

following    key   proper-ties the basic neoclassical model of Solow [1956]

constant   asymptotic growth      rate; and (ii) competitive and optimal allocations

coincide   in the absence of public interventions,           The crucial attribute of

this   class of o-dels is that ther. is a "core" of          capital goods which can be

produced   without the direct or indirect contribution of non—reproducible

factors.

     In developing our model we begin with the analysis of individual

decisions at given prices and then consider the implications of production

structure.     This path leads us to develop aspects of individual accumulation

 mjcroeconomic and macroeconomic evidence, a methodology that has proven to
 provide a powerful organizing tool in other areas of research on aggregate

 behavior.2                                                               -
                  focuses exclusively on taxation of coodity outputs. We
       Our analysis

 have chosen to focus on taxation of this form since we think that a variety
 of public interventions—including aspects of property rights enforcement and
 regulation—may be described in              this manner,    so   that our    conclusions can

 potentially be interpreted as bearing on other aspects of governmental

 activity.

       Our    investigation of the link between public policy and                economic    growth
 is organized as follows.            Section II provides a brief overview of the basic

neoclassical model and of a very simple endogenous growth model.                       Both models
are    calibrated to        accord with long run evidence for the U.S. economy and then

used to analyze the effects of taxation on                real economic activity.
       Section    III develops our model of
                                                    growth through human        capital
accumulation and the incentive effects of public policy on this process.                                Our

analysis proceeds in three stages.                 Following Rosen [1976) and Beckman

 [1976]   ,   we discuss optimal individual accumulation of human
                                                                  capital and the
influence      of various taxes on optimal accumulation. To highlight the role of

taxes and to conform           to prior microeconom.ic     studies, our       analysis begins by
taking the following key prices to be exogenous: the wage rate per unit                           of
human capital;        the   price   of investing    in human capital;    and the    real     interest

rate   on     consution loans.         In the next two stages of model development we

add the structure that makes these relative prices endogenous. First, we
                                                                                               3




study the   production of consumption and          investment      goods, while retaining an

exogenous borrowing and       lending   rate.     This provides a framework for

discussing a smell open economy's accumulation of nontraded human                  capital.    In

this   section, the nature of the influence of tax policies on the price of

investing in human      capital    is shown to depend on the nature of the technology

for producing such investments. Second, we describe a full general

equilibrium in which the rate of return adjusts to equate borrowing and

lending or, equivalently,         savings and investment.          The influence of policy on

the rate of return is a final factor affecting the growth rate.

       Section IV   compares the   welfare effects of taxation in three economies:

the basic neoclassical model, the simple endogenous growth model discussed in
Section II, and the growth model that we propose in section III. The main
conclusion obtained from this comparison is that there are larger welfare

costs of taxation in endogenous growth models than in comparable neoclassical

models with exogenous technical         change.     Fundamentally, this is because

policy   can influence the long run growth rate in endogenous growth models.                   A

concluding section sumaarizes our results and relates them to ongoing

research on the theory of econoic growth.



II.    leoclassical odela of       Ecooic       Growth:   Old and   I.
      When we think   about   .conoic growth,       most   of us   have in   the back of our
minds   some variant of the basic neoclassical model of capital accumulation

due to Solo, [1956], Swan [1963), Cass [1965), and Koopmans                  [1965).   In this

paper we construct and evaluate a new neoclassical model that alters

intertemporal technology in ways which make sustainable growth a feasible

outcome when technology is time stationary.               Before developing our specific

model it is useful to briefly discuss stylized versions of old and new
                                                                                       4




neoclassical models of economic growth.         These two models have the same

specification of preferences over consumption (Cr)          so we   begin with   these:3



    U      E               (C — 1)      for 0        a.                 (11.1)


With this utility function constant growth in consumption is optimal if the

real interest rate is constant over time, which we take as one of the

"stylized facts" of economic development (see Kaldor [1961] and P.omer

[1988a]).      As in most of the growth literature we will assume that per capita

labor supply is inelastic at       L   To   silify   the exposition we abstract from

population growth.

exhibit growth rates exceeding i' during  a transition period in which the
economy converges to its steady—state growth path. In a companion paper

neoclassical model cannot account for much sustained variation in rates of

economic growth—either across countries or tine periods—withoutgenerating

counterfactual implications for factor prices or factor shares,


Calibrating the Model
      To study         the         effects    of taxation     in the    neoclassical    model   it    is useful

to calibrate             it       with   parameters    that   accord    with   the U.S long term

experience. We will use the parameters of the baseline economy studied in

our   companion paper (King and Rebelo                        [1989]) which contains a detailed

discussion of the                   dels      calibration. Each time period is taken to represent

a year and the discount factor                          is chosen so that the after—tax steady—state

interest rate is 3.2%. Momentary utility                               is taken to be logarithmic         (o=1).

The production function is assumed to be Cobb—Douglas,                                 F(K,N)AKlNa.          We

normalize A=1, which is a choice of units for measuring output, and select a

conventional           value for labors share                 (2/3).       Finally,    we   set the
depreciation rate equal to                      10?. (5..10),    the growth rate of technical progress
to   27,              i.02), and the fraction of time devoted to work to 20% (?fr.20).

The Effects     of Taxation

      Throughout    the paper,     the main tax experiment         that    we consider   is   an

unanticipated      increase    in the output/income tax rate—applied equally to all

sectoral activities—from 20% to 30%.                   Roughly,   this difference represents a

change from the average Japanese tax rate during 1965—1975 to the average

U.S. tax rate over that period. (Atkinson and Stiglitz t1980, Figure 1—2],
provide this measure of the average tax rate—tax revenues as a share of
                           a number of countries).7
gross domestic product—for

      To isolate the effects of taxation from those of government expenditures

we assume that the tax revenue is used to finance                  lu      sum transfer payments.

Within the basic neoclassical model, as is well known, an increase in the

income tax rate occasions a shift in the level of the steady—state path—but

not in its slope—and sets in motion transitional dynamics.                       For our

calibrated economy, the steady—state effects of an increase in the rate of

income tax from 20% to         30'!.    are a 18.2% drop in the capital stock and a 3.6%

drop   in consution.          The dynamics that characterize the transition between

the two    steady states are       in Figure 1, where the dashed line
                                       depicted

represents the old steady—state path. The qualitative features of these
dynamics are familiar: during the transition period the initial level of
consumption     rises in      response to the tax       increase   so     the economy "works off'
the   capital stock through lower net investment and temporarily high levels of

consumption.



11.2 4. Sip1e       feocla.ssical        Ilodel of   Endogenous Growth
   For organizing our thinking about economic growth it is useful to
consider the simplest endogenous growth model. In this model all factors of
                                                                                                 7




production are        reproducible       and their quantity is summarized by the        coosite
capital good K*.           The production technology is given by


          = A   K,                                                                     (11.2)'


where k>O is the time invariant              productivity parameter. The resource and
accumulation constraints are

                                                                                       (11.3)

It is     easy to show that the          con growth rate of consumption, investment,
output and      capital     in this economy is:

        =   [()](1/)                                                                   (11.5)
In this expression we have defined Mr)                 as the gross private
                                                        = [(1—r)A+i--6]

rate of return to the coosite capital   good. Thus, in an application of
standard Fisherian principles, the growth rate depends on the gap between the
rate of interest and the rate of time preference, with the strength of this
relation    depending on         the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (1/a).



Calibrating the Model

     We parameterize this economy to make it cona.rable to                 the basic
neoclassical xdel          just discussed. We choose           o1, 5.1O   and determine the

values of    /3   and A   such    that   the economy   grows   at 2?. a year   and has an annual
alter—tax real interest rate of              3.2?.   when the rate of income tax is     20?..8

Effects of Taxation
      As is clear from expression (11.5), an unanticipated increase in the tax

rate    r produces an    iediate      shift in the level and       slope of   the growth

path—there are no        transitional dynamics.         Higher   taxes work to lower the

rate   of   return, R(r),    and   thus   to lower the reward to accuilation.            A   rise
in   the tax rate thus lovers the long run growth rate, which is                a   general

characteristic of endogenous growth models stressed by Rebelo [1987]                         The

effects of increasing the rate of income tax from 20% to 30% on consumption

and    capital   are   represented   in Figure    2. The economys rate of growth falls
from 2% to 0.37%        (in Table 4 this    is   reported as a decline of 1.63% in the
growth      rate).   The reduction in investment associated with this slowdown

makes the initial level of consumption rise by 36%.

       We think that this model       is a useful starting point for          consideration of

the effects of policy on long term growth. However, in a strict

interpretation of       K,   it   delivers endogenous long       run   growth only by
effectively      ignoring labor input, which is the sole force inducing

diminishing returns        to capital in     the   basic technology of    Solow [1956]       and
Swan [1963] . (Alternatively if    is viewed as a composite of physical and
human capital then the assumption is that these are produced according to an

identical technology.) In our analysis below, we will follow Lucas [1988b]
in permitting labor input to be reproducible,             i.e., permitting       human   capital
accumulation.        Then, we can reintroduce the smooth substitution between

factor inputs that was a key motivation for Solow's [1956) specification of

production technology.

III. Economic Growth          through Human Capital Accuilat ion
       Our interest is in models of endogenous growth           that   accord with the major

facts of economic development. One stylized fact is that national growth

rates do not display trends in the absence of major policy interventions.

Another is that there is little evidence of long run trends in               real   interest

rates.     Following Solow [1970),        we   interpret these observations as evidence
that steady—state models are a reasonable first approximationto reality, and
we focus on economies in which the real interest rate is constant along

steady—state paths. We therefore require that the production of both
physical and human capital goods is governed by constant returns to scale
technologies so that there are feasible steady—state growth paths. We also
continue to utilize the preferences described in (11.1) since these lead
individuals      to choose a constant growth       of consumption when    faced with   a
constant    interest   rate.
       The model economy that we     construct     is thus   of the class studied
previously by Uzawa [1965), Lucas [1988b] and Rebelo [1987) in that it
highlights the societal allocation of resources between current consumption
and comprehensive accumulation (physical and human capital) under constant
returns to scale. However, our model is different in three respects from
these earlier studies. First, in contrast to Uzawa and Lucas, we allow for a
commodity input into the production of new human capital, which seems

empirically reasonable         given our broad interpretation of       this process. In
this regard,    are also motivated by the analysis of Rebelo [1987), which
                  we

indicated that the Uzawa—Lucas specification restricts certain tax policies

to have negligible effect on the steady—state growth rate. Second, since we
want to understand Ci) the decentralization of accumulation decisions and

(ii)    growth   in an open    economy   with traded physical capital and nontraded
human capital, we require that the rate of human capital investment be

subject to diminishing              point—in—time returns as in Rosen   t1976]   .
                                                                                     Third,   our

del      is designed to permit a quantitative evaluation of the effects of

policy on economic growth.



III. I       The Core Eleeuts

    To study the accumulation of physical and human capital, we use a two

sector endogenous growth model.                 As in the neoclassical model of the previous

section, there is a single consu.tion/physical investment good.                      This good

is produced in sector 1 according to a constant returns—to—scale production

technology with physical and human capital as its inputs.                Rence, one

technical coustraint for the economy is

         +         =   Ylt   =
                                 Fi(KI,NitHt).                                        (111.1)


As previously,          C    and        denote consuntion and physical investment. Dutput

of this commodity is                    and physical capital and labor (human capital)
                                  Y1
inputs into this sector are denoted respectively by                    and
                                                                  K1
   The human capital investment good, which we call      is produced in the
                                                    1Ht'
second sector with another production technology that is constant returns to

scale in the two inputs, i.e.,


   'Mt        '2        F2(X2, N2H).                                                  (111.2)


   The physical capital goods are taken to obey standard neoclassical




                                 I fi
accumulation equations, i.e.,

               —             =      —                                                (111.3)
where           is the depreciation rate in sector j.           Aggregate   physical capital
investment       is then the sum    of   the sectoral investments, i.e.,         1    11t2t'
    Our    specification of       the evolution of human       capital   embodies diminishing

point—in—time capacity to grow, as in Rosen [1976),

           —         =               —
    H+i         Ht       e(IH/H)E        5Ht,                                         (111.4)


with D8 > 0 and              <       This specification of 'adjustment costs" permits

steady—state growth                 and Ht grow      at the
                                                   rate. Further, combined
                                                              same

with (111.2), our setup is consistent with the viev that growth in human
capital combines labor and other inputs according to a production function as

in Hecan         [1976].     We assume that both physical and human capital investment

are irreversible.

    Finally,         the sectoral allocations of labor must sum to the available

stock, N.

           +             N                                                            (11L5)
                N2

Since human capital is embodied in workers time, this allocation also

determines the sectoral allocation of human capital.

    With   this specification of interteoral              technology, our model has a

range of feasible balanced growth equilibria in which consution, physical

investment,       sectoral outputs, and capital stocks all grow at the same rate;

this    rate,    which we    denote by
                                         ''H'
                                                is the human capital growth   rate.

Calibrating the Model

    Our objective is to          explore the quantitative effects of ta.x policies         on
rates    of economic growth. For this purpose, we need to specify aspects of

the investment technologies (parameters              of the 8    function, 5M'
                                                                                                     12




production technologies (parameters of the functions F1 and F2); and tax
structure.  Our parameter selections are reported in Table 1.

    Throughout our analysis, we concentrate                   on the case where the production

          F1 and F2 are Cobb—Douglas, with                   F = AK1°1 (NH)i.
functions                                                                                   We


uniformly   assume that the share of labor in sector 1
                                                                       (or)
                                                                              is   2/3, so that our

results are compatible with those for the neoclassical model discussed above.

Further, as in section II, we normalize the constant term in the sector 1

production function to unity (A1                    1) which, as earlier, represents a choice

of units.    In our quantitative analysis,                 we assume that there is a uniform

depreciation rate on physical capital in its two uses, 5K1 = 5K2 =                               .10.
    The parameter       choices     for    sector    1   are well within the range of

selections studied in other settings, such as public finance, quantitative

growth theory, and business cycle analysis.                    However, in specifying the human

capital production process, there is less guidance from prior aggregative

studies.    We consequently start with a benchmark view that human capital

production is not much different from the production of output, so that                              =
                                                                                                 2
   = 2/3 and        =        =   .10.     This set of parameter choices has the convenient
                        ox

implication that there are no transitional dynamics in response to tax
changes if these are uniform across the sectors. Rather, both capital

goods—K and H—simply grow forever at the new steady—state rate, as in the

simple del of section II. This implication is independent of the choice of
the e function; it holds generally if the two sectoral production functions

are the same.

    There has been       little research since that            of Rosen   [1976] on   the
estimation of the parameters of the e function, which is a primary
determinant of the rate of human capital accumulation. We employ a
parameterization of the human              capital accumulation     technology which implies
that:          (i) human    capital   declines at the depreciation rate if there is no

investment expenditure (e(O)O); and                        (ii) there are locally no      "adjustment
costs" at zero gross investment so that

                                                                                 I   =   0. The
specific         function we use is
                                      1                9

Our benchmark assumption              is that the parameter 9 takes on the value               .5.

      To       conduct    quantitative experiments within our general equilibrium model,

it    is also necessary to            specify aspects of preferences—,3 and c—since these

influence the equilibrium interest and growth rates.                         Our procedure is as

follows: we choose a value of the intertenporal elasticity of substitution

in consumption (i/c) and a baseline value for the after—tax interest rate

R(r) and growth rate
                                .         Then, we can compute two       "uniovns"       in the model,

the   utility discount factor               fi   and   the productivity parameter for sector 2

output,         A2.
                      The   former   is   pinned       down by the Fisberian link between      interest
and   consumption growth, /3(7N)R(r)l; the latter is determined by the

required growth rate given efficient factor input proportions. Fixing these

parameters, we then explore how steady—state interest rates and growth rates

vary as the tax           structure       is altered.'1      Our benchmark preference case is to

assume         that the intertemporal            elasticity of     substitution is unity     (1/c =   1).
Finally,        as in section II, we use the after—ta.x steady—state real interest

rate      of   32 and growth rate 27,.
      Seiisztzvy Analysis: Given our uncertainty about                   the values of the human
capital        production technology,             we   looked at   the implications of    alternative

parameter values, suggested by prior theory or measurement, which would act

to reduce the growth implications relative to our benchmark. First, the

tizawa     [1965)—Lucas [1988b) specification is that only labor is used to
                                                                                              14



produce     the human    capital      investment good
                                                        (021).
                                                                  This parameterization has

the very special property that taxation of sector 1 output has no effect on

the economys steady—state growth rate.                Consequently, we study the

implications of increasing our choice of               2   from our benchmark of .67 to a

level of .95,      Second,    in the applied labor economics literature,         there is a

variety of evidence on the magnitude of the depreciation of human capital:
Mincer's [1974] estimate of                  .012 for individuals is the lowest one that

we found; Haley [1976] reports estimates in the range of 3 to 4%.                  In   our

sensitivity analysis, we reduce                to Mincer's value.    Third, reasoning that

increasing "adjustment costs" would mitigate the sensitivity of growth to
economic policy, we reduce 0            to   .25.   Fourth, we explored the implications of

a value of u that implies a smaller degree of intertemporal substitution

(o'=5).     Table 1 provides      a   summary of the parameterizations that we consider.



Taxation of the Two Sectors

     Throughout the analysis,           we consider taxation of sectoral outputs at

rates        with the proceeds rebated lump sum. As in the basic neoclassical

del       of section II, with constant returns—to—scaletechnologies this is

equivalent to taxing the incomes from all factor services allocated to sector

j   at   the uniform rate
                             r.

III. 2      Individual   Human Capital       Lccuulation
     We   start by studying the individual's decision problem when the following

prices are taken as given          U)    the wage rate, (ii) the price of investing in
human capital, and (iii) the            interest rate. These are assumed constant over
time, as    theywill be in a steady state.             The   introduction of diminishing

returns to     point—in—time production is necessary for the individual's human
                                                                                       15




capital investment demand to be well defined. Otherwise, when the rates of

return to the accumulation of physical and human capital are identical (as

they are in equilibrium) the individual allocations across these two

activities are indeterminate.

    The individual maximization problem involves choosing sequences of

consumption         {C} and human   capital investments         so as to maximize

lifetime utility (11.1), subject to an intertemporal budget constraint,


                                      B   +   [R(r))_t[wNM
                     o(T)j_t C                                 1Ht1'

where      is the market discount factor (R 1+r(1—r), with r(1—r) being the
        R(r)
after—tax real interest rate) and B is the level of initial financial

assets.    The optimal human capital program is also constrained by the

evolution equation for human capital,            =                        —
                                      [H+i-_HJ/H              ecIHfJHf)
    There is a separation        of consumption from production decisions in this

ndel, so that preferences do not influence the rate of human capital
formation. Consumption growth         occurs   at the familiar rate
               =
(C+1/C)
   To examine  the determination of the optimal growth rate, it is convenient
to work with the inverse of the adjustment technology, which states the
inputs required to yield a given flow of human capital outputs. Call this
function   W, so that                W1— (l_6H)Ht)/Ht].        Substituting this
expression         into the lifetime budget constraint and maximizing with respect to

the human capital stocks, we are led to the following efficiency condition:


    wN =                              +
           (R(r)_7M)pDW[7R_l+6HJ          P'[7_l+S.).                         (11L7)
                                                                                        16




Implicitly,    this efficiency condition determines a function for the
                                                                       optimal
growth rate of human capital in the presence of adjustment costs,"

                                                                           (111.8)


The   growth rate depends   positively on   the wage rate w and negatively on the

price of    investing in human capital p)2     Since investment in human

capital—like other investments—depends negatively on the interest rate R(r)
and on the depreciation rate of the capital good           the growth rate also
                                                      H'
depends negatively on these factors.        In addition, it depends implicitly on

the parameters of the    e function as in    other models with adjustment costs to

investment.
                                                                                   -

      This formulation provides a convenient basis for discussing some

theoretical results    from the labor economics literature—which generally

views the investment process for human capital as untaxed—and to preview

some of our results in the general equilibrium models studied below.            If we

subject labor income to a tax at rate       r, thenthe   after—tax wage falls to

           so that one would expect a slowdown in human capital growth from this
(1_Tw)w

channel. (These implications for human capital       accumulation   translate
directly into implications for the growth of individual income,
                                                                wNH).
However, there may be a countervailing effect from the influence of taxation

on the cost of investing in human capital. If labor is the only input into

human capital investment and there is no direct taxation of the human capital

activity, as in Rosen [1976]. then p is simply proportional to (l_y)w, so

that there is a full offset on the relative price v/p and, thus, no effect on

the growth rate.    In the alternative specification studied by Hecknan (1976),

labor is only one of the factors employed in producing new human capital, so

that there is a smaller countervailing move in p from         and, thus, there
                                                                                               17




continues to be a reduction in the grow-th            rate induced by   the tax   increase
even    if   the human   capital    investment sector is not taxed.



III.    3 Prices Facing      A   Sa1l Open Economy
       For the   purpose   of studying a small open economy,       we need  to explore the
implications      of the production structure for the prices w          and p. Thus in

this section we proceed part way to a full dynamic general equilibrium, but

we retain the assumption that the interest rate is exogenous. We make                    the
conventional assumptions that           there is international borrowing     and lending;
trade in capital and        consumption goods;     and    international iobility of
labor/human capital.         We    also assume that   all countries follow the "worldwide

tax system" according to which agents pay taxes in their home country on
capital income from foreign investments but receive a tax credit for any

taxes paid abroad on this income.'3


The    Price of Investment in Human Capital
       For a small economy facing       a given   world   interest rate, the cost   of

producing a marginal unit of           capital investment good is independent
                                      the human

of the level of investment, since both of the production functions are

constant returns to scale. In discussing the implication of analogous
results for specialization in the production of traded goods in a world
economy, Baxter [1988) notes that they fundamentally derive from the
nonsubstitution theorem" of Samuelsom [1961) and Mirrleeg [1969). In our
setting, since human capital is not traded, a small open economy will not
specialize if it grows, i.e., it will generally produce both final product
and human capital investment. But it still faces a price of investing in
human capital that is determined solely by domestic technology and taxes
along with the world interest rate; this price is not influenced by the

domestic economys        choice between production of                 final output and human       capital
investment.
      Following      Baxter's t1988] line of argument,               the    capital intensity in
sector 1 is pinned down by the cost of capital under international capital

bility, Ki/(NiH)                                                     .    Hence, the real wage rate          w
                               cl[(R(r)._l+öKl)I(1._i-l)]
is also determined by these variables, as v                                                  Finally,
                                                                 (1—r1)D2F1C'c1,1).
with all of the input costs determined, the price of the investment good is

given by

factor price for sector 2, w/[R(r)_1+S2]

Ilications of Taxation
      With these solutions      in hand, we can return to the effects                   of   the
analysis of taxation of sector 1 output—i.e.,                        of a rise in
                                                                                     r1—discussed
                                                                                                        at

the   end,   of the previous section.            First, if there is only labor in the sector

2 production function              =   1),   so that        =   0,    then
                                                                             p=w/(1—r2) and w/p

(1—r2).       Hence, in our CobbDouglas            setup,   2            1 will be associated with no

effect of sector I taxation on economic growth.                          However, sector 2 taxation

will have a negative influence on growth.

      As stressed by Heckman (1976L with       a sector 1 tax increase will
                                         VN<l,
reduce v/p and, hence, reduce the growth rate of human capital. (The same

logic also implies that this relative price change will generally occur when

other produced inputs are used in the creation of new human capital; it can

even occur if these are flow inputs rather than                       capital   (5x2=1).)
                                                                                              To some
                                                                                    19




extent, there will also be factor substitution induced by an increase in

that is, the input ratio      will rise and an increase in the marginal product

of labor viii occur.    This factor substitution effect on the marginal product

of labor will partly mitigate the direct effect of taxation.

     These  general equilibrium adjustments are complex and, for this reason,
we   resort to siilations of parametric economies in studying the effects of
taxation in small open economies. To maintain the link to individual
consumer choice, we also discuss the adjustment in the prices w and p so that
one can see how the equilibrium outcomes are decentralized.
    Table 2 reports the results of some basic experiments with our small open
economy setup, which holds fixed the rate of return R(r). Prior to the
fiscal change, we assume that the economy has a growth rate of 2'!. and the
initial configuration of tax rates is r1Tf.2O. Further, we assume that the
economy does not trade with the rest of the world at these tax rates. We
then explore the ilications of increasing r1 to .3 and of increasing both
   and r2 to .3.
    In our benchmark case, we assume the parameter values discussed in
section 111.1 above govern the economy. We also consider two other sets of
parameter values. The first is a 'high 02" case with 02     .95, which is
designed to illustrate the effects discussed earlier in this section. The
second   is to bring in greater investment   adjustment   costs;   we   consider 0.25.
    In the benchmark case with 01=02=2/3, the 1O sector 1 tax increase—from

r1=.20 to r1=.30—lowers the growth rate by over eight percentage points.
(Even a one percent increase in the sector     1 tax rate lowers growth by two

percentage points).                is induced by a decline in v/p, the gross

Taxing sector 2 at the      same   higher rate      (r1r2.30)    leads   to   a complete
shutdown of human      capital   investment ('Yff      1—8H
    With a higher labor share,         the effects of taxation of sector 1
                               a2=.95,
are reduced, but still important: the increase from
                                                     r1.2O to r=.3O reduces
the growth    rate   by 2.84%, so that—starting from a 2% growth rate—the

economy would      display negative growth.      As discussed previously,          with lover

capital input, the relative price v/p is less sensitive to taxation in

sector 1.  Taxing both sectors at the same higher rate (r1=r2=.30) continues
to lead to a complete shutdown of the growth process.

    With more sharply increasing costs of growth (9 smaller), there is                     a
smaller magnitude impact:         growth falls by five percent when the tax change
is concentrated on sector I alone; previously, in the benchmark model, it -

fell by over eight percent.

III. 4     The Closed Economy General Equ.ilibrium

    In   the closed economy general equilibrium, the rate of return exerts a

stabilizing influence relative to the prior analysis.               In particular, the

increases in the tax     rate    that lead to lower growth bring about a decline in

the real rate of return, which raises the amount            of   human   capital   investment

undertaken at a given relative price v/p. Therefore, the effects that we

report in   this   section are necessarily smaller than those in the prior

section.

   Results on the effects of taxation on the growth rate are provided in

Table 3:    in the benchmark economy, the basic tax experiment of raising the

sector 1 tax rate from
                       T1.2O to         r.30     leads to   a   one half percent decrease

in the growth rate; raising both tax        rates    by ten percent leads to        a.   cut in

the growth rate of 1.51.         This number is broadly in line with the growth
                                                                                             21




effects that   we   foundthe simple endogenous growth model of section 2
                            in

(which implied a growth rate decline of 1.6%), but it is slightly attenuated
due to the presence of 'investment adjustment costs" to human capital

formation in the current setup.
    The balance of the table reports a battery of sensitivity experiments

abstracting from the transitional dynamics induced by the tax increase and
focusing on steady—state effects. First, when we consider the higher labor's

share value,                we find that the effects of taxing only sector 1 is

sharply   limited: instead of a      .5% cut   in the   growth   rate   there is a   .17,

reduction.                            suggests that it is important to obtain
               This sensitivity analysis

good estimates of the relative importance of taxed factors and untaxed
factors in the human capital production process. Second, when we consider
the   Mincer [1974) value of depreciation 5H=012' the effects of a general tax

increase are attenuated, falling from 1.5% to           .677,.   At the aggregate level,

the depreciation rate on human       capital   involves the training of new

population members;      the retraining of agents reallocated across jobs; and the

continuing development of population members staying on the same job.                  Our

sensitivity analysis indicates that it would be valuable to obtain better

measurements of the depreciation of human capital associated with these

activities.    Third, there is a major influence of the intertemporal

elasticity of substitution (1/u) on the rate of economic growth.                Our value

of    a5 isonly     about halfway from our benchmark of a=1 to the largest values

found by Hall [1988), but it is nevertheless sufficient to substantially

mitigate the effect of taxation on economic growth.              Fourth, we experimented

with values of the investment technology parameter, reducing it to 9.25,                     As

in the small open economy, the growth rate declines relative to the benchmark
                                                                                             22




experiment but      this influence is smaller than that of         the   other   sensitivity
experiments.
      From this battery of results, we conclude that           taxation   may affect the

growth rate in a quantitatively important way, but that the magnitude of this

influence depends,       not   surprisingly,   on the production and tax structure.



IV.    e1fare Ilicatioms of Taxation

      In   the models   of   sections II and III we examined the effects on real

activity of an increase in the income tax rate from 20% to 30%.                  In this

section we evaluate the predictions of our models for the welfare cost of

this tax increase.       Our objective is to illustrate the general principle that

there are larger welfare effects in endogenous growth models than in the

basic neoclassical model.          As in the previous sections we assume that the tax

proceeds are rebated in a lump—sum fashion in order to isolate the

substitution effects of taxation.



Method of policy analysis

      The method that we employ is based on Lucas [1988a] and works as

follows.15     Denote by             the consumption path associated with the steady
                             {C}0
state of an economy with a 201 tax rate, and let                    demote the path that

results after an unanticipated increase          its   the tax rate from 20% to 30%.        The

welfare loss associated with this tax increase is the number                such that


                                                                                   (IV.1)
                             U({C}0).

Since   C grows at a constant rate,            is determined so that consumers are

indifferent between Ci) an increase in the tax rate to 30% and (ii) a
                                                                                                   23




situation     in which the tax rate remains at     207.    but their consumption level is

reduced by 1OO7.      in every period.

IV. 1      The Basic Ieoclassical Xodel

        In response to an increase in the income tax rate from             207.   to 30%, our

parameterized version of the neoclassical model predicts that steady—state

capital falls by 18.2% and consumption declines by                3.67..   As Judd [1987) and

Jorgenson and Yun [1988) have stressed, it is inappropriate to evaluate tax

policies solely on the basis of these long run effects. In fact the welfare

cost of taxation       would be independent of preferences in the neoclassical

growth model if only steady—state comparisons were utilized. However, the

decline in steady—state consumption gives us an upper bound to the welfare

cost associated with the tax increase.          Since consumption is higher along the

transition path than it is in the new steady state, the welfare cost is lower

than the cost associated with an immediate, permanent 3.6% drop in

consumption.

        The first line of Table 4 shows that, taking into account the entire

transition path, the welfare cost of raising the income tax rate from                    20'!.    to

30'f.   in the benchmark model is   1.67..   That is, the tax rate increase is

equivalent (in utility terms) to an immediate             1.67.   downward shift in the

steady—state consumption path.

        We studied the sensitivity of this welfare cost to intertemporal

elasticities of substitution different from the benchmark value of one.                          When

the intertenporal elasticity of substitution in consumption is increased

(i.e.       is reduced), the initial. jump in consumption illustrated in Figure                    1


is magnified and the welfare cost increased.          For example, when                1/2, the

welfare cost is    1.717..   Symmetrically, when       is increased, the welfare cost
                                                                                                24




falls:     when         2, the welfare        cost   is 1.46%.    The intuition behind these

results is familiar from discussions of the welfare cost of taxation in

partial equilibrium (e.g., Nusgrave and                Xusgrave    t1980), page 310)):

increasing the willingness of agents to substitute across goods increases

their response to the tax distortion and leads to a higher excess burden of

taxation.




IV. 2    The   Sile Endogenous          Growth    !odel
    In the     simple   endogenous growth model of           section   II there are no
transitional dynamics. A permanent change in the tax rate implies an
iediate shift in the level of the consution path and a permanent change
in the rate of growth of consumption, For our benchmark case of unitary
elasticity of substitution, increasing r from 20% to 30% results in a 1.63%

reduction in the growth rate. As sketched in Figure 2, the reduction in
rates    of growth induced by taxation is accompanied by an increase in the

initial level of consumption. This effect on consumption is typically

large—with         1 there is a 36.2% increase in initial consumption.                   Yet,

with    lower growth due to taxation, welfare unambiguously declines in this

economy.     Table 4 shows that this economy predicts dramatically higher values

for the welfare cost of taxation than the                 neoclassical model. Fundamentally,
this difference reflects the fact that                 the long run growth rate is affected

in the linear technology economy but not                 in the   neoclassical model.

    However, one aspect           of   our calibration procedure contributed to the

extraordinarilyhigh welfare cost predicted by the model.                     By requiring that

the discount rate       fi   be   such that the economy chooses to grow at 2% when the

income tax rate is 20% we endowed this artificial economy with extremely

patient agents (the value of             fi   we adopted was .9884).    The life—time utility
                                                                                       25




of these agents was severely affected when the tax       rate increase reduced the
returns  to private acculation of capital and hence the rate of growth.
     If we calibrate the model by requiring that without taxes (r=O) the
economy grows at 27.. the welfare effect is 16.3%, which is much lower than

the number we reported in Table 4 but still significantly greater than the
1.67, welfare cost for the neoclassical model, In this case the j3 adopted is
.9576 which coincides with the discount factor used in our benchmark
parameterization of the neoclassical model.
     As in the neoclassical model, the welfare cost of taxation depends on the

extent of inter-temporal substitution in consumption. When        2, for
example, the effect on the growth rate is .82'!, and the welfare cost is 63%.
When      1/2, the effect on the growth rate is 3.2'!, and the welfare cost is

727,.


IV. 3      The Two—Sector Endogenous Growth   odel
      When we consider tax   increases   that are uniformly   levied   on both sectors

I        the two—sector endogenous growth model has positive implications
    and 2,
that are broadly the same as the simple model of endogenous economic growth.
Only the existence of "adjustment costs" alters these implications, yielding
slightly     smaller growth effects.

      In   terms of welfare effects of uniform   sectoral taxation, the final line
of entries in Table 4 makes clear        that the welfare effects are also very

close to those we found for the simple model. The cost of a 10% increase in
taxation is around 60% of consumption. As in the simple endogenous growth
model, the growth and welfare effects are increased (decreased) if
individuals are more (less) willing to substitute over time. For o'             1/2,
                                                                                                26




the growth    rate falls   by 2.97% and   the welfare cost measure is         76%.    For   o   =

2,   the growth   rate falls by .77% and   the   welfare   cost   is 58%.

     Other tax experiments—such as taxing only sector 1 or considering

different    labor share   in the two sectors—generally       ily transitional
dynamics which requires that we explicitly solve for              colete  equilibrium
paths   as in the basic neoclassical model.        We plan to     pursue these
experiments    in our future research.


V.    Conclusions

      In this paper we proposed a model of economic growth in which a

corehensive measure of "technical progress" is made endogenous along the
lines suggested by Uzawa [1965]     ,   Lucas   [1988b] and Rebelo [1987].           By

interpreting this corehensive measure as social             investment in "human

capital," our analysis provides a potentially valuable formalization of the
ideas of Schultz t196i, i981] on economic development. Using this
interpretation, we build explicit thcrofoundations for a two sector model of
endogenous economic growth.      When we   calibrate our model       with parameter

values   that accord with the U.S. long run experience, we           reach three major

conclusions, as follows.

     First, we find that public policies can exert         a quantitatively large
influence on the average growth rates of         economies operating        in isolation.
Policies can display these effects because they influence private incentives
for accumalation of physical and human capital as in Schultz [1981]

Further,    these incentive effects of taxation are reinforced          in    open economies
that have access to     international capital markets. In both open and closed

economies, relatively small changes in tax rates can lead countries to

stagnate or even regress for lengthy periods, if these policies eliminate
                                                                                       27




incentives for growth. Our explanation of no—growth steady states"
contrasts with that offered by Becker, Murphy and Tamura [1988) and Azariadis
and Drazen [1988).         In those analyses, aspects of the technology give rise to

multiple    steady states so that economies with different initial conditions

may   converge   to steady states with different rates of growth       even   in the

absence of cross—country heterogeneity in public policy.

      Second, the effects of taxation depend importantly on aspects of the

production technology for new human capital, about which there is presently

insufficient information. In part, this reflects the fact that our human

capital good is a composite of many different activities and that we have not

taken a sufficiently precise stand on its essential content.           On the other

hand, there has been little research in labor economics since that of Rosen

[1976] and    Hecan        [1976] on the parameters of individual technologies for

investment    in   human   capital.   Our research indicates   that macroeconomic

policy analysis would be aided by additional microeconomic measurement.

      Third, since policies have the potential to influence the growth rate in

dels with      endogenous long run growth, there is generally a much larger

quantitative influence of policies on welfare than in the neoclassical model

where the growth rate is governed by the exogenous rate of technical

progress.     Some   experiments comparing neoclassical and     endogenous growth

           that
dels suggest               this difference can be quantitatively important.

      In   suary,    with the results of the present paper, we find new promise

for the hypotheses of Schultz [1981) that incentive effects of policy can

influence economic activity—taxation can readily lead to development traps

and growth miracles.         Models of endogenous economic growth thus provide new

analytical paths for studying old problems in the economics of development.

    °This paper        is a substantially revised version of one prepared for the

conference on 'The Problem of Development" held at the State University of

New York at Buffalo         in   May 1988.   The analysis of the two sector model in our

work,    particularly in its open economy versions, draws heavily on some recent

research by       Marianne Baxter     [1988L     We   also thank   her   for pointing out the
relationship between our model building activity and the arguments of TW.
Schultz [19811. Finally, we have benefited from coents by Stanley Fischer

and Arnold Harberger—whodiscussed the paper at the Buffalo conference—as
well as by Kenneth Judd, who discussed the paper at the Summer Econometric
Society meetings.         Support from the National Science Foundation is gratefully

acknowledged.
       1This class     of models   is very large,     including structures with many
capital       stocks   in the growth "core" and with nonreproducible factors outside

the growth 'core' (Rebelo [1987]); or with steady states that are only

asymptotically obtained           (Jones and   Manuelli    [1990]).
    2Lucas [1980)provides cogent arguments for combining aggregate and
microeconomic evidence to restrict dynamic macroeconomic models of business
fluctuations. Other applications of this strategy include Mehra and
Prescott's [1985] work on asset pricing and recent work on real business
cycles,       as surveyed by King, Plosser and Rebelo          [1988a,b).
    3As is      conventional with constant elasticity specifications, we assume

that   o-=1    corresponds to     logarithmic momentary utility.
    4A   neoclassical production function is constant                 returns to   scale, concave,

twice continuously differentiable, satisfies the Inada conditions, and

specifies that each production factor is essential in production.
                                                                                                   34




      5Vith    a twenty percent tax          rate on final     output, this nunber    is consistent
with the 6.5X figure used in King and Rebelo 11989], Let the before—tax
marginal product of capital be MPK and the alter tax marginal product be
(l—r) NFL The   rate of return to capital investment is then (1—r) XPK — 6. If
we take the before-tax rate of return, 1(PK — 5, to be .065, then using 6.10

and r.2,  we arrive at an after—tax rate of return of .8(165) — .10     .032.
    The equivalence between output and input taxation under constant returns
to scale is discussed by Break 11974] and XcLure 11975]; Atkinson and
Stiglitz      11980]      provide a convenient suary.
         average tax rate is clearly a crude proxy for the income tax rate in
      7The

our model but we view it as a natural starting point given that it is very
hard to      map   the    complex   tax systems that     most  countries adopt into stylized
descriptions            that can   be   used in   calibration exercises such as ours. For

general      discussions of these difficulties and              suggestions for     improvements on
our proxy see Braun 11989], NcGratten 11989] and Wynne 11988].

      8mese two requirements imply values of A and                    as follows.     First, the

value of A is .1650, since the before—tax interest rate is                   6.5 and     the

depreciation rate is 10.                 The value of   /3   is then given by the equation

              =    1,   where the alter—tax interest rate, R(r), is         3.2'!..


      An     important      assumption     in our approach is that     the changes in
productivity susasarized by the evolution of the composite human capital good

are   embodied in         the representative worker.          See Romer (1986, 1988b] for

analyses that do not rely on this embodiment assumption.

      10By   Dg(x), we mean         the derivative of the       function g with respect to x;

correspondingly, D2g(x) demotes the second derivative.

      11The   details of this procedure are             reported   in Appendix A
                                                                                      35




    121t also     depends positively on the number of hours, N, which    is exogenous

in our   model.     In economies with variable labor supply, therefore, policy may

affect human      capital   accumnilation via the supply of labor, a channel not

considered here.

    13The   U.S.,   Japan and the U.K. follow this tax system.    An alternative tax

convention is the "territorial system" which exempts from taxes         all capital
income earned     abroad.     See Swenson [1989] for a detailed discussion.

    14TO   compute the closed economy general equilibrium, essentially, we add

the requirement that                R   1 to the preceding analysis.   See appendix



    '5This method is closely related to that used by Hamilton in his [1987]

study of the effects of taxation on risk taking. Our measure of the welfare
effects of taxation would not be appropriate if we were addressing normative
questions such as the design of an optimal tax system, since we do not impose
that the tax revenue mist be the same in the two regimes compared. If this
restriction were imposed, our welfare measure would coincide with the
compensating variation used by Hamilton [1987] . We thank Ken Judd for making
us aware of Hamiltons work.

Cal ibrat ion

        For the purpose of determining the parameters of the steady state to
tcb       observed average growth and real interest rates, we proceed as follows.
Firat      we    postulate     CES    forms for the F 1 and         F.
                                                                     2   functions      so that F

Then,     we compute the steady state according to the following algorithm:



Step 1:         Given          1         and         invert    (1+r)                          +         to
