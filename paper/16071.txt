Business Cycles With A Common Trend in Neutral and Investment-Specific Productivity

JEL No. E32

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper identifies a new source of business-cycle fluctuations. Namely, a common stochastic trend
in neutral and investment-specific productivity. We document that in U.S. postwar quarterly data
total factor productivity (TFP) and the relative price of investment are cointegrated. We show theoretically
that TFP and the relative price of investment are cointegrated if and only if neutral and investment-specific
productivity share a common stochastic trend. We econometrically estimate an RBC model augmented
with a number of real rigidities and driven by a multitude of shocks. We find that in the context ofour
estimated model, innovations in the common stochastic trend explain a sizable fraction of the unconditional
variances of output, consumption, investment, and hours.

1    Introduction
Since the seminal work of Kydland and Prescott (1982) much attention has been devoted
to the role of technology shocks as a source of business cycles. The early contributions,
including that of Kydland and Prescott, limited attention to technology shocks that take
the form of stationary disturbances to neutral productivity. Subsequent contributions, such
as those by King, Plosser, and Rebelo (1988), Cogley and Nason (1995), and Rotemberg
and Woodford (1996), study models in which technology shocks take the form of permanent
disturbances to neutral productivity. More recently, a number of studies, starting with the
work of Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (2000), have emphasized the role of stationary
investment-specific productivity shocks as an engine of business cycles.
   Following the introduction of the investment-specific technology shock, business-cycle
researchers turned to studying the importance of this shock relative to that of the neutral
productivity shock as a source of aggregate fluctuations. Fisher (2006), using VAR methods
and long-run identification techniques, finds that the majority of business-cycle fluctuations
are driven by investment-specific productivity shocks. Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti
(2008) arrive at a similar conclusion in the context of an estimated structural model. By
contrast, Smets and Wouters (2007) find that investment-specific productivity shocks play
a negligible role in explaining output movements at business-cycle frequencies and assign
instead a significant role to shifts in neutral technology.
   The motivation for our analysis originates in two observations regarding the assumed sto-
chastic properties of technology shocks in the literature referred to above. One observation
concerns the fact that all existing studies assume that neutral and investment-specific pro-
ductivity shocks follow independent stochastic processes. This assumption, however, is not
based on empirical evidence, but appears to be made in a purely ad-hoc fashion. The sec-
ond observation is that existing studies vary widely regarding the assumptions made about
the long-run univariate properties of neutral and investment-specific productivity. Fisher
(2006), for example, assumes that both the neutral and the investment-specific technology
shocks follow independent nonstationary processes. Smets and Wouters (2007) assume in-
stead that both, neutral and investment-specific technology shocks, follow independent but
trend-stationary processes. Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2008) model neutral pro-
ductivity shocks as having a nonstationary stochastic component and the investment-specific
technology shock as having a trend-stationary component.
   The first step in our analysis is to provide an empirical foundation for modeling the sto-
chastic properties of the underlying productivity shocks. To this end, we begin by conducting
an empirical analysis of the univariate and joint long-run properties of total factor productiv-


                                               1
ity and the relative price of investment goods. We find that both of these time series contain
a stochastic nonstationary component. This finding, together with the implications of a
wide class of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models linking the long-run properties
of TFP and the price of investment to those of neutral and investment-specific technology,
imply that both neutral and investment-specific productivity shocks should be modeled as
containing a stochastic trend. In turn, the requirement that both types of productivity shock
contain a stochastic trend can be fulfilled either by assuming that each productivity process
contains an independent stochastic trend or by assuming that the two series share a single
stochastic trend. Here again, we let the data inform us about which of these two model-
ing strategies is empirically more compelling. We therefore perform cointegration tests on
TFP and the price of investment. We find that these two series appear to share a common
stochastic trend. This finding calls for a change in the way productivity shocks should be
modeled in business cycle studies. Specifically, the central implication of our empirical result
is the emergence of a new source of business cycles, namely, a common stochastic trend in
neutral and investment-specific productivity.
   Accordingly, the second step in our investigation is to gauge the importance of our newly
identified shock as a source of business cycles. To this end, we estimate a dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium model driven by a multitude of shocks, including shocks to a common
stochastic trend in neutral and investment-specific productivity. The skeleton of our the-
oretical model is the standard RBC structure. We augment this structure with four real
frictions: habit formation in consumption, investment adjustment costs, variable capacity
utilization, and imperfect competition in labor markets. These frictions have been shown to
improve the RBC model’s ability to match U.S. postwar data at business-cycle frequencies.
We assume that business cycles are driven by seven shocks: two shocks to the common
stochastic trend in neutral and investment-specific productivity, a stationary neutral pro-
ductivity shock, a stationary investment-specific productivity shock, a preference shock, a
wage-markup shock, and a government spending shock. We estimate the model by maxi-
mum likelihood using postwar U.S. quarterly data on output, consumption, investment, and
hours. We find that in the context of our estimated model, the common stochastic trend in
neutral and investment-specific productivity plays a sizable role in driving business cycles.
   An important byproduct of our investigation is to provide an econometric justification
for the common practice of associating the relative price of investment with an investment-
specific productivity shock. Such association is valid only if the production technology
transforming consumption goods into investment goods is linear. If instead this technology
is not linear, then the relative price of investment is an endogenous variable that depends not
only on the (exogenous) investment-specific technology shock, but also on the (endogenous)


                                               2
amount of resources devoted to the production of investment goods. We estimate the cur-
vature of the investment-good production function and find that this production technology
is indeed linear. This finding validates the customary practice of treating the relative price
of investment as an exogenous variable embodying investment-specific technological change.
    The remainder of this paper is organized in eight sections. Section 2 presents a statistical
analysis of the univariate and joint long-run properties of TFP and the relative price of
investment. Section 3 presents the theoretical framework through which we evaluate the im-
portance of the common productivity shock. Section 4 demonstrates theoretically that TFP
and the relative price of investment are cointegrated if and only if neutral and investment-
specific productivity are cointegrated. Section 5 presents a vector-error-correction model
of the joint law of motion of the permanent components of neutral and investment-specific
productivity. Section 6 presents the estimation of the model and discusses its fit. Section 7
analyzes the predicted role of the common productivity shock in generating business cycles.
Section 8 provides sensitivity analysis. Section 9 concludes.


2       A Common Stochastic Trend in TFP and the Price
        of Investment
In this section, we empirically investigate two issues. One is whether TFP and the relative
price of investment posses a stochastic trend. The second is whether these two series are
cointegrated, that is, whether they are driven by a common stochastic trend.
    Our unit-root and cointegration tests are conducted using quarterly U.S. data ranging
from 1948:Q1 to 2006:Q4. The two time series are total factor productivity and the relative
price of investment. Total factor productivity is taken from Beaudry and Lucke (2009).
This time series covers the nonfarm business sector and is adjusted for variations in capital
capacity utilization. The time series for the relative price of investment is based on our own
calculations following the methodology proposed in Fisher (2006).1


2.1     Unit Root Tests
We begin by conducting tests of the null hypothesis that the logarithms of TFP and the
relative price of investment have a unit root.2 Table 1 presents the results. The table shows

that under both the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and the Dickey-Fuller Generalized
Least Squares (DFGLS) tests the null hypothesis of a unit root cannot be rejected at the
standard 5 percent confidence level for both TFP and the relative price of investment.3
    An alternative test of nonstationarity is to pose the null hypothesis that the time series
is stationary in levels. The KPSS test is designed for this purpose. Table 2 displays the
results of applying this test to TFP and the relative price of investment. We perform the
test for lags ranging from 1 to 7 quarters, including always the possibility of a linear time
trend. For both variables and for all lag specifications considered, the KPSS test rejects the
hypothesis of stationarity of the individual time series at the 5 percent significance level.
   We also perform the ADF and KPSS unit root tests on the growth rates of total factor
productivity and the relative price of investment. The results of these tests suggests that
both growth rates are stationary.
   3
     In performing the ADF test, a constant but no time trend is included. The results are robust to including
a time trend.

      Note: The cointegration tests are performed on the logarithms of total factor
      productivity (corrected for variations in capacity utilization) and the relative
      price of investment. The sample period is 1948:Q1 to 2006:Q4. The variable r
      denotes the number of cointegrating vectors. AIC stands for Akaike Information
      Criterion.


    Based on the unit-root tests performed above, we conclude that the logarithms of total
factor productivity and the relative price of investment appear to be integrated processes of
order one. That is, these two time series contain a stochastic trend. The implication of this
empirical finding for modeling business cycles is to rule out model specifications in which
either TFP or the price of investment or both are trend stationary. Such specifications are
the most frequently used ones in the existing literature on the sources of business cycles. Our
empirical findings thus far suggest that in modeling business cycles, the stochastic processes
for neutral and investment-specific technology shocks should incorporate stochastic trends.
   A further question regarding the appropriate modeling of neutral and investment-specific
productivity shocks that has not been contemplated in the existing literature but that
emerges naturally once the problem is analyzed from the perspective we are proposing is
whether neutral and investment-specific productivity shocks are driven by two independent
stochastic trends or by a single common one. We turn to this issue next.


2.2    Cointegration of TFP and the Relative Price of Investment
Thus far, we have established that both TFP and the relative price of investment posses a
nonstationary stochastic component. The question we wish to investigate here is whether
these two stochastic components are cointegrated or independent from each other. In other
words, we wish to test the hypothesis that there is no cointegrating relationship between
TFP and the price of investment. Rejection of this hypothesis would imply that the two
time series are cointegrated. That is, that they are driven by a single stochastic trend.
   To identify the number of independent stochastic trends that define the nonstationary
components of TFP and the relative price of investment, we perform Johansen’s trace test for
cointegration. The results are shown in table 3. We set the lag length following the Akaike

                                              5
information criterion. The Johansen test rejects the null hypothesis of zero cointegrating
vectors at high confidence levels when no deterministic trend is included in the system (p-
value of 0.00) and when a deterministic trend is included (p-value of 0.01). The hypothesis
of no cointegrating relationships is rejected at a confidence level of 10 percent when an
orthogonal trend is included (p-value of 0.07).
    We conclude from the present empirical analysis that the hypothesis that TFP and the
relative price of investment are driven by a single stochastic trend cannot be dismissed off
hand. We do not conclude that this is the only empirically viable characterization of the
long-run behavior of the TFP and investment price series. But our analysis speaks clearly for
covering a gap created by the exclusive attention that has been paid thus far in the business-
cycle literature to either models featuring independent stochastic trends in TFP and the
price of investment (e.g., Fisher, 2006; and Altig, et al., 2005) or to models maintaining the
assumption that the relative price of investment, or TFP or both are trend stationary (e.g.,
Smets and Wouters, 2007; and Justiniano et al., 2008). Accordingly, the remainder of this
paper studies the consequences for business-cycle analysis of our novel assumption that TFP
and the relative price of investment are cointegrated I(1) processes. Such analysis necessarily
involves the use of a theoretical model of the business cycle, which we develop in the next
section.


3    The Model
We develop a model of the business cycle for two purposes: First, we wish to establish
what assumptions about the underlying shocks would give rise to the cointegration pattern
between TFP and the price of investment documented above. Second, we wish to estimate,
in the context of a structural DSGE model the fraction of the variance of output and other
macroeconomic indicators explained by our newly identify source of aggregate fluctuations,
namely shocks to the common stochastic trend in TFP and the Price of investment.
    Our model economy is a real-business-cycle structure augmented with four real rigidi-
ties, habit formation in consumption, variable capacity utilization, investment adjustment
costs, and imperfect competition in labor markets. The driving forces include stationary and
nonstationary neutral and investment-specific productivity shocks, preference shocks, gov-
ernment spending shocks, and wage-markup shocks. This battery of shocks has been shown
to be important for explaining business-cycle fluctuations in developed economies (see, for
example, Smets and Wouters, 2007; and Justiniano, et al., 2009).




                                              6
3.1    Households
Consider an economy populated by a large number of identical agents with preferences
described over consumption, Ct , and hours worked, ht ,

                                     X
                                     ∞
                                E0         β t bt U (Ct − θCt−1 , ht ),                   (1)
                                     t=0


where β denotes the subjective discount factor, bt is an exogenous stochastic preference
shock, and θ ∈ [0, 1) measures the degree of internal habit formation. The period utility
function U is assumed to be of the form

                          U (x, y) = [(x(1 − y)γ )1−σ − 1]/(1 − σ).

Households are assumed to own physical capital. The capital stock, denoted Kt , is assumed
to evolve over time according to the following law of motion
                                                                   g 
                                                                     It
                        Kt+1 = (1 − δ(ut ))Kt +         Itg    1−S   g    ,               (2)
                                                                    It−1

where Itg denotes physical units of investment goods. Investment goods are produced using
consumption goods via a technology of the form

                                           Itg = at Xta H(It ),                           (3)

where It denotes gross investment measured in terms of physical units of consumption goods,
and at and Xta are, respectively, stationary and nonstationary investment-specific technology
shocks. The production function H is assumed to be of the form

                                              H(I) = I ξ ,

with ξ ∈ (0, 1]. In a decentralized version of this economy, the relative price of investment
goods in terms of consumption goods, which we denote by pIt , is given by

                                                        1
                                       pIt =                        .
                                                 at Xta H 0 (It )

In the special case in which the production function of investment goods takes the linear
form (ξ = 1), we have that the relative price of investment is simply given by the inverse
of at Xta . This is the case most commonly assumed in the related literature. Rather than


                                                    7
imposing this assumption, we will let the data inform us about the curvature of the function
H.
   Owners of physical capital can control the intensity with which the capital stock is uti-
lized. Formally, we let ut measure capacity utilization in period t. The effective amount of
capital services households supply to firms in period t is given by ut Kt . We assume that
increasing the intensity of capital utilization entails a cost in the form of a faster rate of
depreciation. That is, we assume that the depreciation rate is an increasing and convex
function δ(ut ) of the rate of capacity utilization. We adopt the functional form

                            δ(u) = δ0 + δ1 (u − 1) + δ2 /2(u − 1)2

for the function mapping the rate of capacity utilization to the depreciation rate.
   The function S introduces investment adjustment costs. It is assumed that in the deter-
ministic steady state the function S satisfies S = S 0 = 0 and S 00 > 0. These assumptions
imply the absence of adjustment costs up to first order in the vicinity of the steady state.
They also imply that at the steady state the relative price of installed capital in terms of
new capital goods, or Tobin’s q, equals unity. We assume that the function S takes the form

                                                           g
                                   S(x) = (κ/2)(x − µI )2 ,

                                      g
where κ > 0 is a parameter and µI denotes the growth rate of Itg along the deterministic
growth path.
   The budget constraint of the household is given by

                                           Wt
                               Ct + It =      ht + Rt ut Kt + Φt ,                        (4)
                                           µt

where Rt denotes the rental rate of capital and Φt denotes lump-sum profits net of lump-
sum taxes. The variable µt ≥ 1 denotes an exogenous wage-markup shock. This markup
represents a wedge between the wage rate paid by firms, Wt , and the marginal wage rate
received by households, Wt /µt < Wt . This wedge reflects the monopoly power of labor
unions. The union rebates all profits to households in a lump-sum fashion. For more details
of the underlying labor-market structure, see the appendix.

3.2     Firms
Output, denoted Yt , is produced with a homogeneous-of-degree-one production function
that takes as inputs effective units of capital, ut Kt , and labor services, ht . The technology is
buffeted by a transitory neutral productivity shock denoted zt and by a permanent neutral
productivity shock denoted Xtz . Formally, the production function is given by

                                        Yt = zt F (ut Kt , Xtz ht ).                                   (5)

We assume that the production function F takes the familiar Cobb-Douglas form

                                           F (x, y) = xα y 1−α.

    The demand for capital and labor services are given, respectively, by

                                        zt F1 (ut Kt , Xtz ht ) = Rt ,

4     Theoretical Implications for Cointegration
In section 2, we presented evidence suggesting that total factor productivity and the relative
price of investment are cointegrated processes. In our model economy, TFP and the price of
investment are given, respectively, by

                                         T F Pt = zt (Xtz )1−α ,

and
                                                        1
                                          pIt =                 .
                                                  at Xta ξItξ−1
Recall that zt and at are stationary exogenous random variables, whereas Xtz and Xta are
nonstationary exogenous random variables. Along a balanced growth path with a stationary
investment share in output, the trend of investment must equal the trend in output, which
we denote by XtY . In turn, the equilibrium trend of output along the balanced growth path
can be shown to be related to the productivity trends Xtz and Xta as follows:
                                                     1−α            α
                                     XtY = (Xtz ) 1−αξ (Xta ) 1−αξ .


                                                    10
Our empirical finding that the logarithms of TFP and the price of investment are cointegrated
means that there exists a scalar ζ such that

                                             T F Ptζ pIt

is a stationary process. Using the definitions of TFP and pIt given above and the expression
for the equilibrium trend in output, it follows that this cointegration restriction implies that

                                        (Xtz )ζ(1−αξ)+(1−ξ)
                                                 Xta

must be stationary. This last expression states that if TFP and pIt are cointegrated, then Xtz
and Xta must themselves be cointegrated. By a similar argument, one can readily establish
that the converse is also true. That is, if Xtz and Xta are cointegrated, then so are TFP and
the price of investment. We summarize this result in the following proposition:

Proposition 1 In the model with equilibrium conditions given in section 3.3, TFP and the
price of investment are cointegrated if and only if Xtz and Xta are cointegrated.

    An alternative way to arrive at the conclusion that neutral and investment-specific pro-
ductivity are driven by a common stochastic trend is to study the cointegration properties
of stock prices and TFP in U.S. postwar data through the lens of a theoretical model.
    There are two standard theoretical measures of the value of the stock market. One is
given by the value of the stock of physical capital calculated as the product of the capital
stock, Kt , and marginal Tobin’s Q, Qt . Under this measure, the value of the stock market
is given by Qt Kt . It can be shown that in our model, the trend in Qt Kt is the same as the
trend in output, XtY , which, as established earlier in this paper, is a linear combination of the
trend in neutral technology, Xtz , and the trend in investment-specific technology, Xta . The
second standard theoretical measure of the value of the stock market is given by the value
of the firm, Vt , which can be written recursively as Vt = Yt − Wt ht − It + βbt Et Λt+1 /Λt Vt+1 .
That is, the value of the firm is given by the present discounted value of output net of wage
payments and investment spending. It can be shown that the equilibrium trend of Vt is the
same as that of output, XtY , which as mentioned before is a geometric combination of the
trends in neutral and investment specific productivity, Xtz and Xta .
   In sum, regardless of which of the two definitions of the value of the stock market one
uses, its trend is given by a combination of the trends in neutral and investment specific
productivity, Xtz and Xta . At the same time, the trend in TFP is, as we already deduced,
given by (Xtz )1−α , and therefore depends only upon the trend in neutral productivity. It

                                                 11
follows from these theoretical arguments that stock prices and total factor productivity are
cointegrated if and only if Xtz and Xta share a common stochastic trend. We summarize this
result in the following proposition:

Proposition 2 In the model with equilibrium conditions given in section 3.3, TFP and stock
prices are cointegrated if and only if Xtz and Xta are cointegrated.

    The key empirical question is therefore whether stock prices and TFP appear to be I(1)
cointegrated processes in postwar U.S. data. To this end, we measure stock prices by the
Standard and Poor 500 index deflated by the GDP deflator and expressed in per capita terms
by dividing by the population between 15 and 65 years of age. The Dickey Fuller test fails to
reject the null hypothesis of a unit root at standard confidence levels in specifications with
and without a linear trend. Similarly, the KPSS test rejects the hypothesis of stationarity
at standard confidence levels with or without the assumption of a linear trend. Finally, the
Johansen cointegration test rejects the hypothesis of no cointegration relationship between
stock prices and TFP when no linear trend is included, when a linear trend is included, and
when an orthogonal linear trend is included. Beaudry and Portier (2006) also find that TFP
and stock prices are cointegrated time series. This evidence provides further support to the
strategy of modeling productivity in the neutral and investment-specific sectors as sharing
a common stochastic trend.


5     Modeling Cointegration Between Neutral and Investment-
      Specific Productivity
Based on the results contained in propositions 1 and 2, we impose the following cointegration
relationship between Xtz and Xta :

                           xt ≡ ψ ln(Xtz ) − ln(Xta ) is stationary.                       (7)

Without loss of generality, we assume that the deterministic steady-state value of xt is zero.
Let
                                                 Xtz
                                         µzt ≡    z
                                                 Xt−1
and
                                                 Xta
                                         µat ≡    a

denote, respectively, the gross growth rates of Xtz and Xta . Then, we postulate the following
vector error correction model (VECM) for the joint law of motion of Xtz and Xta :
   "                  #       "              #"                         #       "        #            "             #"         #
       ln(µzt /µz )               ρ11 ρ12          ln(µzt−1 /µz )                   κ1                    D11 D12        1t
                          =                                                 +                xt−1 +                                ,
       ln(µat /µa )               ρ21 ρ22          ln(µat−1 /µa )                   κ2                    D21 D22        2t

where the innovations to the common trend in neutral and investment-specific productivity,
1t and 2t are iid normal with mean zero and variances σ21 and σ22 , respectively. Without
loss of generality, we set D11 = D22 = 1 and D12 = 0.
    We refer to 1t and 2t as the common shocks to neutral and investment-specific productiv-
ity. And we refer to zt as the neutral productivity shock and to at as the investment-specific
productivity shock. The central goal of the remainder of the paper is to ascertain the joint
contribution of the common technology shocks 1t and 2t to business-cycle fluctuations and
to compare it to the contributions of the sector-specific productivity shocks zt and at . Our
VECM formulation encompasses, as polar cases, the two most common formulations of shock
dynamics in the related literature. In one of these formulations, it is assumed that both TFP
and the price of investment are stationary (e.g., Smets and Wouters, 2007). This setup arises
when one assumes that σ1 = σ2 = 0. The second case is one in which TFP and the price of
investment are assumed to possess independent stochastic trends (e.g., Fisher, 2006). This
case arises when ρ21 = ρ12 = κ1 = κ2 = D21 = 0. As discussed earlier, the key implication
of the empirical analysis of section 2 is that both of these formulations are strongly rejected
by the data.
   In addition to the shocks to the common trend in neutral and investment-specific pro-
ductivity, our model features five stationary shocks: a neutral productivity shock, zt , an
investment-specific productivity shock, at , a preference shock, bt , a government spending
shock, gt , and a wage-markup shock, µt .
   These exogenous random variables are all assumed to follow univariate AR(1) processes:

                                                 ln zt = ρz ln zt−1 + σz zt ,

respectively. We assume that the trend component of government spending is cointegrated
with that of output. Specifically, we assume that

                                            Gt = gt XtG

where XtG denotes the trend component of government spending, gt is the cyclical component
of government spending, assumed to be exogenous and stochastic, and ρxg is a smoothing
parameter controlling the speed of transmission of shocks to the trend in output to the trend
in government spending.


6      Model Estimation
Our main goal is to ascertain the contribution to business-cycle fluctuations of the novel
shock we have introduced, namely, the common stochastic trend in neutral and investment-
specific productivity. In our VECM formulation this common stochastic trend is driven by
two innovations, 1t and 2t . We do so using the model economy developed in section 3 as the
data generating process. We calibrate a subset of the structural parameters of the model
and estimate the remaining parameters using maximum likelihood.
   We assign a value of 2 to the preference parameter σ, a value of 0.025 to the steady-state
rate of depreciation δ0 , a value of 0.99 to the subjective discount factor β, a value of 10
percent to the wage markup, a value of 20 percent to the share of government spending in
output, a value of 1.0049 to the steady-state gross quarterly growth rate of output, µy , and a
                                                                                                  I
value of 0.9957 to the steady state gross quarterly growth rate of the price of investment, µp .
We normalize the steady-state rate of capacity utilization, u, to unity. This normalization
pins down the parameter δ1 . Table 4 summarizes the calibration. We estimate the remaining
structural parameters of the model by maximum likelihood.
    The log-linearized version of our dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium model is of the
form
                                        yt = yt∗ + η me me

where yt is a vector containing four observables, namely, the growth rates of output, con-
sumption, and investment, and the logarithm of hours all expressed in deviations from their
means. The variables in yt are measured with error. The true values, contained in the vector
yt∗ , are unobservable. The measurement errors are captured by the term η me me          me
                                                                               t , where t
is a normally distributed i.i.d. vector of order four with mean zero and variance/covariance
matrix equal to the identity matrix. The matrix η me is diagonal and of order 4 by 4. We
estimate the elements of its diagonal. We constrain the measurement errors to capture at
most 25 percent of the variance of the corresponding variables. The vector xt is unobservable
and contains the states of the system. The matrices gx and hx are functions of the calibrated
and estimated structural parameters of the model. The structural disturbances are collected
in the 7-by-1 vector t , which distributes normally with mean zero and variance/covariance
matrix equal to the identity matrix. The matrix η is a function of the standard deviations
σi for i = 1, 2, a, z, b, µ, g.
    We estimate by maximum likelihood the parameters defining the exogenous processes
driving business cycles in our model along with other structural parameters. Specifically,
we estimate the parameters defining the VECM model for the evolution of the cointegrated
trends Xtz and Xta , which are ρij , κi , and σi for i, j = 1, 2 and D21 . We also estimate
the standard deviations and serial correlations of the AR(1) processes governing the laws of
motion of the remaining five exogenous shocks. We further estimate two preference parame-
ters, θ and γ, four technology parameters, α, ξ, κ, and δ2 , and the smoothing parameter for
government purchases, ρxg .
    We estimate the model on U.S. quarterly data ranging from 1948:Q1 to 2006:Q4. Ta-

methods and in the context of a DSGE model the curvature of the technology transforming
consumption goods into investment goods, embodied in the parameter ξ. Our estimate shows
that this production function appears to be linear (ξ = 1). This implies that the relative price
of investment coincides with the inverse of investment-specific productivity, an assumption
maintained in much of the existing literature on investment-specific technology shocks, and
one that is often criticized for not being based on econometric evidence. The variances of
the measurement errors for the growth rates of output, consumption, and investment attain
their maximum allowed values of 25 percent of the variances of the corresponding time series,
whereas the estimated measurement error in hours is nil.


6.1    Model Fit
Table 6 presents predicted and observed second moments of output growth, consumption
growth, investment growth, and hours. The model fits the data quite well along all dimen-
sions considered in the table. It correctly predicts the volatility ranking hours, investment,
output, consumption. The model also captures the procyclicality of consumption and invest-
ment. Finally, as shown in the bottom panel of table 6, the model satisfactorily replicates
the serial correlations of output growth, consumption growth, investment growth, and hours.

7     Common-Trend Shocks and Business Cycles
How important is the common stochastic trend in neutral and investment-specific produc-
tivity identified in this paper in generating business cycles? To address this question, we
compute the variance decomposition of key macroeconomic variables implied by our esti-
mated DSGE model. Table 7 displays the shares of the predicted variances of output growth,
consumption growth, investment growth and hours attributable to the common stochastic
trend, i.e., to 1t and 2t jointly, and to each of the remaining five driving forces included in
the model. Shocks to the common trend emerge as the main drivers of business cycles in our
estimated model. They explain about three fourth of the variances of output and investment
growth and about one third of the predicted variances of consumption growth and the level
of hours. This result is remarkable because in the existing literature, which has not allowed
for the possibility of a common stochastic trend in neutral and investment-specific produc-
tivity, the lion’s share of business-cycle fluctuations is typically allocated to shifts in either
neutral or investment-specific productivity. In our model, by contrast, these two sources of
uncertainty explain each a negligible fraction of the predicted movements in output growth,
consumption growth, investment growth, and hours.
    To gauge the pattern of comovement induced by the common-trend shocks, figure 1
displays the impulse response functions to one-standard-error innovations in the common-
trend shocks 1t and 2t . The common-trend shock 1t , shown with a solid line, generates
an expansion in output, consumption, and investment. Hours initially contract due to the
wealth effect caused by the increase in productivity. After the initial contraction, hours
display a hump-shaped response, expanding gradually at first, reaching a peak response six
quarters after the innovation and then declining slowly toward their steady-state value. The
initial contraction in hours is in line with a number of empirical studies that use Blanchard-
Quah-type methods to identify the effect of permanent shifts in productivity. The negative
response of hours to permanent shifts in productivity documented by empirical studies has

been interpreted by some as being at odds with the predictions of the RBC model. Figure 1
shows that such interpretation is misplaced. In fact, one can state more generally that a
weak or negative response of hours to productivity shocks that are either stationary and
highly persistent or nonstationary is a quite robust prediction of the RBC model.
   The second common-trend shock, 2t , whose impulse responses are shown with broken line
in figure 1, possesses the characteristics of a technological diffusion. It generates an increase
in both neutral and investment-specific productivity in the long run, but a decline in both
types of productivity during the initial transition. The response of productivity resembles
the adoption of new technologies that, by replacing old, well-established ones, induces a
temporary slump in productivity. This diffused response of productivity translates into an
initial contraction in output, investment and employment. All of these variables later recover
and by period ten the economy is booming. Forward-looking consumers understand that the
initial slump is merely a prelude to permanently higher output and as a consequence choose
to increase spending from the outset. Our estimates show that the diffused, permanent
productivity shock 2t is a key driver of business cycles; it alone explains more than half of
the predicted variations in output and investment.


8     Sensitivity Analysis
In this section we analyze the robustness of our results to three modifications of the baseline
setup. The first robustness check analyzes the role of measurement errors. Our rationale for
including measurement error is twofold. First, our theoretical model is of a closed economy.
The data we confront the model with, however, is taken from an open economy. As a
result, domestic absorption necessarily equals output in the model but not in the data. The
introduction of measurement error is meant to partially bridge this theoretical gap. Second,
it is widely accepted that NIPA data is not free of measurement error, particularly in the time
series for private spending. We begin by addressing the question of whether the importance
of common-trend shocks is sensitive to the fact that the variances of measurement errors
are capped at 25 percent of the variance of the associated observables. To this end, we
reestimate a version of the model in which measurement errors are unrestricted. We find
that in this case, measurement error explains 30 percent of the variance of output growth,
25 percent of the variance of consumption growth, 33 percent of the variance of investment
growth, and virtually nothing of the variance of hours. These figures are not too different
from those that emerge from our baseline estimation. In fact, a likelihood-ratio test of the
null hypothesis that the variance of measurement errors are no greater than 25 percent of
the variance of the associated observables cannot be rejected in favor of the alternative of

                                               20
unrestricted measurement errors. Moreover, the unrestricted estimation assigns an even
greater importance to shocks to the common productivity trend than does the restricted
estimation that caps measurement error at 25 percent. Specifically, in the unrestricted case,
1t and 2t explain jointly 86 percent of the predicted variance of output growth, 36 percent
of consumption growth, 93 percent of investment growth, and 48 percent of hours.
   An alternative setup is one in which a theoretical model that does not allow for mea-
surement error is forced to explain data that are strongly suspected of suffering from some
amount of measurement error. We address this issue by testing the null hypothesis that mea-
surement errors are nil in all variables against the alternative hypothesis that measurement
errors are unrestricted. We find that the null hypothesis of no measurement error is strongly
rejected by the data. The associated likelihood-ratio test has a p-value of about virtually
0. Even in this case, the common-trend shocks are estimated to be important drivers of the
business cycle, explaining 42 percent of output growth, 32 percent of consumption growth,
and 50 percent of investment growth.
   A further sensitivity exercise consists in extending the sample to include the great reces-
sion of 2008. Estimating the model over the period 1948:1 to 2010:1 delivers results that are
consistent with our baseline estimates. Specifically, over the longer sample the common-trend
shocks explain 83 percent of the variance of output growth, 33 percent of the variance of
consumption growth, 97 percent of the variance of investment growth, and 39 percent of the
variance of hours. The most salient feature of the great-recession years is the unprecedented
collapse in hours worked. Specifically, between 2006:4 and 2010:1, actual hours worked per
capita fell by almost 15 percent, reaching the lowest level in the entire sample. There is an
ongoing literature aimed at identifying the sources of the great contraction of 2008. This
literature has not yet arrived at a definite conclusion regarding the type of shock that is
responsible for it. There is relative consensus, however, in that problems originated in the
financial sector had much to do with the downturn. Because our theoretical model abstracts
from both financial frictions and financial disturbances, we hesitate to include the last three
years in our baseline sample.
    We have pointed out elsewhere (Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2008) that DSGE models that
include an investment-specific productivity shock but do not include the price of investment
in the set of observables tend to deliver business cycles in which the predicted ratio of the
standard deviation of the growth rate of the price of investment to the standard deviation of
the growth rate of TFP is significantly higher than its empirical counterpart. This problem
also arises in the present study. As a partial remedy, we perform a constrained maximum-
likelihood estimation in which we restrict the predicted ratio of the standard deviations of
the price of investment and TFP to be at most 0.65. In the data, this ratio has a mean of


                                              21
0.55 and a standard deviation of 0.05. So our upper bound of 0.65 is the sum of the mean
ratio of standard deviations and two standard deviations of the ratio. Under the constrained
estimate, the common-trend shocks continue to explain the bulk of movements in output,
consumption, and investment. However, the fit of the model deteriorates when the constraint
is imposed.


9    Conclusion
In this paper we identify a new source of business cycles. It takes the form of a common sto-
chastic trend in neutral and investment-specific productivity. We identify this novel source of
aggregate fluctuations by means of three empirical facts whose joint theoretical implications
have been overlooked in the large related literature. Namely, the facts that TFP contains a
unit root, that the relative price of investment contains a unit root, and that TFP and the
price of investment appear to be cointegrated processes. A key insight of this paper is that
these three facts can be theoretically reconciled if and only if neutral and investment-specific
productivity are assumed to be cointegrated processes.
   The second contribution of our investigation is to quantify the importance of shocks to
the common stochastic trend in driving aggregate fluctuations in postwar U.S. data. To
this end, we perform a maximum-likelihood estimation of a mainstream dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium model featuring a number of real rigidities and driving forces. A novel
element of our model is that the laws of motion of the permanent components of neutral and
investment-specific productivity are modeled as a bivariate vector error correction model,
thereby allowing for cointegration. Our estimated DSGE models implies that the common
stochastic trend in neutral and investment-specific productivity is a non negligible driver of
short-run fluctuations. We regard these estimates as a first pass at evaluating the role of a
new source of business cycles. It remains for future research to establish the sensitivity of
this result to model specification and to the set of observables used in estimation.
   We conclude by stressing that the central insight of this paper, namely that neutral
and investment-specific productivity share a common stochastic trend has potentially an
important implication for the ongoing debate on the relative importance of neutral and
investment-specific productivity as drivers of business cycles. Viewed through the lens of
our analysis, the question of whether business cycles are driven by neutral or investment-
specific productivity shocks is ill posed. For it fails to contemplate the possibility that
business cycles are driven in part by a common productivity component.

Appendix
Modeling An Exogenous Wage Markup
We introduce a variable wage markup by assuming the existence of a union that sells differ-
entiated labor services monopolistically. The household receives total labor compensation in
the amount Wt ht , where Wt denotes the real wage rate paid by firms to the union. However,
in deciding the number of hours worked the household faces a marginal wage rate equal to
ft , which the household takes as exogenously given. The difference between the average and
W
the marginal labor income, given by ΦU ≡ (Wt − W ft )ht , is a monopoly rent, which the labor
                                            t
union rebates to households in a lump-sum fashion. Households take ΦUt as exogenously
given. In practice, workers pertaining to a labor union are offered a contract specifying a
wage rate and a fixed number of hours of work. This scheme is equivalent to the theoretical
                                                  ft , a lump-sum profit, and the ability to
contract we propose, which specifies a wage rate, W
choose the number of hours of work. The budget constraint of the household is then given
by
                                      ft ht + Rt ut Kt + ΦU + ΦF ,
                            Ct + It = W                                                      (8)

where Rt denotes the rental rate of capital and ΦFt denotes profits received from the ownership
of firms.
    Labor services hired by firms, denoted hdt , are a composite of differentiated types of labor
inputs, aggregated by means of the following function
                                                    Z       1    1

                                      hdt       =                 µt
                                                                 hjt dj         ,

where hjt denotes labor services of type j used in period t, and µt is an exogenous and
stochastic variable. The intratemporal elasticity of substitution between differentiated types
of labor input is given by µt /(µt − 1). As will be clear shortly, µt can be interpreted as the
equilibrium gross markup charged by a labor union. Given a desired level of the composite
labor input, hdt , the firm chooses hjt for all j ∈ [0, 1] by minimizing the total cost of labor,
         R1
given by 0 Wjt hjt dj, subject to the constraint imposed by the above aggregator technology,
where Wjt denotes the wage paid to labor input of type j. The implied demand for labor of
type j is given by

where Wt ≡ 0 Wjt          dj           denotes the cost of one unit of the labor composite. That

is, at the optimum, 0 Wjt hjt dj = Wt hdt .
    The wage rate for labor services of type j, Wjt , is set by a labor union that is the
monopolistic supplier of this type of labor. The union maximizes profits, which are given
by (Wjt − W ft )hjt , subject to the demand for labor, equation (9). The optimality condition
associated with this problem is
                                                 ft .
                                        Wjt = µt W

It is clear from this expression that µt represents a wage markup.
    In a symmetric equilibrium, we have that hjt = hdt = ht and Wjt = Wt for all j. Therefore,
we can drop the indices j and d.
