                                             ABSTRACT

Inequality in U.S. housing prices and rents both declined in the mid-20th century, even as home-ownership
rates rose. Subsequently, housing-price inequality has risen to pre-War levels, while rent inequality
has risen less. Combining both measures, we see inequality in housing consumption equivalents mirroring
patterns in income across both space and time, according to an income elasticity of housing demand
just below one. These patterns occur mainly within cities, and are not explained by observed changes
in dwelling characteristics or locations. Instead, recent increases in housing inequality are driven most
by changes in the relative value of locations, seen especially through land.

1        Introduction

In this paper, we examine a dimension of inequality that has received surprisingly scant attention

– inequality in housing outcomes. We find that measures of inequality in housing prices and

rents in the United States exhibit a U-shaped pattern over the last 85 years, resembling patterns

of income and wealth inequality, often referred to as a “great compression” followed by a “great

divergence” (Piketty and Saez (2003), Saez and Zucman (2014)). Housing-value inequality fell

from 1930 to 1970 as home ownership expanded, but has subsequently risen. Rent inequality

also fell, but it has risen only slightly since. Combining both measures into a rental equivalent,

we again see a U-shape.

        To understand the fall and subsequent rise of housing inequality, we use decomposition

techniques to quantify the impacts of key variables. Changes in housing inequality have occurred

primarily within cities and are not explained by observable changes in dwelling characteristics.

Thus, changes in the desirability of particular neighborhoods, reflected in land values, appear to

be the main contributor to changes in housing inequality, although we cannot rule out changes

in unobserved housing quality. Using a series of simple regressions, we also find that local

housing inequality is related with local income inequality at magnitudes implied by reasonable

values for the income elasticity of housing consumption.

        Knowledge of housing inequality sheds light on larger issues concerning consumption and

wealth inequality. It informs debate over whether consumption inequality has grown as much as

income inequality over the last few decades.1 Housing accounts for a large share of consumption,

and has done so more stably than other items, such as food or health care.2 Housing may

represent permanent income particularly well as it is durable (Friedman (1957), p 208). The

great compression and great divergence in housing inequality are of roughly similar magnitude,

commensurate with income changes. However, housing inequality has less to do with tangible

dwelling characteristics — such as living space — and more to do with what people pay to live
    1
     Krueger and Perri (2006) and Meyer and Sullivan (2010) argue that consumption inequality has increased
much less than income inequality using the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Aguiar and Bils (2011) propose a
correction for measurement error that results in a consumption inequality measure that mirrors income. Work
using PSID consumption measures by Attanasio and Pistaferri (2014) and earlier evidence by Cutler and Katz
(1992) also suggest that consumption inequality has increased in line with income inequality.
   2
     As a fraction of Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), “Housing and utilities” rose from 16.6 to
18.1 percent between 1959 and 2014. Similar fractions for “Food and beverages purchases for off-premises
consumption” are 19.4 to 7.5 percent; “Clothing and footwear,” 8.0 to 3.1 percent, ”Motor vehicles and parts,”
5.9 to 3.7 percent; “Health care,” 4.7 to 16.5 percent. Depending on the survey, the budget share of housing
roughly one-sixth, in the PCE, to one-third, in the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), of average consumer
expenditures (Albouy and Lue (2015).)

in different locations. These locations offer different “intangibles” such as access to employment

and local amenities, such as schools, safety, and natural features.

        There has also been recent debate over whether wealth inequality has increased as much as

income inequality.3 Housing informs this debate as it accounts for much of the overall capital

stock and is the principal asset for most Americans with savings.4 Our evidence that housing

values have diverged indirectly supports the view that wealth inequality has increased, albeit

to levels lower than before World War II, due to increases in home-ownership.5

        To our knowledge, our paper is the first to document inequality in housing prices and rents

over such a long period and to relate them to measures of income inequality over space and time.

Our analysis of housing expenditures sheds light on consumption inequality prior to World War

II – before widely available household-level consumption data – providing direct evidence of a

great compression in consumption inequality contemporaneous with similar changes in income

and wealth.6 While several studies (e.g. Van Nieuwerburgh and Weill (2010), Moretti (2013),

and Gyourko, Mayer and Sinai (2013)) have examined recent changes in housing-price inequality

across cities, our analysis extends for longer, covers rents, and examines dwelling characteristics

and variation in prices within cities.



2        Data, Inequality Measures, and Empirical Techniques

2.1       Housing Data and Sample Selection

Our data are drawn from the full 1930 and 1940 Census, the long form of the 1960 through 2000

Censuses, and the American Community Survey (ACS) for 2009-12. These surveys ask owners

to report the current value of their home and renters to report their monthly rent. Renters from

1970 onward and home owners from 1980 onward also report their utility costs. Home values
    3
      Kopczuk (2004) find a great compression of wealth inequality but little divergence afterwards. Using capi-
talization methods, Saez and Zucman (2014) find greater divergence, although Kopczuk (2015) disputes this.
    4
      Housing accounts for roughly one third of total household wealth and roughly 40 percent of the capital stock.
Housing is almost two thirds of wealth for the middle three quintiles (Wolff, 2014). In 2004, 62 percent of housing
wealth was held by the bottom 90 percent, and only 9.8 percent by the top 1 percent; for stocks and mutual
funds, the comparable numbers are 14.6 and 44.8 percent (Wolff 2009, p. 160).
    5
      Differences in wealth due to inequality in housing values have more complex implications than differences due
to other types of capital. An appreciation in home prices will only increase a home-owner’s permanent wealth if
they have a less expensive alternative to living in their now more expensive house. Rognlie (2014) and Bonnet
et al. (2014) have emphasized this point in critiquing Piketty and Zucman (2014). One interesting feature of our
paper is our finding that home owners have alternatives that are observably quite similar but much less expensive.
This suggests that the distinction is less important.
    6
      Goldin and Margo (1992) used methods similar to ours to highlight and examine the great compression
in incomes in the 1930’s and 1940’s. Piketty and Saez (2003) examine the great compression of top incomes,
particularly from capital.

are recorded as intervals from 1960 through 2000 and monthly rents are reported as intervals

for 1960, 1980, and 1990. In all other years the questions record a continuous measure with

relatively little top coding.7

       We restrict our sample to focus on residential homes and to maximize consistency across

years. This involves three restrictions. First, we restrict the sample to the continental United

States. Second, we eliminate all farms and homes used for commercial activities, such as

dental and medical offices. Fourth, we remove owner-occupied units in multi-family structures.

Appendix table A.1 lists the number of houses in each category. We remove farms in all years,

which is our most important sample restriction. The 1930 and 1940 data do not include dwelling

characteristics, nor do they indicate the presence of businesses, so we cannot remove businesses

and multi-family structures in these years. These two categories account for only 6 percent of

owner-occupied houses in 1960.8


2.2      Interpolation and Extrapolation Procedures

The Census often asks questions about home values and rents in terms of intervals. Even when

questions are asked in terms of continuous dollars, the data are top coded, and respondents

often round. To account for these issues, we use a Pareto interpolation procedure to allocate

responses within intervals. Where y are values distributed according to F (y), this procedure

fits ln[1 − F (y)] = αj [ln(kj ) − ln(y)], where αj > 1, kj > 0 are parameters for an interval j. In

other words, it fits a linear spline of the “tail” function ln[1 − F (y)] to ln(y). For high values of

y, the αj parameters are fairly constant, implying that the Pareto distribution provides a good

fit. To improve comparability and handle rounding problems, we also interpolate in years with

continuous data, using 25 artificial intervals, with 4 percent of the data in each.9

       At the top of the distribution, we use standard Pareto extrapolation procedures (e.g. Atkin-

son, Piketty and Saez (2011)). In years that we have information about the mean of top coded

values, we use the estimate of αJ = E[y|y > k]/(E[y|y > k] − k). In other years, we extrapolate

αJ for the top coded bin from the αj from intervals in the top 10 percent of the distribution.10
   7
     The home value is the owner’s estimate. We discuss below how question changes impact our analysis. We
take data from the ACS from 2009 (not 2008) through 2012 to reflect conditions after the latest housing boom
and bust.
   8
     Enumerator instructions for 1940 instruct respondents to exclude the value of units rented out and to also
exclude the area of the house that is used for business purposes if this is a “considerable portion” of the house.
These instructions are re-printed in the data appendix.
   9
     Because of rounding, these intervals can sometimes contain only one value. In these cases, we decrease the
number of groups until each interval has a top value at least 2.5 percent higher than its bottom value.
  10
     The one exception to this are rent values in 1930 and 1940, where we hard code the top Pareto distribution



                                                        3
For the bottom interval we extrapolate values using a uniform distribution to deal with bottom

coding and problems associated with zero values. We set the minimum of this interval as a

proportion of average household income in that year. More details are in Appendix B.


2.3    House Values, Gross Rents, and Consumption Equivalents

We present all of our results separately for housing prices and rents. To integrate the two and

account for changes in home ownership (which mainly changed from 1940 to 1960), we impute

a rental equivalent measure for home owners, based on a constant user cost of 0.0785 times

the value of the house and plus utility payments.11 We then divide these rental measures by a

household equivalence scale to provide a per-person measure of housing consumption.12


2.4    Inequality Measures

To describe inequality in housing expenditures we use three scale and population invariant mea-

sures: the variance of logs, the Gini coefficient, and the Theil entropy index.13 We decompose

the variance of logs and the Theil index to show how much overall inequality is due to variation

across versus within areas. Note that the variance of logs is particularly sensitive to the bottom

of the distribution while the Gini coefficient and Theil mainly measure changes in the middle

of the distribution (Atkinson (1970)).
parameter to be 2.5. In these years we have a continuous distribution of rents (and home values) with very few
top codes; parameters estimated from the mean procedure lead to suspiciously high inequality statistics.
  11
     This commonly-used value is based on Peiser and Smith (1985). User costs of home ownership are foregone
interest, depreciation, and property taxes, minus price appreciation. User costs vary over space, time, and possibly
occupant, but there are various empirical and conceptual challenges in calculating year-by-city user costs (e.g.
those examined in Verbrugge (2008) and Poterba and Sinai (2008)). We choose a constant number so as to avoid
the data being overly influenced by our choice of methodology, recognizing that scale invariance of the inequality
measures will help to undo differences among owners.
  12
     Equivalence scales are designed to take into account economies of scale in consumption, such as from the
sharing of common spaces, kitchens, etc. We use the OECD equivalence scale: 1 + 0.7(A − 1) + 0.5C where A is
the total number of adults in the household and C is the number of children (14 years old or below).
  13
     The Theil index is computed by taking a weighted average of the log of the (normalized) expenditure on
housing by each household. Where ȳ ≡ E[yi ]:
                                                      N        
                                                   1 X yi       yi
                                             T =            ln
                                                   N i=1 ȳ     ȳ

The Gini coefficient and Theil index satisfy the principle of transfers, so a transfer from a rich to a poor person
always decreases inequality. We decompose Theil entropy indices and variances of logs by calling inequality in
mean levels of housing expenditures across areas the between (areas) component, and inequality within areas the
within component. As Cowell (2011) notes, the variance of logs is only decomposable with constant means of
logged values, not levels.

2.5      Dwelling Characteristics and Location Measures

Dwelling characteristics are provided only from 1960 onwards. They include the age of the

building, the number of rooms, the number of bedrooms, the presence of complete plumbing,

and what heating system, if any, was installed (gas, oil, wood, electric, etc.).

       Measures of location extend back to 1930. We consider the lower 48 states, and 722 com-

muting zones (CZs). CZs are defined like metropolitan areas, corresponding to local labor

markets, but include rural areas, and are constant over time.14 Some locational advantages may

be permanent, such as climate and natural features. Others, such as safety or employment prox-

imity, may have changed considerably since 1930. We remain agnostic about which amenities

households value, mainly because we can measure so few of them.


2.6      Re-weighting Analysis

To account for how observable changes in housing characteristics have affected inequality, we

use the propensity-score re-weighting approach of DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996). This

approach estimates what the distribution of housing prices would be if the observed charac-

teristics of houses had remained identical to earlier years, and those characteristics had been

priced as in later years. In this way, it rules out general-equilibrium effects (such as changes

in demand) affecting prices. Nonetheless, it is a useful accounting method, as changes from

re-weighting tell us how well observable characteristics could affect inequality.

       The re-weighting makes the observable characteristics of a sample of houses in a later “cur-

rent” year, t (e.g. 2010), resemble characteristics from a previous “target” year, t0 (e.g. 1970).

The weights are the odds of a house being observed in the target year relative to the current

year, which we determine using a logit regression on the pooled sample in years t and t0 . Fortin,

Lemieux and Firpo (2011) provides detailed conditions for identification and implementation

details. The main requirement for identification is conditional independence – after conditioning

on all characteristics, a house’s price is independent of the year we observe it in.
  14
    We use 1990 Commuting zones, which are more fully explained in Tolbert and Sizer (1996). They are made
up of counties and designed to be places where people both live and work. For 1930 and 1940 we are able to
assign every house to one commuting zone. In 1960 they are not available in public PUMS samples. From 1970
onward some houses are identified as being in PUMA’s or county groups in the IPUMS data that cut across
multiple commuting zones. For these years we follow Dorn (2009), Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013), and others in
probabilistically assigning houses to commuting zones based on the proportion of responses in their most detailed
geographic category that were in one commuting zone or the other. For most of our specifications we also report
statistics using states. We are able to match each house to a state for each year.




                                                       5
3     Empirical Results

3.1   General Trends over Time

Table 1 provides basic characteristics of the sample. The first row shows how home-ownership

fell after the Great Depression and rose dramatically after World War II, hovering just above

60 percent for over fifty years. Household size consistently fell (from 3.8 in 1930, 3.3 in 1960,

to 2.5 in 2012) and the number of rooms per house rose slowly after 1960 (from 5 to 5.75)

along with the number of bedrooms. Indoor plumbing was common but not ubiquitous in 1960,

but became so by 1980. Taken together, these trends imply Americans consumed much more

housing per person. The fraction living in the South and West also ballooned from 35 to 60

percent, while the Midwest and Northeast lost its former predominance.

    Figure 1 graphs Lorenz curves for various measures of housing outcomes and incomes in

1930, 1970, and 2012. We present Lorenz curves because they show how each part of the

distribution has changed over time.

    Panel A shows that, among home-owners, 2012 and 1930 have almost identical levels of

inequality, with 50 percent of housing value accruing to the top 20 percent. Inequality is

uniformly lower in 1970 with 40 percent going to the top 20 percent. To better understand the

distribution of housing assets (if not equity) Panel B includes renters as zeroes. Here we see

1930 is considerably less equal, with 80 percent of owner-occupied housing wealth accruing to 20

percent of households, resembling the original “Pareto Principle,” for 19th-Century landowners.

In comparison, inequality in 2012 is much lower, although changes in the number of farms may

influence this number.

    Panel C shows that rents were quite unequal in 1930, but that they were much more equal

in 1970. Since then, rent inequality has only grown slightly, primarily for costlier units. Panel

D shows consumption equivalents, which summarize much of the earlier discussion: 1930 had

the highest inequality, 1970 the least, and 2012 resembles 1930 at the top of the distribution

but 1970 at the bottom.

    Panels E and F describe household wage income (not available in 1930) and total income

(not available in 1930 or 1940). Total income inequality is generally smaller, especially at the

bottom (partly due to lack of zeroes), and increased less than wage inequality between 1970

and 2012.

    Figure 2 graphs our preferred inequality statistics in all years. Generally these show U-


                                               6
shaped patterns from 1930 to 2012. Before 1970 there was a great compression in housing

consumption, similar to trends in the inequality of household income shown in Panel D.

   From 1930 to 1970 the Theil entropy index and the variance of the log of home prices roughly

halved. Each statistic increases after 1970 — with a blip in 1990 that seems due to regional

housing booms — and settles in 2012 at a level slightly below its value in 1930. It is especially

remarkable that home-ownership waxed considerably during the great compression, while it did

not wane during the great divergence.

   Rents exhibit a different pattern. While inequality in rents declined dramatically between

1930 and 1960, it increased less than home values in the period starting in 1980. Since inequality

changed more at the top than at the bottom, this may relate to increased levels of housing

assistance for low-income households, or rent control in major cities like New York and San

Francisco.

   The consumption equivalent measure accounts for changes in demographics and home own-

ership, and exhibits a U-shaped pattern that is slightly less extreme in the latter half of the U.

This measure shows the lowest levels of inequality in 1980, while the other measures bottomed-

out closer to 1960. Inequality in consumption equivalents appears to be currently at its highest

level since World War II and seems to be increasing.

   While we only have household wage income in 1940 (and nothing in 1930) it is worth noting

that inequality in our housing measures fell more between 1940 and 1960 than measures of

income. Subsequent increases in housing inequality since 1960 have been comparatively gentler.


3.2   Decomposition over Space

In Figure 3 and Table 3 we use a spatial decomposition to see how much inequality is due to

differences across areas as opposed to within them. Differences across cities are likely labor

market driven, since CZs are designed to resemble local labor markets. Differences within cities

are likely due to dwelling characteristics, local amenities, and commuting opportunities.

   In all cases, within-area inequality is much larger than between-area inequality, such that

the within statistics are generally between three to ten times as large. The U-shaped patterns

observed at the national level for each measure are reflected both within and across states and

commuting zones. However, given the relative magnitudes, changes in inequality are mainly

driven by differences within metro areas. In contrast, much of the literature (examples include

Van Nieuwerburgh and Weill (2010), Diamond (2012), Gyourko, Mayer and Sinai (2013), and


                                                7
Moretti (2013)) focuses on growing inequality between metro areas. Between-metro changes did

figure prominently in 1990 blip, which occurred in rents as well as prices, but have otherwise

been dwarfed by changes within metros.

       The large increases in household wage inequality within areas in the late 20th century,

mirrors those in Baum-Snow and Pavan (2013), who find income inequality grew the most

within the largest U.S. cities. Meanwhile, inequality between metro areas declined considerably

between 1940 and 1960, and did not change considerably afterwards outside of the 1990 blip.


3.3      The Role of Observable Characteristics

Although the share of income devoted to housing appears to have stayed relatively constant

over the 20th century, patterns of housing consumption appears to have changed considerably.

As pointed out in Table 1, while households have shrunk in (human) size, their housing units

have gotten larger, and they have moved south and west.

       Increases in housing price inequality since 1970 could be the result of two forces. First, some

households may have moved into ever larger units, while others moved into ever smaller units.

Second, Americans might have moved in ways that heightened inequality.

       These hypotheses are examined in Figure 4 and Table 4. They show that if households lived

in housing units with dwelling characteristics, locations, and household composition observably

identical to those in 1970, housing values would be only slightly more equal. This accountable

change is very small in relation to the overall changes.15

       The re-weighting results in Table 4 show that dwelling characteristics can explain at most

30 percent of the change in the two inequality statistics using the consumption equivalent

measure. The direction varies, however, with decreases in inequality among home owners and

increases for renters. Generally, changes in the location of houses and household composition

from 1970 to 2012 have tended to make households more equal in their housing outcomes. It is

also interesting, even surprising, that neither location nor dwelling characteristics do much to

explain changes in household wage inequality.

       Our results on dwelling characteristics support previous reflections on this issue. For exam-
  15
     The re-weighting specification we use allows for depreciation of housing by year at the cost of allowing for
“vintage” effects of houses built in particular years. In an alternative specification we allow for these vintage
effects. Davis and Heathcote (2007) find that spending on structural improvements in the US (roughly 0.8
percent) is very similar to a reasonable estimate of structural depreciation (roughly 1 percent). Our conclusions
using vintages reinforce the idea that changes in dwelling characteristics have not driven the changes in housing
inequality that we document.




                                                       8
ple, Glaeser and Gyourko (2008) find that per-capita square footage consumed by rich and poor

households has become more equal over time. Since construction costs vary little within cities,

much of the growing inequality in housing value seems to be due to growing inequality in land

values, or the right to build on such land.


3.4        The Relationship between Income and Housing Inequality

The patterns documented in section 3.2 suggest a link between local income and housing in-

equality. Studies of housing demand (e.g. Polinsky and Ellwood (1979), Hanushek and Quigley

(1980), and Mayo (1981)) have generally concluded that housing is a necessity, a regularity

sometimes known as “Schwabe’s Law.” Most estimates typically fall between 0.3 and 1.0. So

variations in income should be reflected in housing consumption. In fact, other things equal, the

variance of log housing consumption should equal the square of the income elasticity of housing

times the variance of log income.16

         Patterns of income and housing inequality over time and space suggest a considerable re-

lationship between the two. For instance, between 1970 and 2012, the variance of log income

increased by 0.26, while the variance of log housing consumption increased by 0.09, consistent

with an income elasticity of 0.59.

         We examine this relationship spatially in Figure 5 and Table 5 by comparing how inequality

within CZs for housing relate to income. Here we see that the two inequalities are strongly

related, and share a relationship of roughly the same magnitude. Column three of Table 5 takes

the square root of a regression of the variance of the logs of measure of housing consumption

on the variance of logs of household income. This produces estimates of the income elasticity

of housing expenditures in the range of 0.7 to 0.9, which are reasonable, if slightly higher than

values from temporal variation.



4         Conclusion

Our results provide some refinements to the debate on inequality, particularly in terms of

consumption and wealth. The similarity of housing and income inequality over space and time

according to plausible income elasticities appears to support those arguing that consumption
    16
    This exercise carries several caveats: General equilibrium effects may interact with consumer preferences to
either dampen (Matlack and Vigdor (2008)) or amplify (Van Nieuwerburgh and Weill (2010)) the direct effects of
changes in incomes. Additionally, since housing is so heterogeneous, it is difficult to quantify how much “housing
service” a house of a given size or in a given neighborhood provide.

inequality does reflect income inequality. Additionally, changes in dwelling characteristics and

differences between cities explain only a small fraction of recent increases in housing inequality.

This suggests that the value of land plays an important role, even within cities.17

       Several studies — e.g., Green, Malpezzi and Mayo (2005), Gyourko, Saiz and Summers

(2008), and Saiz (2010) — have emphasized that regulatory and geographic constraints on

housing supply may play an important role in price differences across cities. Our findings suggest

constraints may play a role within cities, as new housing in the most desirable neighborhoods

may be the most constrained. These may interact with findings by Rossi-Hansberg, PierreDaniel

Sarte and Owens (2010), Guerrieri, Hartley and Hurst (2013), and Autor, Palmer and Pathak

(2014) on how local externalities that can lead to substantial income sorting within cities.

Generally, our findings suggest that researchers would do well to more closely examine differences

in land prices across neighborhoods. An interesting research project would be to determine how

much they are driven by local externalities, dwelling characteristics, and fixed neighborhood

amenities.

       The growing inequality in housing prices that we document also indirectly supports findings

that wealth inequality has increased. High home-ownership levels do imply that inequality

in housing wealth is still smaller than it was in 1930. Nevertheless, the windfall gains from

unequal housing price changes, which benefited some homeowners relative to others, may help

stir once-popular Georgeist concerns about unequal land-ownership from the beginning of the

20th Century. Moreover, it appears that housing inequality will continue to grow in line with

any further increases in income inequality.
  17
    Our result also supports findings by Watson (2009) and Reardon and Bischoff (2011) that segregation by
income has increased since 1970. This contrasts with findings by Glaeser and Vigdor (2012) and others that
black-white segregation peaked in 1970 and has since declined.

NOTE: Each presents inequality measures for separate samples. The first is for home owners and is the dollar
value of their primary residence. The second is for renters and is their cash expenditure per month on rent and
utilities. The final combines the two to compute an consumption measure per person, as explained in the text.
Farms and houses used for business are excluded. Data are interpolated within intervals. The observation for
2012 comes from ACS for 2009-2012. See text and Data Appendix for more detail.

NOTE: These panels display scatter plots for commuting zones with the variance of logs of total income recorded
in the 2009-2012 ACS on the x axis and each measure of housing expenditure inequality on the y axis (with zeros
excluded). Each variable is computed for its relevant population with the variance of the logs of household total
income including both owners and renters in each graph. The size of each circle is proportionate to the number
of (weighted) households in each commuting zone. The OLS regression line plotted incorporate these weights.

NOTE: Home values refer to owner-occupied homes. Rents are gross and include the cost of utilities. Both are
self reported. Consumption equivalents combine gross rents with imputed rents based on a percentage of the
home value plus utility costs, divided by the equivalence scale 1 + 0.7(A − 1) + 0.5C where A is the number of
adults and C is the number of children under 14. Household wage income refers is the sum of wages and salaries
from all household members. Values are interpolated within intervals using standard procedures described in the
text.

NOTE: Statistics are taken of 2012 data, re-weighted to emulate the distribution of observable dwelling and
location characteristics of previous years. The top and bottom row refers to the actual values in the specified years.
Dwellings refers to: Indicators for the number of rooms, bedrooms, the decade of construction, plumbing facilities,
and the heating system type. States and CZs include indicators for the geographic entities, and demographics is
the interactions of the household type (single, a couple, a single parent, or non-related individuals) with indicators
for the number of children and adults (separately). The solid line contains weights accounting for all of these
which were computed as noted in the text, following DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996) and Fortin, Lemieux
and Firpo (2011).

NOTE: Each coefficient is the (re-signed) square root of the absolute value of the regression coefficient relating
the variance of the log of household wage income within each CZ with the variance of the log of the variable within
each CZ. Standard errors clustered by the state the plurality of the CZ’s population lives in are in parenthesis.
The unit of observation for each regression is a CZ year and each coefficients is from a different regression. Each
is computed using the relevant sample for that variable while income inequality is computed using the universe
of all home owners and renters. The third column represents an estimate of the income elasticity of demand for
housing services. See tables 1 and 2 and figure 5 for more detail.

Appendix - For Online Publication
A     Data appendix
A.1    Integrated Public Use Microdata Series samples
Our Census data are provided by the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, from usa.ipums.org
detailed in Ruggles et al. (2010). For each year we use the following samples.

    • 1930: 5 percent sample

    • 1940: 1 percent sample

    • 1960: 1 percent

    • 1970: 1 percent state and metro (depending on state or commuting zone) and format 1
      or 2 (depending on the questions needed).

    • 1980: 5 percent state sample

    • 1990: 5 percent sample

    • 2000: 5 percent sample

    • 2009-12 ACS five year 2012 sample with interviews in 2008 dropped

A.2    Sample restrictions
As mentioned in the main text, we include households in the United States with three restric-
tions: We omit houses outside the continental US, we exclude houses used to generate revenue,
and we similarly exclude owner occupied multiple family residences. Appendix table A.1 shows
the percentage of houses we exclude for each year due to being used to generate revenue or
encompassing multiple units. We present these separately for both owners and renters.
    The first row for each panel shows the number of houses in the continental US that are
included in our sample. this is quite high for each year, and in later years it is over 90 percent.
The next few rows show reasons why houses are excluded. By far the most important reason is
because they are farms. For example, in 1930 25 percent of households lived on a farm. Multiple
family houses and houses used for commercial purposes are also excluded in our analysis for
the years where the census identifies them. In 1960, the first year we can identify them, these
housing categories made up roughly 6 percent of owner occupied housing.
    The final few rows show categories of houses that were excluded from questions in some
years. From 1960-1980 mobile homes and trailers were excluded and in 1970 condos were as
well. In other years they are included. These categories, again, make up a small proportion of
housing units in these years, They never reach six percent, and often are well below that mark.

            NOTE: The gives the numbers of intervals for each year the census data are intervalled.


We use a pareto distribution to interpolate values both in years where data are intervalled and
where they are continuous. Where data are intervalled, we interpolate within the specified
intervals. Where data are continuous, we divide the data into equally size intervals. We start
with 25, but decrease the number until each interval has a reasonable “width,” or distance form
its minimum to maximum value.18
  18
     The precise definition is that the procedure will decrease the number of intervals until each interval has a
max value that is 1.01 times its min value or greater. We do this because the procedure fails for intervals that
are excessively “narrow” as sometimes occurs where respondents round values.


                                                       iii
    The pareto distribution’s cumulative distriubtuion function (CDF) has the from F (y) =
1−(k/y)α for y ≥ k. It follows that the logarithm of the complementary CDF (or “tail” function)
has a slope of −α with respect to ln(y). The greater the slope α, the faster observations “die
off,” and the less disperse the distribution. For any value yi , define

                                pi ≡ ln[1 − F (y)] = α ln(k) − α ln(y)                                     (A.1)

The interpolation method (Pareto (1896)) estimates α by differencing expression A.1 at the
values for the two endpoints of a bracket [yi , yi+1 ], where i = 1, ..., I indexes the intervals,
namely

                                       ln(yi+1 ) − ln(yi )
                               α̂i =                       , i = 1, ..., I − 1,                            (A.2)
                                           pi − pi+1
                1/α
and k̂i = yi pi . Even when the distribution may not be considered Pareto globally, this
procedure fits a simple line segment to the log survivor function in terms of ln(y).
     Since the Pareto distribution is unbounded, determining a value of α beyond the top code,
yI in the data can be difficult. This problem is largely remedied if the mean is available, as
it is for housing values in 1930, 1940, and 2012. There, the property that the mean value of
ȳI ≡ E[y|y ≥ yI ] = αyI /(α − 1), imples a value of
                                                           ȳI
                                               α̂I =                                                       (A.3)
                                                       ȳI − yI
    In other situations it is impossible to obtain a mean above a given cutoff. In these cases we
infer a value of α by taking the average of values from the linear interpolation method (A.2)
for the top 10 percent of the distribution that do not correspond to the top interval.19 For rent
values in 1930 and 1940, we code the top pareto parameter to be 2.5, which roughly corresponds
to this.
    For the bottom-most interval we employ a simple strategy of imposing a uniform distribu-
tion so our choices impact our results as minimally as possible. To do this we need to establish
a minimum possible value for the variable we are concerned with. The bottom value is deter-
mined to be, for rents, 0.03 percent of average household incomes per year (corresponding to a
household that makes 10 percent of the average household income and spends 1/3 of it on rent).
For home values it is the same value, but divided by 0.0785, which is the rent to value ratio
we use to convert housing values into user costs of housing. For household incomes it is the 0.1
times average household income in that year. Average (national) household incomes for this
purpose across the many years in our sample come from Chao and Utgoff (2006). How we treat
bottom values matters little except for in the variance of logarithms, which has undesirable
properties at the bottom of the distribution (for instance, it cannot account for zero values).
    Figure A.2 shows several illustrations of our imputation procedure for different types of
situations. We plot both the CDF and the tail function, which is linear in the pareto distribution.
The second plot is especially relevant for determining the fit in the very top of the distribution.
    Panel A of Figure A.2 shows both the empirical cumulative density function for home prices
in 2012 and the pareto CDF used in the paper. Note that this is a year where respondents
reported a continuous quantity, though the distribution plot shows that many did round. The
dashed lines show intervals in each bin used for rounding. As in other years, we divided the
data into 25 bins to perform the CDF interpolation. The dashed lines show the min and max
proportions for each bin, as well as its placement along the scale.

    In the extremely rare case where all values in the top 10 percent are in the top bin, we check the top 11, 12,
13, etc. percent, stopping at the first percentile where an estimate exists.

bution matches the top of the distribution. Overall the fit is quite good, with the line tracking
the distribution until it encounters the state by year topcodes for the top 0.5 percent of the
distribution.
    Similarly Panel C and Panel D show the same for the 1970 distribution where the variable
is divided into 11 intervals. Here the distribution meets the interval boundaries exactly and the
interpolation simply smooths the area between them. The top code extrapolation has the same
slope as the one for 2012, but this slope matches the slope of the previous interval rather well,
implying the extrapolation is reasonable for this year as well.

C              Geographic Assignment
We keep a consistent geographic sample across all years in the sample by primarily using 1990
local labor markets, or commuting zones, as described by Tolbert and Sizer (1996). Local labor
markets are a natural geography for this analysis since housing values are closely related to local
income levels. For 1970-2011 we match geographically using the probabilistic mapping made
available by David Dorn via his website and used in, for example, Dorn (2009). For 2012 we
replicate the probabalistis matching using updated PUMA definitions for the 2012 census and
for 1930 and 1940 we use the direct county to commuting zone mapping in Tolbert and Sizer


                                                                                                                                                                    v
(1996) since counties are available. Unfortunately it is not possible to match to commuing zones
in for 1960 based on the publicly available samples, so we instead use states as our geographic
entity where we use data from 1960 (this is generally marked in each table).
    This mapping uses the most disaggregated geography available in each census to project this
geography onto counties and then project these counties onto commuting zones. Unfortunately,
the PUMAS and county groups available often contain multiple counties and these counties
sometimes fall into separate commuting zones. In these cases we compute a probability that a
given person resides in one commuting zone based on the proportion of people in her identified
geography that in fact live in the given commuting zone based on non-restricted census summary
tables. Where these probabilistic matches occur, we create multiple observations – one for each
possible commuting zone – and weight them by the probability the original observation is in
that commuting zone, times their initial weight if applicable. Samples for 1930 and 1940 contain
county information so the match is exact and we avoid the first projection.


D     Deflating
Since the inequality measures we use are scale invariant, deflating is generally unimportant. We
deflate values using the Consumer Price Index excluding structures published by the BLS, from
the Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis’ FRED system. The series mnemonic is: CUUR0000SA0L2.
Before 1935, when structures were not identified separately, we combine the data series from
the general CPI (CPIAUCNS) and the CPI for rent of primary residence (CUUR0000SEHA) by using
an OLS regression to predict the shelters excluded series for the years it is available prior to
1941 based on the general CPI and the CPI for rent of primary residence. This regression has
good out of sample prediction powers for years up to 1960, so we believe it is a reasonable
approximation for the initial five years.


E    Re-weighting decomposition specifics
Formally, using notation similar to Fortin, Lemieux and Firpo (2011), we have two groups of
houses, one group of houses observed in t and another in t0 . We have prices for each group
and some houses may appear in both groups. We want to compute a statistic, ν(P), that is a
function of a distribution of house prices, P → R. With the above caveats in mind, we denote
the distribution Pt,t0 where the first subscript refers to the year we would like to apply prices
from and the second year is the year we would like to match in terms of observables. So we
re-weight observed houses in t so that they corresponded to the distribution of characteristics
of houses in t0 . Note that in this notation Pt,t is simply the distribution of houses in period t.
Putting this together, we are seeking to recover:
                                                      
                                             ν Pt,t0                                         (A.4)

    Conditional independence, or ignorability, in this context means that once we condition on
all observable characteristics (S and L), the unobservable characteristics () are independent of
whether we observe the house in t or t0 . Here this would imply that once we take into account
each observable detail about the house there is no special trait which we omitted that differs
systematically between t and t0.
    To actually estimate ν Pt,t0 , we compute re weighting factors following DiNardo, Fortin and
Lemieux (1996) which Hirano, Imbens and Ridder (2003) and Firpo (2007) formally establish
are efficient. Φ(S, L) with the following form:

                                          Pr(τ = t0 |S, L)/Pr(τ = t0 )
                              Φ(S, L) =                                                      (A.5)
                                          Pr(τ = t|S, L)/Pr(τ = t)


                                                 vi
     Where τ represents the year the house was observed in (either t0 or t). The intuition is
that we would like to heavily weight the observations from year t that look very much like the
observations in year t0 . We do this by using the odds that an observation came from t0 given
its observables.
     We compute the probabilities using logit regressions that pool houses observed in both t and
t0 . By regressing a dummy indicator of a house being observed in t0 on a flexible functional form
of S and L In this context we mostly use dummy variables for different categories. we are able to
compute predicted probabilities P̂r(τ = t0 |S, L) and P̂r(τ = t|S, L). To compute P̂r(τ = t0 ) and
P̂r(τ = t) we simply use the sample proportions (appropriately weighted). Applying equation
A.5 then gives a value of Φ̂(S, L) that we use to re-weight each statistic.
     We then multiply Φ̂(S, L) by the weights already applied to the houses observed in t to
simulate the density that would exist under the counter-factual that houses had identical char-
acteristics to houses in t0 but were priced in terms of the prices that prevailed in t.
