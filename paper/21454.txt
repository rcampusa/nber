                                            Abstract

A growing literature establishes that high-quality early childhood interventions that enrich the

environments of disadvantaged children have substantial long-run impacts on a variety of social

and economic outcomes. Much less is known about their effects on health and healthy behaviors.

This paper examines the long-term impacts on health and healthy behaviors of two of the oldest

and most widely cited U.S. early childhood interventions evaluated by the method of randomization

with long-term follow-up: the Perry Preschool Project (PPP) and the Carolina Abecedarian Project

(ABC). We present evidence of pronounced gender effects of the programs. Boys randomly assigned

to the treatment group of PPP have significantly lower prevalence of behavioral risk factors in

adulthood compared to those randomized to the control condition, while those who received the

ABC intervention enjoy better physical health. The impact on girls is considerably weaker for both

programs, although there are beneficial effects for them as well. Many treatment effects across

programs are not comparable because different outcomes are measured, different survey instruments

are used, and different ages are sampled. Where outcome measures are comparable, the estimated

treatment effects are stronger for ABC males compared to PPP males. The imprecise estimates for

women found for each program translate into imprecise estimates of differences in female treatment

effects across programs. Our permutation-based inference procedure recognizes the small sample

sizes of the ABC and PPP interventions, adjusts for the multiplicity of the hypotheses tested,

accounts for non-random attrition from the panel follow-ups, and adjusts for departures from

randomization protocols in implementation when doing so is appropriate. We conduct dynamic

mediation analyses to shed light on the mechanisms producing the estimated treatment effects. We

document a significant role played by improved childhood traits, above and beyond the effects of

experimentally enhanced adult socioeconomic status. Overall, our results show the potential of

early life interventions for preventing disease and promoting health.

1     Introduction

Discussions of ways to control the soaring costs of the health care system in the US and elsewhere

largely focus on the provision of health care (see, e.g., Emanuel, 2012; Jamison et al., 2013).

However, treatment of disease is only part of the story. Prevention has a substantial role to play.

Most medical care costs in developed countries like the United States arise from a minority of

individuals with multiple chronic conditions, like cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and cancer

(see Cohen and Yu, 2012).1,2 Such conditions are the main causes of premature death, and managing

them effectively requires that patients make lifestyle changes by adhering to healthy behaviors (Ford

et al., 2012; Kontis et al., 2014; Mokdad et al., 2004). While prevention holds the key for lifelong

health, changing behavior in adulthood is challenging (Marteau et al., 2012).3

    A substantial body of evidence shows that adult illnesses are more prevalent and more problem-

atic among those who have experienced adverse early life conditions (Danese et al., 2007; Galobardes

et al., 2008). At present, the exact pathways through which early life experiences translate into

health over the life cycle are not fully known, although there is increasing understanding of the

role that might be played by biological embedding of social and economic adversity.4 The evidence

on the social determinants of health (Marmot and Wilkinson, 2006) suggests that a strategy of

prevention rather than later life treatment may be more effective. Such an approach recognizes the

dynamic nature of health capital formation, and views policies that shape early life environments

as effective tools for promoting health (Conti and Heckman, 2014). Following this path, a recent

interdisciplinary literature points to the role that might be played by early childhood interventions

targeted to disadvantaged children in promoting adult health (Black and Hurley, 2014; Campbell

et al., 2014; Di Cesare et al., 2013).

    This paper contributes to this literature by examining the effects on health and healthy behaviors
    1
      In the United States, in 2008, 1% of the population accounted for 20% of total health care expenditures. These
are older patients with cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and other multiple chronic conditions. In contrast, the bottom
half of the expenditure distribution accounted for 3.1% of spending.
    2
      The United Nations in 2011 has set a goal of reducing the probability of premature mortality due to these
diseases by 25% by the year 2025.
    3
      One potentially promising approach uses insights from behavioral economics to design effective programs imple-
mented by employers, insurers, and health care providers, to increase patient engagement and to encourage individuals
to take better care of themselves (Loewenstein et al., 2013, 2007). These chronic conditions can indeed be prevented,
or, at least, their onset can be substantially delayed (Ezzati and Riboli, 2012; Sherwin et al., 2004).

of the two most influential, high-quality, U.S.-based early childhood interventions – the Perry

Preschool Project (PPP) and the Abecedarian Project (ABC). Both interventions used the method

of randomization to assign enriched environments to disadvantaged children. Participants are

followed into adulthood. PPP was conducted in Ypsilanti, Michigan, starting in 1962; ABC in

Chapel Hill, North Carolina, starting in 1972. PPP provided preschool education at ages 3-5 and

home-based parenting guidance; ABC also included a health care and a nutritional component, and

lasted from birth until age 8.5 Data from PPP and ABC enable analysts to learn about the health

benefits of early life interventions for disadvantaged populations. Since children are generally in

good health, and reliable early life biomarkers predictive of later disease have yet to be discovered,

it is challenging to demonstrate health effects of early life interventions in the absence of long-term

follow-ups.

    The PPP data have rich information on behavior but not health. ABC has a survey of health

at age 34 in addition to measures of healthy behaviors. For both studies, we perform analyses

by gender and find substantial differences in the effects of treatment between males and females.

We present evidence that both the Perry and the Abecedarian interventions have statistically and

substantively significant effects on the health and healthy behaviors of their participants. The

specific outcomes affected vary across studies, although for both interventions, treatment effects

are much stronger and more precisely determined for males. The Perry male participants have

significantly fewer behavioral risk factors (in particular smoking) by the time they have reached

age 40, while the Abecedarian male participants are in better physical health by their mid 30s.

We document the important role played by enhancements in childhood traits, above and beyond

educational attainment and adult socioeconomic status, as mechanisms producing treatment effects.

    We use robust statistical methods and apply the frameworks developed in Heckman et al. (2010)

and Campbell et al. (2014) to systematically account for small sample sizes of the experiments, the

effects of multiple hypothesis testing, and non-random panel attrition to analyze these studies. We

adjust for departures from randomization protocols when appropriate. We show that accounting

for small sample sizes and multiple hypotheses affects inference from these studies.
    5
      The Abecedarian Project had a second-stage intervention at ages 5–8 via another randomized experimental
design. Campbell et al. (2008) show that the early educational intervention had far stronger effects than the school-
age treatment on the majority of the outcomes studied. Campbell et al. (2014) also show that the second-stage
intervention had no effects on health. Hence, in this paper we only analyze the first-stage intervention.



                                                         2
    Rather than using arbitrarily constructed aggregates of health indicators as employed in previous

analyses of these experiments, we use more interpretable disaggregated measures. We examine the

mechanisms through which treatment effects arise using dynamic mediation analyses. We use as

mediators both early child developmental traits and adult socioeconomic outcomes.

    We address the challenges that analysts face when comparing results across experiments. The

baseline characteristics of the populations treated differ. Treatments vary. Follow-up periods

and questions asked are not strictly comparable. Many treatment effects across programs are

not comparable because different outcomes are measured, different survey instruments are used,

and different ages are sampled. Where outcome measures are comparable, estimated treatment

effects are stronger for ABC males compared to PPP males. The imprecise estimates for women

found in each program translate into imprecise estimates of differences in female program effects.

Our analysis suggests that simple comparisons of treatment effects across programs as featured in

commonly reported meta-analyses (see, e.g., Camilli et al., 2010; Karoly et al., 2005) are potentially

very misleading guides to policy.

    The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the ABC and PPP interventions. Section 3

discusses the statistical challenges addressed in this paper and presents our econometric procedures.

Section 4 presents and discusses our estimates of treatment effects and the results of our mediation

analyses. Section 5 concludes.



2       The ABC and PPP Interventions

Both the ABC and the PPP interventions were center-based small-scale programs designed to enrich

the early environments of disadvantaged children. The main characteristics of both interventions are

displayed in Table 1. The Perry Preschool Project (PPP) took place in the mid-1960s in the district

of the Perry Elementary School, a public school in Ypsilanti, Michigan (a small city near Detroit).

The Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) took place one decade later at the Frank Porter Graham

Child Development Institute at the University of North Carolina’s Chapel Hill campus. Eligibility

was based on weighted scales which included multiple indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage,

although the specific items and weights differed across the two interventions.6 ABC enrolled children
    6
     The specific ABC and PPP items and the PPP weights are reported in Table 1; the weights used for the ABC
scale are reported in Table 1 of Ramey et al. (2000).


                                                     3
soon after birth7 until 5 years of age8 for a very intensive 6.5 to 10 hours per day program. PPP

enrolled children at 3 years of age for 2 years9 for a less intensive 2.5-3 hours per day program.10

Details of the randomization protocol are presented in Section 1 of the Web Appendix. In this

section we report: (a) the background characteristics of the two populations (subsection 2.1); (b)

the interventions administered (subsection 2.2); and (c) the data collections carried out (subsection

2.3).

    [Table 1 about here.]


2.1     The background characteristics of the two populations

While both ABC and PPP targeted disadvantaged populations, the background characteristics of

the participants differed. We summarize them in Table 2 and Figures 1 and 2.11

    The first substantial difference that emerges is in the IQs of participants. While the average

Stanford-Binet score at 3 years of age is 79 points in PPP, it is 14 points higher at the same age

in the control group of ABC.12 This difference is also visible in Panel A of Figure 1, which shows

that the region of common support is limited to the bottom half of the density of ABC. The partial

overlap in the IQ distributions across the two interventions arises because PPP required an IQ

smaller than 85 to be eligible to participate in the program.

    There is no significant difference in average health at birth (Table 2). However, more ABC

participants are born at low (< 2, 500 grams) or high birthweight (> 4, 000 grams), as shown in

Panel B of Figure 1.13

    Turning to the parental demographic characteristics, we see that the parents in PPP are older

than those in ABC, with the age difference amounting to six years for the mothers and to nine

years for the fathers (when fathers are present). The density reported in Panel D of Figure 1
   7
      The average age at entry for the treated was 8.8 weeks, and it ranged between 6 and 21 weeks.
   8
      As mentioned, the intervention consisted of a two-stage treatment: a preschool stage (0-5) and a school-age
stage (5-8). In this paper we only study the effects of the preschool treatment, both for comparability with PPP, and
because previous work has reported negligible or no effects from the second-stage treatment.
    9
      The first cohort experienced only one year of treatment, starting at age 4.
   10
      Note that, if we compute the hourly cost per child, the PPP intervention was more expensive than the ABC.
   11
      See Hojman et al. (2013) for a comparison of the background characteristics of the ABC, PPP, CARE (Carolina
Approach to Responsive Education), IHDP (the Infant Health and Development Program) and ETP (Early Training
Project).
   12
      We only use data from the control group for ABC, since it started at birth, hence by age 3 the treatment group
would have already received three years of the program.
   13
      Parenthetically, the median birthweight for PPP was 3.14 kg, compared to a national population average of 3.29
kg in 1964. For ABC, the median birthweight was 3.24, compared to a national population average of 3.34.


                                                         4
shows that the region of common support for paternal age only extends between the ages 20-45.

In line with the older parental age, the participants of the PPP intervention also have, on average,

a greater number of siblings (4, up to a maximum of 12, as shown in Panel C of Figure 2), while

ABC children are more likely to be first born. Additionally, ABC participants are more likely to

be born to single mothers, with the father being present almost twice as often in PPP households

than in ABC households (53% vs. 29%, Table 2). Finally, the parents of ABC participants have

higher socioeconomic backgrounds, higher levels of education, and are more likely to be employed

(as shown in Table 2 and Panels A-B and D-E of Figure 2, respectively).

    In sum, while more children in Perry are from two-parent homes,14 many other socioeconomic

characteristics are more favorable for ABC participants, especially for those with fathers present.15

However, as shown in Table 1 of the Web Appendix, controlling for these background characteristics

does not substantially change estimated treatment effects.

    [Table 2 and Figures 1 and 2 about here]


2.2     The Interventions16

Intervention Strategies From 1962 to 1967, the Perry Preschool Project (PPP) recruited dis-

advantaged children three to four years of age on the basis of two selection criteria: “cultural

deprivation” and evidence of being “educably mentally retarded” based on the Stanford-Binet In-

telligence score (mean = 79). Mid-intervention and follow-up summaries describe a program that

operated for 2.5 to 3 hours each morning, 5 days per week over the course of a school year (Weikart,

1966, 1967, 1970). Except for the first treatment group that participated for one year only, four

treatment groups experienced two years of the instructional program. In addition to a monthly

parent group meeting hosted by social work staff, PPP further incorporated a 60-90-minute weekly

home visit, designed to offer individualized instruction as needed, establish teacher-primary care-

giver relationship, and involve the latter in their child’s development (Weikart, 1964, 1967, 1970).

    Weikart’s descriptions of the program change significantly throughout the course of the inter-

vention, including its length and format for both children and parents, the intervention method-
   14
      See, e.g., Lopoo and DeLeire (2014) for a recent study on the long-term outcomes of children born to single
mothers.
   15
      See, e.g., Carneiro et al. (2013) and Dickson et al. (2015) on the intergenerational effects of maternal education
on cognitive and behavioural outcomes for a sample of children from US and UK, respectively.
   16
      See Heckman et al. (2014b) for a more detailed description of the ABC and PPP interventions.

ologies and learning activities, the role of the teacher, the role of the child as a learner, and even

his/her understanding of cognitive development (Weikart, 1964, 1967, 1970). This reflects both

experimentation within the program and the changed framing of it as the literature on child devel-

opment evolved while the program was being implemented. What remains consistent, however, are

Weikart’s stated primary goals of cognitive development with an emphasis on language develop-

ment, the use of developmental theory in guiding curriculum framework and intervention methods,

and a combined approach of a morning center-based preschool program and a weekly afternoon

home visit by the child’s teacher (Weikart, 1964, 1967, 1970). The learning program implemented

in PPP from 1962 to early 1965 included unit-based instruction, intentional adult-child interac-

tive language, and a rich set of learning materials including Montessori tools, movement/dancing,

and an emphasis on caregiver-planned large- and small-group activities. In the final year of PPP,

the learning program more closely resembled the later developed HighScope curriculum including

“Plan, Do, Review.” Individual instruction was not a specific feature of the Perry center-based

program (see Weikart et al., 1978 and Kuperman, 2014a), whereas in ABC, it was a key component

of the learning program.

   Ten years after PPP began, ABC recruited four cohorts of infants born between 1972 and 1977

at hospitals near Chapel Hill, NC, for an intensive early childhood intervention designed to prevent

retardation for low-income multi-risk populations. Treated children were transported by program

staff from their homes to the newly built Frank Porter Graham Center (FPGC) for up to 9 hours

each day for 50 weeks/year (Ramey et al., 1976).

   What is now known as the “Abecedarian Approach” emerged from a process of distinctive cur-

riculum development. The number of teaching and learning activities expanded through formal

testing and evaluation with each successive ABC cohort. The Learningames for the First Three

Years were designed by both Joseph Sparling and Isabelle Lewis as play-based adult-child activities

for the expressed purposes of minimizing infants’ maladaptive, high-risk behaviors, and enhancing

adult-infant interactions that support children’s language, motor, and cognitive development and

socio-emotional competence, including task orientation (Sparling and Lewis, 1979). Influenced by

Piaget’s theory of developmental stages, each individual activity included a stated learning objec-

tive thought to be developmentally appropriate, specification of needed materials, directions for

teacher behavior, and expected child outcome. In addition to tracking and dating activity assign-

                                                  6
ments, these records enabled staff to prescribe a specific instructional program every 2 to 3 weeks

for each child by rotating learning activities and to note developmental progress or its lack thereof

from program entry to approximately age 36 months (Ramey et al., 1976). During preschool, ABC

supplemented the original Learningames with a program for three and four year olds, thought

to be developmentally appropriate and developed together by staff and caregiving professionals

with assistance from outside consultants. The Abecedarian Approach to Social Competence encour-

aged cognitive development, sociolinguistic and communicative competence, and reinforced socially

adaptive behaviors involved in task orientation, peer-peer relations, adult-child relationships, and

emotional self-awareness (Ramey et al., 1976, 1982). Language intervention remained the critical

ABC vehicle for supporting cognition and social skills (McGinness and Ramey, 1981).

    The two randomized controlled trials share many features in common, including an emphasis on

language and cognitive development in the intervention for disadvantaged children, the background

influence of developmental theory on the design of the curriculum but with plenty of room for

individual adaptation, and general similarities such as the use of field trips as a learning tool, orga-

nization of the learning environment during preschool years, and ongoing professional development

for staff. However, a comparison of reports drafted by the directors of PPP and ABC concurrently

with their own interventions also reveals some key differences.

    The programs differed in the way they perceived their treated children and designed their in-

tervention goals and conceptual approaches. Perry was motivated by a “deficits” model, and the

intervention was perceived as remediating cultural deprivation and mental retardation. PPP was

launched in an era when cognitive psychology was in ascendance and shaped educational policy.17

This conceptual approach initially led Weikart to prioritize cognitive over socio-emotional learning

in his reporting of the Perry program, which he described as a key feature of a traditional middle

class nursery school. However, in practice, PPP teachers modified this agenda and intentionally

fostered the child’s socio-emotional development, including self-regulation and the capacity of mak-

ing judgments.18 The middle class teachers who initiated the program did for the disadvantaged

children in Perry what middle class parents do for their own children (Heckman et al., 2014b) and

effectively prevented the program from being focused solely on cognition. Indeed, in reporting the

first findings from the study, Weikart (1967) wrote

      “Preschool must demonstrate ability to affect the general development of children in

      three areas. These are intellectual growth, academic achievement, and school behav-

      ior.”

   In contrast, ABC aspired to prevent retardation and thus recruited their sample from birth.

By the time it was launched, the literature on child development had evolved beyond a sole focus

on cognition. It benefitted from an enhanced understanding of the work of child development

psychologists Piaget and Vygotsky. For ABC, socio-emotional learning and cognitive development

were intertwined and embedded within adult-child interactions and adult-mediated activities that

incorporated an intentional use of language as a teaching tool to elicit children’s emerging social

competence and ability to reason.

   ABC and PPP differ on a number of program elements. In addition to the difference in intensity

and duration, ABC and PPP involved the family in different ways. PPP incorporated weekly

home visits, designed to offer opportunities for individualized instruction as needed, to establish

a relationship between the child’s center-based teacher and the mother/primary caregiver, and

to involve her in the child’s education. Weekly home visits lasted approximately 60-90 minutes

(Weikart, 1964, 1970). In addition, PPP offered an opportunity for parents to participate in monthly

group meetings hosted by social work staff (Weikart, 1964, 1967). In ABC, while there were no

home visits, parents were invited to be actively involved in preschool classrooms and to participate

in parent-teacher conferences to share updates about the treated child. Both treatment and control

groups in ABC received family support in the form of social work services on a request basis to

obtain family planning and legal help.

   Early reports of parental involvement in ABC suggest that each nursery and classroom staff

member was assigned four treatment families to contact in order to establish individualized and

open communication between parents and the center. Teachers were directed to plan an afternoon

for each family to visit FPGC, observe their child, and to meet other teachers and medical staff.

Families were provided photographs of their child engaging in program activities that served to

further strengthen the connection between home and school. Reports indicate that family holiday

parties were well attended (Ramey et al., 1977).

The health care and nutritional components                     ABC differed significantly from PPP because it

also included health care and nutritional components. Table 3 displays the treatments and exams

included in the health care component of the ABC. Free pediatric care was provided to all the

treated children who attended the Frank Porter Graham (FPG) center (Ramey et al., 1982). The

on-site medical staff had two pediatricians, a family nurse practitioner, and a licensed practical

nurse.19 The well child care component included assessments at ages 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24

months, and yearly thereafter, in which a complete physical exam was performed and parents of

the treated children were counseled about child health care, nutrition, growth and development.20

The ill child care component included daily surveillance of all the treated children in the FPG

center for illness.21

    When ill, children were examined by a member of the health care staff, laboratory tests were

performed, the appropriate treatment was given, and the child was followed until recovery (Ramey

et al., 1982). The cost of medicines was not covered; the parents were responsible for buying them,

but the staff on-site ensured they were taken. If children were referred to a hospital, hospitalization

costs were not covered. Only the treated children received the free pediatric care. Free medical

care for the control children had been initially offered at the FPG center and two university-

affiliated hospitals. However, this incentive was discontinued after the first year (Heckman et al.,

2014b; Ramey et al., 1976), and the control families were left with the other sources of health care

that were available at the time: community clinics for visits (mostly crowded and with rotating

doctors), the local office of the health department for well-baby checkups and immunizations, and

the hospital E.R. for emergencies.22 Hence, an important difference was the continuity of early

health care provided to the treated as compared to the control group.

    In addition to primary pediatric care, the treated children also received breakfast, lunch, and

an afternoon snack at the center. Food was prepared in kitchens approved by the local health

department. A nutritionist who planned the local public school menus consulted with the kitchen

service to plan menus for breakfast, lunch, and daily snacks. On the other hand, PPP did not

complementing the rest of the learning program for promoting self-help, motor skill development,

social cognition and social behavior, self-regulation, language development, and specifically, for

knowledge of healthy eating behaviors. Not only were meals and snacks at ABC prepared according

to state nutritional guidelines, but a formal educational structure was in place for meals and eating

at FPGC before ABC started collecting data. In contrast, in Perry, there was no formal activity

supporting healthy nutrition or eating behaviors. The teachers provided healthy snacks in the form

of crackers and juice. Perry used snack time to support language and social development.23

Child care experiences of the control group The PPP was launched before Head Start and

the push for early childhood interventions. The control group was in home care or in neighborhood

home-care settings with neighbors, friends, and relatives. Things had changed ten years later.

Children in the control group of the ABC intervention attended various types of out-of-home care

before age 5, for periods of time varying between 0 and 60 months (Pungello et al., 2010). This

paper does not account for control contamination, which is dealt with extensively in Garcı́a et al.

(2014). They find that doing so enhances estimated program effects. Thus, our estimates are

conservative.


2.3      The Data Collected

Both the ABC and PPP interventions followed participants over time and collected a substantial

amount of information about their lives. In PPP, data were collected annually from age 3 (the en-

try age) until the fourth grade (measures of intelligence and academic aptitude, achievement tests,

assessments of socio-emotional development and information from school records starting at kinder-

garten through secondary education). We know if participants went to post-secondary education

but do not know teacher ratings or performance there, apart from information on graduation. Four

follow-ups with interviews were conducted at ages 15, 19, 27, and 40. The retention rate has been

high throughout: 91% of the original participants were re-interviewed at age 40.24 Information on

       Among those lost at follow-up, 5 controls and 2 treated were dead, 2 controls and 2 treated had gone missing.

the health of the subjects was collected only at ages 27 and 40, all based on self-reports.25

     Richer data were collected for the Abecedarian intervention than for the Perry intervention.

Background characteristics were collected at the beginning of the program, and include parental

attributes, family structure, socioeconomic status, and the health of the mother and of the baby.

Anthropometric measures were collected and a wide variety of assessments of the cognitive and

socio-emotional development of the child and of both the family and the classroom environment

were conducted, from soon after the start of the preschool program until the end of the school year.

Four follow-ups with interviews were carried out at ages 12, 15, 21, and 30. A biomedical sweep

was conducted when the participants were in their mid-30s, for the purpose of collecting indicators

of cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk (Campbell et al., 2014).

     Many measures taken are not strictly comparable across programs. Section 3 in the Web Ap-

pendix gives details on the exact survey questions asked and on the construction of the variables

examined. Table 2 in the Web Appendix summarizes their comparability. The lack of compara-

bility poses several challenges for meta-analyses, commonly reported in the literature and child

development.

     We focus our empirical analysis on a set of outcomes of public health relevance according to

the following categories: (1) Physical Health; (2) Health Insurance and Demand for Health Care;

(3) Behavioral Risk Factors/Lifestyles (diet and physical activity, smoking and drinking).



3        Methodology

Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are often touted as the “gold standard” of program eval-

uation (see, e.g., Ludwig et al., 2011). A major benefit of randomization is that, when properly

executed, it solves the problem of selection bias for mean outcomes. RCTs can render treat-

ment assignments statistically independent of unobserved characteristics that affect the choice of

participation in a program and that might also affect outcomes. As a consequence, a perfectly

implemented randomized experiment enables analysts to evaluate mean treatment effects by using

simple differences-in-means between treatment and control groups.26
    25
     An age 50 follow-up has almost been completed, which includes collection of an extensive set of biomarkers.
    26
     As noted by Heckman (1992), experiments only identify means and not distributions and so do not directly
address many important policy questions without making assumptions beyond the validity of randomization. See
also Heckman et al. (1997).


                                                      11
    In spite of their potential benefits, RCTs are often plagued by a range of statistical problems

that require careful attention. They often have small sample sizes and many outcomes. They are

often implemented through complex randomization protocols that depart from an idealized random

experiment (see, e.g., Heckman et al., 2010). A compromised randomization protocol is not an issue

for the ABC experiment. It is a substantial issue in PPP. Heckman et al. (2010) discuss this point

in detail. We apply their method in this paper and refer the reader to that paper for details of the

procedure and how it effects estimated treatment effects.

    In addition to these challenges, the small sample sizes of the PPP and ABC interventions sug-

gest that standard applications of large sample statistical inference procedures, which rely on the

asymptotic behavior of test statistics, may be inappropriate. The large number of outcomes poses

the danger of arbitrarily selecting “statistically significant” treatment effects for which high values

of test statistics arise by chance. Indeed, for any particular treatment parameter, the probability

of rejecting a true null hypothesis of no treatment effect, i.e., the type-I error, grows exponen-

tially as the number of tested outcomes increases. This phenomenon leads to “cherry picking” of

“significant” results. Finally, non-random attrition can generate spurious inferences.

    We account for all of these issues in our statistical analysis. We address the common criticism

of analyses of the Perry and Abecedarian data regarding the validity of large sample inferential

procedures. We examine if statistically significant results survive after accounting for small sample

sizes, multiple hypothesis testing, non-random attrition, and departures from the intended random-

ization protocols. For many outcomes, we find a gain in statistical significance when we analyze

the PPP data using permutation tests valid in small samples. However, for a similar proportion of

outcomes, when we analyze the ABC data with the same methods, we lose statistical significance.

Additionally, adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing affects inference in both PPP and ABC.

Hence, our more careful statistical analyses make a substantial difference in the inference about

the effectiveness of early childhood programs that is often not fully appreciated in the advocacy-

driven early childhood literature. Adjustments for attrition and compromised randomization are

implemented but not discussed in this paper.27

    The rest of this section is organized as follows. We discuss our method for inference in sub-

randomization an issue for ABC.

Subsection 3.3 describes our correction for attrition. Subsection 3.4 describes our method for de-

composing statistically significant adult treatment effects into interpretable components associated

with inputs that are enhanced by the treatment.28 A more detailed description of our methodology

is presented in Section 3 of the Web Appendix.


3.1      Small Sample Inference

We address the problem of small sample size by using exact permutation tests which are tailored

to the randomization protocol implemented in each intervention, following the analysis of Heckman

et al. (2010). Permutation tests are distribution free. They are valid in small samples since they

do not rely on the asymptotic behavior of the test statistics. Permutation-based inference gives

accurate p-values even when the sampling distribution is skewed (see, e.g., Lehmann and Romano,

2005). It is often used when sample sizes are small and sample statistics are unlikely to be normal.

In order to discuss our methodology more formally, we first introduce some notation.

   Let Y = (Yi : i ∈ I) denote the vector of outcomes Yi for participant i in sample I. Let

D = (Di : i ∈ I) be the binary vector of treatment assignments, Di = 1 if participant i is assigned

to the treatment group, and Di = 0 otherwise. We use X = (Xi : i ∈ I) for the set of covariates

used in the randomization protocol. Our method exploits the invariance of the joint distribution

(Y, D) under permutations that swap the elements of the vector of treatment status D.

   The invariance of the joint distribution (Y, D) stems from two statistical properties. First,

randomized trials guarantee that D is exchangeable for the set of permutations that swap elements

in D within the strata formed by the values taken by X (see Heckman et al., 2010 for a discussion).

This exchangeability property comes from the fact that under the null hypothesis of no treatment

effect, scrambling the treatment status of the participants sharing the same values of X does not

change the underlying distribution of the vector of treatment assignments D. Second, the hypothesis

of no treatment effect implies that the joint distribution of (Y, D) is invariant under these selected

permutations of the vector D. As a consequence, a statistic based on assignments D and outcomes

Y is distribution-invariant under reassignments based on the class of admissible permutations.

Lehmann and Romano (2005) show that under the null hypothesis and conditional on the data,
  28
       This approach is called “mediation analysis” in the applied statistics literature.


                                                            13
the exact distribution of such statistics is given by the collection of its values generated by all

admissible permutations.

   An important feature of the exchangeability property is that it relies on limited information

on the randomization protocol. It does not require a full specification of the distribution D nor of

the assignment mechanism, but only the knowledge of which variables are used as covariates X in

implementing the randomization protocol. Moreover, the exchangeability property remains valid

under compromises of the randomization protocol that are based on the information contained in

observed variables X. In PPP, the assignment variables X used in the randomization protocol are

cohort, gender, child IQ, socio-economic status (SES, as measured by the cultural deprivation scale)

and maternal employment status. Treatment assignment was randomized for each family on the

basis of strata defined by these variables. In the ABC study, the assignment variables X are cohort,

gender, maternal IQ, High Risk Index and number of siblings. The participants were matched in

pairs on the basis of strata defined by the X variables.


3.2   Correcting for Multiple Hypothesis Testing

The presence of multiple outcomes in these studies creates the potential problem of cherry picking

by analysts who report “significant” estimates. This generates a downward-biased inference with

p-values smaller than the true ones. To see why, suppose that a single-hypothesis test statistic

rejects a true null hypothesis at significance level α. Thus, the probability of rejecting a single

null hypothesis out of K null hypotheses is 1 − (1 − α)K even if there are no significant treatment

effects. As the number of outcomes K increases without bound, the likelihood of rejecting a null

hypothesis becomes 1.

   One approach that avoids these problems is to form arbitrarily equally weighted indices of

outcomes (see, e.g., Muennig et al., 2011, 2009). Doing so, however, produces estimates that are

difficult to interpret. Instead, we analyze disaggregated outcomes. We correct for the possibility

of arbitrarily selecting statistically significant treatment effects by conducting tests of multiple

hypotheses. We adopt the familywise error rate (FWER) as the Type-I error. FWER is the

probability of rejecting any true null hypothesis in a joint test of a set of hypotheses. The stepdown

algorithm of Lehmann and Romano (2005) exhibits strong FWER control, that is to say that FWER

is held at or below a specified level regardless of which individual hypotheses are true within a set

                                                 14
of hypotheses.

    The Lehmann and Romano (2005) stepdown method achieves better statistical properties than

traditional Bonferroni and Holm methods by exploiting the statistical dependence of the distribu-

tions of test statistics. By accounting for the correlation among single hypothesis p-values, we are

able to create less conservative multiple hypothesis tests. In addition, the stepdown method gener-

ates as many adjusted p-values as there are hypotheses, which facilitates examination of which sets

of hypotheses are rejected. There is some arbitrariness in defining the blocks of hypotheses that are

jointly tested in a multiple-hypothesis testing procedure. In an effort to avoid this arbitrariness,

we define blocks of independent interest that are selected on interpretable a priori grounds (for

example, unhealthy lifestyles such as smoking and drinking). We also report the p-values obtained

with the traditional Bonferroni method to compare it with the stepdown results.


3.3    Correcting for Attrition

Non-random attrition is also a potential source of bias in the estimation and inference of treatment

effects. While the treatment status D and preprogram variables X are observed for all participants,

outcomes Y are not observed for some participants due to panel attrition. As a consequence, this

may induce correlation between the treatment status and the unobserved characteristics that affect

sample retention.

    We address this issue by implementing an Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) procedure that

identifies features of the full outcome distribution by reweighting non-missing observations by their

probability of being non-attrited, which is modelled as function of observed covariates.29 The IPW

method relies on matching on observed variables to generate weights that are used to adjust the

treatment effects for the probability of retention. These probability weights are estimated using a

logit model, following the approach used in Campbell et al. (2014).30 Small sample IPW inference

is performed by recalculating these probabilities for each draw used to construct permutations.

In PPP, attrition rates are below 10% at age 30 follow-up. For ABC, attrition rates are lower –

roughly 6%. However, for the health component, there was substantial attrition, and we replicate
  29
     For a recent review, see Huber (2012).
  30
     We use a logit specification that models attrition as function of pre-program variables for PPP and for ABC
at ages 21 and 30, and also as function of variables collected in the previous sweep for ABC at mid 30s, given the
severity of attrition in the biomedical sweep. We follow the procedure applied in Campbell et al. (2014), which is
described in greater detail there.

3.4    Mediation Analysis

We also conduct a dynamic mediation analysis to decompose the effects of the treatment into

components associated with the experimentally induced enhancement of inputs at different ages in

the production of health.31 Recall that the observed outcome is:


                                           Y = DY1 + (1 − D)Y0 ,                                              (1)


where D denotes treatment assignment (D = 1 if treated and D = 0 otherwise), and Y1 and Y0 are

the counterfactual outcomes when D is fixed at 1 and 0, respectively. Our analysis is based on the

following linear health production function:


                                 Yd = κd + αd Id + βd X + ˜d ,           d ∈ {0, 1},                         (2)


where κd is an intercept; αd and βd are vectors of parameters; X are pre-program variables assumed

not to be affected by the treatment; ˜d is a zero-mean error term; Id are inputs in the production of

health that can be changed by the intervention, so that I = DI1 + (1 − D)I0 . Let J be the index

set of all inputs JM = {1, . . . , JM } and J \JM . Following Heckman et al. (2013), we decompose

the term αd Id in equation (2) into components due to the JM inputs we measure and the J \J M

inputs we do not:

                                                αdj Idj +              αdj Idj + βd X + ˜d
                                         X                       X
                            Yd = κd +                                                                         (3)
                                        j∈J M               j∈J J M


                                                        αdj Idj + βd X + d ,
                                                  X
                                       = τd +                                                                 (4)
                                                j∈J M
                                                                                            

                   P                                             P
where τd = κd +       j∈J J M                                   j∈J J M

    Our aim is to decompose treatment effects into components attributable to changes in measur-
  31
     We thank an anonymous referee for suggesting this analysis. A full comparable mediation analysis for both the
ABC sample and the PPP sample is difficult. Different measurements have been collected in the two interventions
(for example, the Pupil Behavior Inventory has only been used in PPP, while height and weight have only been
measured in ABC), and the data collection was carried out at different ages.




                                                            16
able inputs. The decomposition is as follows:
                                                                                          
                                            X                 
  E(Y1 − Y0 |X) = (τ1 − τ0 ) + E                 ∆αj + α0j E(∆I j ) + (∆αj )E(I0j ) + (β1 − β0 ) X   (5)
                                          j∈J M


where ∆αj is a change in the parameters, and ∆I j is a change in the inputs. Clearly, unobserved

inputs may also be changed by the experiment. Those changes may be correlated with the observed

input changes. Heckman et al. (2013) discuss these issues and propose and implement methods for

addressing this potential endogeneity problem. Under assumptions specified in that paper, they

test and do not reject the null hypothesis that increments in unobservables are independent of

increments of observables. We apply their test for both interventions and we also fail to reject this

null hypothesis.32

Thus, we can safely simplify the notation and write equation (4) as:


                                                           αj Idj + βX + d .
                                                    X
                                       Yd = τd +                                                       (6)
                                                   j∈J M


Equation (1) can thus be rewritten as:

                                                        X
                                     Y = τ0 + τ D +            αj I j + βX + ,                        (7)
                                                       j∈J M


where τ = τ1 − τ0 is the contribution of unmeasured inputs to mean treatment effects,  = D1 +

(1 − D)0 is a zero-mean error term, and I = DI1 + (1 − D)I0 are the measured inputs. On the

basis of equation (7), we can decompose the effects of the intervention on health as:


                                                                       αj E(I1j − I0j ),
                                                                   X
                                E(Y1 − Y0 ) = (τ1 − τ0 ) +                                             (8)
                                                               j∈J M


where the second term on the right hand side is the contribution of measured inputs to the treatment

effect.

    We next expand this framework to consider two sets of inputs: childhood (indexed by C) and

adulthood (indexed by A) inputs, so that the vector I can be partitioned into two subvectors

   We denote this mediation analysis as “dynamic,” since we consider inputs at different ages,

where the early inputs can have both direct effects on the health outcomes, and indirect effects

operating through the late stage inputs. In our empirical application, we also compare it with the

results obtained from two “static” mediation analyses, i.e., a first one based on the following health

production function in which only early inputs are included:


                                                                       j j

as done for example in Muennig et al. (2009).33 As we will see, accounting for both early and late

inputs and for the dynamics in the process of formation of human capital makes a substantial differ-

ence. Excluding early inputs leads to an overestimation of the role played by late ones in explaining

the mechanisms through which the ABC and PPP interventions produced health impacts.



4         Empirical Results

This section presents the results of our empirical analysis. We discuss the mean treatment effects

in subsection 4.1, and the dynamic mediation analysis results in subsection 4.2.

     Departing from the previous literature in child development,34 we conduct our analysis by

gender. The rationale for this choice is based on both biological and behavioral considerations.

It is well-established in both animal and human studies that males are more greatly affected by

stressful environments (Kudielka and Kirschbaum, 2005). Gender differences in growth, health, and

mortality have been reported in the medical literature, starting in utero (see, e.g., Case and Paxson,

2005; Eriksson et al., 2009). In addition, differences between men and women in the propensity to

engage in unhealthy behaviors and in developing cardiovascular disease in the presence of common

risk factors have been well documented. These behavioral differences have led some scholars to

propose gender-based interventions (see, e.g., Courtenay et al., 2002; Juutilainen et al., 2004; Marino

et al., 2011; Wardle et al., 2004). Despite the large body of interdisciplinary evidence, substantial

gaps remain in our understanding of the sources of gender differences, especially in relation to the

interconnections between social and biological processes (Rieker and Bird, 2005; Short et al., 2013).

The magnitude of, and explanations for, gender differences likely vary depending on the specific

stage of the life cycle and the particular health measure considered (Matthews et al., 1999). The

existing literature does not provide a definitive answer as to why men and women have differential

responses to environments. Nonetheless, our analysis confirms the importance of taking the gender

dimension into account when analyzing the impacts of interventions. For the outcomes we study,

we find much stronger effects of these programs for boys than for girls.

         However, they do not control for omitted inputs.

         Heckman et al. (2010) and Campbell et al. (2014) are exceptions.

4.1   Estimates and Inference

Our main results are displayed in Tables 4 (for PPP) and 5 (for ABC). A complete set of results is

displayed in Web Appendix Section 5. The general pattern reported there is that for most blocks

of outcomes, there are few statistically significant health and/or health lifestyle outcomes for girls,

although there are numerous statistically significant health and/or health lifestyle outcomes for

boys. For each table, we present simple differences in means between the treatment and control

groups, and different p-values. These range from the traditional large-sample p-value for the one-

sided single hypothesis that treatment had a positive effect to the constrained permutation p-value

based on the Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) t-statistic associated with the difference in means

between the treatment groups, and its corresponding multiple hypothesis testing (stepdown) p-

value. Column (11) of each table reports p-values which account for all the statistical challenges

addressed in this paper. Finally, column (13) reports conservative Bonferroni p-values that adjust

for multiple hypothesis testing for comparison. We find statistically significant health effects for

males in both interventions. PPP promoted healthy behaviors. ABC improved biomarkers for

cardiovascular and metabolic health.

   We first examine the treatment effects for the PPP. It is evident from Table 4 that there is a

substantial and significant reduction in both smoking prevalence and intensity among the males in

the treatment group, with effects already present at age 27 and sustained through age 40. Muennig

et al. (2009) also examine the impact of the intervention on smoking, but were unable to detect

any impact, since they pool male and female samples. A separate analysis by gender is justified

on a priori grounds, on the basis of the interdisciplinary literature documenting differences in

both determinants of smoking behavior (Hamilton et al., 2006; Waldron, 1991) and responses to

interventions (Bjornson et al., 1995; McKee et al., 2005).

   Males in the treatment group have a lower lifetime prevalence (0.40 versus 0.56 in the control

group). They also have significantly lower rates of daily smoking than the controls, with the

proportion of daily smokers declining from 0.42 to 0.33 between age 27 and the age 40 follow-up

for the treated, while remaining stable at just above 50% for the controls, so that the difference

between the treated and the controls doubles in a decade. This difference - 20 percentage points

(p.p.) - amounts to the gap in smoking prevalence between men with an undergraduate degree



                                                  20
(11.9%) and those with low education (29.5%) in the US in 2005 (CDC, U.S. Department of Health

and Human Services, 2010). Additionally, while the smoking prevalence among the treated aligns

with US-wide figures for men below the poverty level in 2005 (34.3%, CDC), the one among the

controls is 20 p.p. higher. Another finding is that the biggest difference between the two groups

emerges in relation to the intensity of smoking, which is only partly reduced between the ages 27

and 40 due to a decline in intensity among the controls: the average number of cigarettes smoked

per day falls from 8.7 at age 27 to 6.5 at age 40.35 This is consistent with the decreasing trend

in smoking behavior which has been experienced in US after the release of the Surgeon’s General

Report in 1964, as documented in the literature (see, e.g., Fiore et al., 1989) – an opposite to the

trend documented for obesity.

    These estimates have substantial relevance for public health. Tobacco use is considered the

leading preventable cause of early death in the United States, and about half of all long-term

smokers are expected to die from a smoking-related illness (U.S. Department of Health and Human

Services, 2010). In two major studies carried out for the U.S., one estimated that lifetime male

smokers have a reduced life expectancy of 11 years as compared to nonsmokers, and that, although

male smokers who quit at younger ages have greater gains in life expectancy (by 6.9 to 8.5 years

for those who quit by age 35), even those who quit much later in life gain some benefits (Taylor

et al., 2002). Typical male smokers at age 24 have a reduced lifetime expectancy of up to 6 years

as compared to nonsmokers (Sloan et al., 2004); this includes those who subsequently quit. Hence,

we would expect this reduction in smoking to translate into improved health among the treated

participants relative to the controls as they age.

    Additionally, the treated males at age 40 in the PPP are more likely than the controls to report

having made dietary changes in the last 15 years for health reasons (38% versus 23%, see Table 4):

most of these changes are related to reductions in the amount of fat and salt in the diet, and in

the intake of junk food. Hence, we would expect these changes in dietary habits to also translate

into substantial health improvements (see, e.g., Sacks et al., 2001 for the effects of diet on blood
  35
     Instead, the ABC intervention seems not to have affected smoking behavior to the same extent. The only
statistically significant impact is a delay in the age of onset of smoking by approximately three years, from 17 years
old for the controls to 20 years old for the treated males (Table 5 in the Web Appendix). However, this effect loses
statistical significance once we account for multiple hypothesis testing. One plausible explanation for the lack of
impact of the ABC on smoking could be the much lower smoking prevalence experienced by the two cohorts, who
lived at two different phases of the smoking epidemics.



                                                         21
pressure).

   Finally, the PPP intervention also substantially improved the healthy habits of the women who

were randomized to the treatment group: by age 40, they are 33 percentage points more likely to

engage in regular physical activity than those randomly assigned to the control group (Table 4);

they also report to drink significantly less frequently in the age 27 sweep, although this difference

is no longer significant by the time they reach age 40.

   We next turn to analyze the impacts of the Abecedarian intervention, where anthropometric

and cardiovascular biomarkers have been collected during a physician’s visit when the subjects

were in their mid-30s. We first examine three outcomes not previously reported: weight, height

and BMI. For each of them, the treated males perform better than the controls: they are on

average 7 kilograms lighter, 5 cm taller, and with a BMI 4 points lower - just below the obesity

threshold. However, the statistical significance of these differences vanishes once we account for

multiple hypothesis testing. A comparison with nation-wide figures for 2011-2012 (Ogden et al.,

2014) reveals that ABC male participants are more likely to be both overweight and obese than

20-39 year old African-Americans: the prevalence of being overweight is 72% for the treated and

75% for the controls, against a nationwide figure of 63%, while that of obesity is 56% for the treated

and 62.5% for the controls, against a US average of 35%.

   Substantial differences are also found for all the reported outcomes related to blood pressure.

Treated males have on average lower values of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and are

less likely to fall into the Stage I hypertension category, according to the definition of the American

Heart Association.36 The magnitude of these impacts is both statistically and medically significant.

These estimated reductions in blood pressure are at least twice as large as those obtained from the

most successful multiple behaviors change risk factors randomized controlled trials (Ebrahim et al.,

2011). For example, the greatest reduction reported in their meta-analysis is -8.5 and -10 for

diastolic and systolic blood pressure, respectively (Cakir and Pinar, 2006), against the -13.5 and

-17.5 reported in the ABC.

   The superior health status of the males in the ABC treatment group is confirmed when we

analyze the use of health care (Table 5). The treated are significantly less likely to have ever been

hospitalized (21% versus 56% in the control group), and also to have had a scheduled treatment or
  36
       A more extensive set of health outcomes from the biomedical sweep is analyzed in Campbell et al. (2014).


                                                         22
exam in the past 12 months (22% versus 48% in the control group). They also enjoy higher health

insurance coverage than those in the control group, especially if provided by the employer.

   Finally, although they do not appear to be in better health than the controls, the females in

ABC benefit from the treatment in terms of improved healthy habits. Interestingly, we find an

improvement in healthy behavior for PPP and ABC. For example, the treated females in ABC

and PPP are more likely to engage in physical activity, although the measures are not strictly

comparable. ABC treatment women are more likely to eat fresh fruit than controls. They start

drinking alcohol later. Perry treatment women are less likely to drink than controls.

   For the outcomes with high comparability we find significant differences in the effects of the

treatment between the ABC and PPP interventions for males. For females, reflecting the impreci-

sion of estimates for them within each program, there are no sharp differences in treatment effect

across programs.37 Table 7 reports tests of equality of comparably measured treatment effects by

gender across the two studies. The relatively stronger effects found in ABC are consistent with

(but do not definitively establish) the efficacy of the early health care given to participants in that

program.


Methodological Issues           As noted in Section 3, both the ABC and PPP studies are plagued by

several problems. We deal with these problems using methods tailored to the characteristics of

each intervention. They make a substantial difference in inference, especially in case of the PPP.

For many outcomes in that intervention, statistical significance is gained (e.g., for the probability

of never being a smoker by age 40) or increases as we move from a large-sample analysis to a

permutation-based analysis. In contrast is the effect of applying more refined methods to the

Abecedarian sample. In that sample, no outcome is a gain seen in statistical significance. For a few

outcomes the treatment effects do not survive the multiple hypothesis testing correction (height and

BMI). This suggests that using large-sample methods does no harm in analyzing the Abecedarian

sample. However, accounting for multiple hypotheses makes a difference. This is evident when

we compare the stepdown p-values with the more conservative ones obtained using the Bonferroni

method (column 13). The analysis of the Perry intervention requires more sophisticated methods

to obtain reliable inference due, in part, to the greater complexity – and compromise – in its
  37
       Table 2 of the Web Appendix summarizes the comparability of the measures available in PPP and ABC.

randomization protocol.38 As reported in Campbell et al. (2014), adjusting for attrition from ABC

makes a difference.


4.2     Mechanisms Producing the Treatment Effects

We next investigate the mechanisms through which estimated treatment effects arise using the

mediation analysis described in Section 3.4. The literature suggests both direct and indirect mech-

anisms through which early childhood experiences might affect later health. Inadequate levels of

stimulation and nutrition, the lack of a nurturing environment and of a secure attachment rela-

tionship, are all inputs which have been shown to play important roles in retarding development,

by altering the stress response and metabolic systems, and leading to changes in brain architecture

(Taylor, 2010).39 On the one hand, child development might directly affect adult health, both

because early health conditions are quite persistent throughout the lifecycle (as for example in

the case of obesity, see Millimet and Tchernis, 2013), and because early traits are determinants of

lifestyles (Conti and Heckman, 2010).40 On the other hand, child development might also affect

adult health indirectly, by improving socioeconomic determinants such as education, employment

and income (Heckman et al., 2010) - factors which might also have an independent effect on health,

as documented in a large interdisciplinary literature (Deaton, 2001; Heckman et al., 2014a; Lochner,

2011; Marmot, 2002; Smith, 1999).

    As described in Section 3.4, we use a dynamic mediation analysis to examine the role of child-

hood and adult inputs in explaining treatment effects. We allow early childhood developmental

traits to have both a direct impact on outcomes, and an indirect one through educational attain-

ment and adult socioeconomic status. We then compare the results obtained from a dynamic

mediation analysis with those obtained by performing two static mediation analyses, where only

childhood and adulthood inputs in turn are included in the health capital production function.

The rationale for this exercise is to show the bias researchers might encounter by not considering

a dynamic model of human capital formation.

    Differences in both the timing and the content of the data collected do not allow us to use

      Given the lack of brain scans and measures of cortisol, we use proxies related to the underlying biological systems,
such as cognitive and behavioral test scores.

exactly the same childhood mediators. Nonetheless, we can analyze the role played by cognitive

and behavioral traits for both interventions. Additionally, we include comparable mediators for

educational attainment and adult socioeconomic status. In particular, for PPP, as early childhood

mediators we consider (following Heckman et al., 2013): IQ (the Stanford-Binet scale), reduced

externalizing behavior (reduced aggression) and academic motivation (constructed from selected

items of the Pupil Behavior Inventory available in Perry). All are measured at ages 7-9. Heckman

et al. (2013) show the powerful role of reduced externalizing behavior in producing a variety of

beneficial behaviors in PPP. For adult inputs, we use high school graduation as a measure of

educational attainment, unemployment (number of months unemployed in the last two years) and

monthly income at age 27 as measures of socioeconomic status. Heckman et al. (2010) show that

these measures were significantly affected by treatment. For the ABC, the childhood mediators

represent the three different domains of development of the child: the Bayley Mental Development

and the Stanford-Binet Scales for cognition, the Infant Behavior Record (IBR) Task Orientation

Scale for behavioral development,41 and the Body Mass Index of the child for physical health. All

are averages of standardized measurements taken at ages 1-2. All of these measures have been shown

in previous work to be significantly affected by the treatment (Burchinal et al., 1997; Campbell

et al., 2014). For adult inputs, we use college graduation as a measure of educational attainment,

and employment status and earnings at age 30 as measures of socioeconomic status. Garcı́a et al.

(2014) document a significant impact of the intervention on these outcomes.

    Complete results on mediation analyses are reported in the Web Appendix, Section 6. The

main results for the PPP are displayed in Figure 3. We decompose the treatment effects for the

outcomes which survive the multiple hypothesis testing correction, and display the results for those

for which we find that the mediators explain statistically significant shares of the treatment effects.

Consistent with the evidence in Heckman et al. (2013), we find that externalizing behavior is the

main mediator of the effect of the intervention on smoking for males. Its mediating role survives

even when later educational attainment or socioeconomic status is entered, and its effects on adult

behaviors are accounted for. It accounts for shares of the treatment effects ranging between 17%

and 48%. For example, it explains almost half of the treatment effect on the probability of not being
  41
     As seen in subsection 2.2, task orientation was one of the adaptive behaviors emphasized in the Abecedarian
curriculum.

a daily smoker at 27 years (p=0.084), and 43% on the number of cigarettes smoked per day at age

40 (p=0.052). The contribution of later life mediators is much smaller and fails to reach statistical

significance. The role played by childhood behavioral traits is consistent with evidence reported

in Conti and Heckman (2010), who show that improvements in child self-regulation are associated

with a significantly lower probability of being a daily smoker at age 30, above and beyond its

effect on education and the effect of boosts in education attainment on outcomes. This finding also

contributes to the recent but flourishing literature on the importance of personality and preferences

for healthy behaviors (Cobb-Clark et al., 2014; Conti and Hansman, 2013; Heckman et al., 2014a;

Moffitt et al., 2011). For females, we find that enhancements in cognition are the main mediators

of the effect of the intervention on physical activity. This is in line with the evidence reported in

Conti and Heckman (2010), who show that improvements in cognition are associated with better

health for women but not for men.

    Figure 4 compares the results from the dynamic mediation analysis with those obtained from

the two static mediation analyses, including, respectively, those using only childhood mediators

(panel (a)) and those using only adult mediators (panel (b)). They show that the decomposition

components for the childhood mediators are unchanged in the static and dynamic mediation analysis

(both in case of externalizing behaviors for males, and of cognition for females). However, only

including adult socioeconomic factors as inputs overestimates their importance. Indeed, while

the shares explained by income are large and statistically significant in the static model, they

are substantially reduced in magnitude and driven to insignificance when childhood factors are

accounted for. Childhood factors have an impact on health behaviors above and beyond their

effects on socioeconomic status in adulthood.

    We now turn to the results for the Abecedarian Program, which are displayed in Figure 5.42

We only report the results for men. Analysis of the female data from ABC shows few treatment

effects. The mediators are clearly not comparable with those used in the analysis of Perry. We

confirm the PPP results that early childhood traits mediate the health effects of the treatment,
   42
      We only report mediation results for the males in case of the ABC, since the dynamic mediation analysis and
the static mediation analysis with late inputs cannot be performed for females, since the only statistically significant
outcomes for this sample are those at age 21, and the late mediators are measured at age 30. The results for the static
mediation analysis with early inputs for the ABC are shown in the lower panel of Table 14 in the Web Appendix.
Differently from the case for males, no mediator appears to explain a statistically significant share of the treatment
effect. IQ explains 42% of the effect of the treatment on physical activity — a mechanisms similar to the one uncovered
for the PPP — although it fails to achieve statistical significance at conventional levels


                                                          26
above and beyond any induced improvement in adult socioeconomic status. The shares explained

by task orientation and the body mass index of the child range between 17% and 28% for blood

pressure, and between 20% and 31% for hypertension. Together, they explain half of the treatment

effect. This is consistent with existing evidence on both the role of child temperament43 and that of

physical development in the early years as key predictors for the risk of later obesity.44 Interventions

to fight the obesity epidemic starting in the childhood years are increasingly being advocated, both

to promote healthy dietary and exercise patterns (Deckelbaum and Williams, 2001), and to improve

parental knowledge of proper nutrition and recognition of the child being overweight.45 As described

in Section 2, the Abecedarian intervention included all these components. Treated children enjoyed

better nutrition and time for exercise while they were in the childcare center. These features of

the intervention could have had both a direct effect on their fat mass composition, and an indirect

effect through a change in their preferences and behaviors. Additionally, participants were not

allowed to eat outside meals and had to clean up the table once they were finished. This feature

might have further contributed to the development of their self-regulatory skills. Finally, the

counseling provided to the parents during the child well-care visits might have also improved the

eating environment at home. Unfortunately, the data at our disposal do not allow us to disentangle

the roles of these different channels.

    On the other hand, the role of childhood traits in explaining the effect of the treatment on

the greater availability of health insurance is much reduced when adult mediators are introduced.

Consistent with the fact that the provision of health insurance is tied to a job, we find that

employment status is the main mediator of the effect of treatment, with explained shares of 39% in

case of health care coverage and 26% in case of employment-provided health insurance, respectively.

Additionally, we also uncover evidence of a dynamic interaction between child and adult factors,

with 20% and 13% of the effect of the treatment on the health insurance outcomes being mediated

by the indirect effect of child BMI on adult employment.46

    We also compare the dynamic mediation analysis results with those obtained from the two
   43
      Specifically, task orientation has been associated with increased physical activity (Boyd et al., 2002); this seems a
plausible mechanism through which this trait might have by itself affected obesity, although data limitations prevent
us from testing this formally.

      As expected, higher child BMI at ages 1-2 is associated with a lower probability of being employed at age 30.

static mediation analyses (Figure 6). As for the PPP, we find that the shares explained by the

childhood mediators are comparable in the static and in the dynamic model for the physical health

outcomes. However, for health insurance outcomes they are substantially reduced in the dynamic

model (from 25% to 0% in the case of BMI) and driven to insignificance. In other words, the effects

of early traits on health care coverage work entirely through their impact on adult socioeconomic

status. Conversely, the small and insignificant shares of the treatment effects on the physical health

outcomes explained by employment in the static model are reduced to zero in the dynamic model.

Employment status still explains a significant share of the treatment effect on the health insurance

outcomes in the dynamic model (Panel (b) of Figure 6).47 For females, income appears to explain

half of the treatment effect on alcohol consumption in the static mediation model. This share

is reduced to 12% and driven to insignificance in the dynamic model (as shown in Panel (b) of

Figure 4).

     In sum, our analysis shows the powerful role of enhanced early childhood traits in explaining

the effect of the treatment on adult health and health behaviors, above and beyond any effects of

adult socioeconomic status. This is consistent with the framework of Cunha and Heckman (2009)

and Cunha et al. (2010), as reviewed and extended by Heckman and Mosso (2014), in which early

investments promote later life skills by boosting the base of capabilities that shape performance on

a variety of tasks. Our analysis shows the importance of developing the child in her entirety, going

beyond purely cognitive traits, within an integrated approach which also promotes behavioral and

health development.



5        Conclusions

This paper analyzes the long-term impacts on healthy behaviors and health of two of the oldest

and most cited U.S. early childhood interventions: the Ypsilanti Perry Preschool Program and the

Carolina Abecedarian Project. We address some of the major limitations of previous work analyz-

ing these data. That research does not account for the variety of statistical challenges that arise in
    47
    It should also be noticed that in the case of the static mediation analysis we do not pass the specification test
we apply following Heckman et al. (2013). See Table 11 in the Web Appendix.

analyzing these studies.48 For many outcomes, these corrections make a substantial difference.49

We also demonstrate differences across interventions in: (a) characteristics of the treated popula-

tions; (b) the nature of the treatment; and (c) the data collected. These differences create serious

challenges for the meta-analyses routinely conducted in the literature on child development.

    There are strong differences in the impact of the interventions by gender. Treatment effects are

particularly strong for men. Both the Perry and the Abecedarian interventions have statistically

significant effects on the healthy behavior and health of their participants. The specific health

outcomes affected vary by intervention. The Perry participants have significantly fewer behavioral

risk factors (in particular smoking) by the time they reach age 40. The Abecedarian participants

are in better physical health in their mid-30s. When strictly comparable outcomes are compared

across program, including people of the same gender, estimated treatment effects are stronger for

male ABC participants. This is broadly consistent with the emphasis on early health found for

ABC. We find no statistically significant differences across program for women.

    In an attempt to shed light on the mechanisms through which these treatment effects emerge,

we conduct dynamic mediation analyses. Despite the lack of overlap in the measurements taken

in the two interventions, the outcomes significantly affected by them, and the imperfect compara-

bility of the mediators, we have uncovered an important role of enhanced early childhood traits as

sources of adult treatment effects, above and beyond adult enhancements in socioeconomic status.

This evidence is broadly consistent with the models of dynamic capability formation reviewed in

Heckman and Mosso (2014). Skills developed early in life enhance the capabilities of persons to

effectively perform a variety of lifetime tasks.

    As the cohorts we have studied age and diseases start becoming more prevalent and manifest,

it will be valuable to assess the contribution of behavioral risk factors and health insurance as

additional mechanisms explaining the health effects of early childhood interventions. Our results

contribute to an emerging body of evidence that shows the potential of early life interventions for

preventing disease and promoting health.


   48
      Compromised randomization is not an issue with the ABC program. For Perry, where it is an issue, we apply
the methods discussed in Heckman et al. (2010), where they make a difference in the reported estimates.
   49
      Heckman et al. (2010) show that correcting for compromised randomization in Perry as we do in this paper
makes a difference. Correcting for attrition from the medical wave of ABC has substantial impacts on estimates.

Notes: These figures present the density estimation of four pre-program variables collected in both the Perry and Abecedarian
interventions. Panel A plots the Stanford-Binet IQ score at 3 years of age (we only use data for the control group for the
ABC intervention, since it started at birth). Panel B plots the weight at birth in kilograms. Panel C and D plot the mother’s
and father’s age at the time of the participant’s birth. These estimates are based on a normal kernel function with optimal
bandwidth for normal densities.

     Notes: These figures present estimates of the empirical distributions of three categorical and three binary variables collected in both the Perry and Abecedarian interventions.
     All variables were collected at the onset of each intervention. Panels A and B: mother’s and father’s last grade completed. Panel C: the number of participant’s siblings. Panel
     D and E: mother’s and father’s working status (a binary indicator which takes value 1 if the parent is employed and 0 otherwise). Panel F: presence of the father (a binary
     indicator which takes value 1 if the participant’s father is a current resident of the household).

       Well-Child  Assessments were made at 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months, and yearly thereafter.
         Visits    A health history and a social history were obtained and a complete physical examination was performed.
     Immunizations Appropriate immunizations (diphteria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, and rubella) as recommended by the American Academy
                   of Pediatrics were given.
       Lab Tests   A sickle cell preparation was obtained at 9 and 12 months from all black children.
                   A skin test for tubercolosis was given yearly, and a hematocrit was done at 9 and 18 months and yearly thereafter.
                   During symptom-free periods, the children were cultured for bacteria at two-week intervals, and for viruses and mycoplasmas every four weeks.
        Health     The parents were present at the child well-care visits. They were taught and counseled in the areas of: feeding and nutrition, weaning, cleanliness,
       Education   skin care, child growth and development, behavior, toilet training, accident prevention, and dental hygiene.
                   They were also encouraged to express their concerns and to discuss the problems that they were facing.
        Vision     Routine screening for vision was provided annually.
        Hearing    During symptom-free periods, the children underwent pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry once a month.
                   If any tympanogram was abnormal, the child was seen for repeat otoscopy and tympanometry after two weeks.

       Sick-care   Daily surveillance of all children in the center for illness: the licensed practical nurse visited the classroom daily to review the health status
                   of the children and receive reports from the parents.
                   Children who were unwell were promptly seen by a member of the health care staff.
                   A history was obtained and a physical examination done; appropriate laboratory tests and cultures were performed.
                   Children had their upper respiratory secretions cultured by throat swab and a saline nasal wash for isolation of viruses and bacteria.
                   A computer form was completed each time the child was examined, listing pertinent history, physical findings, diagnosis, and culture results.
                   Parents were informed of the nature of the child’s ailment, and given prescriptions, but were responsible for buying medicines.
                   The family nurse practitioner made sure that half of the prescriptions were sent home and half to the center.
                   The children were followed through the illness to recovery. They were allowed to attend the center when ill except in case of chickenpox.
                   These referrals were made to specialists and hospitals but specialized visits and hospitalizations were not paid for.

     * In the first year of the study, the control children received medical care from the FPG center. After the first year, they were left on their own.
     Free medical care for the control children was offered by FPGC and 2 university-affiliated hospitals to control families, and reports suggest that this incentive was discontinued
     after the first year (Heckman et al., 2014a; Ramey et al., 1976).

Notes: This table presents the inference results for selected outcomes of the Perry Intervention. The columns present the
following information: (1) describes the variable of interest; (2) displays the sample size for the control group; (3) displays
the sample size for the treatment group; (4) displays the control mean; (5) displays the treatment mean; (6) displays the
unconditional difference in means between treatment and control groups (absolute value); (7) displays the asymptotic p-value
for the one-sided single hypothesis based on the t-statistic associated with the unconditional difference in means. The remaining
columns present permutation p-values based on 30,000 draws. (8) displays the single hypothesis one-sided naive permutation
p-value (by naive we mean based on an unconstrained permutation scheme); (9) displays the one-sided single hypothesis con-
strained permutation p-value based on the t-statistic associated with the difference in means between treatment groups (by
constrained permutation we mean that permutations are done within strata defined by the pre-program variables used in the
randomization protocol: gender, cohort indicator, the median of the cultural deprivation scale, child IQ at entry and mother
employment status. More specifically, we simulate the pairwise matching defined in the randomization protocol using these
variables and permute the treatment status within matched participants). (10) displays the multiple hypothesis testing (step-
down) p-values associated with (9). The multiple hypothesis testing is applied to blocks of outcomes indicated by horizontal
lines. (11) displays the one-sided single hypothesis constrained permutation p-value based on the IPW (Inverse Probability
Weighting) t-statistic associated with the difference in means between treatment groups. Probabilities of IPW are estimated
using the following variables: gender, presence of the father in the home at entry, cultural deprivation scale, child IQ at entry
(Stanford-Binet), number of siblings and maternal employment status. (12) displays the multiple hypothesis testing (stepdown)
p-values associated with (11). The multiple hypothesis testing is applied to block of outcomes indicated by horizontal lines.
(13) displays the Bonferroni p-value=m × pIP W , where pIP W is the unadjusted p-value in col. (11) and m is the number of
hypotheses to test in the block.

Notes: This table presents the inference results for selected outcomes of the Abecedarian Intervention. The columns present
the following information: (1) describes the variable of interest; (2) displays the sample size for the control group; (3) displays
the sample size for the treatment group; (4) displays the control mean; (5) displays the treatment mean; (6) displays the
unconditional difference in means between treatment and control groups (absolute value); (7) displays the asymptotic p-value
for the one-sided single hypothesis based on the t-statistic associated with the unconditional difference in means. The remaining
columns present permutation p-values based on 30,000 draws. (8) displays the single hypothesis one-sided naive permutation
p-value (by naive we mean based on an unconstrained permutation scheme); (9) displays the one-sided single hypothesis con-
strained permutation p-value based on the t-statistic associated with the difference in means between treatment groups (by
constrained permutation we mean that permutations are done within strata defined by the pre-program variables used in the
randomization protocol: gender, cohort indicator, number of siblings, high risk index at birth, and mother WAIS full IQ score.
More specifically, we simulate the pairwise matching defined in the randomization protocol using these variables and permute
the treatment status within matched participants). (10) displays the multiple hypothesis testing (stepdown) p-values associated
with (9). The multiple hypothesis testing is applied to blocks of outcomes indicated by horizontal lines. (11) displays the one-
sided single hypothesis constrained permutation p-value based on the IPW (Inverse Probability Weighting) t-statistic associated
with the difference in means between treatment groups. Probabilities of IPW are estimated using gender- and wave-specific
covariates. See Campbell et al. (2014) for details. (12) displays the multiple hypothesis testing (stepdown) p-values associated
with (11). The multiple hypothesis testing is applied to block of outcomes indicated by horizontal lines. (13) displays the
Bonferroni p-value=m × pIP W , where pIP W is the unadjusted p-value in col. (11) and m is the number of hypotheses to test
in the block.

Notes: This graph provides a simplified representation of the results of the dynamic mediation analysis of the
statistically significant outcomes for the PPP intervention. Each bar represents the total treatment effect normalized
to 100%. One-sided p-values that test if the share is statistically significantly different from zero are shown above
each component of the decomposition. The mediators displayed are: externalizing behavior, as in Heckman et al.
(2013) among the early childhood inputs; and income as in Heckman et al. (2010) among the adult inputs. The
complete mediation results are reported in Tables 2 and 3 in the Web Appendix. The definition of each outcome is
reported in Section 3 of the Web Appendix. The sample the outcomes refer to (M = males; F = females) and the
age at which they have been measured (y.o. = years old) are shown in parentheses to the left of each bar, after the
description of the variable of interest. ***: significant at the 1 percent level; **: significant at the 5 percent level; *:

each component of the decomposition. The mediators displayed are: task orientation as in Burchinal et al. (1997)

they have been measured (y.o. = years old) are shown in parentheses to the left of each bar, after the description
of the variable of interest (HI=Health Insurance). BMI-Employment is the share of the treatment effect which can
be attributed to the indirect effect of experimentally induced changes in BMI affecting health insurance coverage
through its impact on employment (see equation 12). ***: significant at the 1 percent level; **: significant at the 5

Notes: This figure is comprised of two panels. Each panel provides a simplified representation of the results of
the static and of the dynamic mediation analyses of the statistically significant outcomes for the ABC intervention,
respectively by comparing the results for the early child development mediators task orientation and BMI (panel
(a)) and for the adult socioeconomic input employment (panel (b)). For each outcome and mediator, the lighter-
colored bars display the static mediation analysis results, while the darker-colored bars display the dynamic mediation
analysis results (as shown in Figure 5). The complete mediation results are reported in Tables 5 and 6 in the Web
Appendix. The definition of each outcome is reported in Section 3 of the Web Appendix. The sample is for males
and the age at which outcomes have been measured (y.o. = years old) are shown in parentheses, to the left of each
bar, after the description of the variable of interest. The40term BMI-Employment in Figure 5 does not appear here
since the static mediation analyses do not account for the indirect effects of early inputs affecting health outcomes
through their impacts on late inputs. S=static mediation analysis; D=dynamic mediation analysis.
