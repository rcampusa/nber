A synthesis of the Lucas-Prescott island model and the Mortensen- Pissarides matching model of unemployment
is studied. By assumption, all unmatched workers and jobs are randomly assigned to islands at the
beginning of each period and the number of matches that form on a particular island is the minimum
of the two realizations. When calibrated to the recently observed averages of U.S. unemployment and
vacancy rates, the model fits the observed vacancy-unemployment Beveridge relationship very well
and implies an implicit log linear relationship between the job finding rate and the vacancy-unemployment
relationship with an elasticity near 0.5. The constrained efficient solution to the model is decentralized
by a equilibrium outcome in which wages on each island are determined by a modified auction. Although
the efficient solution explains only about 25% of the observed volatility in the U.S. vacancy-unemployment
ratio, an equilibrium outcome in which wages are determined as the solution to a strategic bargaining
game explains almost all of it.

1       Introduction
The purpose of the paper is to study a search and matching model that in-
corporates features of both the Lucas and Prescott (1974) and the Mortensen
and Pissarides (1994) equilibrium models of unemployment. There are two
essential speciÞcation assumptions: Unmatched workers and jobs search sub-
markets, "islands" in the literature, at random and the number of matches
that form on any particular island is the minimum of the two realizations.1
The solution to the associated social planner’s problem can be decentralized
by a modiÞed auction.
    The matching process is closely related to the original formulation of
job-worker matching as summarized in the Þrst chapter of Pissarides (2000).
However, instead of postulating an ad hoc matching function, the essen-
tial assumptions generate an endogenous positive relationship between the
job Þnding rate and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment (a "reduced
form" matching function) as well as a negative relationship between vacancies
and unemployment (a Beveridge curve). Indeed, given parameters chosen to
match the U.S. average unemployment and vacancy rates observed in the last
six years in the U.S. and a match period length consistent with the average
ßows into and out of employment in the U.S., the implied Beveridge curve
and observed unemployment rates explains 91% of the variation in vacancy
rates observed over that same period. Furthermore, the implicit relationship
between the job Þnding rate and the vacancy-unemployment ratio is essen-
tially log linear over the relevant range with an elasticity of about 0.48, two
facts consistent with the literature on the estimation of empirical matching
functions reviewed by Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001).
    When the wage is set ex post at auction on each island, equilibrium
outcomes would be constrained eﬃcient if the matching process were charac-
terized by constant returns to scale in the sense that the expected number of
matches increases in proportion to the average numbers of unmatched work-
ers and jobs per market holding their ratio constant. Although in fact the
speciÞed matching process exhibits increasing returns, a modiÞed auction in
which the agents on the short side of the market on any island obtain all of
match surplus decentralizes the eﬃcient solution for reasons anticipated by
Mortensen (1982).
    1
    This quite old ideas has been fruitfully explored in a recent paper by Shimer (2006)
in the case of limited mobility between island.



                                           2
    Although the constrained eﬃcient solution to the model implies more
volatility that the standard equilibrium matching model analyzed by Shimer
(2005), it still explains only 25% of the observed variation in the vacancy-
unemployment ratio. However, an equilibrium outcome in which wages are
set as the solution to a continual strategic bargaining game played by worker
and employer explains over 80% of the volatility.


2    The Matching Process
In the standard search equilibrium framework, the matching function is a
black box that relates the number of unemployed workers and vacant jobs to
the ßow of matches that form. As in Shimer (2006), the relationship between
the match ßow and the numbers of unmatched workers and jobs considered in
this paper is the outcome of more primitive assumptions about how matching
takes place. The speciÞcation follows.
    The economy is composed of a continuum of workers and employers and
a continuum of islands where exchange takes place. Time is divided into dis-
crete periods of equal length denoted as t = 1, 2, .... Let M and N represent
measures of unmatched workers and unmatched jobs per island respectively
at the beginning of any period. Under the assumption that participants
are randomly assigned to islands, Shimer (2006) demonstrates that the joint
probability that there are i workers and j jobs on any particular island are
independent Poisson variables with means M and N respectively. Formally,
the probability is
                                       e−(M+N) M i N j
                       π(i, j; M, N) =                   .                (1)
                                             i!j!
As one can easily verify,

            ∂π(i, j; M, N)
                           = π(i − 1, j; M, N) − π(i, j; M, N)            (2)
                 ∂M
            ∂π(i, j; M, N)
                           = π(i, j − 1; M, N) − π(i, j; M, N).
                 ∂N
In other words, the derivative of the probability that there are i workers and
j jobs in any market with respect to the average number of workers (jobs)
per market is equal to the change in the probability induced by the marginal
worker (job) per market.


                                      3
   Given that the short side determines the match outcome on each island,
the average number of matches created per island is given by
                                        X
                                        ∞ X
                                          ∞
          F (M, N) ≡ E{min(i, j)} =                   min(i, j)π(i, j; M, N)   (3)
                                            i=0 j=0

As an implication of equations (1) and (2), Shimer (2006) demonstrates that
                                    j−1
       ∂F                         X
                                  ∞ X
              ≡ FM (M, N) =                 π(i, j; M, N) = Pr{i < j} > 0      (4)
       ∂M                         j=1 i=0

        ∂F                     X
                               ∞ X
                                 i−1
              ≡ FN (M, N) =                 π(i, j; M, N) = Pr{j < i} > 0.     (5)
        ∂N                        i=1 j=0

In other words, the partial derivative, FN (M, N), is the share of the islands
with unemployed workers at the end of a period while FM (M, N) is the
fraction of islands with vacant jobs. In this paper, we refer to F (M, N)
as the structural matching function implied by the matching process. A
characterization of its properties follow:
Proposition 1 The matching function F (M, N) is increasing and concave
in M and N holding the other constant (FMM < 0 and FMM < 0). Further-
more,
FMN (M, N) = 1 − FN (M, N) − FM (M, N)                      (6)

Proof. See the Appendix.
   The next result, a corollary of Shimer’s (2006) Proposition 3, implies that
the matching process exhibits increasing returns.
Proposition 2 A one percent increase in both M and N increases the num-
ber of matches by more than one percent. Formally, the matching function
exhibits increasing returns in the sense that

   Hence, equation (7) and (8) together imply that the matching function is
approximately linearly homogenous when the sum of the number of workers
and jobs per island is large. Still, the following fact and the graph in Figure
1 suggests that the speed of convergence can be slow:

3       The Beveridge Curve and Matching Func-
        tion
The number of unemployed workers, U , and vacant jobs, V , are deÞned
as those not matched during the period. That is U = M − F (M, N) and
V = N − F (M, N). Hence, the corresponding unemployment and vacancy
rates are
                               U    M − F (M, N)
                           u=     =                                     (9)

                           L−U +V         L−M +N
where L ≥ M is the average number of workers per market and L−U +V , the
sum of the number of matched and vacant jobs, is the average number of jobs
per market. Shimer (2006) shows that observations on the unemployment
and vacancy rates tie down the number of unmatched workers and jobs con-
ditional on the total average number of workers per market, L. Furthermore,
variation in the number of unmatched jobs induce a negative relationship

between the vacancy rate and the unemployment rate given the number of
unmatched workers.
    Although the number of unmatched jobs at the beginning of a period is a
state variable, it responds over time to changes in the number of unmatched
jobs, induced say by shocks to match productivity. Under the assumption of
random search,

     Mt+1 = Ut + s(L − Ut ) = Mt + s(L − Mt ) − (1 − s)F (Mt , Nt )       (11)

where s is an exogenous job separation rate. Indeed, in steady state the
number of workers hired and jobs Þlled is equal to the separations ßow,
(1 − s)F (M, N) = s(L − M).
    The assumption that all unmatched workers and jobs are randomly as-
signed is easily justiÞed. SpeciÞcally, if all other workers (jobs) that Þnd
themselves not matched at the end of a period were to stay in their respec-
tive islands, then the chance of Þnding a job (worker) is the next period is
higher at a randomly selected alternative island. Hence, staying is not a
symmetric non-cooperative Nash equilibrium. However, if all search by se-
lecting an island at random, then the likelihood of matching is the same in
all islands. It is this assumption of continual reallocation that distinguishes
the model studied in this paper from Shimer’s (2006) mismatch model.
    The following strategy for calibrating the model suggests itself: First,
choose the period length and set the value of the separation rate per period
s to its observed average value in the data. Given these numbers and the
observed unemployment rate and vacancy rate averages, use equation (9),
equation (10) and the steady state condition to determine M and N.
    The choice of a matching period length is not totally arbitrary. SpeciÞ-
cally, in the U.S. case the length must be consistent with the fact that the
average duration of an unemployment spell is approximately one quarter
and that the median spell length is considerably shorter. With these facts
in mind, a period length of one month suggests itself as a base line case.
Shimer’s (2005) estimate of s is 10% per quarter or 3.33% per month. The
average vacancy rate reported in the JOLTS data over the 72 month pe-
riod from December 2000 to November 2006 inclusive was 2.51% while the
monthly average of standard CPS measure of the unemployment rate over
the same period was 5.29%. Given these choices, equations (9)-(11) imply
M = 1.145, N = 0.770, and L = 13.56. These numbers suggest that a
"island" might be interpreted as a Þrm of about median size which receives

                                      7
1.145 applicants per month seeking jobs that become available with frequency
0.770 per month. When evaluated at these values, the sum of the elasticities
of F (M, N), a measure of the degree of increasing returns, is 1.458.
    The data on vacancy and unemployment rates over the last six years are
plotted as the scatter of points illustrated in Figure 2.2 The plot represents a
well deÞned empirical Beveridge curve. The vacancy-unemployment relation-
ship obtained by varying N between 0.75 and 0.95 is illustrated as the solid
curve in the Þgure. As anyone can see, the Þt of the model is remarkable.
Indeed, the percent of variance in the vacancy rate explained by the curve
implied by the model and the unemployment rate is 91%.
    The slope of the model’s Beveridge curve is relatively invariant to choices
of the length of the matching period within the range consistent with ob-
served unemployment durations. This fact is illustrated in Figure 3 where
the implied relationship between the vacancy and unemployment rate are
drawn under the assumption that the period length is a quarter and a week
as well as a month.
    Of course, Shimer’s (2006) mismatch model can also explain the recent
time series data on unemployment and vacancy rates. In that model, the
labor market is viewed as a collection of segmented markets for diﬀerent
occupations and regions. Given this interpretation, he argues that cross
market mobility is quite small or non-existent. In this environment, the
total number of workers per island (L in our notation) is M which he regards
as Þxed. He calibrates his model by setting M and N to match observed
vacancy and unemployment rate averages and then varies N holding M Þxed
to generate a Beveridge curve.
    The job Þnding rate, deÞned as the ratio of the hires ßow to the number of
unemployed workers, is an empirical measure of unemployment spell hazard.
As documented in Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001), the empirical literature
on the matching function suggests that the job Þnding rate is well described
as a log linear function of the vacancy-unemployment ratio with a elasticity
in the range of 0.3 to 0.5.
    In the model under study, the measured job Þnding rate corresponds to
the ratio of the number matched per period to the number unemployed,
F (M, N)/U, and the observed vacancy-unemployment ratio is V /U. As both

    The vacancy rates are from the monthly U.S. job opening rate, total non-farm, series
from JOLTS for December, 2000, to November 2996, and the unemployment rates are the
CPS unemployment rate, non-farm series for the same months.

increase as N increases, a positive implicit relationship exists between the
two variables, one that Shimer (2006) calls the "reduced form" matching
function. Indeed, the log-log relationship obtained when N varies between
0.75 and 0.95, the same range used to generate the model’s Beveridge curve,
is illustrated in Figure 4. Obviously, the relationship is very close to linear
over this range. Furthermore, the slope (elasticity) is 0.481, a number within
the Petrongolo-Pissarides "plausible range".3 Hence, the model provides a
simple micro foundation for the empirical matching functions estimated in
the literature.

   Although Shimer’s mismatch model also implies a nearly log linear relationship, his
implied elasticity is only about 0.2.

4    The Social Planner’s Problem
The planner takes the random search by participants as given but can set the
number of unmatched jobs in each period subject to a cost, c, the same cost
that an employer would face. Assume that workers and employers are risk
neural and discount future income by the factor β ∈ (0, 1) per period. A job-
worker match produces market output of value p per period and the home
production of any unmatched worker during a period has value z. Obviously,
gain from trade requires that p > z.
    The assumed sequence of events within a period follows: In the Þrst sub-
period, matching takes place. In the second subperiod, all matches produce.
Job separations take place and the number of unmatched jobs to be posted
in the period t + 1 is determined in the Þnal subperiod of t.
    As employment is equal to Et = L−Ut , the law of motion for employment
is

     Et+1 − Et = L − Ut+1 − Et = L − Mt+1 + F (Mt+1 , Nt+1 ) − Et (12)
               = F (L − (1 − s)Et , Nt+1 ) − sEt

by equation (11) where Nt+1 is the number of jobs posted at the end of
period t.In each period, the planner chooses a job entry strategy, a function
of the state of the market as reßected in the current value of employment,
that determines the number of unmatched jobs that will participate in the
matching process at the beginning of the next period.
    Given agent preferences, a benevolent planner chooses a strategy that
maximizes the present value of aggregate match surplus net of recruiting
costs. Since the match surplus ßow is p − z, the Bellman equation associated
with this dynamic programming problem is

 V (Et ) = max {(p − z)Et − cN + βV ((1 − s)Et + F (L − (1 − s)Et , N))} .
           N≥0

The Þrst order condition is

                       c = βFN (L − (1 − s)Et , N)λt+1                    (13)

where

    λt ≡ V 0 (Et ) = p − z + β(1 − s) [1 − FM (L − (1 − s)Et , N)] λt+1   (14)


                                      12
represents the present value of a job-worker match. In other words, the
cost of posting an unmatched job is equal to the product of the job’s mar-
ginal contribution to the total number of matches in the next period and
the present value of a job-worker match. Because FNN < 0, the second or-
der necessary condition is satisÞed. The solution to the planner’s problem
solves the Þrst order condition, equation (13), the system of diﬀerence equa-
tions deÞned by equations (12) and (14), and the transversality condition
lim→∞ λt (1 + r)−t = 0.
    The existence of at least one steady state solution to the problem can
be demonstrated with the following argument. First, solve the free entry
condition, equation (13), for N as a function of λ and E. Since FN (M, N) is
increasing in M and decreasing in N from (6) and (5), the solution for the
average number of unmatched jobs posted per island, denoted as N(λ, E),
is positive for any λ > 0, is increasing in λ and is decreasing in E. Since
F (M, N) is positive and increasing in both of its arguments, it follows from
equation (12) and the properties of N(λ, E) that the singular curve repre-
senting the steady state condition ∆E = Et+1 − Et = 0 can be represented
by a strictly positively sloped curve relating λ and E as represented in phase
diagrams illustrated in Figures 5. Finally, as the right hand side of (12) is
decreasing in Et , Et+1 − Et < (>)0 to the right (left) of the singular curve
as indicated by the direction arrow in the phase diagram.
    Because FM (M, N) is a probability by (4), the curve deÞned by ∆λ =
λt+1 −λt = 0, the solution to λ = (p−z)/[1−β(1−s) [1 − FM (L − (1 − s)E, N(λ, E))],
is bounded above by (p − z)/[1 − β(1 − s)] and below by p − z. This fact
and the properties of the ∆E = 0 singular curve imply that the two singular
curves must intersect at least once in the positive quadrant if p − z > 0.
Because the coeﬃcient on λt+1 on the right side of equation (14) is strictly
less than unity, ∆λ > (<)0 at points above (below) the curve as indicated by
the directional arrows in the phase diagrams portrayed in Figures 5. Finally,
since F (M, N) exhibits increasing returns, FMM FNN − FMN FN M < 0 can
hold so that
                                                 µ                       ¶
   ∂FM                            ∂N               FMN FNM − FMM FNN
         = −(1 − s)FMM + FNN           = (1 − s)                           ,
    ∂E                            ∂E                       FNN

may be positive. Hence, the singular curve representing the condition ∆λ = 0
can also has a positive slope as illustrated in Figures 5.
   Although it might appear that multiple steady states can exist, in fact


                                    13
there is only one.4 The assertion can be established by using the steady
condition ∆λ = 0 to eliminate λ in the Þrst order condition. The result is
                             βFN (L − (1 − s)E, N)(p − z)
                 c=                                                .
                      1 − β(1 − s)[1 − FM (L − (1 − s)E, N(λ, E))]

This condition deÞnes a negatively sloping relationship between E and λ
given the properties of the partial derivatives of F (N, M) reported in Propo-
sition 1. Of course, a steady state is the single solution pair at the intersection
of this curve and the positively sloped relationship deÞned by ∆E = 0.
    Finally, because the steady state is a saddle point, there is a unique path
converging to it from any initial condition as illustrated in Figure 5. Because
any other solution trajectory violates the transversality condition, the con-
verging trajectory represents the unique solution to the planning problem
associated with the initial stock of unmatched workers inherited from the
past.

                           Phase Diagram: Planner’s Problem

5       Auction Equilibrium
Suppose that the wage on each island are determined as the outcome of an
auction as in Lucas and Prescott (1974) and Shimer (2006). SpeciÞcally,
assume that the worker collects the entire match surplus if there are more
jobs than workers on her island but receives only her reservation wage if
the number of workers exceeds the number of jobs available. Although the
auction outcome is indeterminate when the number of workers and jobs are
equal, suppose for now that the employer obtains the surplus in this case.
    Shimer (2006) shows that these assumptions yield outcomes that are
equivalent to the planner’s solution in his "mismatch" model. However, in
his model there is only one margin, the free entry condition. In this model,
the worker’s reservation wage as well as the free entry condition characterize


                                     15
an optimal solution. Consequently, the auction equilibrium is eﬃcient only
under the counter factual condition that the expected number of matches
that form is homogenous of degree one in the number of unmatched jobs and
workers. Although this requirement holds approximately when the average
numbers of unmatched jobs and workers per market are large, the calibration
presented above does not have this property. However, a relatively simple tax
and subsidy system does exist that will decentralize the planner’s problem.
The proofs of these assertions follow.
   As the probability that there are i workers and j jobs in the same island
from the point of view of any job on a particular island is equal to the
probability that i workers and j −1 other jobs are also assigned to the island,
an employer can expect to obtain the entire match surplus with probability
equal to the fraction of markets that have strictly fewer jobs than workers.
That is
              X
              ∞ X
                i                              X
                                               ∞ X
                                                 i−1
 Q(M, N) =              π(i, j − 1; M, N) =              π(i, j; M, N) = FN (M, N)
              i=1 j=1                          i=1 j=0

by equation (5). An alternative way to obtain the same result is to realize
that the relevant probability is equal to the expected number of jobs that
are matched in markets with weakly fewer jobs than workers divided by the
number of jobs to be matched. But that fraction is also

      1 XX                       X
         ∞   i                    ∞ X i

      N i=1 j=1                  i=1 j=1

by equation (1).
   As a worker receives the surplus only if matched on an island with fewer
workers than jobs, an analogous argument and equation (4) imply that the
probability of such an event is
                   ∞ j−1                       j−1

where ∞  j=1 π(j − 1, j; M, N) is the probability that there is one fewer other
workers than jobs on the island.

                                          16
    The present value of employment to a worker originally matched on an
island with fewer unmatched workers that unmatched jobs, denoted Yt , is
the solution to

           Yt = p + β [(1 − s)Yt+1 + s [Pt+1 Yt+1 + (1 − Pt+1 )Ut+1 ]]

where Ut+1 is the value of search and Pt+1 = P (Mt+1 , Nt+1 ) = P (L − (1 −
s)Et , Nt+1 ) is the probability of being matched on an island with fewer work-
ers in the next period. In addition to the current ßow of match product, the
worker can expect to receive the total value of her match in the next period
if either her current match continues or the match ends at the end of the
current period but she is rematched on an island with fewer workers than
jobs in the next period. This second possibility is a consequence of the fact
that a worker can move directly from one job to another without a spell of
unemployment.
    As the value of unemployed search solves

                    Ut = z + β[Pt+1 Yt+1 + (1 − Pt+1 )Ut+1 ]

and the value of an unmatched job is zero in equilibrium, the surplus value of
a match, the diﬀerence St = Yt − Ut , is the solution to the Bellman equation

           St = p − z + β(1 − s)[1 − P (L − (1 − s)Et , Nt+1 )]St+1 .      (16)

Finally, the free entry condition requires that the cost of posting a vacancy
now equals its expected future return, the product of the present value of the
match surplus and the employer’s chance of receiving it in the next period.
In other words, the number of unmatched jobs solves

                      c = βQ(L − (1 − s)Et , Nt+1 )St+1 .                  (17)

An equilibrium is any solution to equations (12), (16) and (17) that satisÞes
the tranversality condition limt→∞ β t St = 0.
    A comparison of the equilibrium conditions, equations (17) and (16) ,
with the necessary conditions for a solution the planner’s problem, equations
(13) and (14) respectively, implies that the equilibrium solution is a candidate
solution to the planner’s problem if and only if the surplus value of a match
is equal its shadow value in the eﬃcient solution, i.e., St = λt for all t.
However, equations (14) and (16) together with equation (15) imply that
P (Mt+1 , Nt+1 ) < FM (Mt+1 , Nt+1 ). As a consequence, the private return to

                                       17
posting a vacancy generally exceeds the social return implying that that the
market over invests in job creation relative to the eﬃcient solution.
   Alternative, if the worker receives the surplus instead, then
             X
             ∞ X
               i−2                                X∞
Q(M, N) =               π(i, j; M, N) = FN (M, N)−   π(i, i−1; M, N) < FN (M, N)
              i=1 j=0                                 i=1

is the probability that there are strictly few jobs than workers. In this case,
the private and social surplus value of a match are equal since P (M, N) =
FM (M, N), but too few unmatched jobs are created because Q(M, N) <
FN (M, N).
    These facts imply that the following tax and subsidy scheme will imple-
ment the eﬃcient solution: Provide both parties with the full surplus value
of a match when the number of unmatched workers and employers on an
island are exactly equal and Þnance the subsidy with a lump sum tax levied
on the workers, employed or not.5 In this case, P = FM and Q = FN which
implies St = λt and c = βFM λt+1 . Of course, the transfer required in each
period, equal to
                        Tt = FMN (L − (1 − s)Et , Nt+1 )St+1 ,                    (18)
vanishes as the number of unmatched workers and jobs become large as a
consequence of equation (7).


6       Bargaining Equilibrium
Suppose that the wage is determined as the outcome of a strategic non-
cooperative bargaining game played after worker and employer meet along
the lines outlined by Hall and Milgrom (2005). Hall and Milgrom argue that
delay rather than search is the relevant default option so long as both sides
receive at least the value of continued search. Assuming that the worker can
generate value at the ßow rate z while bargaining but neither can search
for an alternative until next period, the unique perfect wage outcome of a
symmetric alternating oﬀer game is given by
                              µ       µ                ¶¶
                                            1
                    wt = min p, max z + (p − z), Rt                      (19)
                                            2
    5
   In other words, allocating the match surplus to the side responsible for forming the
match, which is both when the numbers on the two sides of the market are equal, imple-
ments the eﬃcient solution as pointed out in Mortensen(1983).

                                          18
In other words, the pair split the ßow surplus, p − z, equally provided that
the result exceeds the ßow value of the worker’s search option, Rt .
    Because the value of a Þlled job to the employer is the present value of
the proÞt ßow and the ex ante probability of Þlling any job in the matching
process is the ratio of the matching rate to the number of unmatched jobs
at the beginning of the period, the free entry condition is

                           F (L − (1 − s)Et , Nt+1 )
                      c=                             βJt+1 ,              (20)
                                    Nt+1
where Jt+1 is the employer’s value of a match in the next period. The em-
ployer’s value evolves according to the rule

                         Jt = p − wt + β(1 − s)Jt+1 .                     (21)

   Provided that match output exceeds the opportunity cost of employment,
p ≥ z, and the worker’s wage is no less then the reservation wage, z + 12 (p −
z) ≥ Rt , the wage is wt = z + 12 (p − z) and the employer’s match value solves
                                  p−z
                           Jt =       + β(1 − s)Jt+1 .                    (22)
                                   2
Obviously, the singular curve characterizing ∆J = 0 is the horizontal line
                 (p−z)/2
deÞned by J = 1−β(1−s)   in Figure 7. Furthermore, because 0 < β(1 − s) < 1,
the diﬀerence equation is unstable forward in time as indicated in Þgure by
the directional arrows.
   The solution to the free entry condition, equation (20), for the number of
unmatched jobs, denoted as N(J, E), increases with J and decreases with E
F (M, N) is increasing in both arguments and is concave in N. The locus of
points for which ∆M = Mt+1 − Mt = 0 is deÞned by

             s(L − M) − (1 − s)F (L − (1 − s)E, N(J, E)) = 0

is a positively sloped relationship between J and E as illustrated in Figure
7. Since ∆E > 0(< 0) for all E to the left (right) of the singular curve
characterizing ∆E = 0, a unique saddle point steady state solution exists,
coincident with the ∆J = 0 curve, which is the only solution to the diﬀer-
ential equation system deÞned by the necessary conditions and tranversality
conditions. Furthermore, the state value of employment is positive if p − z
is positive and suﬃciently large.

7       Labor Market Volatility
Shimer (2005) argues that the standard equilibrium matching model can
explain at most 10% of the observed volatility in the ratio of vacancies to
unemployment. In this section, I show that the eﬃcient solution to the island
matching model can explain only about 25% of the volatility given reason-
able parameter values if productivity and separation shocks are suﬃciently
persistent.6 However, the bargaining equilibrium model explains 88% of the
volatility.
    6
   In his more recent paper, Shimer (2006) also shows that his model of mismatch un-
employment does much better in this dimension.

                                        21
    One implication of matching models that diﬀerentiate them from Shimer’s
(2006) mismatch model is that shocks to the match separation or job destruc-
tion rate, s, induce variation in both vacancies and unemployment as well as
shocks to productivity, represented in the model by the parameter p. In the
eﬃcient solution case, the steady state values of the number of unmatched
workers and jobs, M and N, are determined by the following equations:

                            βFN (M, N)(p − z)
                  c=                               (free entry).                     (23)
                       1 − β(1 − s)[1 − FM (M, N)]

                F (M, N) = s(L − M + F (M, N )) (steady state).                      (24)
    Without loss of generality, one can normalize the base line value of match
productivity per period at p = 1. Given the normalization, c and z are ex-
pressed in units of output per period. Given a period length of one month,
reasonable values of the interest rate and separation rate are r = 0.004 and
s = 0.033. In his papers, Shimer (2005,2006) sets the opportunity cost of em-
ployment, z, equal to 0.4 (40% of market output). Hagadorn and Manovskii
(2005), Hall (2006), and Mortensen and Nagypál (2006) argue for larger val-
ues. As in the last of these papers, I set z = 0.7. Because M , N, and L are
determined by the steady state condition and the observed average values
of the unemployment and vacancy rates over the 12/2000 to 11/2006 period
as discussed above, the free entry condition evaluated at these bench mark
values can be use to tie down the cost of vacancy posting. The implied value
is c = 0.485, equal to about two week of match output. Given all these
parameter values, one can now use equations (23) and (24) to compute the
responses of all the endogenous variables to variation in both the productivity
and separation rates.
    The central variable of interest in the literature on labor market volatility
is the vacancy-unemployment ratio. At the baseline parameter values, the
elasticity of the steady state value of the ratio with respect to p, computed
using equations (23) and (24), is 4.561.7 This measure of the response to
productivity variation is somewhat larger than the value of 3.43 obtained
using the version of the canonical matching model studied by Shimer (2005)
   7
    This is a comparative static result, and as such, is not the response one would see to
a persistent but transitory shock under rational expectation. However, the evidence in
Shimer(2005) suggest that productivity shocks are nearly permanent, a fact that justiÞes
the use of the number as an approximation to the dynamic response.



                                           22
and the same parameter values and much larger than the 1.72 number ob-
tained when Shimer’s choice for the opportunity cost of employment z = 0.4
is assumed.
    As Mortensen and Nagypál (2007) argue, the elasticity of the vacancy-
unemployment ratio with respect to p is not the only parameter needed to
explain volatility given that separation shocks also occur and are known to
be negatively correlated with productivity shocks as documented by Shimer
(2005). The computed value of the elasticity of the vacancy-unemployment
ratio with respect to s is only −0.126. Given the elasticities of the vacancy-
unemployment ratio and the standard deviation of log productivity (σp =
0.02), the standard deviation of the log of the separation rate (σ s = 0.075),
and the correlation between the two (ρps = −0.524) computed from U.S.
post WWII data reported in Shimer (2005), the implied standard deviation
of the vacancy-unemployment ratio is
                   ¡                                           ¢1
               σθ = η2θp σ 2p + ηθp η θs ρps σ p σ s + η2θs σ s 2 = 0.097

where θ = V /U represents the ratio of vacancies to unemployment and ηθx is
the elasticity of θ with respect to x. This number is about 25% of the standard
deviation of the vacancy-unemployment ratio (σ θ = 0.382) in Shimer’s data.
    The worker’s ßow value of search, R, is procyclic because both the ex-
pected wage and the probability of becoming employed increase with produc-
tivity and decrease with the separation rate in the eﬃcient solution to the
model. To see this point, note that one can write the free entry condition in
the eﬃcient solution case as
                                  FN (M, N)(p − R)
                             c=
                                    1 − β(1 − s)

where
                                 FM (M, N)(1 − s) (p − R)
                      R=z+
                                      1 − β(1 − s)
is the worker’s reservation wage. Given that FN (M, N), the probability of
strictly fewer workers than jobs on an island, is decreasing in N and that
M is Þxed, at least in the short run, the direct eﬀect of an increase in p
is an increase in N. The reservation wage rises with p both directly and
because the probability of being on the short side of the market increases
with N. Similarly, the reservation wage falls with s. Hence, the response in


                                          23
the reservation wage dampens the eﬀects of shocks on unemployment and
vacancies as in the standard model.
   When the wage is the outcome of a continual non-cooperative bargaining
game over current match output as characterized by Hall and Milgrom (2005),
I have shown above that the wage is independent of the reservation wage.
Hence, it follows from equations (19) - (21) that the equilibrium solution is
demand determined. SpeciÞcally, because
                       1                     1    p−z
               wt = z + (p − z) and Sf (t) =                ,
                       2                     2 1 − β(1 − s)
the number of unmatched jobs solves

                        F (M, N) 12 β(1 − s) (p − z)
                   c=                                for all t.
                           N         1 − β(1 − s)
    The response elasticities to shocks in both p and s are much diﬀerent
than those implied by the eﬃcient solution because the wage is less respon-
sive to productivity shocks. Indeed, at the baseline parameter values, the
elasticity of the vacancy-unemployment ratio with respect to p is 9.169 and
with respect to s is −2.714. Given these values and Shimer’s (2005) statistics
σ p = 0.02, σs = 0.075, and ρps = −0.524, the implied standard error of the
log vacancy-unemployment ratio (θ = V /U) is
                   ¡                                             ¢1
              σ θ = η2θp σ 2p + 2η θp ηθs ρps σ p σ s + η 2θs σ s 2 = 0.338.

Hence, the model explain 88% of the observed value Shimer reports.


8    Conclusion
The implications of the aggregate matching process implied by assuming that
unmatched worker and jobs randomly search islands in every period and that
the match ßow on each island is equal to the minimum of the two realized
values is studied in the paper. When the model is calibrated to match the
average unemployment and vacancy rates over the last six years in the U.S.,
the model Þts well the observed negative relationship between the vacancy
and unemployment rates (Beveridge curve) observed over the same period.
Furthermore, the implies relationship between the job Þnding rate and the
vacancy-unemployment ratio is log linear with elasticity within the plausible

                                           24
range reported in Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001). In other words, the
matching process generates a "reduced form" matching function with the
properties found in the empirical literature.
    When the matching process is embedded in a standard model of equi-
librium unemployment, I show that the solution to the planner’s problem
can be implemented by a modiÞed auction. Namely, if the worker (job) is
allocated the entire match surplus when the total realized number of workers
(jobs) on any island is less than or equal to the number on the other side of
the market, then a search equilibrium is socially eﬃcient as anticipated by
Mortensen (1982).
    Finally, the eﬃcient solution to the model explains about 25% of the ob-
served volatility in the ratio of vacancies to unemployment in the U.S. as
reported by Shimer (2005). However, an alternative equilibrium outcome
obtained when the wage is determined by continual strategic bargaining be-
tween the worker an employer explains 88% of the volatility.
