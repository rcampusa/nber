                                               ABSTRACT

This paper develops a politico-economic model for use in studying the role of intra-elite conflict in
the simultaneous determination of a country’s political regime, trade policy and income-tax-based
redistribution scheme. Three socioeconomic groups are involved: two elite groups and workers, whose
preferences regarding trade policy and income taxation are derived from a simple open-economy model.
The critical point is that income taxation induces a rich-poor/elite-workers political cleavage, while
trade policy opens the door to intra-elite conflict. In this model, when there is no intra-elite conflict,
changes in trade policy are associated with political transitions. Coups (democratizations) open up
the economy if and only if both elite factions are pro-free-trade (protectionist). However, in the presence
of intra-elite conflict, autocracies respond to popular revolts by changing trade their policy and reallocating
political power within the elite (to the elite group with the same trade policy preference as the workers)
rather than offering to democratize the country. The change in trade policy is credible because the
elite group with the same trade policy preference as the workers controls the autocracy. Moreover,
in the presence of intra-elite conflict, coups tend to result in the maintenance of the existing trade policy
unless popular demands are extremely radical and/or the elite group with the same trade policy preference
as the workers is exceptionally weak.

1       Introduction
The question as to what factors determine the institutional framework of collective decision-making is
central to political economy and has received considerable attention in the literature (see, for example, the
classic contributions of Lipset, 1959; Moore, 1966; Luebbert, 1991; Rustow, 1970; Linz and Stepan, 1978;
O’Donnell, 1973; O’Donnell and Schmitter, 1986; Dahl, 1971; and Olson, 1993). In a very important work,
Acemoglu and Robinson (2000, 2006) make a significant contribution to this literature by developing a

politico-economic model of autocracy and democracy in which the income-distribution conflict, mediated
by different political institutions, emerges as the main determinant of the political regime. In this paper
we build on their framework in order to explore the connections between political transitions and trade
policy with a view to contribute to a broader understanding of political transitions and the political
economy of trade policy.
    Some political transitions from autocracy to democracy or vice versa occur in conjunction with changes
in trade barriers. Others do not. Two illustrative, but radically different, examples are those of Great
Britain in the nineteenth century and Argentina in the twentieth century. On the one hand, Great Britain
moved toward free trade in 1846 (with the repeal of the Corn Laws) before becoming a democracy. The
repeal of the Corn Laws undercutt the economic interests of the ruling landed aristocracy, proved that
industrialists were gaining control of Parliament, and placated the working-class Chartist movement,
which was seeking a more radical reform of Parliament (see Searle, 1993, and Schonhard-Bailey, 2006).
Thereafter, Great Britain had a stable free-trade policy throughout its transition to a fully consolidated
democracy. In Argentina, on the other hand, after workers had voted on a large scale for the first time
in 1946, an urban-rural cleavage consolidated which lasted until the advent of the autocracy in 1976.1
This new political equilibrium brought the economy to the verge of autarky. Democracy did not take
hold, and a series of transitions to autocracy and back to a constrained form of democracy took place
during this period. However, none of the autocratic governments that ruled the country until the coup
of 1976, which deposed a highly populist government, opened up the economy to any significant degree
(see Mallon and Sourrouille, 1975; O’Donnell, 1977; and Brambilla, Galiani and Porto, 2010).2
    More systematic evidence on the connections between political transitions and trade policy can also
be found. For example, O’Rourke and Taylor (2006), using panel data on tariffs, democracy and factor
endowments for the period 1870-1914, show that democratization raises tariffs in countries with high
land-labor ratios and lowers tariffs in countries with high capital-labor ratios, though this latter effect is
smaller and not always significant (see Table 2 in O’Rourke and Taylor, 2002). These results should not,
after all, be surprising, since trade policy has been portrayed as an important determinant of political
cleavages throughout history (see, among others, Rogowski, 1987 and 1989; Gourevitch, 1986; Findlay
and O’Rourke, 2007; Galiani, Schofield and Torrens (2012); and Acemoglu and Yared, 2010). However, to
the best of our knowledge, no study has been done that actually models the connections between political
transitions and trade policy. In this paper we formally characterize these connections by developing a
model of political regime determination coupled with endogenous trade policy.
    The key components of our model are a politically determined trade policy and the possibility of intra-
elite conflict over trade policy. The intuition is relatively simple. When there is intra-elite conflict over
trade policy, one of the elite groups has the same trade policy preference as the people, while the other
elite group has the opposite trade policy preference. In other words, when there is intra-elite conflict over
trade policy, the political cleavage that exists in relation to trade policy differs from the rich-poor/elite-
non-elite cleavage.3 This lack of alignment in political cleavages has two political implications. First,
   1
      As explained by O’Donnell (1977) , at least until 1976, the alliance of the industrialists and landowners in Argentina
lasted only for short periods, while “dissolving rapidly into situations which repeatedly put these two dominant fractions of
the Argentine bourgeoisie in different political camps.”
    2
      Other more recent examples are the move made by countries of Eastern-Europe in the 1990s to embrace both democracy
and free trade and the descent into dictatorship and autarchy of much of Africa following independence in the 1950s and
1960s.
    3
      The critical point is that trade policy opens the door to a type of political cleavage that differs from the rich-poor


                                                             2
an autocracy controlled by the elite group that has the same trade policy preference as the people can
placate the supporters of a popular revolt more easily than one that is controlled by the elite group
that has the opposite trade policy preference. This is because an elite group that has the same trade
policy preference as the people can credibly commit to implementing the people’s preferred trade policy
even after the threat of a revolt has died down. Second, the elite group that has the same trade policy
preference as the people will have ambiguous feelings about autocratic governments controlled by the
other faction of the elite, since such governments will, on the one hand, reduce redistribution from the
elite toward the people but will also, on the other hand, implement a trade policy that is detrimental to
the interests of the elite group that share’s the people’s trade policy preference.
    The model provides a good explanation for the experiences of Great Britain and Argentina. The first
political implication outlined above accounts for the first Reform Act as well as the repeal of the Corn
Laws in nineteenth-century Great Britain. The protectionist, landed aristocracy, fearing a revolution,
conceded a significant portion of its political power to the pro-free-trade commercial and industrial elite.
This political reform averted democratization and paved the way for a switch in trade policy. The second
political implication accounts for the coups that resulted in the continuance of import-substitution policies
and the coup that was followed by the opening of the economy in Argentina in the second half of the
twentieth century. While democracy was not extremely populist, industrialists supported only those
autocracies that advocated industrial protection, but when the proponents of radical tendencies seemed
to be on the brink of dominating the country’s democratic institutions, the industrialists tacitly accepted
the opening of the economy.
    Beyond these historical examples, the model points to general, testable implications of the connections
between political transitions and trade policy. In the absence of intra-elite conflict over trade policy,
political transitions are associated with changes in trade policy. Specifically, when both elite groups are
pro-free-trade (protectionist) coups (democratizations) will open up the economy. In the presence of
intra-elite conflict, autocracies can postpone democratization by engineering a reallocation of political
power within the elite (to the elite group with the same trade policy preference as the workers). The
intuition is that this reallocation will induce a credible change in trade policy. In the presence of intra-
elite conflict, coups will tend to lead to the maintainance of the existing trade policy, because otherwise
the elite group with the same trade policy preference as the workers will not support the coup. However,
when democracy becomes extremely populist and/or the elite group with the same trade policy preference
as the workers is exceptionally weak, a coup will lead to a change in trade policy.
    There are several other papers that relate to our work. First, there are number of studies that
draw attention to the significance of intra-elite conflict in different contexts. Lizzeri and Persico (2004)
have developed a model of democratization in which only the majority of the elite needs to support the
extension of the franchise, while there can be a minority group within the elite that loses ground as a result
of this type of reform. Acemoglu (2010) develops a model of State capacity in which the effectiveness of
intra-elite conflict in controlling the State intensifies as the State’s capacity grows and as more efficient
forms of taxation and redistribution therefore become available. The key finding is that the destructive
effect of more intra-elite conflict can offset the beneficial effect of increased State capacity. Ghosal and
Proto (2008) build a model of democratization in which intra-elite conflict plays a crucial role. They
cleavage. Indeed, though we focus on the role of trade policy in this paper, our model applies to any policy variable that
could potentially divide the elite. An obvious example is the development of a no-fee school system, which might be opposed
by landowinig elites but supported by industrialist elites (see Galor, Moav, and Vollrath, 2009).



                                                            3
develop a coalition formation game with two elite groups that are uncertain about their relative future
level of political power and a non-elite group that cannot act collectively. Under autocracy, the stronger
elite group obtains all the surplus, while, under democracy, the weaker elite group forms a coalition with
the non-elite group, which induces a more balanced division between the elites. Democratization occurs
when the elites are sufficiently risk-averse. Our model incorporates the same general idea as that put
forward by Ghosal and Proto (2008), i.e., that an elite group may be willing to form a coalition with the
non-elite group in order to improve its bargaining power with the other elite group.
    Beyond this, however, there are several differences. Our model is a non-cooperative one with no
explicit coalition formation. In addition, in Ghosal and Proto (2008), there is only one policy variable
–the division of a unit of surplus– while, in our model, there are two: income taxation and trade policy.
Thus, in our model, there can be two different political cleavages: one based on income taxation and the
other based on trade policy. Another important difference is that we use the Acemoglu and Robinson
(2006) framework, in which democratization has nothing to do with risk aversion; rather, the crucial
element is the type of institutional change that the elites will accept as a credible means of transferring
political power in order to avert a revolt. The novel aspects of our model are: that democracy may now
be more costly for one elite group (the one with opposite trade policy preferences to those of the non-elite
group) than for the other; that the elite groups must bargain with one another in order to reach a decision
as to which one will control the autocracy and, hence, which trade policy the autocracy will implement;
and, finally, that the non-elite group is not indifferent as to which group controls the autocracy and that
it may be able to influence this decision.
    Second, there is an extensive body of literature on the ways in which international trade affects
domestic political alignments (see, among others, Rogowski, 1987 and 1989). In most cases, these studies
informally assume a political economy model. We, on the other hand, use a formal model of policy
determination. More importantly, much of the existing literature focuses on the political cleavages that
result from the effects of international trade on different social groups, while paying little attention to other
potential political cleavages that might interact with the ones generated by the effects of international
trade. Thus, the underlying model of policy determination is one-dimensional. In contrast, we consider
a two-dimensional policy space in which political cleavages in respect of trade policy may or may not
coincide with political cleavages in other dimensions, such as those associated with redistribution through
income taxation. In other words, protectionist and pro-free-trade coalitions may differ from poor and
rich coalitions. This has important implications for both the political regime and trade policy.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce an open economy model of
a society made up of two elite groups and one non-elite group which must make two collective decisions:
once concerning income taxation and the other dealing with trade policy. We show that standard trade
models are compatible with this model and demonstrate how intra-elite conflict over trade policy naturally
arise in standard trade models, depending on domestic factor endowments and international prices. In
Section 3, we incorporate this model into a dynamic political transition game. In Section 4 we define and
characterize the equilibrium of the game. In Section 5 we fully characterize political transitions in the
absence and in the presence of intra-elite conflict over trade policy. In Section 6 we illustrate the results
using historical examples of intra-elite conflict. In Section 7, we present our conclusions.

2     The Economy
In this section we build a model of a society that is composed of three socioeconomic groups: two elite
groups and one non-elite group. This society must arrive at two collective decisions: one about income
taxation and one about trade policy. We first describe a general economic environment. Then, we show
that several trade models are compatible with our specification.

2.1     Economic Environment
Consider a society formed by three socioeconomic groups: two elite groups, denoted by K and L (for
example, industrialists and landowners), and a non-elite group called “the people” and denoted by N
(for example, workers). Let ni be the proportion of the population that belongs to group i = K, L, N ,
and let yi,t be the gross income (before any redistribution scheme) of a member of group i in period
t. In each period, the government runs a balanced budget redistribution scheme that taxes the income
of all citizens at a rate τt ∈ [0, 1] and redistributes the proceeds through a lump-sum transfer. Income
taxation is costly, as the government must incur a cost of C (τ ) units of output in order to collect τ units
of output in taxes, where the cost function C is strictly increasing and strictly convex, and C (0) = 0 and
                                                      1+η
C ′ (0) < 1 − yȳN < C ′ (1) (for example, C (τ ) = τ1+η , with η ≥ 0). In each period, the government also
selects a trade policy λt ∈ {A, F }, , where A denotes autarky and F free trade.
     The per period utility function of a member of group i is given by:

                                    vi (τt , λt ) = (1 − τt ) yi (λt ) + [τt − C (τt )] ȳ (λt ) ,                                (1)

where
X         yi (λt ) is the the gross income of a member of group i when the trade policy is λt and ȳ (λt ) =
      ni yi (λt ) is the average income of society when trade policy is λt .4 The expected utility of a member
    i
of group i at time t is given by:
                                                  nX∞                      o
                                         Vi = E t        δu−t vi (τu , λu ) ,                              (2)
                                                              u=t

where δ ∈ (0, 1) is the common discount factor and Et is the expectation operator taken over the
probability distribution of sequences of the form {τu , λu }∞u=t .
    Each group in society can either lose or win with different trade policies, depending on the particular
trade model that we have in mind. We say that group i is pro-free-trade (protectionist) if and only if
yi (F ) > yi (A) (yi (A) > yi (F )).5 We focus on economies for which protectionism is costly in the sense
that ȳ (F ) > ȳ (A) and in which at least one group loses with a change in trade policy.6 We impose some
structure on income distribution and the effect that international trade has on it.
   4
     It is possible to replace the redistribution scheme with a public good financed with income taxation. In order to see this,
suppose that the utility of a member of group i is vi = (1 − τ ) yi (λ) + H (g), where g is the level of the public good. Assume
that H is strictly increasing and strictly concave, H (0) = 0 and H ′ (ȳ) < yȳP < 1 < H ′ (0) < mini yȳi . Since, the government
budget constraint is τ ȳ = g, then the utility of a member of group i is given by vi (τ, λ) = (1 − τ ) yi (λ) + H (τ ȳ (λ)), which
can be easily obtained in our model if we set C (τ ) = τ − H(τ ȳ
                                                                  ȳ)
                                                                      . Moreover, it is not difficult to prove that this cost function
satisfies all the proper assumptions. For example, C (0) = 0 − H(0)
                                                                 ȳ
                                                                    = 0.
   5
     For a more detailed discussion of how to induce the trade policy stance of each group see Section 2.2.
   6
     We can even conceive of cases in which all groups win or all groups lose if the economy is opened up, but the political
economy of trade policy in such cases is not very interesting, as we can simply ignore trade policy as a relevant policy
variable.


                                                                  5
    Assumption 1: The elite groups have above-average incomes, while the people have below-average
incomes, regardless of the type of trade policy that is in effect, i.e.,

                                      min yi (λ) > ȳ (λ) > yP (λ) for λ ∈ {A, F }
                                    i∈{K,L}



      Using Assumption 1 we can compute the most preferred policy of each group, which we denote by
(τi , λi ). Formally,
                          (τi , λi ) = arg max {(1 − τ ) yi (λ) + [τ − C (τ )] ȳ (λ)}
                                                 (τ,λ)

For an elite group it is always the case that yi (λ) > ȳ (λ). Therefore, for i = K, L, τi = 0 and
λi = arg maxλ yi (λ). That is, an elite group prefers no income taxation and a trade policy that maximizes
its gross income. For the people, yi (λ) < ȳ (λ), which implies that the people’s decision reduces to a
comparison of a pair of policies. Specifically, let τN (λ) be the income tax rate that maximizes the people’s
utility when trade policy is λ; in other words, τN (λ) is the unique solution of the following equation:

                                                                          yN (λ) 7
                                                C ′ (τN (λ)) = 1 −                .
                                                                           ȳ (λ)

Then, λN = arg maxλ vN (τN (λ) , λ) and τN = τN (λN ). Note that τN clearly depends on how trade
policy affects income distribution and particularly on how it affects the income share of the populace
(nN yN (λ) /ȳ (λ)). Due to this interdependence, it is possible that, even if the populace is protectionist,
they may prefer the combination of a free-trade policy and the tax rate τN (F ) to a protectionist trade
policy and τN (A). The following assumption rules out such a situation, however.

    Assumption 2: If the people are pro-free-trade, they prefer (τN (F ) , F ) to (τN (A) , A), while if they
are protectionist, they prefer (τN (A) , A) to (τN (F ) , F ). Formally,

                               yN (F ) > yN (A) ⇒ vN (τN (F ) , F ) > vN (τN (A) , A) ,
                               yN (A) > yN (F ) ⇒ vN (τN (A) , A) > vN (τN (F ) , F ) .


     Assumption 2 simply says that income taxation is not enough to change the people’s stance on
trade policy. The key question is, of course, how strong this assumption is. On the one hand, when
the populace is pro-free-trade, Assumption 2 is, in fact, very mild. In order to see this more clearly,
we must distinguish between two possible situations. First, it may be the case that, although the
peoples’s gross income is higher under free trade, their income share is in fact lower under free trade, i.e.,
yN (F ) > yN (A), but (nN yN (F ) /ȳ (F )) < (nN yN (A) /ȳ (A)). Then, τN (F ) > τN (A), which implies
that, under free trade, the populace does not only have a higher gross income, but it also receives higher
transfers (net of taxes). Thus, it is always the case that vN (τN (F ) , F ) > vN (τN (A) , A). Second, it
may be the case that the populace’s gross income and income share are both higher under free trade,
i.e., yN (F ) > yN (A) and (nN yN (F ) /ȳ (F )) > (nN yN (A) /ȳ (A)). Then τN (F ) < τN (A) and, therefore,
(1 − τN (F )) yN (F ) > (1 − τN (A)) yN (A), which implies that the only situation in which the populace
  7                                                  yN
      The solution is unique because C ′ (0) < 1 −    ȳ
                                                           < C ′ (1) and C is strictly convex.


                                                                    6
prefers (τN (A) , A) to (τN (F ) , F ) is when τN (A) is sufficiently higher than τN (F ) so that transfers under
protectionism are much higher than under free trade. This is very unlikely and, in fact, is impossible
for some specifications of the cost function C. On the other hand, when the populace is protectionist,
it must be the case that (nN yN (A) /ȳ (A)) > (nN yN (F ) /ȳ (F )), which implies that τN (F ) > τN (A).
Then, Assumption 2 is somewhat more robust, since it is always possible to conceive of a cost function C
that induces low enough costs of income taxation so that the populace would prefer to have a higher tax
rate levied on a bigger tax base under free trade than to have a lower tax rate levied on a smaller tax base
under protectionism. Conversely, if the costs of income taxation are relatively high, then the opposite
is true, and the people will prefer (τN (A) , A) to (τN (F ) , F ). In the rest of this paper, we assume that
Assumptions 1 and 2 hold.
    The above discussion also shows what types of redistribution can be induced by trade policy that
are not possible under a redistribution scheme based solely on income tax. If there is no intra-elite
conflict over trade policy (say, for instance, that both elite factions are protectionist and the people are
pro-free-trade), then trade policy provides the elite with a way to “transfer” income from the people to
the elite (by closing the economy). It also gives the people an opportunity to “transfer” income from the
elite (by opening up the economy). If there is intra-elite conflict (the setting we emphasize throughout
this paper), then trade policy becomes a more interesting instrument, since it allows redistribution from
one elite faction to the other elite group and to the people and vice versa. This cannot be accomplished
through income taxation and is a key element that paves the way to a number of very interesting political
interactions.

2.2   Factor Endowments, International Trade and Intra-Elite Conflict
Most trade models are compatible with our three-group model and are capable of inducing intra-elite
conflict over trade policy, depending on the levels reached by domestic factor endowments and interna-
tional prices or world factor endowments. We will now briefly review three international trade models
while focusing on two issues. First, we show how these models can be used to provide micro-foundations
for our model. Second, we derive the conditions under which these models induce intra-elite conflict
over trade policy. We close the section with general micro-founded definitions of a group stance on trade
policy and intra-elite conflict over trade policy.
    Consider an economy with three final goods, denoted by j = X, Y, Z, and three primary inputs,
denoted by i = K, L, N . Let Yj denote the consumption of j and let Qj be the production of good j.
Assume that preferences and production functions are Cobb-Douglass, i.e.,

            U = (YX )βX (YY )βY (YZ )βZ , Qj = (Kj )αK,j (Nj )αN,j (Lj )αL,j for j = X, Y, Z,
              X                    X
where βj ≥ 0,    βj = 1, αi,j ≥ 0,      αi,j = 1, for i = K, L, N and j = X, Y, Z. Let E = (K, L, N )
                   j                       i
be the vector of factor endowments in the economy. Define the capital-labor and land-labor ratios by
k = K/N and l = L/N , respectively. When necessary, we refer to factor endowments of the domes-
tic (world) economy using the subindex d (w). For instance, Kd (Kw ) indicates the domestic (world)
endowment of capital, and kd (kw ) is the domestic (world) capital-labor ratio. Let T G (N T G) be
the set of tradeable (non-tradeable) goods. Therefore, the economy can be summarized as the tuple

     Model 1: Simple Factor-Specific Model. Consider an economy in which each final good is
tradeable and is produced using a simple linear technology,          i.e., QX = K, QY = L, QZ = N . Thus, the
                          1
economy is given by M = A , B , E , T G , N T G , where A1 = I3×3 , B1 > 0, T G1 = {X, Y, Z},

and N T G1 = ∅.
     In Appendix 1, we compute the equilibrium under autarky as well as the equilibrium of an integrated
world economy and we show that international trade replicates the integrated equilibrium for any allo-
cation of factor endowments to given countries. Comparing factor prices under autarky and under an
integrated equilibrium, we show that: wiF > wiA if and only if h1i (Ed , Ew ) > 0, where h1K (Ed , Ew ) =

Thus, there is intra-elite conflict over trade policy if and only if

Figure 1.a depicts the trade policy stance of each group as a function of world factor endowments for
βX = βY = 0.25 and βZ = 0.50.8 Intra-elite conflict occurs when the domestic capital-labor ratio differs
from the world capital-labor ratio and the domestic land-labor ratio is similar to the world land-labor
ratio or vice versa. In other words, biases in the abundance of capital or land per worker relative to world
endowments produce intra-elite conflict.9
    For a small open economy that cannot affect international prices wiF > wiA if and only if h1i (Ed , p∗ ) > 0,
where h1K (Ed , p∗ ) = ep∗X − βX (kd )βX −1 (ld )βY , h1L (Ed , p∗ ) = ep∗Y − βY (kd )βX (ld )βY −1 , h1N (Ed , p∗ ) = ep∗Z −

    Moreover, the magnitude of the bias necessary to produce intra-elite conflict increases with βZ . The intuition is that,
as the share household income that is expended on labor-intensive goods decreases, differences in labor endowments will
become less important and, hence, small biases in capital or land endowments will be enough to induce intra-elite conflict.

    Model 2: Ricardo-Viner Factor-Specific Model. Consider an economy with two final goods,
each produced using a Cobb Douglass production function, i.e., QX = (KX )αK,X (NX )αN,X , QY =
(L)αL,Y (NY )αN,Y . Note that capital and land are specific factors, while labor can move freely between
the two industries. Thus, the economy is given by M2 = A2 , B2 , E2 , T G2 , N T G2 , where:
                                                                   

     In Appendix 1, we prove that international trade always replicates the integrated equilibrium for any
allocation of factor endowments to given countries. Comparing factor prices under autarky and under
an integrated equilibrium we show that wiF > wiA if and only if h2i (Ed , Ew ) > 0, where h1K (Ed , Ew ) =

   Model 3: Simple Model with a Non-Tradeable Good. Consider an economy with three final
goods, two of which (X and Y ) are tradeable while the other (Z) is non-tradeable. Specifically, assume
that the production functions are QX = (KX )αK,X (NX )αN,X , QY = (KY )αK,Y (LY )αL,Y and QZ = NZ .
Thus, the economy is given by M3 = A3 , B3 , E3 , T G3 , N T G3 , where:
                                                         
                              αK,X              αK,Y    0

In Appendix 1, we prove that, unless there is a very particular distribution of factor endowments among
countries, international trade cannot replicate the integrated equilibrium. Hence, under free trade, at
least one country specializes intheproduction of QY . Indeed, a small   open economy   i specializes in the

omy is specialized, both industrialists and landlords are pro-free-trade or, if industrialists are better off
under autarky, there is intra-elite conflict. The intuition is as follows. Land is a specific factor that is
fully employed in the rural export industry Y and, hence, landlords always prefer a free-trade policy.
Although in a specialized economy all the capital is also employed in the rural industry, it is possible
that industrialists would be better off under autarky because capital can move to manufacturing industry
X. In a diversified economy that exports the land-intensive good industrialists tend to be protectionists
(although this is not necessarily the case) while landlords are still pro-free-trade. Conversely, in a diver-
sified economy that exports the labor-intensive good X, landlords becomes a protectionist group, while
industrialists tend to favor a free-trade policy.

    In general, we can compute the equilibrium factor prices under autarky and free trade for any given
economy. By comparing them, we can deduce the trade policy stance of each socioeconomic group and
find the conditions under which there is intra-elite conflict over trade policy. Formally, we have the
following definition.

    Definition 1: For an open economy, let wiF and wiF denote the real price of factor i = K, L, N under
free trade and autarky, respectively. We say that group i is pro-free-trade if and only if

                                                  hi = wiF − wiA > 0.                                                  (7)

We say that there is intra-elite conflict over trade policy if and only if

                                                       hL hK < 0.                                                      (8)


    Remark 1: Note that wiA will be a function of domestic factor endowments Ed . In the presence of
factor price equalization, wiF is a function of world factor endowments Ew . For a small open economy
wiF is a function of domestic factor endowments and international prices of tradeable goods.


3        The Polity
The choice of who make collective decisions (τ, λ) in each period and under what restrictions is determined
by the distribution of political power in society. We assume that there are two sources of political power:
de jure power, which emanates from legal institutions, and de facto power, which emanates from the
ability to change legal institutions. Political regimes allocate de jure political power to different groups
in society. We consider two alternative political regimes: autocracy, and democracy. In an autocracy, the
elites have the de jure political power and, hence, the government maximizes the elites’ utility. However,
sometimes autocracies face a threat of revolution, which temporarily gives de facto political power to
the people. In a democracy, the people have the de jure political power and, hence, the government
maximizes the people’s utility. Sometimes democracies may face the threat of a coup, however, which
temporarily gives de facto political power to the elites.12
    Revolutions and coups are costly events. We assume that a fraction µt (ϕt ) of the gross income of
society is destroyed in a revolution (coup). The de facto political power conferred by the threat of a
revolution or a coup is also transitory. A simple way of modeling this is to assume that, if the political
regime is an autocracy, then, during any given period, there is some probability that the people will be
able to overcome the collective action problem and thus pose a revolutionary threat. Similarly, if the
political regime is a democracy, then, in any given period, there is some probability that the elite will be
able to pose the threat of a coup. Formally, in an autocracy, with probability q, the cost of the revolution
    12
     In general, it is very difficult to maintain the threat of a revolt or a coup for a long time. Perhaps this is because
collective-action problems can be solved only under very special circumstances; or it might be the case that, given enough
time, the legal authorities will always be able to mobilize enough resources to repress the insurgents. Thus, whatever the
reason, the de facto political power conferred by the threat of a revolution or a coup tends to be short-lived.


                                                            11
is µt = µ < 1, while with probability (1 − q), the revolution has a prohibitive cost, which we indicate
with the notation µt = ∞. In a democracy, with probability r, the cost of the coup is ϕt = ϕ < 1, while
with probability (1 − r), the cost of the coup is prohibitive, which we indicate by ϕt = ∞.
    The timing of events within a given period in a democracy is as follows:

  1. The state ϕt is revealed.

  2. The people propose a policy (τ, λ) to be implemented by the democratic government.

  3. One of the elite groups, indicated by l ∈ {L, K}, assesses the people’s proposal and then chooses
     to mount a coup or not. If l mounts a coup, it also backs one of the elite groups to control the new
     dictatorship.

  4. The other faction of the elite, indicated by s ∈ {L, K}, examines the people’s proposal and l’s
     move. If l has begun a coup, s must decide whether to support it or not. If s supports the coup,
     then the coup takes place, the new elite government takes form and the elite faction that controls it
     selects a policy. The coup costs a fraction ϕt of aggregate income. If s does not support the coup,
     then the coup fails and the elite cannot take power.

  5. If there is no actual coup, either because l does not mount it, or because s does not support it,
     then the people’s proposal is implemented.

    The intuition behind this sequence is as follows. As in Acemoglu and Robinson (2006), we model a
coup as a game between the elites and the people in which the people’s promises are credible only when
the elites can pose a credible coup threat. The new issue that we introduce is a second dimension of
potential conflict: trade policy. In particular, although all members of the elites prefer the lowest income
tax, they may disagree about trade policy. Also, the people may have a higher or lower propensity to
implement protectionist policies, which implies that democracy may be more costly for one elite group
and more attractive for the other. A direct consequence of introducing a second policy dimension and
two elite groups is that a coup must be the outcome of bargaining between the elite groups. In the event
of intra-elite bargaining over the possibility of staging a coup, we assume that one of the elite groups,
denoted by l, takes the lead and decides whether or not to mount a coup and proposes which of the
thow elite groups should control the new government, while the other elite group, denoted by s, has veto
power. When both elite groups have the same trade policy preferences, it does not actually matter which
one is l and which one is s, since λl = λs 6= λN . However, in the presence of intra-elite conflict over trade
policy, it is very important to determine which elite group has the power to propose and which has veto
power. We assume that the elite group s and the people share the same trade policy preference, i.e.,
λl 6= λs = λN . Note also that there is no credible commitment problem between the elite groups, since,
once a coup has been mounted, only one group of the elite will control the new autocracy.
    The timing of events within a given period in an autocracy is as follows:

  1. The state µt is revealed.

  2. The elite group that controls the autocracy decides whether to concede the control of the autocracy
     to the other elite group or not.


                                                     12
    3. The elite group that controls the autocracy proposes democratization or a policy (τ, λ).
    4. The people observe the elite’s move and decide whether they should mount a revolution or not.
       If the elite offers to democratize the country and the people accept the offer, then they take over,
       and the new democratic government selects a policy. If the people organizes a revolution, all factor
       endowments are expropriated and redistributed evenly among the people, and the economy moves
       into autarky. The revolution costs a fraction µt of aggregate income, which includes the cost of
       organizing the revolution as well as the long-standing reduction in economic efficiency caused by
       the elimination of private property.

    Only step 2 requires some explanation. The idea is that the elite group that controls the autocracy
may prefer to concede control over the autocracy to the other elite group if that would help to avoid
democratization. This concession is a reallocation of de jure political power between the elite groups
which can be accomplished by extending the franchise or by means of any political reform that properly
re-balances the legal rights of the two elite groups under the autocratic regime.


4     Equilibrium
In this section we define and characterize the equilibrium of the game. First, we formally define the
dynamic political economy game and the corresponding notion of equilibrium. Second, we define and
characterize the sets of promises that would placate a revolt, prevent a coup that would have given rise
to a short-lived autocracy, and prevent a coup that would have given rise to a lasting autocracy. In the
next section, we use these sets to fully characterize political transitions in the absence and in the presence
of intra-elite conflict.
     Recall that the tax rate τ is any real number between 0 and 1, i.e., τ ∈ [0, 1]; trade policy λ is a
discrete variable that can take only two values (autarky and free trade, denoted by A and F , respectively),
i.e., λ ∈ {A, F }; the cost of a revolt is an i.i.d. random variable that can take two values (low and
prohibitive, denoted by µ and ∞, respectively), i.e., µt ∈ {µ, ∞}; and the cost of a coup is an i.i.d.
random variable that can take two values (low and prohibitive, denoted by ϕ and ∞, respectively),
i.e., ϕt ∈ {ϕ, ∞}. Finally, there are four different types of political institutions (autocracy controlled
by l, autocracy controlled by s, democracy and revolution, denoted by aut (l), aut (s), dem, and rev,
respectively).
     We will restrict the analysis to Markov strategies, which means that the decision of player i in period
t can only depend on the political regime at the beginning of the period, the realization of the random
variables µt or ϕt , and the actions taken by  other players in period t before i must move. A Markov
                                                 aut(l) dem
strategy for elite group l is a function σl = σl       , σl   , where:

                         aut(l)
                        σl        : {µ, ∞} → {aut (l) × [0, 1] × {A, F } , aut (s) , dem} ,              (9a)
                         σldem    : {ϕ, ∞} × [0, 1] × {A, F } → {aut (l) , aut (s) , dem} .              (9b)
Elite group l must make a decision under two possible circumstances. When the political regime is an
autocracy controlled by l, for every possible realization of µt , l must decide among three alternatives: stay
in control of the autocracy, in which case l also selects a policy; concede control to s; or offer democrati-
zation. When the political regime is a democracy, for every realization of ϕt and every concession offered

                                                         13
by the people, l must select among three alternatives: mount a coup that gives rise to an autocracy
controlled by l; mount a coup that gives rise to an autocracy controlled

   A Markov strategy for the elite group s is a function σs = σs          , σs (aut (l)) , σsdem (aut (s)) ,
where:

                       σsaut(s) : {µ, ∞} → {aut (s) × [0, 1] × {A, F } , dem} ,                               (10a)
               σsdem (aut (l))    : {ϕ, ∞} × [0, 1] × {A, F } → {aut (l) , dem} ,                             (10b)

Elite group s must make a decision under three possible sets of circumstances. When the political regime
is an autocracy controlled by s, for every possible realization of µt , s must decide between two alternatives:
to stay in control of the autocracy, in which case s also selects a policy, or to offer democratization. When
the political regime is a democracy and the elite group l has decided to initiate a coup that will give rise
to an autocracy controlled by l, for every realization of ϕt and every concession offered by the people,
s must select between two alternatives: to support the coup or not to support it. When the political
regime is a democracy and the elite group l has decided to initiate a coup that will give rise to an
autocracy controlled by s, for every realization of ϕt and every concession offered by the people, s must
select between two alternatives: to support the coup, in which case s must also select a policy, or not to
support it.                                                                             
    A Markov strategy for the people is a function σN = σN      dem , σ aut(l) , σ aut(s) , where:

The people must make a decision under three different set of circumstances. When the political regime
is a democracy, for every realization of ϕt , the people select a concession. When the political regime is
an autocracy controlled by the elite group l (s), for every realization of µt and every concession offered
by the elite, the people must decide if they accept the concession or if they are going to mount a revolt.
    Let Σi be the set of Markov strategies of group i = {l, s, N } = {K, L, N }, σ = (σl , σs , σN ) a profile of
Markov strategies and Σ = Σl × Σs × ΣP . Any σ ∈ Σ induces a probability distribution over sequences

D Summing up, a political       E         transition game with endogenous trade policy is a tuple G =

player i (for a formal definition of a Markov strategy see (9), (10), and (11)), and Vi : Σ → ℜ is the
discounted utility function of player i (for a formal definition of Vi see (1) and (2)). Then, a Markov
perfect equilibrium of this game is defined as follows.
                                                                    D                       E

                                                          14
    In order to characterize the Markov perfect equilibrium, it is useful to define some threshold values
for µ and ϕ. Let µ̄ (τ, λ) denote the proportion of aggregate income that the people are willing to sacrifice
in order to expropriate the elite instead of accepting (τ, λ). Formally:

                                                             nN vN (τ, λ)
                                           µ̄ (τ, λ) = 1 −                .
                                                                ȳ (A)

Let ϕ̄i (τ, λ, λj ) denote the fraction of its income that the elite group i is willing to sacrifice in order to
switch the policy from (τ, λ) to (0, λj ). Formally:

                                                                   vi (τ, λ)
                                           ϕ̄i (τ, λ, λj ) = 1 −               .
                                                                   vi (0, λj )

    Next, we use these thresholds to compute the set of promises that placate groups that are threatening
to stage a revolt, prevent a coup that would give rise to a short-lived autocracy, and prevent a coup that
would give rise to a lasting autocracy.
    1. Promises that placate a revolt. In Appendix 2 we prove that the set of promises that will
placate a revolt when the autocracy is controlled by the elite group j is given by:

                 S̄R (µ, λj ) = {(τ, λ) ∈ S : µ ≥ [1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τ, λ) + δ (1 − q) µ̄ (0, λj )} .

The intuition is as follows. Suppose that the autocracy is controlled by the elite faction j, there is
a threat of a revolt, and the elite promises to implement (τ, λ). For the period concerned, the elite’s
proposal is completely credible, but in the future it will be credible only when there is a threat of a
revolt (an event that occurs with probability q), since, if there is no such threat (an event that occurs
with probability (1 − q)), the elite government can safely implement (0, λj ). q µ̄ (τ, λ) + (1 − q) µ̄ (0, λj )
indicates the proportion of aggregate income that the people are willing to sacrifice in order to expropriate
the elite rather than accepting (τ, λ) with probability q and (0, λj ) with probability (1 − q). Thus,
(1 − δ) µ̄ (τ, λ) + β [q µ̄ (τ, λ) + (1 − q) µ̄ (0, λj )] indicates the proportion of aggregate income that the
people are willing to sacrifice in order to expropriate the elite rather than accepting (τ, λ) now and
(τ, λ) with probability q and (0, λj ) with probability (1 − q) in the future. Since, µ is the proportion
of aggregate income that the people must sacrifice in order to mount a revolt and expropriate the elite,
S̄R (µ, λj ) is the set of promises that will placate those threatening to revolt.
    2. Promises that prevent the establishment of a short-lived autocracy. In Appendix 2 we
prove that the set of promises that will block a coup that would give rise to a short-lived dictatorship
controlled by the elite group j is given by:

                S̄C (ϕ, λj ) = {(τ, λ) ∈ S : there is i ∈ {L, K} such that [1 − δ (1 − q)] ϕ ≥
                            [1 − δ (1 − q − r)] ϕ̄i (τ, λ, λj ) + δ (1 − q − r) ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λj )} .

The intuition is as follows. Consider a situation in which the threat of a revolt forces the elite to offer to
institute a democracy in order to dispel that threat. This means that, autocracies cannot be long-lasting
because, sooner or later, a revolt will lead to a democracy. Suppose that we are in a democratic regime,
there is the threat of a coup and the people promise to implement (τ, λ). During the period in question,
the promise is completely credible, but, in the future, it will be credible only when there is the threat of a


                                                          15
coup (an event that occurs with probability r), since, when there is no such threat, the people can safely
implement (τN , λN ). Thus, if the elite does not mount a coup, with probability r, the policy is (τ, λ)
and, with probability (1 − r), it is (τN , λN ). Conversely, if every time that there is the threat of a coup
the elite mounts a coup that gives rise to a dictatorship controlled by the elite faction j, then society will
continuously switch back and forth between one political regime and the other. Under a democracy, the
people will implement (τP , λP ) until there is a coup and the policy is switched to (0, λj ), which in turn
will be implemented until the threat of another revolt leads to another wave of democratization. Thus,
from the point of view of the elite, the key difference between accepting the people’s promise or not is that
a coup would lead to (0, λj ) under circumstances in which the policy to be implemented would have been
(τ, λ) or (τN , λN ). More formally, (1 − δ) ϕ̄i (τ, λ, λj ) + δ [(r + q) ϕ̄i (τ, λ, λj ) + (1 − r − q) ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λj )]
indicates the proportion of its income that elite group i is willing to sacrifice in order to get (0, λj ) instead
of (τ, λ) now and (τ, λ), with probability (r + q), and (τN , λN ), with probability (1 − r − q), in the future.
Engineering this policy change has an expected cost for the elite, which is given by (1 − δ) ϕ + δqϕ (the
cost is expressed as a fraction of i’s income). The first term is the immediate cost of mounting a coup,
while the second term is the expected discounted cost of future coups (there will be a coup each time
that a democracy is established, an event that occurs with probability q). Finally, the inequalities that
characterize S̄C (ϕ, λj ) must be valid for only one i ∈ {L, K} because only one elite groups needs to
oppose the coup in order for it to fail.
    3. Promises that prevent the establishment of a lasting autocracy. In Appendix 2 we prove
that the set of promises that will block a coup which would give rise to a lasting dictatorship controlled
by the elite faction j is given by:

         S̃C (ϕ, µ, λj ) = {(τ, λ) ∈ S : there is i ∈ {L, K} such that (1 − δ) ϕ ≥
                        [1 − δ (1 − r)] ϕ̄i (τ, λ, λj ) + δ (1 − r) ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λj ) − δq ϕ̄i (τ (j) , λ (j) , λj )}

where (τ (j) , λ (j)) = arg max(τ,λ)∈S̄R (µ,λj ) {vj (τ, λ)}.
    The intuition is similar to the one associated with S̄C (ϕ, λj ). However, there is one key difference:
once the elite mounts a coup, there will be no further attempt at democratization. This does not affect
the value of what the people’s offer, but it significantly changes the costs and benefits of a coup. Now
a coup implements (0, λj ) when there is no threat of a revolt and (τ (j) , λ (j)) when there is a threat.
More formally, (1 − δ) ϕ̄i (τ, λ, λj ) + δ [r ϕ̄i (τ, λ, λj ) + (1 − r) ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λj )] indicates the proportion of
its income that elite group i is willing to sacrifice in order to obtain (0, λj ), instead of (τ, λ), now, and
(τ, λ), with probability r and (τN , λN ) with probability (1 − r) in the future. However, a coup cannot
always implement (0, λj ), since, when there is the threat of a revolt, the elite must placate the potential
rebels by offering (τ (j) , λ (j)). For this reason, we must subtract δq ϕ̄i (τ (j) , λ (j) , λj ) from the benefits
of a coup. In terms of the costs, in this situation, a coup occurs only once, which implies that a long-lasting
dictatorship costs the elite (expressed as a fraction of its income) just (1 − δ) ϕ.


5     Political Transitions and Trade Policy
In this section we will fully characterize political transitions and trade policy. It is analytically convenient
to study the case in which both elite groups have the same trade policy preference separately from the
one in which there is intra-elite conflict over trade policy. First, we consider a society in which there is


                                                             16
no intra-elite conflict (Proposition 1). Second, we consider a society in which there is intra-elite conflict
(Proposition 2). Finally, we use Propositions 1 and 2 and the international trade models of Section 2.2
to illustrate the equilibrium.

5.1      Political Regime and Trade Policy in the Absence of Intra-Elite Conflict
We can define the following thresholds for the cost of the revolt and the coup. The reader will recall that
(τN , λN ) is the people’s most preferred policy and λE = λl = λs is the elite’s preferred trade policy.

                                                µ̄ = [1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τN , λN ) + δ (1 − q) µ̄ (0, λE ) ,   (12a)
                                                H
                           [1 − δ (1 − q)] ϕ̄       = min {ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λE )} ,                              (12b)
                                                      i∈{l,s}

                           [1 − δ (1 − q)] ϕ̄L = δ (1 − q − r) min {ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λE )} .                     (12c)
                                                                       i∈{l,s}

      The following proposition characterizes the equilibrium in the absence of intra-elite conflict.

   Proposition 1: No intra-elite conflict over trade policy. Assuming that condition (8) does not
hold, let λE = λl = λs 6= λN and µ̄, ϕ̄H , ϕ̄L be defined by (12). Then, G has a unique Markov perfect
equilibrium. In this equilibrium:

  1. If µ ≥ µ̄, the society remains non-democratic. When µt = ∞, E sets (0, λE ); when µt = µ, E
     offers a temporary concession.13

  2. If µ < µ̄, society switches to a democracy the first time µt = µ. Thereafter:

          (a) If ϕ ≥ ϕ̄H , then the democracy is fully consolidated and N sets (τN , λN ).
          (b) If ϕ̄L ≤ ϕ < ϕ̄H , then the democracy is semi-consolidated. When ϕt = ∞, N sets (τN , λN );
              when ϕt = ϕ, N offers a temporary concession.14
          (c) If ϕ < ϕ̄L , then the democracy is unconsolidated. The society continuously switches
              back and forth between political regimes and trade policies. In an autocracy, when
              µt = ∞, E sets (0, λE ); when µt = µ, E democratizes and N sets (τN , λN ). In a democracy,
              when ϕt = ∞, N sets (τN , λN ); when ϕt = ϕ, there is a coup and E sets (0, λE ).


      Proof : see Appendix 2. 

    The main message of Proposition 1 can be easily summarized in a less formal way, which also has
the advantage of highlighting the relationships between the political regime and trade policy. If the cost
of organizing a revolt is high (µ ≥ µ̄), the elites can always placate the people by offering a temporary
concession. In this case, society remains non-democratic, there is a very low degree of redistribution,
and the economy tends to operate under the trade policy preferred by the elites, except under special
circumstances (i.e., when the best way of stopping a revolt without changing the political regime is
 13
      In particular, (τ (l) , λ (l)) = arg max(τ,λ)∈S̄(µ,λE ) {vl (τ, λ)}.
 14
      In particular, (τ, λ) = arg max(τ,λ)∈S̄(ϕ,λE ) {vN (τ, λ)}.


                                                                      17
by offering a temporary change in trade policy). If the cost of organizing a revolt is low (µ < µ̄),
then a temporary concession cannot placate the people and the elites are forced to democratize. The
type of democratic regime that emerges will depend on the cost of mounting a coup. If the cost of
organizing a coup is relatively high (ϕ ≥ ϕ̄H ), then, after the first revolt, society switches from an
autocracy with no income redistribution and the trade policy preferred by the elite to a consolidated
democracy with high levels of income taxation and redistribution and the trade policy preferred by the
people. If the cost of organizing a coup is moderate (ϕ̄L ≤ ϕ < ϕ̄H ), then, after the first revolt, society
switches from an autocracy with no income redistribution and the trade policy preferred by the elites to
a semi-consolidated democracy, which usually levies high income taxes and implements the trade policy
preferred by the people. However, this semi-consolidated democracy may sometimes face the threat of
a coup, which it can counter by moderating income taxation and perhaps by introducing a change in
trade policy for a brief period. Finally, if the cost of organizing a coup is relatively low (ϕ < ϕ̄L ), then
society continuously switches between political regimes, levels of income taxation and types of trade
policy. Under an autocracy, there is no income taxation and the trade policy that is implemented is the
one preferred by the elite, while, under a democracy, there is a high level of income taxation and the
trade policy that is implemented is the one preferred by the people.
    To sum up, in the absence of intra-elite conflict over trade policy, political transitions can be expected
to be associated with major changes in trade policy. In particular, coups (democratizations) open up the
economy if and only if both elite groups are pro-free-trade (protectionist).15

5.2    Political Regimes and Trade Policy under Intra-Elite Conflict
We can define the following thresholds of the cost of a revolt and the cost of a coup.

                          µ̄H = [1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τN , λN ) + δ (1 − q) µ̄ (0, λl ) ,                               (13a)

    Proposition 2: Intra-elite conflict over trade policy. Assuming that condition (8) holds, let
λl 6= λs = λN and µ̄H , µ̄L , ϕ̄H , ϕ̄M H , ϕ̄M L , and ϕ̄L be defined by (13). Then, G has a unique Markov
  15
     Although not part of Proposition 1 it is also easy to prove that if the elite is protectionist (pro-free-trade) and the
people are pro-free-trade (protectionist), democratization is more likely to occur when trade policy is endogenous than when
there is an exogenous free-trade (protectionist) policy, but it is less likely to occur when trade policy is endogenous than
when there is an exogenous protectionist (free-trade) policy. The consolidation of democracy is always less likely when trade
policy is endogenous than when it is exogenous, regardless of the nature of the exogenous trade policy.


                                                              18
perfect equilibrium. In this equilibrium, before the first time that µt = µ, the autocracy is controlled by
l, which sets (0, λl ). Thereafter:

   1. If µ ≥ µ̄H , the society remains non-democratic. The autocracy continues under the control of
      l only if Vl (aut (l) , µ) ≥ Vl (aut (s) , µ). Otherwise, the first time that µt = µ, the control of the
      autocracy is transferred to s.16

   2. If µ̄L ≤ µ < µ̄H , then, the first time that µt = µ, society switches to an autocracy controlled
      by s or to a democracy. Moreover, if democratization leads to a political regime that always
      implements λN , then the first time that µt = µ, l transfers the control of the autocracy to s.
      Otherwise, l chooses to democratize if and only if Vl (dem, ∞) ≥ Vl (aut (s) , µ).17

   3. If µ < µ̄L , then the first time that µt = µ, society switches to a democracy. Then:

        (a) If ϕ ≥ ϕ̄H , the democracy is fully consolidated and N sets (τN , λN ).
        (b) If ϕ̄M H ≤ ϕ < ϕ̄H , the democracy is semi-consolidated. When ϕt = ϕ, N offers a temporary
            concession.
         (c) If ϕ̄M L ≤ ϕ < ϕ̄M H , the democracy is either semi-consolidated or unconsolidated.
             In the first situation, when ϕt = ϕ, N offers a concession that includes λl . In the second
             situation, society continuously switches between political regimes, but it always maintains the
             same trade policy λs = λN . The democracy will be semi-consolidated if and only if N cannot
             induce a coup controlled by s or, even if N can do so, N prefers to defend democracy.18
        (d) If ϕ̄L ≤ ϕ < ϕ̄M L , the democracy is unconsolidated and society continuously switches
            between political regimes, but it always maintains the same trade policy λs = λN .19
         (e) If ϕ < ϕ̄L , the democracy is unconsolidated and society continuously switches between
             political regimes and trade policies.20
  16
     When the autocracy is under the control of the elite group j, when µt = ∞, the autocratic government sets
(0, λj ), while when µt = µ, it sets (τ (j) , λ (j)) = arg max(τ,λ)∈S̄R (µ,λj ) {vj (τ, λ)}. Moreover, Vi (aut (j) , µ) =
(1 − δ)−1 {[1 − δ (1 − q)] vi (τ (j) , λ (j)) + δ (1 − q) vi (0, λj )}.
  17
     For    a     semi-consolidated        democracy       Vi (dem, ∞)       =        (1 − δ)−1 {δrvi (τD , λD ) + (1 − δr) vi (τN , λN )},
where (τD , λD )       =    arg max(τ,λ)∈S̃C (ϕ,λl ) {vN (τ, λ)}.       For an unconsolidated democracy Vi (dem, ∞)                      =
(1 − δ)−1 [1 − δ (1 − q − r)]−1 {[1 − δ (1 − q)] vi (τN , λN ) + δrvi (0, λl ) − δr [1 − δ (1 − q)] ϕvi (0, λl )}.   For the definition
of Vl (aut(s), µ) see the previous footnote.
  18
     In a semi-consolidated democracy, when ϕt = ϕ N promises τ = arg max(τ,λl )∈∩j S̄C (ϕ,λj ) {vN (τ, λl )} and
λ = λl . In an unconsolidated democracy, when µt = ∞, s sets (0, λs ); when µt = µ, there is democrati-
zation and N sets (τN , λN ); when ϕt = ∞, N sets (τN , λN ); and when ϕt = ϕ, there is a coup and s sets
(0, λs ). N can induce a coup controlled by the elite group s if and only if there is (τ, λ) ∈ S̄C (ϕ, λl ) − S̄C (ϕ, λs ).
If such (τ, λ) exists, it is still possible that N prefers a semi-democratic regime if VN (dem, ϕ, τ, λ) ≥
VN (aut(s), ∞) − ϕvN (0, λs ), where VN (dem, ϕ, τ, λ) = (1 − δ)−1 {[1 − δ (1 − r)] vi (τ, λ) + δ (1 − r) vi (τN , λN )},
τ        =    arg max(τ,λl )∈∩j S̄C (ϕ,λj ) {vN (τ, λl )}, λ =    λl ,   and     Vi (aut(s), ∞) − ϕvi (0, λs )          =
(1 − δ)−1 [1 − δ (1 − q − r)]−1 {[1 − δ (1 − r)] vi (0, λs ) + δqvi (τN , λN ) − [1 − δ (1 − r)] [1 − δ (1 − q)] ϕvi (0, λs )}.
  19
     In particular, when µt = ∞, s sets (0, λs ); when µt = µ, there is democratization and N sets (τN , λN ); when ϕt = ∞,
N sets (τN , λN ); and when ϕt = ϕ, there is a coup and s sets (0, λs ).
  20
     In particular, when µt = ∞, l sets (0, λl ); when µt = µ, there is democratization and N sets (τN , λN ); when ϕt = ∞,
N sets (τN , λN ); and when ϕt = ϕ, there is a coup and l sets (0, λl ).


                                                                   19
    Proof : see Appendix 2. 

    The main message to be derived from Proposition 2 can be easily summarized in a less formal but
clearer way. First, consider situations in which at least one elite group can stop a revolt by offering
a temporary concession and, hence, the key political issue is who controls the autocracy (parts 1 and
2). If the cost of organizing a revolt is high enough (µ ≥ µ̄H ), then both elite groups can placate the
supporters of a revolt by offering a temporary concession. Therefore, society remains non-democratic.
If the leading elite group l is protectionist (pro-free-trade), then the economy tends to operate under
protectionism (free trade), except when the people are threatening to revolt and must be placated with
temporary redistribution measures and, possibly, a short period of free trade (protectionism). If trade
policy is relatively unimportant for l and s can placate the proponents of a revolt by introducing much
lower taxation levels, then l will transfer the control of the autocracy to s and there will be a switch in
trade policy. If the cost of organizing a revolt is moderate (µ̄L ≤ µ < µ̄H ), only the elite group s can
placate the people by offering them a temporary concession. Therefore, there are two possible situations,
both of which imply a switch in trade policy: either l transfers the control of the autocracy to s and,
hence, democratization can be avoided, or l offers to democratize the country.21 Depending on the type
of regime that would emerge after democratization, l prefers one or the other alternative. In general, after
democratization, l will not have enough de facto political power to impose the trade policy it prefers,
and, hence, l would rather transfer control over the autocracy to s. But, when the de facto political
power wielded by l in a democracy is great enough to enable it to impose the trade policy it prefers, l
might be better off if it offers democratization than if it transfers the control of the autocracy to s.
    Second, consider situations in which only democratization will stop a revolt and, hence, the key
political issues are the consolidation of democracy and the nature of the coups that could take place
(part 3). Suppose that the cost of organizing a revolt is relatively low (µ < µ̄L ). Before the first revolt
takes place, there will be an autocracy controlled by l, no redistribution and the trade policy favored by
l. After the first revolt, if the cost of mounting a coup is very high (ϕ ≥ ϕ̄H ), then society will switch
to a consolidated democracy that implements high levels of taxation and redistribution and the trade
policy favored by N . If the cost of mounting a coup is high (ϕ̄M H ≤ ϕ < ϕ̄H ), then society will switch
to a semi-consolidated democracy which usually implements high levels of redistribution and the trade
policy preferred by N , but which sometimes lowers income taxes and may introduce the trade policy
preferred by l for a short period of time in order to counter a threatened coup. If the cost of organizing
a coup is moderate (ϕ̄M L ≤ ϕ < ϕ̄M H ), then society will switch to either a semi-consolidated or an
unconsolidated democracy. A semi-consolidated democracy usually introduces high levels of taxation
and redistribution and implements the trade policy preferred by N , but it sometimes faces the threat of
a coup, which it counters by lowering income taxes and temporarily instituting the trade policy preferred
by l. If the transition is to an unconsolidated democracy, then society will continuously switch between
political regimes and levels of income taxation and redistribution, but the trade policy favored by N will
   21
      Recall that we are assuming that, at the outset, the political regime is an autocracy controlled by l and λl 6= λN . If
we change this assumption and we assume that, at the outset, the political regime is an autocracy controlled by s, then the
elites will have no incentive to reallocate their political power in the autocracy. Note, however, that this is a very particular
case. In general, if we assume that, at the outset, there is an autocracy that maximizes a weighted average of the payoffs of
both elite groups, then the elites will consider changing these weights in order to placate the people. Moreover, the direction
of the change will be the same as it would be under our simpler assumption, i.e., the relative power of the elite group that
favors the same trade policy as the people must increase.



                                                               20
always be retained. If the cost of a coup is low (ϕ̄L ≤ ϕ < ϕ̄M L ), then, after the first revolt, society will
switch to an unconsolidated democracy, with ongoing changes in the political regime and levels of income
taxation and redistribution, but with a stable trade policy (the one favored by N ). If the cost of a coup
is very low (ϕ < ϕ̄L ), then, after the first revolt, society will switch to an unconsolidated democracy,
with continuous changes in the political regime, levels of income taxation and redistribution, and trade
policy.22
    To sum up: Proposition 2 suggests that in the presence of intra-elite conflict the path for political
transitions and trade policy should be as follows. Suppose that l is protectionist and s and N are pro-free-
trade.23 Initially, the elite group l controls the autocracy and implements a protectionist trade policy.
Then, a revolt forces the elites to reallocate political power within the autocratic regime. Accordingly,
the elite group s gains control over the autocracy and switches to a free-trade policy. The switch is
credible and placates the people because s favors a free-trade policy. Finally, democratization brings
more redistribution from the rich elites to poor people through income taxation, but it does not interfere
with the free-trade policy. Subsequent coups, if any, tend to give rise to an autocracy controlled by
s, which also favors a free-trade policy. Analogously, suppose that l is pro-free-trade and s and N are
protectionists.24 Initially, l controls the autocracy and implements a free-trade policy. Revolts bring s
to power and there is a switch to protectionism. Democratization further cements protectionist policies.
Coups, if any, tend to give rise to a temporary autocracy controlled by s and also to the continuation of
protectionism. Coups that give rise to an autocracy controlled by l that implements a free-trade policy
are possible only when the cost of a coup is extremely low and s is willing to accept free trade in order
to avoid a radical democracy that would introduce a very high income tax rate.

5.3    International Trade, Political Regimes and Trade Policy
In this section we will integrate the international trade models developed in Section 2.2 with Propositions
1 and 2. The goal is to show how different world prices (and, similarly, world factor endowments)
induce different paths for political transitions and trade policy. We proceed as follows. We take the
three international trade models outlined in Section 2.2. For each model, we assume an underlying
economic structure (domestic factor endowments, production functions and preferences) and compute
the competitive equilibrium under autarky. Then, we vary only the vector of world prices of tradeable
goods and compute the competitive equilibrium under free trade. We select different world prices in such
a way as to cover all the relevant cases in terms of trade policy stances that might be adopted by the
three socioeconomic groups. Finally, we introduce these cases into the political transition game and use
Propositions 1 and 2 to characterize the equilibrium for each case. Since the political transition game has
  22
     Recall that we are assuming that λl 6= λs = λN , with l being the agenda-setter and s having veto power when they are
bargaining over the possibility of mounting a coup. If we reverse these roles, then there will never be a coup that gives rise
to an autocracy controlled by the elite group that favors a trade policy that is not in the interests of N . Note, however,
that this is a particular case. In general, when ϕ < ϕ̄L both types of coups are feasible and, hence, if the bargaining power
of l is great enough, there will be a coup controlled by l.
  23
     This can represent, for example, the economic cleavages existing in Great Britain in the nineteenth century, with l
denoting the landed aristocracy, s the commercial and industrial elite and N industrial workers. For more details see Section
6.1.
  24
     This can represent, for example, the economic cleavages seen in Argentina in the second half of the twentieth century,
with l denoting landowners in the rural exporting industry, s industrialists in the import-competing sector and N industrial
workers. For further details, see Section 6.2.



                                                             21
several exogenous variables (µ, ϕ, r, and q), we present three different types of figures. First, we change
the cost of the revolt µ, and the cost of the coup ϕ, keeping r and q constant. Second, we vary µ and q,
keeping ϕ and r. Finally, we vary ϕ and r, keeping µ and q constant.

                    See Figures 1, 4, 5, and 6: Simple Factor-Specific Model (Model 1)

     Figures 4, 5 and 6 are based on the simple factor-specific model (Model 1) for βX = βY = 0.25
                                                                       1+η
and βZ = 0.50. Additionally, we assume δ = 0.85, C(τ ) = τ1+η , with η = 0.85, r = q = 0.50 for
Figure 4, ϕ = 0.25 for Figure 5, and µ = 0.25 for Figure 6. Each sub-figure is obtained from points
P 1.a , ..., P 1.f in Figure 1. Thus, we induce the different trade policy stances that could be adopted by
the different socioeconomic groups by changing the vector of world prices. Note that the title of each
sub-figure indicates the induced trade policy stance. From Figures 1 and 4, we can see how world prices
affect the connections between political transitions and trade policy. Consider point P 1.b in Figure 1. For
this point, the world price of the labor-intensive good p∗Z /p∗X is high (analogously, lw and kw are high)
and, hence, both elite groups are protectionist and the people are pro-free-trade. In this case, autocracy
is associated with protectionism and democracy with free trade (Figure 4.b). Similarly, consider point
P 1.a in Figure 1. For this point, the world prices of the labor- and land-intensive goods p∗Z /p∗X and
p∗Y /p∗X are high (analogously, kw is high) and, hence, landlords and the people are pro-free-trade while
industrialists are protectionist. In this case, if the cost of the revolt is below a given threshold, autocracy
and democracy are associated with free trade (Figure 4.a). Figures 5 and 6 present similar results, with
a focus on democratization and coups, respectively. Figure 5 shows that only when there is intra-elite
conflict will there be a range of µ for which the elites avoid democratization by engineering a credible
change in trade policy though a reallocation of political power within the autocracy. Moreover, as the
probability that the cost of the revolt is not prohibitive q increases, this range decreases. In Figure 6,
we confirm that, in the absence of intra-elite conflict, unconsolidated democracy is associated with an
unstable trade policy (Figures 6.b and 6.e). Moreover, when p∗Z /p∗X is high, coups are associated with
protectionism, while when p∗Z /p∗X is low, they are associated with a switch over to free trade. Figure 6
shows that, in the absence of intra-elite conflict, coups will tend to result in a continuation of the existing
trade policy. Finally, note that it is always the case that, as the probability that the cost of a coup is
not prohibitive r increases, the range of ϕ for which there is a coup decreases.

                See Figures 2, 7, 8, and 9: Ricardo-Viner Factor-Specific Model (Model 2)

    Figure 7, 8 and 9 are based on the Ricardo-Viner factor-specific model (Model 2) for alphaK,X = 0.25,
alphaN,X = 0.75, alphaL,Y = 0.75, alphaN,Y = 0.25, and βX = βY = 0.50. Additionally, we assume
                    1+η
δ = 0.85, C(τ ) = τ1+η , with η = 0.85, r = q = 0.50 for Figure 7, ϕ = 0.25 for Figure 8, and µ = 0.25 for
Figure 9. Each sub-figure is obtained from points P 2.a , ..., P 2.f in Figure 2.a. Sub-figure titles indicate
the induced trade policy stance. Sub-figures 7.c, 8.c, 9.c and 7.f, 8.f, 9.f can also represent a small open
economy, for which the Ricardo-Viner model always generates intra-elite conflict. In order to emphasize
the role of the terms of trade we focus on this case. We define the terms of trade as the relative price of
the land-intensive good Y , i.e., p∗Y /p∗X . In Figure 2.b, note that when p∗Y /p∗X is low, industrialists and the
people are pro-free-trade while landlords are protectionist, whereas, when p∗Y /p∗X is high, landlords are
pro-free-trade while industrialists and the people are protectionist. Analogously, we can say that Figures
7.c, 8.c, and 9.c represent a country with a comparative advantage in the capital- and labor-intensive

                                                       22
good X, while Figures 7.f, 8.f, and 9.f represent a country with a comparative advantage in the land-
intensive good Y . Then, from Figures 8.c and 9.c (Figures 8.f and 9.f), it follows that a country with
comparative advantage in the capital- and labor- (land-)intensive good will tend to move to a free-trade
(protectionist) policy before reaching full democratization, and the consolidation of democracy will not
significantly affect this trade policy. Figures 9.c and 9.f also show that it is possible that the people may
not be willing to defend democracy because this would require a temporary change in trade policy.

          See Figures 3, 10, 11, and 12: Simple Model with a Non-tradeable Good (Model 3)

     Figure 10, 11, and 12 are based on a model with a non-tradeable good (Model 3) for αK,X = 0.75,
αN,X = 0.75, αK,Y = 0.25, αL,Y = 0.25, βX = βY = 0.25, and βZ = 0.50. Additionally, we assume
                       1+η
δ = 0.85, C(τ ) = τ1+η , with η = 0.85, r = q = 0.50 for Figure 10, ϕ = 0.25 for Figure 11, and
µ = 0.25 for Figure 12. Each sub-figure is obtained from points P 3.a , P 3.b , P 3.c in Figure 3. Sub-figure
titles indicate the induced trade policy stance. Figure 3 focuses on three possible situations. When the
economy has a comparative advantage in the capital- and labor-intensive good X (analogously, p∗Y /p∗X
is low), then industrialists and the people prefer a free-trade policy while landlords are protectionist.
When the economy has a comparative advantage in the land-intensive good Y , but is not specialized
(analogously, p∗Y /p∗X is moderate), then industrialists and the people are protectionist while landlords
are pro-free-trade. Finally, when the economy is specialized in the land-intensive good Y (analogously,
p∗Y /p∗X is high), then landlords are pro-free-trade and industrialists and the people are assertive with
respect to trade policy. In particular, for the economy depicted in Figure 3, industrialists need a higher
p∗Y /p∗X than the people in order to support free trade. Note that, for this model, if p∗Y /p∗X is high
enough, trade policy is not a source of social conflict because the three socioeconomic groups all prefer
a free-trade policy, whereas Figures 10, 11, and 12 focus on cases in which at least one group prefers
protectionism. Figures 11.a and 12.a show that, when the economy has a comparative advantage in the
capital- and labor-intensive good, there may be a switch to a free-trade policy under an autocracy, while
the transition to a full democracy will tend to result in the continued implementation of a free-trade
trade. From Figures 11.b and 12.b, we can see that, in a country with a comparative advantage in the
land-intensive good, democratization will be associated with protectionism and coups will tend to result
in the maintenance of a protectionist policy. Finally, from Figures 11.c and 12.c we observe that, for an
economy specialized in the land-intensive good, both under democracy and in the presence of coups a
free-trade policy will tend to be implemented.


6     Case Studies
In this section we illustrate the model developed in this paper with two case studies in which intra-elite
conflict over trade policy play a salient role in determining (and being determined by) the change in
policy regime.

6.1   Great Britain in the Nineteenth Century
Britain’s bold move toward free trade in 1846 was both unprecedented and unilateral; moreover, it ran
counter to the core protectionist ideology of the conservative party while simultaneously undercutting


                                                     23
the economic interests of the ruling landed aristocracy. Thereafter, Great Britain had a stable free-trade
policy throughout its transition to a fully consolidated democracy, even during international crises and
depressions that put the system under stress and prompted many British trading partners to adopt
protectionist measures.
    Before the Reform Act of 1832, the rural aristocracy dominated British politics. The Reform Act
established the right to vote based solely on income and property, thereby considerably changing the
distribution of political power. As discussed in Acemoglu and Robinson (2006), the Reform Act had
three main features. First, it was passed primarily because there was a fear that social disturbances
would arise. Second, it was a strategic concession on the part of the aristocracy, since it did not create
a full democracy, but simply extended the franchise to the new industrial and commercial elite and the
upper-middle class. Third, the working classes were completely excluded by the reform. In terms of
our model, the rural aristocracy and the industrial and commercial elite were the two elite factions.
Before the reform, the aristocracy controlled the autocratic government. The reform, although it did
not completely transfer control over the autocracy to the industrial and commercial elite, did erode the
power of the aristocracy and significantly expand the power of the new industrial and commercial elite.
However, this was just the beginning of a process that reallocated political power between the aristocracy
and the industrial and commercial elite. The debate about the Corn Laws was another decisive factor in
this process, as well as an excellent test for the new distribution of political power.
    Manufacturers had opposed the protectionist Corn Laws as early as the 1820s, but were never strong
enough to repeal them. But, beginning in 1836, an economic downturn, together with a series of poor
harvests, goaded the industrialists into action. High food prices and unemployment also gave impetus
to both the middle and working classes, with the former being organized as the Anti-Corn Law League
and the latter as the Chartist movement. The Anti-Corn Law League was the first modern, nationwide
political pressure group to emerge in Britain (see, among others, Howe, 1984, and Turner, 1995). The
leaders of the League were manufacturers and professionals engaged in export trade. By the 1840s,
the Anti-Corn League had garnered the support of many urban groups, including some urban workers.
The Chartists were an organized working-class movement that sought parliamentary reform, arguing that
reform must encompass the entire social and political horizon. In contrast, the League chose a single-issue
strategy in it efforts to achieve repeal (Schonhard-Bailey, 2006).
    The Conservatives entered the government in 1841 with a strong and unified commitment to protecting
agriculture, yet their leader, Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel, completely reversed this stance within a
few years. In 1846, Prime Minister Peel decided to accept the repeal of the Corn Laws, and about a
third of the members of Parliament in his party followed his lead; the rest remained firmly committed
to protecting agriculture. Within a month of securing the repeal, the Peel government fell, while the
Conservatives remained divided (the repeal of the Corn Laws triggered the expulsion of the Peelite faction
from the Tories, led by Bentink and Disraeli), and then remained out of office for decades. This division
paved the way for almost 30 years of Whig and Liberal dominance, which “rested on a firm alliance of
the urban working and middle classes, of labor and capital” (Rogowski, 1989). During this period, a
free-trade policy was the norm. Moreover, “liberal governments steadily pursued even freer trade, lower
taxes and transaction costs, expansion of the franchise, and diminution of the remaining powers of local
landowners, the Crown, and the House of Lords” (Rogowski, 1989).
    Schonhardt-Bailey (2006) tells a simple but compelling story: economic interests generated the mo-
mentum behind the repeal movement, a momentum that overshadowed almost all else. Indeed, as part


                                                    24
of a broader movement toward democratic reform, these same interests, left unsatisfied, could have snow-
balled into revolution, as Peel and others had feared (and as happened, just two years later, in France).
Schonhard-Bailey (2006) rightly argues that the fatal factor for the Corn Laws was the growth of the
British manufacturing industry and export trade, especially in textiles. More particularly, as the indus-
trial prosperity and export boom of the early 1830s began to wane, industrialists became increasingly
vocal about the “unfair” protection enjoyed by agriculturists. In fact, after the repeal of the Corn Laws,
Peel himself argued, in an elaborate display of concessionary politics, that he sought repeal in order to
“satisfy the wishes of those outside” (the middle-class industrialists). He implied that a “narrow represen-
tation of Parliament” (control of Parliament by the landed aristocracy) required that concessions be made
to satisfy interest groups that were clamoring for reform. The alternative, he implied, was that pressures
for reform might become overwhelming, as they had in France (see Schonhard-Bailey, 2006). In sum,
repeal was an attempt to moderate the mounting pressures for parliamentary reform: by satisfying the
middle class and industrialists with repeal, their drive to gain control of parliamentary seats would wane
and, moreover, the working-class Chartist movement (seeking more radical reform of Parliament) would
lose momentum (see Searle, 1993; and Schonhard-Bailey, 2006). In terms of our model, the protectionist
aristocracy, by partially transferring control over the government to the pro-free-trade industrialists (the
Reform Act of 1832) and allowing a switch in trade policy (the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846), placated
the populace, thereby convincing it to relinquish its more radical demands.
    In such a context, the only option for the Conservatives was to match the set of policies offered by the
Liberals. In fact, in 1867, Disraeli supported the Second Reform Act, which significantly extended the
franchise. Indeed, after the reform, “working-class voters became the majority in all urban constituencies”
(Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006). The particular events leading up to the Second Reform Act were similar
to those that preceded the Reform Act of 1832: riots and social disturbances that convinced the capitalist
and commercial elite that the only alternative to a revolt was an extension of the franchise to the working
classes. In fact, the Chartist movement had significantly increased its power since 1832.
    The 1873-1876 crisis provided an excellent test for trade policy. After 1875, imports from America had
a significant impact on landowners, and the Conservatives, led by Disraeli, had a majority in Parliament.
A group of Conservatives guided by Joseph Chamberlain,“. . . tried to organize a coalition with a family
resemblance of Bismarck’s grouping of industrialists, farmers and workers hit by foreign competition”
(Gourevitch 1986) and attempted to reopen the discussion about tariffs. However, this attempt did not
succeed, since even “Disraeli - who had made protection his by-word in the 1840s - flatly refused to
help” (Rogowski, 1989). Moreover, this time, workers were clearly against protectionism. ”Labor, by the
1870s, was quite strong in support of free trade. In the 1840s, anti-corn-law activists had argued that
labor ought to support free trade in order to keep down consumer costs, especially the price of food.
Labor activists at the time were more skeptical, seeing tariffs as a middle-class concern that distracted
attention from the broader political demands of Chartism. It was only after experiencing the prosperity
of the 1850s and 1860s that British labor accepted free trade” (Gourevitch 1986). It is worth mentioning
that the protectionist pressures that were brought to bear during the 1873-1876 crisis were really very
strong. Internally, some of the consequences of the free-trade policy were “a new wave of bitterness
and violence in Ireland (still almost wholly agricultural) [and] the bankruptcy and reform of the Oxford
colleges (whose endowments were largely in land)” (Rogowski, 1989). Almost all the countries that
played an important role in the international arena, including Germany, France and the United States,
implemented protectionist measures, although of different types and to different degrees (Gourevitch,


                                                    25
1986; and Rogowski, 1989).
    In 1884 the Third Reform Act extended the coverage of voting regulations to rural constituencies
and the ”Redistribution Act of 1885 removed many remaining inequalities in the distribution of seats”
(Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006). The result was that “after 1884, about 60% of male adults were
enfranchised” (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006). Mainly negotiated during the war, “the Peoples Act
of 1918 gave the vote to all adult males over the age of twenty-one and women over the age of thirty
who were ratepayers or married to ratepayers” (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006). In the realm of trade
policy, there was no further attempt to alter the free-trade status quo. As already mentioned, this
was to be expected, since the newly enfranchised members of the population were industrial workers who
supported free trade. Moreover, it is likely that the new industrial and commercial elite was less reluctant
to extend the franchise to industrial workers. This was true for two reasons. First, workers did not pose
a threat to the free-trade policy favored by this elite group. Second, free trade probably reduced income
inequality, thereby making workers less willing to support redistribution through income taxation. The
old aristocracy, already severely weakened, preferred this democratization path, which was coupled with
a stable free-trade policy, because, at the least, it restrained the workers’ most extreme redistributionist
policy proposals. The industrial and commercial elite always enjoyed a huge advantage in its negotiations
with the aristocracy, since, if the aristocrats refused to support free trade, the industrial and commercial
elite could always accelerate the democratization process and achieve free trade anyway. Of course, this
came at a price, namely, welfare legislation.
    Summing up, Great Britain in the nineteenth century provides an example of intra-elite conflict (the
protectionist, landed aristocracy versus the pro-free-trade industrial and commercial elite) in combination
with a pro-free-trade populace. The aristocracy, facing radical demands, had no other option but to
gradually concede political power to the new industrial and commercial elite. The Reform Act of 1832
and the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 were two landmark events in this process. The repeal of the
Corn Laws was an unprecedented move toward free trade that both reflected and reinforced the new
distribution of political power. Proposition 2 Part 2 captures this reallocation of political power among
the elite, as well as the switch in trade policy. After 1846, Great Britain had a stable free-trade policy
throughout the entire transition to a consolidated democracy, which was fully completed in the twentieth
century. The transition was primarily an ongoing bargaining process between industrialists and workers
over welfare legislation. Proposition 2 Part 3 properly captures this transition.

6.2   Argentina in the Twentieth Century
At the beginning of the twentieth century, Argentina’s factor endowment resembled that of a specialized
natural-resource-rich economy. Both the elite and the people supported free trade. However, during the
inter-war period, trade opportunities became scarce and the terms of trade worsened, which triggered
an industrialization process that then accelerated with the Great Depression during the 1930s and the
Second World War. As a result, Argentina embarked on the second half of the twentieth century with a
very different economic configuration. In addition, once workers had voted on a large scale for the first
time, in 1946, an urban-rural cleavage developed which lasted until the dictatorship of 1976. This new
political equilibrium took the economy to the brink of autarky. Democracy was not consolidated, and a
series of coups and democratizations took place during this period. However, none of the dictatorships
that ruled the country until the coup of 1976, which deposed a highly populist government, were headed
by the agricultural free-trade elite, and none of them opened up the economy to any significant degree.

                                                    26
By contrast, the military government that took power in 1976 was primarily controlled by the agricultural
elite and brought the economy back from the edge of autarky.
    Argentina integrated its economy into world markets in the last quarter of the nineteenth century as
an exporter of rural products. Until the 1930s, the country had a specialized economy with very little
industrial development, and almost all of the domestic demand for manufactures was met with imports.
As the country grew, the service sector in the major cities, particularly Buenos Aires, developed rapidly.
The State invested heavily in the infrastructure that was required in order to export rural products, such
as railroads and harbors, and, later, also in public education (see Galiani et al., 2008). Thousands of
immigrants arrived in the country during this period, particularly from Spain and Italy. Although the
country was formally a democracy with a constitution and republican institutions, the rural elite played
a predominant role in government. Democratization pressures came almost exclusively from the urban
middle class. In fact, in 1914 a new electoral law was passed that has been interpreted as an extension of
the franchise to the middle class. Nevertheless, trade policy was never a crucial political issue, and the
economy remained under a free-trade regime throughout the period in question (see Galiani and Somaini,
2010).
    The Great Depression of the 1930s is generally considered to mark the beginning of the import-
substitution process in Argentina. The collapse of commodity prices hit the country’s economy very
hard, since it was so heavily dependent upon exports of agricultural products. In economic and political
terms, the 1930s were a transitional period (see Galiani and Somaini, 2010). On the one hand, the
rural elite retained most of the political power and tried to use it to mitigate the effects of the change
in the terms of trade. On the other hand, two new urban groups were emerging: industrial capitalists
and industrial workers. Thus, the society was transitioning away from a specialized economy mainly
controlled by members of a rural elite (who were faced with a middle class which demanded political
participation and some redistribution, but which did not represent a threat to the country’s integration
into world markets) and toward a much more complex society with two elite factions: the traditional
rural elite and the new industrial elite (in conjunction with a large number of protectionist industrial
workers, who could easily become a majority in a free election).
    The new economic configuration affected almost all the economic and political institutions of the
country. In fact, the 1940s were years of direct industrial promotion initiatives, and the State played the
leading role in the country’s industrial development. First, shortly before Perón assumed power in June
1946, the government created the Argentine Institute for the Promotion of Trade (IAPI). This institution
held a monopoly over the country’s foreign trade. In its early years, it was clearly anti-agriculture, as it
withheld a percentage of the high prices that agricultural products were bringing in the world market after
the end of the war. Together with this, a package of what was by then typical protectionist measures was
implemented: import tariffs were raised, the multiple exchange-rate system was maintained and a scheme
of import permits was created in order to manage the flow of foreign currency. Second, an interventionist
State became an active agent in the economy as a result of the wave of nationalizations that the country
witnessed in the early Peronist years.
    After the Peronist experience, it was clear to all concerned that democracy meant protectionism
and populism; thus, the traditional rural elite had a huge incentive to mount a coup, while the new
industrial elite had mixed incentives in that regard. Two elements completed the scene. First, the
effervescence of subsidies, industrial promotion efforts and ambitious social programs routinely ran up
against a major problem, namely, the appearance of a large deficit on the balance of payments (Diaz


                                                    27
Alejandro, 1970). Second, the military was no longer a united force that was obedient to the traditional
rural elite. On the contrary, the development of major industrial sectors was now in the armed forces’
sphere of influence, when not under their direct control. The coup of 1955 reflected this new and complex
situation. Although the coup was welcomed by the traditional rural elite and a majority of the middle
class, and although the new government implemented transitional policies to promote agricultural exports,
the import-substitution policies were never abandoned. In terms of our model (Proposition 2.c), the
industrialists supported the coup because they could control the dictatorship and, hence, keep industrial
protection mechanisms in place.25
    The exclusion of the Peronist party, and hence of industrial workers, from the political arena after
1955 put a great deal of pressure on the government, particularly since, by then, industrial workers
were well-organized in unions and worshiped Perón as their national leader. Thus, political tensions
persisted. In principle, the elites were willing to accept democracy, but only if populist policies were
rescinded. Industrial workers preferred this type of democracy to a dictatorship, but they could not
credibly pledge to not vote for Perón if free elections were allowed. The ”solution” was a democratic
regime in combination with the proscription of the Peronist party. Under the proscription scheme,
Arturo Frondizi was elected President in 1958 with the support of industrial workers and part of the
middle class. Fear of a balance-of-payments crisis paved the way for the ”developmentalist” strategy
originally envisioned by Perón in 1952-1955 and carried out by Frondizi between 1958 and 1962. Under
this strategy, the basic inputs sectors, namely, the metallurgical and oil industries, were developed as
a way of overcoming the chronic deficit in the balance of payments.26 After a few years, a new item
appeared on the economic policy agenda: the local-market solution for industry was increasingly seen as
inefficient, and the idea of an export industry was gaining support among the country’s authorities. A
military coup overthrew a democratic government in 1966, but economic policy did not change radically.
    In the early 1970s, the limitations of the proscription scheme as a permanent solution became in-
creasingly clear. First, the proscription was apparently not enough to convince the elite to refrain from
mounting coups, and it did not completely avert populist policies either. In fact, all the democratic
governments after 1955 somehow met their demise when they reached the point where they did not
have sufficient maneuvering room to simultaneously satisfy the opposing demands of unionized industrial
workers and the armed forces (read ”the elites” ). Second, some industrial workers, although not the
traditional Peronist unions, and part of the middle class began to radicalize their position and to move
toward socialism. In this context, the proscription scheme was abandoned and the democratic elections
of 1973 resulted in the formation of a new Peronist government, which then proceeded to carry out an
extreme version of the previous developmentalist strategy. However, the possibilities of growth under im-
port substitution had, by then, been exhausted. The country rapidly slid into chaos: in 1975, in the midst
of a social, political and economic crisis that would trigger the bloodiest military coup in Argentina’s
history the following year, the government’s fiscal deficit amounted to almost 15% of GDP. The mili-
tary government that took power in March 1976 very rapidly made it clear that the import-substitution
  25
     Symbolically, one of the most famous slogans used by the new government to describe this new policy was ”Peronism
without Perón”, which essentially meant industrialization through import substitution without the populist component of
the Peronist policies. In fact, most of the measures that promoted agricultural exports (for example, a devaluation) were
thought to alleviate the balance-of-payments constraint; what is more, most of the burden of these measures fell on urban
workers rather than on the industrialist elite.
  26
     In addition, the automotive industry (which was not particularly ”heavy” but nonetheless quite in tune with growing
middle-class demands) was actively promoted.


                                                           28
strategy was no longer part of the government’s agenda. This time, the authorities opted for a policy
of open trade. Industrial capitalists accepted this policy because the alternative was, at best, a highly
populist democracy, if not an outright changeover to socialism. Proposition 2.c captures this change.
Note, in particular, that Proposition 2.c implies that an increase in populism makes a coup controlled by
the pro-free-trade rural elite more likely.
    Summing up, in terms of our model: in the second half of the twentieth century, Argentina appears to
have been a particularly clear example of a case in which intra-elite conflict (the pro-free-trade landlords
and the protectionist industrialists) coexisted with a protectionist populace. In fact, as O’Donnell (1977)
pointed out, the oscillations in the political regime resulted from shifting alliances between social classes.
When industrialists were allied with the working class, democracy prevailed, as did a highly protectionist
trade policy and redistributive pressures that were curbed by the proscription of the Peronist party.
Two destabilizing forces appeared in this context. First, as soon as economic activity gained strength, a
balance-of-payments problem emerged as industrial imports grew and agricultural exports remained stag-
nant. Second, industrial workers demanded more redistribution and the elimination of the proscription
of the Peronist party. In that context, industrialists allied themselves with the landlords in order to force
a coup and a devaluation of the currency, which basically raised the real revenues of both of these sectors
while depressing workers’ real wages. After this economic slump came renewed growth, and, under those
circumstances, the industrialists again allied themselves with the working class, particularly when the
regime was threatened with strikes, riots and demonstrations that seriously disrupted the order of the
industrial workforce. And then the cycle began again. Viewed from this perspective, it is understandable
why, between 1945 and 1975, Argentina continuously switched back and forth from one political regime
to the next, but nonetheless invariably maintained its import-substitution industrialization policy as its
core development strategy. The radicalization of popular demands in the early 1970s paved the way
for the breakdown of the proscription solution, which ultimately led to the 1976 coup and the opening
of the economy. As predicted by Proposition 2 Part 3, industrialists supported this policy because the
alternative was, at best, a highly populist democracy, if not an outright changeover to socialism.


7    Conclusions
In this paper we have looked at some of the connections between political regimes and trade policy. As we
have shown, international trade can crucially affect political alignments and hence the political regime,
as well as trade policy. Indeed, our model suggests that significant connections exist among political
transitions, changes in trade policy and the comparative advantages of an economy. The critical point is
that trade policy opens the way for a political cleavage other than the rich-poor/elite-people division.
    In fact, once we introduce trade policy as an endogenous outcome of the political transition game, the
model predicts that, in the absence of intra-elite conflict over trade policy, major changes in the political
regime will be associated with major switches in trade policy. Moreover, the direction of those switches
depends on the countrys factor endowments and world prices (and, similarly world factor endowments).
For example, consider a country for which the combination of its domestic factor endowments and world
prices induce a protectionist elite and a pro-free-trade stance on the part of the people. For instance, in a
simple factor-specific model (Model 1), these trade policy stances occur when the country is capital- and
land-abundant relative to the world economy. In such a country, we should expect democratic regimes



                                                     29
to be associated with the opening of the economy and autocracies with the proliferation of protectionist
measures.
     In general, for societies in which there is no intra-elite conflict and the people prefer a pro-free-trade
(protectionist) policy, our model predicts that there will be a democratization process that begins with an
autocracy in which a protectionist (free-trade) policy is being implemented; this system then transitions
to a period of unconsolidated democracy and an unstable trade policy and ultimately ends up with a
consolidated democracy and a free-trade (protectionist) policy.
     When we incorporate an intra-elite conflict over trade policy into the model, a new and more diverse
landscape emerges. First, the model predicts that a crucial switch in trade policy may occur before full
democratization takes place through a reallocation of political power within the autocracy. Second, coups
tend to lead to a continuation of the existing trade policy. The countrys factor endowments and world
prices also play a key role. For example, consider a country for which the combination of its domestic
factor endowments and world prices induce an intra-elite conflict and a preference on the part of the
people for a free-trade policy. For instance, in a simple factor-specific model (Model 1), these trade
policy stances occur when the country is capital- and labor-abundant relative to the world economy. In
such a country, we should expect an economic liberalization process to take place on a large scale in
association with a major reallocation of political power within the autocracy; this would be followed by
other autocracies and, eventually, democratic regimes, all of which would be implementing a free- trade
policy.
     In general, for societies in which there is an intra-elite conflict and the people are in favor of free trade
(protectionism), the model predicts that a democratization process will take place, with the starting point
being an autocracy that is implementing a protectionist (free-trade) policy; in the next stage, an autocracy
is still in power, but now it is implementing a free-trade (protectionist) policy. This then gives way to a
period of unconsolidated democracy and a stable free-trade (protectionist) policy which eventually leads
to the establishment of a consolidated democracy that maintains a free-trade (protectionist) policy.
     The model also points to interesting implications for some institutions and organizations, such as
unions or the armed forces, which affect the cost of coups and revolts. For example, unionization probably
decreases the cost of a revolt and increases the cost of a coup. If this is the case, then our model can
tell us how the different groups will react to legislation that promotes labor unions. Similarly, the cost of
a coup depends on the availability and organization of the armed forces. Thus, our model can indicate
which groups will be more willing to extend financial support to the military. In general, when there is
no intra-elite conflict, the elite is better off when the cost of a coup is low and the cost of a revolt is high,
while the opposite is usually true for the general public. However, when there is an intra-elite conflict,
the analysis is more subtle. In particular, it is perfectly possible that one of the elite groups will be better
off when a coup would be more costly or when a revolt would be less costly. The details are somewhat
involved, but the intuition is simple. Consider, for example, the situation of the commercial and industrial
elite in Great Britain at the beginning of the nineteenth century. While a revolt would have been very
costly for the populace, the aristocracy was able to placate the people without relinquishing control of
the government. However, when the people found that a revolt would be less costly, the aristocracy was
forced to transfer its control over the autocracy to the commercial and industrial elite, which paved the
way for the repeal of the Corn Laws. Thus, it is very likely that a moderate decrease in the cost of a
revolt was beneficial for the commercial and industrial elite.

Appendix 1: The Economy
In this appendix we deduce the trade policy stance of each socioeconomic group for three different
international trade models.
    Consider an economy with three primary inputs indexed by i = K, L, N and three final goods indexed
by j = X, Y, Z. Let Yj denote the consumption of j and Qj the production of good j. Assume that
preferences and the production function are Cobb-Douglass, i.e.:

                 U = (YX )βX (YY )βY (YZ )βZ , Qj = (Kj )αK,j (Nj )αN,j (Lj )αL,j for j = X, Y, Z.

We can represent this economy by the tuple M = hA, B, E, (T G, N T G)i, where:

                                                                  
                                 αK,X αK,Y αK,Z                  βX
                          A =  αL,X αL,Y αL,Z  , B =  βY  , E = (K, L, N ) ,
                                 αN,X αN,Y αN,Z                  βZ
                                      X                                   X
                            αi,j ≥ 0,   αi,j = 1 for j = X, Y, Z, βj ≥ 0,   βj = 1,
                                          i                                     j
                     (T G, N T G) such that T G ∩ N T G = ∅ and T G ∪ N T G = {X, Y, Z} .

    Let p = [pX , pY , pZ ], where pj is the price of good j = X, Y, Z, let w = [wK , wL , wN ], where wi is the
price of factor i = K, L, N , let p∗ = [p∗X , p∗Y , p∗Z ], where p∗j is the international price of good j = X, Y, Z,

Note that real factor prices are simply w divided by the price index P , a constant.
   In order to compute the competitive equilibrium of a domestic economy under autarky, we plug in
domestic factor endowments (i.e., Ed = (Kd , Ld , Nd )) into expressions (15)-(17). Analogously, in order to

      If the economy does not produce Qj , the corresponding equalities in (14a)-(14d) must be replaced by inequalities.


                                                                   2
compute the competitive equilibrium of an integrated world economy, we plug in world factor endowments
(i.e., Ew = (Kw , Lw , Nw )) in the same expressions. International trade replicates the integrated economy
equilibrium if and only the distribution of factor endowments among countries belong to the Factor Price
Equalization set (F P E) (see, for example, Krugman and Helpman, 1985). For a two-country world
economy and assuming that all intermediate goods are tradeable, F P E is given by:

                                 F P E = {eR : eR = Γx, and 0 ≤ x ≤ 1} .

When some intermediate goods are non-tradeable, F P E is given by:
                      n                                                             o

              F P E = eR : eR = Γx, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, and xi = w.E     w
                                                                  for all i ∈ N T G   .

    If the distribution of factor endowments among countries belong to F P E, it is easy to deduce the
trade policy stance of each socioeconomic group simply comparing factor prices under autarky and under
the integrated equilibrium. When the distribution of factor endowments among countries does not belong
to F P E it can be more involved to compute the world economy competitive equilibrium under free trade.
A simpler solution is to assume a small open economy and take the international prices of tradeable goods
as exogenous variables.

    Model 1: Simple Factor-Specific Model. Assume that all goods are tradeable and QX = K,
QY = L, QZ = N . In terms of our general model, A1 = I3×3 and T G1 = {X, Y, Z}. Thus, for this model
Γ1 = I3×3 and, hence, F P E 1 = {eR : 0 ≤ eR ≤ 1}. Then, factor prices under free trade will always be the
same as under the integrated equilibrium. For a domestic economy under autarky equilibrium factor prices
     A = β (k )βX −1 (l )βY , w A = β (k )βX (l )βY −1 , and w A = β (k )βX (l )βY . For an integrated
are wK      X d          d       L      Y  d     d               N     Z d      d
world economy equilibrium factor prices are wK  A = β (k )βX −1 (l )βY , w A = β (k )βX (l )βY −1 , and
                                                       X w           w       L     Y  w       w
wNA = β (k )βX (l )βY . Therefore, w F > w A if and only if h1 (E , E ) > 0, where:

Finally, consider a small open economy. Then, wK = ep∗X , wL = ep∗Y , and wN = ep∗Z . Since
P = (βX )βX (βY )βY )(βZ )βZ , the equilibrium exchange rate is e = P/((p∗X )βX (p∗Y )βY (p∗Z )βZ ). Hence,

   Model 2: Ricardo-Viner Factor-Specific Model. Assume that all goods are tradeable, U =

Since 0 ≤ xX ≤ 1, the first equality implies 0 ≤ K           w
                                                                ≤ 1. Since 0 ≤ xX ≤ 1, the second equality
              Ld
implies 0 ≤ Lw ≤ 1. Finally, since 0 ≤ xX ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ xY ≤ 1, the third equality implies 0 ≤
 Ld
Lw ≤ 1. Hence, F P E = {eR : 0 ≤ eR ≤ 1}. Then, factor prices under free trade will always be the
same as factor prices in the integrated equilibrium. For a domestic economy under autarky equilibrium
factor prices are wKA = cα                αK,X βX −1 (l )αL,Y βY , w A = cα               αK,X βX (l )αL,Y βY −1 , and

It is easy to prove that h2K (Ed , p∗ ) > 0 if and only if                        p∗X   <   βX cY ,    while h2L (Ed , p∗ ) > 0 if and only if
p∗Y       βY cX
p∗X   >   βX cY .   Thus, for a small open economy there is always intra-elite conflict over trade policy.

Since 0 ≤ xX ≤ 1, the first two equalities imply γK,Y LLwd ≤ K                   Kd

Therefore, in general there is no factor price equalization in this model. In other words, in the trading
equilibrium one country will be specialized in QY .

The RHS of the first equation is a constant, while g (γK,X (F )) is an strictly decreasing function of
γK,X (F ). Thus, the first equation has a unique solution γK,X (F ) ∈ (0, 1) if and only if

From the second equation, γN,X (F ) ∈ (0, 1) provided that γK,X (F ) ∈ (0, 1).         Since P =

Appendix 2: Politics
In this Appendix we present the proofs of Propositions 1 and 2. We begin by writing the Bellman
equation of each group in each possible state of the world. Each state consists of a combination of a
political regime (revolution, autocracy controlled by elite faction j, or democracy) and a cost of changing
the regime (µ for mounting a revolt and ϕ for mounting a coup).
    Revolution. Since the revolution is an absorbing state, it is easy to compute the expected utility
for each group when the people mount a revolt.
                                                   (
                                                        0        if i = l, s,
                                   Vi (rev, µt ) =   (1−µt )ȳ A                                       (24)
                                                     (1−δ)nN     if i = N.

    Autocracy. Suppose that the political regime is aut(j). If µt = ∞, then j can implement (0, λj ).
In the next period, the political regime will also be aut(j). Moreover, with probability q, µt+1 = µ, and
with probability (1 − q), µt+1 = ∞. Therefore:

                  Vi (aut(j), ∞) = vi (0, λj ) + δ [qVi (aut(j), µ) + (1 − q) Vi (aut(j), ∞)] .

If µt = µ, then j has several alternative means of placating the revolt. First, j can concede a transitory
change in policy (with this policy being denoted as(τ, λ)) without any modification in political institu-
tions. Second, j can transfer the control of the autocracy to the other elite group. Finally, j can offer
democratization. Suppose that j uses the first strategy and N does not mount a revolution. Then, the
expected utility of group i is given by

                Vi (aut(j), µ, τ, λ) = vi (τ, λ) + δ [qVi (aut(j), µ) + (1 − q) Vi (aut(j), ∞)] .

If j and N follow the same strategy every time µt = µ, it must be the case that Vi (aut(j), µ) =
Vi (aut(j), µ, τ, λ) and, therefore:

                                               δqvi (τ, λ) + (1 − δq) vi (0, λj )
                        Vi (aut(j), ∞) =                                          ,                      (25)
                                                            1−δ
                                               [1 − δ (1 − q)] vi (τ, λ) + δ (1 − q) vi (0, λj )
                    Vi (aut(j), µ, τ, λ) =                                                       .       (26)
                                                                    1−δ
N is willing to accept j’s offer if and only if VN (j, µ, τ, λ) ≥ VN (rev, µ), which implies that we can
define a critical value of µ, such that, for µ higher than this critical value, N agrees to stop the revolt
in exchange for j’s offer, while, for µ lower than this critical value, N mounts a revolt if j maintains the
offer (τ, λ). This critical value is given by:

                                 [1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τ, λ) + δ (1 − q) µ̄ (0, λj ) .                     (27)


    Only democracy placate the revolt.                  Suppose that µ < [1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τN , λN ) +
δ (1 − q) minj µ̄ (0, λj ). Then, only democratization can placate the revolt, regardless of which elite group
controls the autocracy. Thus, the first time that µt = µ the political regime switches to dem. Thereafter,


                                                         8
N implements (τN , λN ). During the next period, the political regime will also be dem. Moreover, with
probability r ϕt+1 = ϕ, while with probability (1 − r) ϕt+1 = ∞. Therefore:

                    Vi (dem, ∞) = vi (τN , λN ) + δ [rVi (dem, ϕ) + (1 − r) Vi (dem, ∞)] .

When ϕt = ϕ, N can try to avert a coup by conceding a temporary change in policy (with this policy
being denoted as (τ, λ)). If the elite groups accept this concession, then:

                     Vi (dem, ϕ, τ, λ) = vi (τ, λ) + δ [rVi (dem, ϕ) + (1 − r) Vi (de, ∞)] ,

If N K, and L follow the same strategy every time ϕt = ϕ, it must be the case that Vi (dem, ϕ) =
Vi (dem, ϕ, τ, λ). Therefore:
                                              βrvi (τ, λ) + (1 − δr) vi (τN , λN )
                        Vi (dem, ∞) =                                              ,                              (28)
                                                             1−δ
                                              [1 − δ (1 − r)] vi (τ, λ) + δ (1 − r) vi (τN , λN )
                    Vi (dem, ϕ, τ, λ) =                                                           .               (29)
                                                                     1−δ
   If the elite groups decide to mount a coup that gives rise to aut(j), the expected utility of group i is

                  ViC (dem, ϕ) = (1 − ϕ) vi (0, λj ) + δ [qVi (j, µ) + (1 − q) Vi (aut(j), ∞)] ,

Thereafter, when µt = ∞, j implements (0, λj ), while when µt = µ, there is a switch to dem. Hence:

                    Vi j, µL = vi (0, λj ) + β qVi j, µH + (1 − q) Vi j, µL ,
                                                                            

                        Vi (j, µ) = Vi (dem, ∞) .

If each time ϕt = ϕ, there is a coup, then Vi (dem, ϕ) = ViC (dem, ϕ) and, therefore:
                       [1 − δ (1 − q)] vi (τN , λN ) + δrvi (0, λj ) − δr [1 − δ (1 − q)] ϕvi (0, λj )
   Vi (dem, ∞) =                                                                                       ,           (30)
                                                (1 − δ) [1 − δ (1 − q − r)]
                       [1 − δ (1 − r)] vi (0, λj ) + δqvi (τN , λN ) − [1 − δ (1 − r)] [1 − δ (1 − q)] ϕvi (0, λj )
   ViC (dem, ϕ) =                                                                                                  (31)
                                                                                                                    ,
                                                       (1 − δ) [1 − δ (1 − q − r)]
while Vi (aut(j), ∞) = Vi (dem, ϕ) + ϕvi (0, λj ), and Vi (aut(j), µ) = Vi (dem, ∞).
    The elite group i is willing to accept N ’s offer if and only if Vi (dem, ϕ, τ, λ) ≥ ViC (dem, ϕ), which
implies that we can define a critical value of ϕ such that, for all ϕ higher than this critical value, i prefers
N ’s offer to a coup that gives rise to aut(j). This critical value is given by:
                                    r ′ ϕ̄i (τ, λ, λj ) + (1 − r ′ ) ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λj )
                                                                                         ,                        (32)
                                                      [1 − δ (1 − q)]
where r ′ = [1 − δ (1 − q − r)].
    A coup that gives rise to aut(j) occurs only when [1 − δ (1 − q)] ϕ < r ′ ϕ̄i (τ, λ, λj ) +
(1 − r ′ ) ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λj ) for i = K, L. Therefore, for a given ϕ, the set of concessions that avert such
a coup, denoted S̄C (ϕ, λj ), is given by:

              S̄C (ϕ, λj ) = {(τ, λ) ∈ S : there is i ∈ {L, K} such that [1 − δ (1 − q)] ϕ ≥
                                [1 − δ (1 − q − r)] ϕ̄i (τ, λ, λj ) + δ (1 − q − r) ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λj )} .

                                                              9
Moreover, if N decides to avert a coup, the best way for it to do so is by promising to embrace the
policy that maximizes its expected utility from among the set of policies that will avert a coup, i.e.,
(τ, λ) = arg max(τ,λ)∈∩j S̄C (ϕ,λj ) {vN (τ, λ)}.

    Only one elite group can placate a revolt without democratization.                                                If
[1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τN , λN )+δ (1 − q) minj µ̄ (0, λj ) < µ < [1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τN , λN )+δ (1 − q) maxj µ̄ (0, λj ),
then one elite group can placate a revolt only through democratization, while the other elite group can
also stop it by making a temporary change in policy. Suppose that the first elite is j and the second is k.
Moreover, assume that, for any given reason, society switches to a democratic regime. Sooner or later,
ϕt = ϕ. The complication is that now there are two different types of coups. On the one hand, if a coup
gives rise to aut(j), it will be forced to democratize whenever µt = µ. For this coup, the relevant critical
values are given by (32). On the other hand, a coup that gives rise to aut(k) will lead to a permanent
autocracy, since, whenever µt = µ, k can always stop a revolt by means of a temporary change in policy.
Thus, for this coup, we must deduce new critical values.
    Suppose that when ϕt = ϕ, the elite decides to mount a coup that gives rise to aut(k). Then, in the
present period, k implements (0, λk ). In the next period, if µt+1 = ∞, k implements the same policy
again, while if µt+1 = µ, k placates a revolt with (τ (k) , λ (k)) = arg max(τ,λ)∈S̄R (µ,λk ) vk (τ, λ) (see below
for a definition of S̄R (µ, λk )). Therefore:
                                                              δ
                  ViC (dem, ϕ) = (1 − ϕ) vi (0, λk ) +           [qvi (τE , λE ) + (1 − q) vi (0, λk )] .
                                                             1−δ
    The elite group i is willing to accept N ’s offer if and only if Vi (dem, ϕ, τ, λ) ≥ ViC (dem, ϕ), which
implies that we can define a critical value of ϕ such that, for all ϕ higher than this critical value, the i
prefers N ’s offer to a coup that gives rise to aut(k). This critical value is given by:
                [1 − δ (1 − r)] ϕ̄i (τ, λ, λk ) + δ (1 − r) ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λk ) − δq ϕ̄i (τ (k) , λ (k) , λk )
                                                                                                               .             (33)
                                                         (1 − δ)
    A coup that gives rise to aut(k) occurs only when (1 − δ) ϕ < [1 − δ (1 − r)] ϕ̄i (τ, λ, λj ) +
δ (1 − r) ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λj ) − δq ϕ̄i (τ (j) , λ (j) , λj ) for i = K, L. Therefore, for a given ϕ, the set of con-
cessions that avert such a coup, denoted S̃C (ϕ, µ, λk ), is given by:

     S̃C (ϕ, µ, λk ) = {(τ, λ) ∈ S : there is i ∈ {L, K} such that (1 − β) ϕ ≥
                           [1 − β (1 − r)] ϕ̄i (τ, λ, λk ) + δ (1 − r) ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λk ) − δq ϕ̄i (τ (k) , λ (k) , λk )}

Moreover, if N decides to avert a coup, the best way for it to do so is by choosing the policy from among
the set of policies that can stop a coup which maximizes its expected utility. Therefore, N chooses
(τ, λ) = arg max(τ,λ)∈S̃C (ϕ,µ,λk )∩S̄C (ϕ,λj ) {vN (τ, λ)}.

    Both elite groups can placate a revolt without democratization.                                   If µ ≥
[1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τN , λN ) + δ (1 − q) maxj µ̄ (0, λj ), the elite that controls the autocracy can stop a re-
volt by promising to support a given policy. Therefore, for a given µ, the set of policies that j can offer
in order to stop the revolt, denoted S̄R (µ, λj ), is given by:

                  S̄R (µ, λj ) = {(τ, λ) ∈ S : µ ≥ [1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τ, λ) + δ (1 − q) µ̄ (0, λj )} .

                                                              10
If j decides to stop a revolt, the best way for it to do so is by promising to implement the policy that
maximizes its expected utility, i.e., (τ (j) , λ (j)) = arg max(τ,λ)∈S̄R (µ,λj ) {vj (τ, λ)}.

    Proof of Proposition 1: Suppose that there is no intra-elite conflict over trade policy and assume
than λj = A for j = K, L, τN = τN (F ) and λN = F . The proof is analogous when λj = F for j = K, L,
τN = τN (A) and λN = A. The only required modification is to replace each letter A with an F and vice
versa.
    From (27), if µ < [1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τN (F ) , F ) + β (1 − q) µ̄ (0, A), when µt = µ, then the elite cannot
stop a revolt by making a temporary change in policy, since N will prefer to mount a revolt even if the
elite offers (τN (F ) , F ). Transferring the control over the autocracy to the other elite group does not
work either, because both elite groups are protectionist and, hence, from the point of view of N , both
elite groups offer the same policy when µt = ∞. Therefore, the only available option is democratization.
The value of ϕ will determine the type of democracy that emerges.
    From (32), if [1 − δ (1 − q)] ϕ ≥ mini ϕ̄i (τN (F ) , F, A), then the democracy will be consolidated. The
reason for this is that, after society switches to a democratic regime, even if ϕt = ϕ, N can always avert
a coup by offering (τN (F ) , F ). From (32), if δ (1 − q − r) mini ϕ̄i (τN (F ) , F, A) ≤ [1 − δ (1 − q)] ϕ <
mini ϕ̄i (τN (F ) , F, A), then the democracy will be semi-consolidated. In order to prove this, note that,
after society switches to a democratic regime, whenever ϕt = ϕ N can defend democracy by offering
(0, A), but N cannot defend it by offering (τN (F ) , F ). Moreover, N is always willing to defend democ-
racy, since the policy implemented by an autocracy is the worst possible policy for N . Given that
democracy can be defended, N chooses to defend it in the least costly way possible. Thus, N promises
(τ, λ) = arg max(τ,λ)∈S̄(ϕ,F ) vN (τ, λ). Finally, from (32 ), if ϕ < δ (1 − q − r) mini ϕ̄i (τN (F ) , F, A), then
democracy will be unconsolidated. In order to prove this, note that there is no temporary change in
policy that N can offer in order to stop a coup.
    From (27), if µ ≥ [1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τN (F ) , F ) + δ (1 − q) µ̄ (0, A), when µt = µ, then the elite can
placate a revolt by offering (τN (F ) , F ) and, as a result, society remains non-democratic. Given that
the elite can defend the autocracy, they choose to do so in the least costly way possible. Thus, the elite
promises (τ, λ) = arg max(τ,λ)∈S̄R (µ,A) {vl (τ, λ)}, where l is the elite group that controls the autocracy. 

    Proof of Proposition 2 Parts a and b: Suppose that there is intra-elite conflict over trade policy.
From (27), if µ ≥ [1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τN , λN ) + δ (1 − q) µ̄ (0, λl ), then l selects the best way of defending
the autocracy when µt = µ. Democratization, although an available option, is clearly dominated by
(τN , λN ), when µt = µ, and (0, λl ), when µt = ∞; which always placates a revolt in this region. Thus,
the relevant decision is between defending the autocracy with or without transferring the control to s.
On the one hand, if l decides to placate the revolt without transferring control to s, the best way of doing
so is to implement (τ (l) , λ (l)) = arg max(τ,λ)∈S̄R (µ,λl ) {vl (τ, λ)}, when µt = µ, and (0, λl ), when µt = ∞.
If such a policy is implemented, then expression (26) implies that the expected utility of group i when
µt = µ is given by:
                                         [1 − δ (1 − q)] vi (τ (l) , λ (l)) + δ (1 − q) vi (0, λl )
                      Vi (aut(l), µ) =                                                              .
                                                                  1−δ
On the other hand, if l transfers control to s, then s placates the revolt, and the best way in which s
do so is to implement (τ (s) , λ (s)) = arg max(τ,λ)∈S̄R (µ,λs ) vs {(τ, λ)}, when µt = µ, and (0, λs ), when
µt = ∞. Since, for s, the preferred trade policy is λs , it must be the case that vs (τ, λs ) ≥ vs (τ, λ) for

                                                           11
all (τ, λ) ∈ S. Since N and s share the same trade policy preferences, we have µ̄ (τ, λ) ≥ µ̄ (τ, λs ) for all
(τ, λ). Therefore, λ (s) = λs . From expression (26), the expected utility of group i is given by:
                                          [1 − δ (1 − q)] vi (τ (s) , λs ) + δ (1 − q) vi (0, λs )
                       Vi (aut(s), µ) =                                                            .
                                                                  1−δ
Therefore, l does not transfer control over the autocracy to s and instead defends the autocracy itself, if
and only if Vl (aut(l), µ) ≥ Vl (aut(s), µ).
    From (27), if [1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τN , λN ) + δ (1 − q) µ̄ (0, λs ) ≤ µ < [1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τN , λN ) +
δ (1 − q) µ̄ (0, λl ), then l has only two available options for placating the a revolt. First, l can trans-
fer control over the autocracy to s, in which case the expected utility of l will be Vl (aut(s), µ). Second, l
can democratize, in which case several political regimes can arise, depending on the cost of mounting a
coup.
    Suppose that ϕ ≥ ϕ̄1 , where
                                                                                                              
                             mini ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λl ) min {ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λs ) − δq ϕ̄i (τ (s) , λ (s) , λs )}
               ϕ̄1 = max                             ,                                                           .

Then, from (32) and (33), if the first time that µt = µ, l democratizes, then society switches to a
consolidated democracy because N can stop any coup simply by implementing (τN , λN ). Since, from the
point of view of l, a consolidated democracy is the worst possible political regime, the first time that
µt = µ, l transfers control over the autocracy to s and, thereafter, there is an autocracy controlled by s
forever.
    Suppose that minλ ϕ̄2 (λ) ≤ ϕ < ϕ̄1 , where
                                           min {r ′ ϕ̄ (0,λ,λ )+(1−r ′ )ϕ̄ (τ ,λ ,λ )}
                             (                                                           )
                                                      i     i        l          i   N   N   l
                                                                  1−δ(1−q)
               ϕ̄2 (λ) = max      mini {[1−δ(1−r)]ϕ̄i (τ,λ,λs )+δ(1−r)ϕ̄i (τN ,λN ,λs )−δq ϕ̄i (τ (s),λ(s),λs )}   .
                                                                    1−δ

Then, from (32) and (33), if the first time that µt = µ, l democratizes, then N has the ability to stop any
coup, although it must make some concessions when ϕt = ϕ. N is always willing to stop a coup that gives
rise to aut(l), since, for N , the worst conceivable semi-consolidated democracy is better than an uncon-
solidated democracy with periodic coups controlled by l. However, it is possible that N prefers a coup
that gives rise to a permanent autocracy controlled by s to a semi-consolidated democracy (something
that can happen only when N must promise λ = λl in order to stop the coup when ϕt = ϕ). If this is the
case, N has an incentive to promise a policy that induces a coup controlled by s.2 If N decides to defend
democracy, the best way for it to do so is to offer (τ, λ) = arg max(τ,λ)∈S̃C (ϕ,µ,λs )∩S̄C (ϕ,λl ) {vP (τ, λ)}, when
ϕt = ϕ. Then, from expressions (28) and (29), the expected utility of group i is given by:
                                                   δrvi (τ, λ) + (1 − δr) vi (τN , λN )

whenever ϕt = ∞, while it is given by:
                                             [1 − δ (1 − r)] vi (τ, λ) + δ (1 − r) vi (τN , λN )
                       Vi (dem, ϕ, τ, λ) =                                                       ,
                                                                    1−δ
  2
    Such a policy may not exist. If this is the case, the populace will defend democracy and, hence, democracy will be
semi-consolidated.


                                                                12
whenever ϕt = ϕ. If N induces a coup that gives rise to a permanent autocracy controlled by s, from
(25) and (26), the expected utility of group i when µt = ∞ is given by:

                                                     δqvi (τ (s) , λs ) + (1 − δq) vi (0, λs )
                                Vi (aut(s), ∞) =                                               ,
                                                                       1−δ
while, when µt = µ, it is given by:

                                             [1 − δ (1 − q)] vi (τ (s) , λs ) + δ (1 − q) vi (0, λs )
                         Vi (aut(s), µ) =                                                             .
                                                                     1−δ
Therefore, if l democratizes, there will be a semi-consolidated democracy whenever there is no (τ, λ) ∈
S̄C (ϕ, λl ) − S̃C (ϕ, µ, λs ) or:

             VP (dem, ϕ, τ, λ) ≥ (1 − ϕ) vN (0, λs ) + β [qVN (aut(s), µ) + (1 − q) VN (aut(s), ∞)] .

Otherwise, there will be a democracy until the first time that ϕt = ϕ, when a coup will give rise to aut(s).
Finally, we must consider the decision of l the first time that µt = µ. Suppose that democratization
leads to a semi-consolidated democracy. Then, l prefers to transfer the control of the autocracy to s if
Vl (aut(s), µ) ≥ Vl (dem, ∞). Otherwise, l prefers to democratize. On the other hand, if democratization
leads to aut(s), l always prefers to transfer the control of the autocracy to s the first time that µt = µ,
since it makes no sense for l to democratize for the sole purpose of postponing the arrival of aut(s).3
    Suppose that ϕ̄3 ≤ ϕ < minλ ϕ̄2 (λ), where
                                            mini,λ {r ′ ϕ̄i (0,λ,λl )+(1−r ′ )ϕ̄i (τN ,λN ,λl )}
                           (                                                                                   )
                                                                 1−δ(1−q)                        ,
                 ϕ̄3 = min    mini,λ {[1−δ(1−r)]ϕ̄i (τ,λ,λs )+δ(1−r)ϕ̄i (τN ,λN ,λs )−δq ϕ̄i (τ (s),λ(s),λs )}
                                                                    1−δ

Then, from (32) and (33), if l democratizes the first that time µt = µ, then, no matter what policy is
implemented by N , a coup is always a possibility. Thus, democracy cannot be semi-consolidated, and
the most that N can do is to influence which elite group controls the autocracy after the coup. From
expressions (30) and (31), the expected utility of group i when µt = µ (ϕt = ∞) is given by:

                                         [1 − δ (1 − q)] vi (τN , λN ) + δrvi (0, λl ) − δr [1 − δ (1 − q)] ϕvi (0, λl )
   Vi (aut(l), µ) = Vi (dem, ∞) =                                                                                        ,
                                                                  (1 − δ) [1 − δ (1 − q − r)]

while, when ϕt = ϕ (µt = ∞), it is given by:

                Vi (aut(l), ∞) − ϕvi (0, λl ) = Vi (dem, ϕ) =
                [1 − δ (1 − r)] vi (0, λl ) + δqvi (τN , λN ) − [1 − δ (1 − r)] [1 − δ (1 − q)] ϕvi (0, λl )
              =                                                                                              .
                                                (1 − δ) [1 − δ (1 − q − r)]
   3
     To prove this, suppose that the first time that µt = µ, l democratizes and, then, the first time that ϕt = ϕ, the elite
mounts a coup controlled by s. Then, democratization would lead to (τN , λN ) until the first time that ϕt = ϕ, when a coup
gives rise to aut(s) that lasts for ever (once s takes control of the autocracy, it will never have an incentive to give it up).
However, if the first time that µt = µ, l transfers control over the autocracy to s, then the first policy to be implemented
will be τE ≤ τN and λE = λs = λP , followed by aut(s).




                                                              13
Therefore, if l democratizes, there will be an unconsolidated democracy if there is (τ, λ) ∈ S̃C (ϕ, µ, λs ) −
S̄C (ϕ, λl ) and:

     VN (aut(l), ∞) − ϕvN (0, λl ) ≥ (1 − ϕ) vN (0, λs ) + δ [qVN (aut(s), µ) + (1 − q) VN (aut(s), ∞)] .

Otherwise, the first time that ϕt = ϕ, there will be a coup that gives rise to aut(s). Finally, we
must consider the decision of l the first time that µt = µ. If democratization leads to an unconsolidated
democracy, l prefers to transfer control over the autocracy to s if Vl (aut(s), µ) ≥ Vl (dem, ∞). Otherwise,
l prefers to democratize. On the other hand, if democratization leads to aut(s), l always prefers to transfer
control over the autocracy to s the first time that µt = µ. The reason for this is that it makes no sense
for l, to democratize for the sole purpose of postponing the arrival of aut(s).
    Suppose that ϕ < ϕ̄3 . Then, from (32) and (33), if l democratizes the first time that µt = µ, then,
there is no way that N can stop a coup, nor can it influence who controls the autocracy after the coup.
Therefore, if l democratizes, democracy will be unconsolidated if:

        Vl (aut(l), ∞) − ϕvl (0, λl ) ≥ (1 − ϕ) vl (0, λs ) + δ [qVl (aut(s), µ) + (1 − q) Vl (aut(s), ∞)] .

Otherwise, the first time that ϕt = ϕ, there will be a coup that gives rise to aut(s). Finally, we focus on
the decision of l the first time that µt = µ. If democratization leads to an unconsolidated democracy, l
prefers to transfer control over the autocracy to s if Vl (aut(s), µ) ≥ Vl (dem, ∞). Otherwise, l prefers to
democratize. On the other hand, if democratization leads to aut(s), l always prefers to transfer control
over the autocracy to s the first time that µt = µ.
    Note that we have proved stronger statements than strictly necessary since we have deduced a
complete characterization of the equilibrium when [1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τN , λN ) + δ (1 − q) µ̄ (0, λs ) ≤ µ <
[1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τN , λN ) + δ (1 − q) µ̄ (0, λl ), while in Proposition 2 we have weaker statements of the
form ‘if democratization leads to ... , then ... ’. 

    Proof of Proposition 2 Part c: Suppose that there is intra-elite conflict over trade policy. From
(27), if µ < µ < [1 − δ (1 − q)] µ̄ (τN , λN ) + δ (1 − q) µ̄ (0, λs ), then, when µt = µ, the elite can placate a
revolt only through democratization. Democratization can lead to the advent of several different political
regimes, depending on the cost of mounting a coup.
    From (32), if ϕ′ ≥ maxλj mini ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λj ), then N can stop a coup by promising (τN , λN ), which
implies that democracy is consolidated.
    From (32), if ϕ′ < maxλj mini ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λj ) and ϕ′ ≥ maxλj mini r ′ ϕ̄i (0, λN , λj ) +
(1 − r ′ ) ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λj ), then N can stop a coup by promising (0, λP ), but not by promising (τN , λN ),
which implies that democracy cannot be fully consolidated; it can be semi-consolidated, however, since
N can always moderate income redistribution and at least one group of the elite will find that a coup
would be too costly. Moreover, not only can N defend democracy, but it is also willing to do so. There-
fore, in this region, democracy is semi-consolidated. Moreover, the best way of defending democracy is
to offer (τ, λ) = arg max(τ,λ)∈∩j S̄C (ϕ,λj ) {vN (τ, λ)}.
    From (32), if ϕ′                 <   maxλj mini r ′ ϕ̄i (0, λP , λj ) + (1 − r ′ ) ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λj ) and ϕ′ ≥
minλ maxλj mini r ϕ̄i (0, λN , λ) + (1 − r ′ ) ϕ̄i (τP , λP , λj ), then N has the ability to stop any coup.
                        ′

Clearly, N is willing to stop a coup that gives rise aut(l), since, for N , the worst semi-consolidated
democracy is better than an unconsolidated democracy with periodic coups controlled by l. However, it
is possible that N prefers a coup that gives rise to aut(s) to a semi-consolidated democracy. If this is

                                                        14
the case, N has an incentive to promise to introduce a policy that induces a coup controlled by s. N
can then stop a coup, but not by promising (0, λN ). Thus, N faces a dilemma: defend democracy with
the promise (0, λ) with λ 6= λN , or simply promise (0, λN ), which will lead to a coup. Therefore, if it
is the people’s will, democracy can be semi-consolidated. However, it is also possible that N prefers a
coup that gives rise to aut(s), rather than defend democracy by seducing l, which has the opposite trade
policy preference. If N decides to defend democracy, the best policy that N can choose is λ 6= λN and
τ = arg max(τ ′ ,λ′ )∈∩j S̄C (ϕ,λj ) {vN (τ ′ , λ)}. Then, from expressions (28) and (29), the expected utility of
group i when ϕt = ∞ is given by:

                                                 δrvi (τ, λ) + (1 − δr) vi (τN , λN )
                                Vi (dem, ∞) =                                         ,
                                                                1−δ
while, when ϕt = ϕ, it is given by:

                                             [1 − δ (1 − r)] vi (τ, λ) + δ (1 − r) vi (τN , λN )
                       Vi (dem, ϕ, τ, λ) =                                                       .
                                                                    1−δ
If N does not defend democracy, and N can induce a coup controlled by s, i.e., there exists (τ ′ , λ′ ) ∈
S̄C (ϕ, λl ) − S̄C (ϕ, λs ), then, from expression (31), the expected utility of group i when ϕt = ϕ is given
by:

              Vi (aut(s), ∞) − ϕvi (0, λs ) = Vi (dem, ϕ) =
              [1 − δ (1 − r)] vi (0, λs ) + δqvi (τN , λN ) − [1 − δ (1 − r)] [1 − δ (1 − q)] ϕvi (0, λs )
            =                                                                                              .
                                              (1 − δ) [1 − δ (1 − q − r)]

Therefore, N defends democracy if and only if there is no (τ ′ , λ′ ) ∈ S̄C (ϕ, λl ) − S̄C (ϕ, λs ) or:
                                                                          λs
                                   VN (dem, ϕ, τ, λ) ≥ VN (aut(s), ∞) − ϕyN

Note, in particular, that if the choice to not defend democracy would lead to a coup controlled by l, N
will always be willing to defend democracy. However, if the choice to not defend democracy would lead
to a coup controlled by s, it is possible that N will prefer such a coup rather than a costly defense.
    From (32), if ϕ′ < minλ maxλj mini r ′ ϕ̄i (0, λN , λ) + (1 − r ′ ) ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λj ) and ϕ′ ≥
mini,λ r ′ ϕ̄i (0, λ, λl ) + (1 − r ′ ) ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λl ), then N can stop a coup controlled by l, but cannot stop a
coup controlled by s. Thus, N cannot stop a coup, but they can influence who controls the autocracy
after the coup. Since N always prefers aut(s) to aut(l), the coup will be controlled by s. Thus, in this
region, we have an unconsolidated democracy with periodic coups controlled by s.
    From (32), if ϕ′ < mini,λ r ′ ϕ̄i (0, λ, λl ) + (1 − r ′ ) ϕ̄i (τN , λN , λl ), there is no credible promise that N
can make to stop a coup controlled by l. Thus, in this region, democracy is unconsolidated; whenever
ϕt = ϕ, there will be a coup controlled by l. 
