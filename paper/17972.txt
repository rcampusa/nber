The Effect of Work First Job Placements on the Distribution of Earnings: An Instrumental
Variable Quantile Regression Approach
David H. Autor, Susan N. Houseman, and Sari Pekkala Kerr
NBER Working Paper No. 17972
April 2012

                                                ABSTRACT

Federal and state employment programs for low-skilled workers typically emphasize rapid placement
of participants into jobs and often place a large fraction of participants into temporary-help agency
jobs. Using unique administrative data from Detroit's welfare-to-work program, we apply the Chernozhukov-Hansen
instrumental variables quantile regression (IVQR) method to estimate the causal effects of welfare-to-work
job placements on the distribution of participants' earnings. We find that neither direct-hire nor temporary-help
job placements significantly affect the lower tail of the earnings distribution. Direct-hire placements,
however, substantially raise the upper tail, yielding sizable earnings increases for more than fifty percent
of participants over the medium-term (one to two years following placement). Conversely, temporary-help
placements have zero or negative earnings impacts at all quantiles, and these effects are economically
large and significant at higher quantiles. In net, we find that the widespread practice of placing disadvantaged
workers into temporary-help jobs is an ineffective tool for improving earnings and, moreover, that
programs focused solely on job placement fail to improve earnings among those who are hardest to
serve. Methodologically, one surprising result is that a reduced-form quantile IV approach, akin to
two-step instrumental variables, produces near-identical point estimates to the structural IVQR approach,
which is based on much stronger assumptions.

                                     I.     Introduction
    Compared to other advanced economies, the United States spends relatively little on
active labor market programs, and U.S. programs targeting disadvantaged workers focus pri-
marily on providing job search and job placement services rather than skills development.1
Although evaluation evidence suggests that programs emphasizing job placement are suc-
cessful on average in raising earnings and employment of participants (Bloom et al. 2005,
King and Mueser 2005, Dyke et al. 2006, Autor and Houseman 2010), the emphasis on job
placement is controversial. Average earnings gains of program participants may mask con-
siderable heterogeneity in program effects and high rates of failure, particularly among the
most disadvantaged participants. Many argue that alternative strategies are needed, though
cost-effective alternatives have been elusive (see, for example, Fraker et al. 2004).
    One particularly controversial aspect of government job placement programs such as the
Workforce Investment Act (WIA) and welfare-to-work is that these programs place a large
number of participants in employment with temporary-help agencies rather than with tra-
ditional direct-hire employers. Debate over the impact of temporary-help employment has
spurred numerous studies in the United States and Europe of its effects on low-skilled workers’
labor market advancement.2 In the Detroit welfare-to-work program that we study in this
paper, 20 percent of the job placements obtained through the program were with temporary-
help agencies versus 80 percent with direct-hire employers. Available evidence indicates that
such high placement rates are the norm rather than the exception. For example, Heinrich,
Mueser, and Troske (2009) find that participation in government employment programs in
Missouri is associated with a 50 to 100 percent increase in the incidence of temporary-help
employment relative to employment in other industries.3

    1. OECD publishes cross-country comparisons of expenditures on labor market programs:
http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?r=488782
    2. U.S. studies include Ferber and Waldfogel 1998; Lane et al. 2003; Corcoran and Chen 2004; Benner,
Leete and Pastor 2007; and Autor and Houseman (2010). Autor and Houseman (2010) contains citations to
many recent European studies. Those critical of placing low-skilled workers with temporary-help agencies
argue that these jobs tend to be unstable and low-paying and offer few chances for skills development or
advancement (Parker 1994, Pawassarat 1997, Jorgensen and Riemer 2000, Benner, Leete, and Pastor 2007).
Others point out that temporary-help jobs may serve as important ports of entry into employment for low-
skilled workers. Temporary-help jobs may directly lead to employment with the client company or help
workers build skills and experience, thereby facilitating transition to more stable direct-hire jobs (Abraham
1988; Katz and Krueger 1999; Autor 2001 and 2003; Houseman 2001; Autor and Houseman 2002; Kalleberg,
Reynolds, and Marsden 2003).
    3. Administrative data from various states show that 15 to 40 percent of recent welfare leavers who
found employment worked in the temporary-help sector (Autor and Houseman 2002, Cancian et al. 1999,
Heinrich, Mueser, and Troske 2005, Pawasarat 1997). Many of these individuals would have participated
in welfare-to-work programs. Given that temporary-help employment represents about 2 percent of daily
payroll employment in the United States, the incidence of temporary-help employment in this population is
especially striking.

                                                     2
    To our knowledge, all studies analyzing the causal effect of either temporary-help or direct-
hire Work First job placements on participant outcomes focus on mean effects–that is average
gains in earnings and employment. This exclusive focus on mean effects is a potentially
important shortcoming since it seems unlikely that most participants obtain the ‘average’
benefit or even close to it. Given the range of skills deficits that Work First participants
present, there is likely to be considerable heterogeneity in the causal effects of direct-hire and
temporary-help employment on the distribution of their subsequent earnings outcomes.4 Of
particular interest is whether either temporary-help or direct-hire jobs improve outcomes for
the least advantaged—those in the lower tail of the conditional earnings distribution.
    The current paper offers the first evidence of which we are aware on these distributional
questions. Drawing on a unique data set of Detroit’s welfare-to-work program used in Autor
and Houseman (2010), we estimate the causal effects of welfare-to-work job placements on the
distribution of participants’ earnings over a seven-quarter period. Participants in Detroit’s
welfare-to-work program, known as ‘Work First,’ are assigned on a rotational basis to one
of two or three contractors operating in their district of residence. Rotational assignment—
which is functionally equivalent to random assignment—among contractors with systemati-
cally different job placement rates enables us to separately identify the causal effects of both
temporary-help and direct-hire placements on the distribution of earnings outcomes.
    Our earlier work using these data found large positive and significant mean effects of
direct-hire job placements on subsequent earnings but negative, though largely insignificant,
mean effects of temporary-help job placements on earnings outcomes. This paper explores
the entire distribution of causal effects using the instrumental variables quantile regression
method developed by Chernozhukov and Hansen (2004a, 2005, 2006). This tool has seen
limited applications in empirical work to date, and we are not aware of any prior paper
that applies this estimator to a setting with multiple endogenous variables and multiple
instruments.
    Applying the Chernozhukov-Hansen IVQR technique reveals that the effects of job place-
ment are, as anticipated, quite heterogeneous. We find that neither direct-hire nor temporary-
help job placements significantly affect the lower tail of the earnings distribution. Direct-hire
placements, however, substantially raise the upper tail, yielding sizable earnings increases
for more than fifty percent of participants over the medium-term (one to two years fol-
lowing placement). Conversely, temporary-help placements have zero or negative earnings
impacts at all quantiles. At higher quantiles these effects are economically large and are sig-
nificantly different from both zero and from the estimated effects of direct-hire placements.

   4. Corcoran and Chen (2004) and Andersson et al. (2009) conduct some sub-group analyses of temporary-
help employment.

                                                   3
Unusual among quantile instrumental variables analyses, our analysis statistically rejects the
hypothesis that the heterogeneity in treatment effects we detect for arises by chance; that is,
treatment effect differentials between the top and bottom quartiles of the effects distribution
are, in the case of direct-hire placements, both economically and statistically significant.5
Substantively, our findings raise concerns about the extensive use of temporary-help agencies
in government employment programs. They also reinforce skepticism that programs focused
on job placement can help the hardest to serve.
     Alongside these substantive conclusions, our analysis provides one novel methodological
finding. A potentially unattractive feature of the Chernozhukov-Hansen IVQR estimator is
that it requires a strong, untestable assumption about the structural relationship between
observed and counterfactual outcomes. Specifically, the IVQR model assumes rank invari-
ance—meaning that an individual’s rank in the conditional distribution of outcomes among
those receiving the same treatment (e.g., direct-hire or temporary-help placement) is invariant
to the treatment she receives. In our application, this assumption implies that a participant
whose contractor assignment leads to a job placement and post-placement earnings at per-
centile p0 of the conditional earnings distribution of placed workers would, counterfactually,
have had earnings at percentile p0 of the conditional distribution of non-placed workers had
her contractor assignment instead induced that outcome. Though Chernozhukov and Hansen
explain that this assumption can be weakened to rank similarity, meaning that the assign-
ment mechanism does not lead to systematic changes in ranks across treatment outcomes, it
still rules out the possibility of comparative advantage–for example, if a different set of skills
is rewarded in temporary-help jobs than in direct-hire jobs.
     As a reality check on the IVQR results, we complement these estimates with reduced form
quantile regression (RFQR) models that use a simple two-stage procedure. In the first stage,
we calculate average excess temporary-help and direct-hire placement rates by contractor-
year. In stage two, we estimate quantile regressions for conditional earnings quantiles at
the individual participant level using the excess contractor-year placement rate measure as
our key explanatory variable (along with standard covariates). These RFQR models make
no particular assumptions about the relationships among participant earnings ranks across
treatment conditions. Rather, in the spirit of standard QR models, they simply estimate the
effect of a treatment on the conditional quantiles of the outcome variable.
     Somewhat unexpectedly, the coefficient estimates from the RFQR models are very closely
comparable (and in many cases point identical) with the corresponding IVQR models. This
close comparability provides both reassurance on the robustness of our results and caution

    5. Chernozhukov and Hansen (2004a) reject the null of constant treatment effects for the effect of 401K
eligibility on wealth accumulation.

                                                    4
in their interpretation. On the positive side, the estimates are clearly not sensitive to the
estimation procedure (IVQR versus the simple reduced form model). On the negative side,
the fact that RFQR yields near-identical results to the IVQR estimator raises some doubt as
to whether the IVQR model is actually recovering the joint distribution of latent outcomes for
participants at each location in the quantile index or whether it is merely estimating the causal
effect of treatment on the conditional distribution of wages. Under either interpretation, our
estimates clearly indicate that direct-hire placements have heterogeneous effects, with no
significant impact at lower quantiles of the conditional earnings distribution and sizable and
significant positive effects at higher quantiles. Conversely, while temporary-help placements
also have heterogeneous effects on earnings, the impacts are negative at higher quantiles.
Under the latter interpretation, however, we would not be justified in concluding that the
participants who most benefit from direct-hire placements are those who are most harmed
by temporary-help placements and vice versa.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides background on
the Detroit Work First program, the data used in our analysis, and the characteristics of our
participant sample. Sections III and IV present our econometric framework and tests of the
validity of our research design. Section V presents our empirical findings, and Section VI
concludes.


 II.     Description of the Program, Research Design,
                                            and Data
    Welfare reform legislation passed in 1996 created financial incentives for states to set
minimum mandatory work requirements as a condition for receipt of Temporary Assistance
for Needy Families (TANF) benefits. In Michigan, applicants who do not meet mandatory
work requirements specified in the state legislation must participate in the state’s welfare-to-
work program, Work First. Refusal to participate may result in a reduction of welfare checks
and food stamps. As is apparent in the program’s title, the primary goal of Work First is to
place participants rapidly into jobs.


II.A.     The Detroit Work First Program
    In the Detroit Work First program that we study, participants are assigned to a contract
service provider who operates in the geographic district in which they reside. Program op-
erations are divided into 16 districts or neighborhoods, and in 14 of these districts, two or
three Work First providers serve the district. Contracts with service providers are written

                                               5
each year, with the set of contractors servicing a district occasionally changing from one year
to the next. Importantly, when at least two contractors operate in a district, Work First
participants are assigned to a contractor on a rotating basis, meaning that the contractor
to which a participant is assigned is determined solely by her application date. This proce-
dure is functionally equivalent to random assignment of participants to contractors, as we
demonstrate formally below.
    All contractors provide a standard one-week training course aimed at improving job ap-
plications and other skills of the participants. Under the program, each participant develops
a resumé and is guided through the proper techniques for completing job applications and
handling interviews. In addition, all participants are eligible for support services such as
child care and transportation that are provided outside of the Work First program. The
Work First program, however, emphasizes intensive full-time job search and placement of
participants into jobs. During a Work First spell, program participants may be placed with
a temporary-help agency or directly with an employer (a direct-hire job). Alternatively, a
participant may leave the program without a job placement. By the second quarter following
entry, nearly all participants either are placed in a job or exit the program without having
obtained a job.
    By design, contractors have little scope for affecting participant outcomes other than
through job placements. The training and support services provided by Work First contrac-
tors are minimal and do not differ significantly among contractors. Despite this, contractors
display systematic differences in their propensities to place participants into direct-hire jobs,
temporary-help jobs, or no jobs at all. These systematic differences in placement rates across
contractors with statistically identical populations, stemming from differences in contrac-
tor practices, enable us to estimate the effects of job placement type on the distribution of
subsequent employment outcomes.6 Evidence presented below indicates that in our sample,
the effect of contractor assignment on the probability that a participant is placed into a
direct-hire, temporary, or no job does not systematically vary according to participant char-
acteristics. This allows us to interpret the heterogenous effects of job placements on earnings
as reflecting heterogeneity in treatment effects rather than heterogeneity in the subpopulation
’treated’ across contractors.

    6. It is logical to ask why contractors’ placement practices vary. The most plausible answer is that contrac-
tors are uncertain about which type of job placement is most effective and hence pursue different policies.
Contractors do not have access to UI wage records data (used in this study to assess participants’ labor
market outcomes), and they collect follow-up data only for a short time period and only for individuals
placed in jobs. Therefore, they cannot rigorously assess whether job placements improve participant out-
comes or whether specific job placement types matter. During in-person and phone interviews conducted
by the authors, contractors expressed considerable uncertainty, and differing opinions, about the long-term
consequences of temporary job placements (Autor and Houseman 2006).

                                                       6
II.B.     The Data and Sample
    Our data on participants in the Detroit Work First study come from two sources. The first
is administrative data from the Detroit Work first program. The administrative data cover
all Work First spells that commence between the fourth quarter of 1999 and the first quarter
of 2003 and include the name of the employer for all participants placed into jobs during
their Work First spells. Using detailed lists of temporary-help firms operating in the Detroit
metropolitan area, we code whether the Work First placement was a temporary-help or a
direct-hire job. These Work First administrative data are linked to unemployment insurance
wage records from the state of Michigan. From the state data we have information on UI
earnings and industry of employment for each job held during the eight quarters before and
eight quarter following a participant’s entry into the Work First program. We generally are
unable to determine whether the employer of the Work First job is the same as an employer
during the post-placement follow-up.
    The data set used in our analysis covers 30,522 Work First spells. Our data include
only participants who initiated their Work First spell in a district that had at least two
contractors, who were age 16 to 65 at the beginning of the spell, and who earned less than
$15,000 per calendar quarter during the seven-quarter follow-up period. In addition, we drop
two districts where the participant assignment was not rotated among contractors but rather
was based on language needs. We exclude any Work First spells in districts where at least one
contractor was not assigned any program participants during the calendar quarter in which
the participant entered. Finally, as discussed further below, we exclude instances in which
the effect of contractor assignment on job placement type varied systematically according to
participant characteristics.


II.C.     Participant Characteristics
   Table 1 summarizes key demographic, work history, and employment and earnings out-
comes for our Work First sample. The table displays these characteristics for the entire
sample and separately by Work First placement outcome: direct-hire job, temporary-help
job, or no job placement. Of the 30,522 Work First spells, 38 percent lead to direct-hire job
placement, another 9 percent lead to a temporary-help placement, and 53 percent of spells
end without any job placement. Nearly all Work First participants in our sample are black
women. The jobs that participants obtain during their Work First spells are, as expected,
correlated with their demographic characteristics, prior labor market history, and labor mar-
ket outcomes. Those who are not placed into any job during their Work First spell are less
educated and have lower earnings prior to entering the program relative to those who were


                                              7
placed in a job during the program. Although the administrative records provide data on
education in only 81 percent of the Work First spells (with the remainder missing education
data), these figures indicate that a small fraction of the population has any post-secondary
education and a large fraction is high school drop-outs.
    We track labor market outcomes of Work First participants in quarters 2 to 8 following
Work First entry using matched Michigan unemployment insurance wage records data (panel
D, Table 1).7 Participants are coded as employed in a quarter if they have any UI earnings
during that quarter. Average employment is defined as the fraction of quarters with non-zero
UI earnings over the follow-up period. Those not placed into a job during the Work First spell
are less likely to be employed and have lower earnings in the seven-quarter follow-up period
compared with those placed into a direct-hire or temporary-help job. Although the earnings
differences between those receiving some type of job placement and those with no Work First
job placement are particularly stark, notable differences among those placed into temporary-
help and direct-hire jobs are also evident. Those placed with temporary-help agencies have
slightly higher total earnings and earnings from temporary-help agencies in the eight quarters
prior to entering the program than those placed directly with employers. Interestingly, on
average, temporary-help jobs obtained through the Work First program pay a somewhat
higher hourly wage and have longer weekly work hours than Work First direct-hire jobs.
During quarters 2 to 8 following Work First assignment, the incidence of employment is
slightly higher but not significantly different for those receiving temporary-help placements
compared with those placed directly with employers. Despite this and the higher earnings
evidenced in their Work First jobs, those placed into temporary-help jobs have somewhat
lower average quarterly earnings (-$76) compared with those placed into direct-hire jobs in
post-assignment quarters 2 to 8.
    Panel D of Table 1 also reports earnings from direct-hire and temporary-help jobs and from
the longest continuously-held job during post-assignment quarters 2 to 8 based on employer
information contained in the UI wage records data. In identifying the longest-held job, we
selected the job with the highest earnings in cases of ties (i.e. a participant holding more
than one job lasting the same number of quarters). Notably, the overwhelming majority of
earnings in quarters 2 to 8 derive from direct-hire jobs. Even for those receiving a temporary-
help placement, 76 percent of post-assignment earnings, on average, come from direct-hire


    7. By the second quarter following Work First entry, virtually all participants have been either placed
into a job or terminated from the program: among those placed into a job, 99.6 percent have been placed
by the second quarter following entry; among those terminated without a placement, 97.6 percent have been
officially terminated by the second quarter, according to Work First administrative records. Thus, we treat
employment and earnings in these seven quarters as post-program outcomes, and we do not include the first
post-entry quarter in our outcome data.

                                                    8
jobs. This figure is 91 percent for those with a direct-hire placement and 87 percent for
those with no job placement.8 In addition, over the seven-quarter follow-up period more
than three-fourths of earnings derive from a single employment spell, on average, with little
variation according to Work First job placement type. These descriptive statistics suggest a
strong link between stable employment and higher earnings.
    The empirical focus in this paper concerns the causal effects of temporary-help and direct-
hire job placements on the distribution of subsequent earnings. Table 2 provides summary
statistics of mean quarterly earnings in post-assignment quarters 2 to 8 for all Work First
spells and by placement type at selected percentiles of the earnings distribution. Not sur-
prisingly, the entire distribution of earnings outcomes is lower for those who did not receive
a Work First job placement compared with those who did. Approximately 20 percent of all
participants and 27 percent of those whose Work First spell ended without any placement
had no UI earnings in the seven-quarter follow-up period.
    Panel B of Table 2 shows the share of earnings over the follow-up period coming from
direct-hire jobs at various points in the earnings distribution. Notably, the direct-hire share is
the lowest (and the temporary share the highest) in the lowest earnings quantiles. At the 25th
percentile of total earnings, only 68 percent of earnings come from direct-hire employment,
while at the 75th percentile 85 percent of earnings come from direct-hire jobs. Also notable is
that, though lower than for the other groups, for those with temporary-help placements, 64 to
75 percent of earnings in the follow-up period come from direct-hire jobs. This fact indicates
that transitions from temporary-help to direct-hire jobs are common in this low-skill group.


             III.       The IVQR Method and Estimation
   To analyze the effects of Work First job placements on the distribution of earnings requires
a methodology that allows for causal inference in a quantile regression framework. In this
paper, we rely on the instrumental variable quantile regression method (IVQR) proposed
by Chernozhukov and Hansen (2004a, 2005, 2006), which proves well-suited to our quasi-
experimental setting, albeit at the expense of imposing somewhat restrictive assumptions on
the quantile process.9 The basic assumptions and structure of the model are discussed in
detail by Chernozhukov and Hansen and hence we present only a summary here.

    8. Participants’ industry of employment—used to code whether the employer is a temporary-help firm or
a direct-hire employer—is missing in a small fraction of cases. Consequently, direct-hire and temporary-help
earnings do not sum to total earnings.
    9. An alternative quantile treatment effects estimator is provided by Abadie, Angrist and Imbens (2002).
This method is, however, only applicable for the case of a single binary treatment and binary instrument.
Chernozhukov and Hansen (2004a) show that, despite different assumptions and estimation methods, the
results obtained by these two techniques are closely comparable in the applications that they consider.

                                                     9
    The econometric model is estimated on a dataset with n observations, a continuous out-
come variable Y , a treatment indicator D, an instrument Z (binary or otherwise) and a
vector of covariates X. In the Work First case, Y are the post-placement earnings, D is a
vector of dummies indicating placement into a temporary-help or direct-hire job, and Z is
an indicator of the rotational Work First contractor assignment. Here, capital letters denote
random variables while lowercase letters denote the values these random variables take.
    The causal effects of interest are defined using potential outcomes Yd that are indexed
against the treatment d. For each individual only one component of the vector of potential
latent outcomes {Yd } is observed. In particular, we are interested in the conditional quantiles
of the potential outcomes, {QYd (τ |x), τ (0, 1)}, where τ indicates the quantile index. The
quantile treatment effects reveal the causal effect of D on Y , holding unobserved heterogeneity
(UD ) constant at UD = τ . UD is the so-called rank variable which characterizes heterogeneity
among observationally similar individuals (that is, in terms of their covariates and treat-
                                                                                 ∂
ment status). The quantile treatment effect can then be written simply as ∂d       QYd (τ p X) or
QYd(τ px) − QYd0 (τ p x). If the treatment effect is non-constant (heterogeneous) these effects
will vary across quantiles τ . In most cases, there are plausible reasons to believe that the
mean effect will not capture the treatment effect for all parts of the outcome distribution.
    If the treatment is not selected in relation to {Yd }, conventional quantile regression (QR)
will estimate the conditional quantile treatment effects (Koenker and Bassett, 1978). If,
however, treatment status is determined endogenously, the estimates will be biased and
it is necessary to use a quantile model with instrumental variables. Assuming we have
an instrument Z that is uncorrelated with the potential outcome other than through the
treatment, we can recover the causal effect of D on Y over the whole distribution of Y .
Effectively, the estimator IVQR is a quantile analog of two stage least squares.
    The main assumptions of the model as given by Chernozhukov and Hansen (2004a) are:
A1. The potential outcomes can be expressed Y = q (d, x, Ud ), where q (d, x, τ ) is strictly
increasing and left-continuous in τ . A2. Given X = x, {Ud } is independent of Z. A3. Given
X = x and Z = z, D = δ(z, x, V ) for any unknown function δ and random vector V . This is
the selection equation. A4. Most important, for each d and d0 , given (V, X, Z), Ud is equal in
distribution to Ud0 . In other words, the method requires rank similarity.10 A5. The researcher
observes Y = q(D, X, UD ), D = δ(Z, X, Y ), X and Z.
    To estimate the model in a finite sample framework, consider the usual quantile regression



  10. Rank similarity requires that each individual’s rank in the conditional outcome distribution is invariant
in expectation, regardless of the treatment state. Controlling for covariates may be very important for
achieving rank similarity.

Here D is, again, the vector of endogenous variables, X is the vector of exogenous covariates,
Zi = f (Xi , Zi ) is the vector of instrumental variables and Vi := V (Xi , Zi ) > 0 is a scalar
weight. Estimating the Chernozhukov and Hansen (2004a and 2004b) instrumental variable
                                                                                  √
quantile regression (IVQR) model involves several steps. First, define kxk a = x0 Ax, where
A (τ ) is a uniformly positive definite matrix. Second, for a given value of the structural
parameter (α), run the usual quantile regression (QR) to obtain

(2)                        (βb (α, τ ) , γ
                                         b (α, τ )) = arg min Qn (τ, α, β, γ) .

Then, to find an estimate for α (τ )), seek the value α that makes the coefficient on the
instrumental variable, γb (α, τ ), as close to 0 as possible since the instrument should only
affect the outcome through its effect on treatment status.
    In our Work First context, Y will be a measure of earnings, D will indicate placement into
employment through the Work First program, and Z will be an indicator of the contractor
assignment. As we are interested in the effects of different types of employment, we categorize
job placements as temporary-help (T ) jobs or direct-hire jobs (D).
    Specifically, our empirical conditional quantile models are of the form

(3)         Q (yicrt |x (τ ) ) = α (τ ) + β (τ )T Ti + β (τ )D Di
                            + Xi0 λ (τ ) + γ (τ )r + θ (τ )t + (γ (τ )r × θ (τ )t ) +  (τ )icrt

where the subscript i refers to participant, r to randomization district, c to contractor and t
to assignment year-quarter. The binary variables Ti and Di indicate whether the participant
obtained a temporary-help job or a direct-hire job, respectively. The vector of covariates
(X) includes gender, race, age, as well as the average quarterly UI earnings and the quarters
of employment during the eight quarters preceding the assignment. Finally, the model also
includes dummies for randomization districts (γ) and year by quarter of assignment (θ).
    To estimate the IVQR, valid instrumental variables are required. In our setting, ex-
ogenous variation in job placements is generated by the rotational placement of Work First
participants with contractors. The randomization of participants to contractors occurs within
districts during the specific program year. Importantly for the current purpose, there are sig-
nificant, persistent differences across contractors in their placement rates into temporary-help



                                                   11
and direct-hire jobs.11 This makes it possible to use the contractor assignment as instruments
for the two types of job placements.
    In principle, we could use contractor-by-year assignment dummies directly as instrumental
variables in the IVQR model. In practice, the computational burden imposed by using dozens
of instruments makes this approach infeasible. In place of these dummies, we generate two
continuous instrumental variables that capture each contractor’s average excess probability of
placement into temporary-help and direct-hire employment.12 Thus, to instrument for Ti and
Di in (3), we use the excess probabilities of placement into temporary-help and direct-hire
employment by contractor, P̂ctT and P̂ctD , estimated from linear probability models.
    For contractor assignments to serve as a valid instrumental variable for participant job
placement types, the estimated placement rates P̂ctT and P̂ctD must be independent of  (τ )icrt .
In practice, independence is almost guaranteed by random assignment. In addition, contrac-
tors’ placement rates of participants into temporary-help or direct-hire employment must be
independent of other contractor characteristics that might influence participant outcomes.
This assumption appears reasonable. It allows for the possibility that contractors influ-
ence participants’ post-program outcomes through mechanisms other than job placements
so long as these contractor effects are not systematically related to placement rates. Autor
and Houseman (2010) provide a detailed discussion of this important identifying assump-
tion as well as several falsification tests. Most relevantly, they demonstrate that there is no
statistically significant heterogeneity in contractor effects on participant earnings or employ-
ment that is not explained by contractor placement rates into temporary-help and direct-hire
jobs.13


                 IV.        Verifying the Research Design
    Prior to implementing the analysis, we perform two checks on the validity of the research
design. Since the objective of the IVQR analysis is to study the heterogeneous treatment
effects of job placements on Work First participants, it is important to check, first, that
the participants assigned to different treatments are ex ante comparable and, second, that
the treatments that these participants receive do not differ systematically with participants’
characteristics; if either condition is violated, we may confound heterogeneity in the treated

   11. Autor and Houseman (2010) provide a detailed discussion of the sources of these contractor differences
and their validity as instrumental variables for job placements.
   12. Specifically, we estimate a linear probability model for job placement type (temporary-help and direct-
hire), where the right hand side variables consist of the X’s used in the quantile regression while contractor-
by-year-dummies are absorbed. Residuals from this regression, calculated by contractor-year, form the excess
employment probabilities that we use as instruments in the IVQR estimation.
   13. Formally, this is is shown using an overidentification test.

                                                      12
populations or heterogeneity in the treatments administered with heterogeneity in the effects
of treatment, which is the empirical object of interest.
    These two potential threats to validity—non-comparability of treated participants and
non-comparability of treatments—both correspond to violations of assumption A2 (Indepen-
dence). In particular, A2 requires that conditional on the control variables, a participant’s
rank in the latent outcome distribution Ud is independent of the instruments. While this
independence assumption is formally untestable—since we do not observe latent ranks—we
can use as a rough proxy for participants’ earnings ranks their observed earnings in the eight
quarters prior to contractor assignment. Not surprisingly, past earnings is highly predictive
of future earnings: in an OLS regression of earnings in quarters 2 through 8 following con-
tractor assignment on 8-quarter prior earnings, year-by-quarter dummies, and contractor by
year-of-assignment dummies, the coefficient on prior earnings is 0.51 (SE = 0.006).
    To use prior earnings to assess the plausibility of the independence assumption, we divide
participants into three terciles based on prior earnings and then test whether contractor ef-
fects on placement rates differ systematically among participants drawn from different prior
earnings terciles assigned to the same contractor. Under the assumption that prior earnings
terciles are an informative proxy for latent earnings ranks, the independence assumption
implies that if, for instance, a contractor increases the average probability of placing partici-
pants into temporary-help jobs by 2 percentage points relative to other contractors operating
in the district, that contractor should likewise increase the probability by 2 percentage points
for all of its participants irrespective of their characteristics (in particular, earnings tercile).
    We implement this test using a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model. The intu-
ition of this procedure is readily described using a single equation regression model of the
form:
                                k
                              Dicdt = α + γd + ϕt + θdt + λct + ωicdt ,
         k
where Dicdt  is a dummy variable equal to one if participant i in prior earnings quartile k
assigned to contractor c serving assignment district d in year t received a direct-hire or
temporary-help placement during her assignment spell (with separate dichotomous variables
for each outcome).14 The vectors γ and ϕ contain a complete set of dummies indicating
randomization districts and year-by–contractor assignment, respectively, while the vector θ
contains all two-way interactions between district and year.
    Of interest in this equation is λ, a vector of contractor-by-year of assignment dummies,
with one contractor-by-year dummy dropped for each district-year pair. The p-value for the
hypothesis that the elements of λ are jointly equal to zero provides an omnibus test for the

   14. In reality, the SUR model involves a matrix of dependent variables and error terms. Expositionally, it
is sufficient to consider the single equation case.

                                                     13
null hypothesis that the contractor effects on placement rates into direct-hire or temporary-
help positions do not differ systematically among participants drawn from different prior
earnings terciles assigned to the same contractor. A low p-value corresponds to a rejection
of this null.
    Table 3 displays the results of this exercise. In most cases, we accept the hypothesis that
direct-hire and temporary-help placement probabilities do not differ systematically across
the terciles of prior earnings for participants assigned to the same contractor. However, there
are a total of 13 of 100 contractor-year cells for which we reject the equality of placement
rates across earnings terciles. Most of these cases correspond to contractors serving a smaller
number of participants, which may lead to the estimated heterogeneity in their placement
effects.15 We eliminate these cells from the analysis, which reduces the sample size by 6,639
observations, or roughly 17 percent. The final analytic sample consists of 30,522 observations.
With these problematic cells removed, these tests readily accept the null of equality with p-
values exceeding 0.75. We restrict our subsequent analysis to this sample, though we note
that our findings are essentially unaffected if we instead use the full sample.
    The second validity test we perform is a check on covariate balance among participants
assigned to contractors within each district and year. We apply the SUR model to test for
balance of the following covariates: sex, white race, other (nonwhite) race, age and its square,
average employment probability in the eight quarters before program entry, average employ-
ment probability with a temporary agency in these prior eight quarters, average quarterly
earnings in these prior eight quarters, and average quarterly earnings from temporary agen-
cies in the prior eight quarters. Following our approach above, we perform this test for the full
sample and separately by earnings tercile. If the assignment of participants to contractors is
balanced within district-years (as expected), these covariates should not systematically differ
across contractors within district-year cells, either overall or by prior earnings tercile (our
summary measure of potential earnings).
    As shown in Appendix Table 1, the data accept the null by a comfortable margin in all
cases, with p-values in excess of 0.50. It deserves emphasis that neither acceptance of the null
for equality of placement rates within contractor-year by prior-earnings tercile nor balance of
covariates by earnings tercile across contractor-years proves that the latent rank assumptions
of the Chernozhukov-Hansen model are satisfied or that the rotational assignment of partici-
pants effectively balances unobservable participant characteristics among contractors within

   15. Their elimination also required us to drop 7 additional contractor-year cells for which only one contractor
remained in a district-year. The median number of participants served by the 13 cells dropped due to rejection
of the homogeneity null is 235, as compared to 330 participants for those cells retained. The median number
of participants in the 7 additional cells that were dropped due to lack of a comparison contractor in the
district-year was 339

                                                       14
a district-year cell. Acceptance of these nulls is, however, supportive of the plausibility of
these assumptions.


      V.      Main Results: The Effect of Work First
              Placements on the Earnings Distribution
    This section presents estimates of the causal effect of Work First placements on the
distribution of participants’ quarterly earnings during 2 to 8 quarters following Work First
contractor assignment and contrasts estimates obtained from OLS, 2SLS, ordinary Quantile
Regression (QR), and IVQR models. We begin in Table 4 by estimating the relationship
between any job placement (temporary-help or direct-hire) during the Work First spell on
earnings. In Table 5, we consider the separate causal effects of temporary-help and direct-hire
placements. All models use the full sample of 30,522 spells and include a complete set of
year-by-quarter dummy variables, assignment district-by-year dummies, as well as controls
for age and its square, gender, white and Hispanic race, total UI earnings and total quarters
of employment in the eight quarters prior to Work First assignment, and temporary-help
earnings and quarters of temporary-help employment in the eight quarters prior to Work
First assignment. To facilitate interpretation, we re-center all control variables by subtracting
the mean for participants who did not obtain a job during their Work First spell. Thus, by
construction, the intercept in the OLS estimates equals the mean of the outcome variable for
Work First participants who were not placed into jobs.


V.A.       Earnings effects of any job placements
    The first panel of the Table 4 presents a descriptive OLS regression of equation (3). Par-
ticipants who obtain a job placement during their Work First spell earn on average $498
more per quarter over the seven subsequent quarters than participants who obtain no place-
ment. This point estimate corresponds to an earnings gain of more than 50 percent relative
to non-placed participants whose quarterly earnings average $935. The OLS model is likely
to provide an upward biased estimate of the causal effect of job placements since less than
half of all participants obtain employment during their Work First spell, and those who
do obtain employment have higher average prior earnings and labor force attachment than
those who do not. Using contractor assignments as instruments for job placements, the 2SLS
model in the second panel (B) of the table confirms this expectation. We estimate that job
placement raises subsequent quarterly earnings by $299, which is 40 percent smaller than the
OLS estimate, though still highly significant.

                                               15
    The OLS and 2SLS estimates describe the conditional mean effect of Work First place-
ments on participant outcomes but are not informative about the distributional impacts of
these placements. Panel C presents descriptive (QR) estimates analogous to the earlier OLS
estimates. The association between job placement during the Work First spell and post-
assignment earnings is significantly positive at all quantiles, ranging from $20 per quarter at
the 15th percentile to $953 per quarter at the 85th percentile. Notably, the point estimate and
intercept at the 50th percentile are considerably smaller than the OLS analogues, indicating
that the distribution of quarterly earnings outcome is significantly right-skewed.
    Like the OLS estimates above, these conventional QR models are unlikely to be informa-
tive about causal effects of job placements. Panel D reports causal effects estimates using
the IVQR model in which we instrument for participants’ job placements using the average
excess job placements probabilities of Work First contractors in the year in which the par-
ticipant entered the Work First program. The computation of the IVQR is conducted over
a parameter space centered on the 2SLS estimate.16
    Consistent with the above contrast between OLS and 2SLS estimates, the IVQR estimates
are uniformly smaller than the conventional quantile estimates and are insignificant in some
cases. The IVQR estimate for the effect of job placement at the 50th conditional quantile is
$209, as compared to $336 for the corresponding QR estimate. Figure 1 provides additional
detail on these results by plotting the estimated QR and IVQR relationships between job
placements and quarterly earnings at percentiles 10 through 90 (accompanied by 95 percent
confidence intervals). The causal effects of job placements on subsequent earnings are quite
heterogeneous. Below the 35th percentile, the estimated treatment effect is close to zero with
a relatively narrow confidence band. From the 35th to 60th percentile, this effect rises nearly
monotonically from approximately $100 to $250 per quarter. The estimated treatment effect
is fairly uniform above this level, though precision is greatly reduced at higher quantiles.
To formally test for the heterogeneity of treatment effects, we run a Wald test for the null
hypothesis of constant quantile treatment effects. The test compares the IVQR estimates for
quantiles 15 and 75 and finds that the constant treatment effects hypothesis can be rejected
at the 1 percent level (Panel D of Table 4).

   16. Estimation is performed in Matlab using software developed by Chernozhukov and Hansen and available
for download at http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/christian.hansen/research/. As noted above, we use a scalar
instrumental variable in the IVQR model (and two scalars in the models that distinguish temporary-help
from direct-hire placements) because estimating the IVQR models with 80 contractor-year dummy variables
proved computationally infeasible. Our two-step procedure for constructing the instruments using excess
placement residuals and using these residuals in the second stage produces numerically identical estimates to
conventional 2SLS models. For the IVQR models, we are able to make the direct comparison for a sub-sample
of three large districts. In this comparison, our two-step IVQR procedure produces point estimates that are
identical to the single step IVQR procedure and standard errors that are very slightly more conservative (i.e.,
larger). The results are reported in Appendix Table 2.

                                                      16
     The Chernozhukov-Hansen IVQR model relies on strong assumptions about the struc-
tural relationship between job placements and earnings. Most significantly, the IVQR model
assumes rank invariance, which in our application means that a participant whose contractor
assignment leads to a job placement and post-placement earnings at percentile p0 of the con-
ditional earnings distribution of placed workers counterfactually would have had earnings at
percentile p0 of the conditional distribution of non-placed workers had her contractor assign-
ment instead induced that outcome. Though Chernozhukov and Hansen explain that this
assumption can be weakened to rank similarity, meaning that the assignment mechanism
does not lead to systematic changes in ranks across treatment outcomes, it still rules out the
possibility of comparative advantage. If, for example,a different set of skills is rewarded in
temporary-help and direct-hire jobs, rank similarity would be violated.
     As a complement to the structural estimation approach, we also fit in Panel E a set of
‘reduced form’ QR models using a simple two-stage procedure. In the first stage, we calculate
average excess job placement rates by contractor year as in our models above. In stage two,
we estimate quantile regressions for conditional earnings quantiles at the individual partic-
ipant level using the excess contractor-year placement rate measure as our key explanatory
variable (along with standard covariates). These reduced form QR (RFQR) models make
no particular assumptions about the relationships among participant earnings ranks across
treatment conditions. Rather, in the spirit of standard QR models, they simply estimate
the effect of a treatment on the conditional quantiles of the outcome variable. In our ap-
plication, the treatment is the exogenous component of contractor placement rates which,
as established above, raises or lowers the odds of job placement roughly uniformly across
participants assigned to those contractors.
     Notably, the RFQR estimates prove quite similar to the IVQR estimates that are based
on stronger assumptions. At percentiles 15 through 75, the IVQR and RFQR point estimates
all fall within a few dollars of one another, though generally they are not point identical. The
comparability of the IVQR and RFQR estimates may be taken as evidence that either the
IVQR assumptions are likely to be satisfied or that the IVQR method in this application does
not recover an underlying structural relationship. Under either interpretation, these results
indicate that our findings are not highly dependent on the IVQR procedure.17




   17. It is likely that the standard errors reported for the RFQR models are biased downward since the RFQR
procedure is akin to estimating 2SLS in two steps without accounting for the fact that the explanatory variable
in the second stage is estimated rather than observed. A virtue of the IVQR procedure, by contrast, is that
under the identifying assumptions, it will produce asymptotically correct standard errors.

                                                      17
V.B.       Distinguishing between direct-hire and temporary-help place-
           ments
    Table 5 enriches the previous models to separately identify the distinct earnings impacts
of temporary-help and direct-hire placements. The benchmark OLS estimates in panel A
indicate that direct-hire jobs are associated with an increase in participants’ subsequent
quarterly earnings of $519 during quarters 2 to 8, while temporary-help placements are
associated with a $410 quarterly earnings gain. The 2SLS estimates confirm, as above, that
the OLS estimates are upward biased. Notably, the bias is far greater for temporary-help
placements. After accounting for endogeneity, the effect of direct-hire placements on quarterly
earnings remains significantly positive at $503 while the effect of temporary-help placements
is weakly negative (-$57) and insignificant. These OLS results are largely consistent with
the earlier empirical literature on temporary-help jobs, whereas those from the 2SLS stand
in contrast with the conventional wisdom regarding the assumed positive impacts of any job
placements on welfare recipients’ labor market outcomes.18
    We explore the impact of temporary-help and direct-hire placements on the distribution
of earnings in panels C and D. Conventional QR estimates (panel C) find that both direct-
hire and temporary-help placements are associated with higher subsequent earnings. At
the conditional median, a direct-hire placement is associated with $350 higher quarterly
earnings and a temporary-help placement with $269 higher quarterly earnings. Figure 2,
which plots the entire quantile process for the QR model, indicates that direct-hire placements
are associated with higher earnings than are temporary-help placements at essentially every
quantile, with the greatest differences at higher quantiles.
    Instrumental variables quantile estimates present a strikingly different picture of the
causal effect of job placements on quarterly earnings—though one that is consistent with
estimates from the 2SLS models. As with these models, only the direct-hire placements re-
tain their positive effect in the IVQR, while the estimates for temporary-help jobs become
negative. We estimate that direct-hire-placements have highly heterogeneous, though always
non-negative, effects that range from zero at the lowest quantiles to approximately $200 at
the median, to $1,026 at the 85th percentile. These quantile treatment effects are generally
significant at percentiles 50 to 85.
    By contrast, the estimates for temporary-help jobs start at zero and become negative at
higher quantiles. This indicates that conditional on pre-program earnings and other observ-
ables, participants who rank higher in the earnings distribution are helped more by direct-hire

   18. See e.g. Ferber and Waldfogel (1998), Lane et al. (2003), Corcoran and Chen (2004), Andersson et
al. (2005, 2007), and Heinrich et al. (2005 and 2007). These results of course are consistent with Autor-
Houseman (2010).

                                                   18
placements and harmed more by temporary-help placements than are those who rank lower in
the conditional earnings distribution. For temporary-help placements, we cannot distinguish
the IVQR estimate from zero for the lower quantiles, but we do see a significant negative
effect towards the top of the conditional earnings distribution. Figure 3, which displays the
entire quantile process for the IVQR estimates, indicates that temporary-help placements
do not appear to have positive impacts at any point in the quantile index, while the causal
effects estimates above the 80th percentile are significantly negative and large. A Wald test
comparing estimates at the 15th and 75th quantiles rejects the null of constant quantile treat-
ment effects at the 1 percent level for direct-hire placements and jointly for direct-hire and
temporary help placements. Although constant quantile treatment effects cannot be rejected
for temporary-help placements owing to imprecision in these coefficient estimates, the ef-
fects of direct-hire and temporary-help placements on participant earnings are significantly
different from one another at the 50th and higher quintiles (Table 5, panel D).
    On net, these estimates reveal that the modest overall causal effects of job placements
on participant earnings throughout the conditional earnings distribution (Table 4) mask
two countervailing effects: relatively large direct-hire placement effects—ranging from $250
to $1,000 per quarter over the 50th through 85th percentiles of the conditional earnings
distribution—and imprecisely estimated but nevertheless large and negative effects of temporary-
help placements on the conditional earnings distribution in higher quantiles. Under the
maintained assumption of rank invariance, these estimates imply that participants with the
highest potential earnings in direct-hire employment are those who suffer the greatest earn-
ings losses from temporary-help placements. One plausible interpretation of this result is
that temporary-help placements crowd out the earnings that these (relatively) high earn-
ings potential workers would have received if they had not received a placement; that is,
temporary-help placements for these workers are worse than no placement at all because
they inhibit them from obtaining better positions on their own.
    As a reality check on these estimates, panel E presents ’reduced form’ QR models analo-
gous to those above, estimated using a standard QR regression with contractor excess place-
ments into direct-hire and temporary-help jobs as the main explanatory variables. The co-
efficient estimates from the RFQR models are point identical with the corresponding IVQR
models for quantiles 25 through 85 and differ only slightly from the IVQR estimates for lower
quantiles.
    The comparability of the RFQR and IVQR models both provides reassurance on the
robustness of our results and suggests caution in their interpretation. On the positive side,
the estimates are clearly not sensitive to the estimation procedure (IVQR versus our simple
reduced form model). On the negative side, the reduced form QR estimator is clearly only


                                             19
a model for the causal effect of treatment on the conditional distribution of earnings and
makes no claim to identify the person-level causal effect of temporary-help or direct-hire job
placement relative to an alternative placement.19 The fact that RFQR yields near-identical
results to the IVQR model raises some doubt as to whether the IVQR model is actually
recovering the joint distribution of latent outcomes for participants at each location in the
quantile index or whether it is merely estimating the causal effect of treatment on the con-
ditional distribution of wages. Under this latter hypothesis, we would offer a somewhat
weaker interpretation of the findings in Table 5: while we are justified in concluding that
direct-hire placements have heterogeneous but uniformly positive impacts on earnings and,
conversely, that temporary-help placements have heterogeneous but uniformly negative im-
pacts on earnings, we cannot necessarily infer that the participants who most benefit from
direct-hire placements are those who are most harmed by temporary-help placements and
vice versa.
     One subtlety in interpreting these results lies in the relationship between conditional and
unconditional quantiles. Because our main estimates condition on a rich set of covariates,
it’s not immediately apparent how the estimated causal effects of temporary-help and direct-
hire placements on the conditional distribution of earnings correspond to their effects on the
overall (unconditional) distribution of earnings.20 To illuminate these relationships, we re-
estimate the IVQR without any person-level covariates. While these covariates serve a useful
purpose in the main models—improving the precision of the estimates and increasing the
plausibility of the rank invariance assumption—they complicate interpretation.21 Alternative
estimates that exclude person level covariates are reported in Appendix Table 3, with a
detailed depiction of the quantile process shown in Figure 4. While the exclusion of covariates
modestly affects the shape of the treatment effect distribution and the magnitude of standard
errors, the overall pattern of the quantile treatment effects is quite similar to the earlier models
containing rich covariates: direct-hire placements have no effect at lower quantiles and large
and often significant positive effects at higher conditional earnings quantiles; temporary-help
placements negatively affect quarterly earnings for those in higher quantiles, though these
estimates excluding covariates are not statistically significant. In net, these estimates support
the interpretation given to the earlier results.

   19. Because the IVQR model assumes rank invariance, the implied person-level treatment effect is simply
the difference in the causal effects of different treatments at each location in the quantile index.
   20. Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2009) propose a useful technique for estimating the effect of covariates on
unconditional outcome quantiles. We are not aware of an instrumental variables analogue of this technique,
however.
   21. Chernozhukov and Hansen (2006) emphasize this point stating that “the rank variable U ... is made

V.C.       The Dynamics of Job Placements: Earnings by Sector and
           by Longest Job Spell
    Why do direct-hire placements raise subsequent earnings while temporary-help placements
fail to do so? The next two analyses suggest two complementary answers. One is that
temporary-help placements do not appear to serve as a stepping stone into direct-hire jobs—
nor do placements into direct-hire jobs subsequently promote temporary-help employment.
Thus, placements in direct-hire and temporary-help jobs primarily affect earnings in the
sectors into which workers are placed, and moreover may crowd out earnings in the alternative
sector. Second and quite logically, direct-hire placements appear to yield longer and higher-
paying job spells than do temporary-help placements. Putting these facts together implies
that direct-hire placements raise earnings because these placements are relatively durable or
lead to other, durable direct-hire jobs. Conversely, temporary-help placements do not increase
and may lower earnings because these placements end rapidly and do not typically yield
subsequent, more durable direct-hire employment. We next explore these points formally.
    Table 6 re-estimates the 2SLS and IVQR models separately for earnings in direct-hire
and temporary-help employment during post-placement quarters 2 to 8. If placed in any
job during the Work First spell, the median participant (i.e. a participant in the 50th quan-
tile of the conditional earnings distribution) increases her subsequent quarterly direct-hire
earnings by $237, with no effect on her subsequent temporary-help earnings. Conversely,
participants placed in temporary-help jobs see a small and not significant $37 increase in
direct-hire earnings at the median, and no increase in temporary-help earnings. At higher
quantiles, we see larger positive effects of direct-hire and temporary-help placements on earn-
ings in those job types. Simultaneously, crowd-out is also larger at higher quantiles: at high
values of the quantile index, participants placed in direct-hire jobs gain the most from those
placements and forgo the largest earnings in temporary-help jobs and vice versa. However,
because the own-sector placement effects are more consistently large and positive for direct-
hire placements, the net effects of direct-hire placements are generally positive while those for
temporary-help placements are generally negative. Although Wald tests fail to reject the null
hypothesis of constant treatment effects for direct-hire and temporary-help earnings, they do
reject the equality of the direct-hire and temporary-help placement effects at the 50th and
75th quantiles.
    The final set of tables and figures (Table 7 and Figure 5) re-estimate the models for
total wage earnings during the longest post-placement job spell.22 The results are largely

   22. The longest job spell does not necessarily correspond to the Work First placement job. As noted above,
information on job placements comes from Work First administrative data while information on employment
during the two-year follow-up period comes from state UI wage records. In general we cannot tell whether a

                                                     21
consistent with those discussed above: the estimates in panel B showing separate effects
for direct-hire and temporary-help placements exhibit considerable heterogeneity across the
conditional earnings distribution. The estimated earnings increases resulting from direct-hire
placements in the IVQR range from $4 to $930 (at the 15th and 85th percentiles respectively)
and vary between –$1 and –$609 for temporary-help placements over the same quantile
range. During the longest post-placement job spell, direct-hire placements create significant
positive earnings effects that increase with the conditional earnings quantile. Temporary-help
placements are not associated with such positive effects, but may in fact significantly reduce
longest-job earnings at the higher tail of the conditional earnings distribution. Wald tests
confirm the heterogeneity of estimated treatment effects for temporary-help placements and
jointly for temporary-help and direct-hire placements.
    Finally, when comparing the IVQR results from quantile to quantile, it is clear that the
patterns are not always monotone, but instead exhibit some occasional peaks and troughs.
We believe that these local dips are not necessarily indicative of actual drastic changes
in the treatment effect, but rather a result from the lack of support for the instrument
at these locations.23 Chernozhukov et al. (2009) show that it is possible to re-order the
quantiles (point estimates and standard errors) to satisfy the monotonicity requirements, and
thereby improve upon the original estimates. We do not apply this rearrangement procedure
here because the departures from monotonicity are modest in our application and hence the
rearrangement makes little substantive difference.24


                                      VI.        Conclusions
    This paper applies the instrumental variable quantile regression estimator developed by
Chernozhukov and Hansen (2004a, 2005, 2006) to job placement and earnings data from
Detroit’s Work First program, which was previously used by Autor and Houseman (2010) to
study the effects of welfare-to-work job placements on subsequent post-placement earnings.
We use the rotational assignment of participants to contractors as instruments for direct-
hire and temporary-help job placements, which allows us to estimate the causal effects of
placements on the distribution of participants’ post-program earnings. The quantile treat-
ment effects provide a more nuanced depiction of the effect of welfare-to-work job placements
on program participants’ long-term labor market outcomes than is feasible using OLS and

job held in the follow-up period is the same as the job obtained through the Work First program.
  23. Plots of the concentrated objective function over the coefficients of the endogenous variables support this
conclusion. There appears to be little density around certain locations, making the parameter identification
weaker in those areas.
  24. Plots using the rearrangement procedure are available from the authors.

IV methods, which estimate conditional mean effects. In this paper, we are able to esti-
mate the effects of direct-hire and temporary-help placements over the entire distribution of
participants earnings.
    We document that the effects of job placements on labor market outcomes are quite het-
erogeneous for both direct-hire and temporary-help placements. Moreover, the treatment
effects of direct-hire and temporary-help placements differ qualitatively and quantitatively
from one another. Direct-hire placements are estimated to significantly increase subsequent
earnings over one to two years for half or more of all placed participants. By contrast,
temporary-help placements have uniformly zero or negative effects on the earnings distribu-
tion, and these effects are large and significant at high quantiles. Even at the top of the
earnings distribution the positive effects generated by the Work First program are only man-
ifested in direct-hire earnings and total wage earnings but not in temporary-help earnings.
Unusual among quantile instrumental variables analyses, our setting provides sufficient power
to statistically reject the hypothesis that the heterogeneity in direct-hire treatment effects
we detect arises by chance; the treatment effects differentials between the top and bottom
quartiles of the effects distribution for this group are both economically and statistically
significant.
    Substantively, these results highlight that the widespread use of temporary-help agencies
by public programs may not be an effective strategy for improving earnings in this dis-
advantaged population. Perhaps more fundamentally, they underscore the possibility that
interventions focused solely on job placement may do little to raise the earnings of those in
the lower end of the conditional earnings distribution.
    Methodologically, a surprising result of our analysis is that a reduced-form quantile IV
approach, akin to two-step instrumental variables, produces near-identical point estimates to
the structural IVQR approach, which is based on much stronger assumptions. Reassuringly,
the comparability of these estimates indicates that our substantive results are not sensitive
to the estimation procedure. Nevertheless, we believe these results cast some doubt on
whether the IVQR model in our application is actually recovering the joint distribution of
latent outcomes for participants at each location in the quantile index or whether it is merely
estimating the causal effect of treatment on the marginal distribution of wages. Under
either interpretation, our estimates indicate that direct-hire placements have heterogeneous
but uniformly positive impacts on earnings and, conversely, that temporary-help placements
have heterogeneous but uniformly negative impacts on earnings. Given this methodological
uncertainty, however, we are hesitant to conclude that the participants who most benefit
from direct-hire placements are those who are most harmed by temporary-help placements
and vice versa (as would be implied by the IVQR model). Rather, we reach a more agnostic


                                              23
conclusion, which is that the distribution of outcomes induced by direct-hire placements first
order stochastically dominates the corresponding distribution induced by temporary-help
placements.

Sample: All Work First spells initiated from the fourth quarter of 1999 through the first
quarter of 2004 in 12 Work First randomization districts in Detroit, Michigan. Participants
may have multiple spells in the data. Data source is administrative records data from Work
First programs linked to quarterly earnings from Michigan unemployment insurance wage
records. Job placement outcomes are coded using Detroit administrative records.
Temporary-help versus direct-hire employers are identified using unemployment insurance
records industry codes.
