 I. Introduction

      Different models of political cycles emphasize either the "opportunistic"

 or the "partisan" incentives of policymakers. In "opportunistic" models, the

policymakers maximize their popularity or their probability of reelection. In

 "partisan" models different political parties represent the interests of

different constituencies and, when in office, follow policies which are

favorable to their supporting groups; specifically, the left wing    parties are

more concerned with the problem of unemployment, while the right wing parties

are relatively more willing to bear the costs of unemployment to reduce

inflation.

     This literature has developed in two clearly distinct phases. The first

one, in the mid—seventies, is due to the influential work by Nordhaus (1975),

and Lindbeck (1976) on "opportunistic" cycles and by Hibbs (1977)    on

"partisan" cycles. These papers share a "pre—rational expectations" model of

the economy and are based upon an exploitable "Phillips curve". The "political

business cycle" model of Nordhaus predicts pre—electoral fast growth and low

unemployment; raising inflation around the election time and a post—electoral

recession, regardless of the political orientation of the incumbent. Hibbs'

partisan model implies systematic and permanent differences in the

inflation/unemployment combination chosen by different political parties.

     Macroeconomists soon lost interest in this subject, because at that time

the profession was developing (or fighting against), the "rational

expectations revolution. "

    The second phase took off in the mid—eighties as a branch of the game—

theoretic approach to the positive theory of policy. Cukierman and Meltzer

(1986), Rogoff and Sibert (1988), Rogoff (1990), and Persson and Tabellini

(1990) propose rational "opportunistic" models; Alesina (1987) develops a
                                          2


rational partisan approach. These models depart from their predecessors in

two important dimensions. First, the assumption of economic agents'

rationality makes real economic activity less directly and predictably

influenced by monetary policy. Second, voters' rationality implies that they

cannot be systematically "fooled" in equilibrium.

     This second generation of models has empirical implications which are

quite different from those of the earlier literature: the assumption of

rationality reduces the extent and the likelihood of regular political cycles,

although it does not eliminate them. For example, in models with rational

economic agents and voters, Nordhaus' type cycles are mitigated. Rather than

regular multi—year cycles on output and unemployment, one should observe,

according for instance to Rogoff and Sibert (1988), short—lived electoral

cycles on monetary and fiscal policy instruments, but not necessarily on

economic activity outcomes. Alesina (1987, l988b) shows that in a partisan

model with nominal wage contracts and rational voters, permanently different

inflation rates across parties may result only in temporary, post—election

differences in output and unemployment.

     Finally, Ito (l990a,b) and Terrones (1989) study political business

cycles with endogenous timing of elections, an institutional setting which is

very common in parliamentary democracies.

     This paper addresses two questions. First, whether or not the dynamic

behavior of GNP growth, unemployment and inflation is systematically affected

by the timing of elections and of changes of governments. Second, whether or

not the second generation of rational models has provided useful insights to

interpret the evidence. The paper suggests an affirmative answer to both

these questions by examining 18 OECD democracies, in the last three decades.
                                       3

     Our results can be summarized as follows: a) The "political business

cycle" hypothesis, as formulated in Nordhaus on output and unemployment is

generally rejected by the data. (Some favorable evidence can be found in only

two countries.) In every country, with the exception of Japan, we also reject

the extension of the "political business cycle" model, with endogenous timing

of elections; b) inflation tends to increase immediately after elections,

perhaps as a result of pre—electoral expansionary monetary and fiscal

policies; if confirmed by direct evidence on policy instruments, this result

yields support to the Rogoff and Sibert (1988) and Rogoff (1990) model of

"political budget cycles"; (c) we find evidence of temporary partisan

differences in output and unemployment and of long—run partisan differences in

the inflation rate as implied by the "rational partisan theory" of Alesina

(1987). This pattern appears rather unambiguously in countries with a pure

two—party system, or with clearly identifiable "right" and "left" coalitions;

(d) we find virtually no evidence of permanent partisan differences in output

and unemployment. Indirectly, results (c) and (d) yield some support to the

positive model of inflation developed by Kydland—Prescott (1977) and Barro and

Gordon (l983a,b).

     The qualitative features of these results are consistent with the finding

on the United States by Alesina and Sachs (1988), Alesina (l988a) and Chapell

and Keech (1988). The advantage of a multi—country study is that, of course,

one has many more degrees of freedom. Elections and changes of governments

are relatively infrequent events. Thus, the researcher is left with very few

observations and only one country is considered. This is why systematic

multi—country studies are particularly useful in this area.
                                                   4

     The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we highlight the

empirical implications of several models of political cycles. Since several

comprehensive reviews of the literature have recently appeared (Alesina

(1988a), Nordhaus (1989), Persson and Tabellini (1990)) we sketch the various

models very succinctly. In Section 3 we present regressions on a panel data

set of all the countries in the sample. Section 4 discusses the results of

country by country regressions. Section 5 checks the robustness of our

results by employing Hamilton's (1989) method of timing recessions and

expansions. Section 6 considers the issue of endogenous timing of elections.

The last section concludes.



2. Models of Politico—Economic Cycles

2.1 The "Political Business Cycle" (Nordhaus (1975))

     The assumptions underlying Nordhaus' "political business cycle"

(henceforth PEC) can be characterized as follows:

     A.l) The economy is described by a Phillips curve:

             —
                 ay1   + y(ir —
                                      ir)   ÷          0 <   a   < 1;   > 0.          (1)


where y is output growth; iv is inflation; ,e is expected inflation; £ is a

random shock with zero mean; a, 7           are   parameters.2 The autoregressive term in

(1) captures various sources of persistence. The "natural" steady state level

of growth is normalized at zero, with no loss of generality.

    A.2) Inflation expectations are adaptive:

             —
                 'Tt—l + A(,re1
                                  —
                                      ic1).        0 < A< 1                           (2)


    A.3) Inflation is directly controlled by the policymakers.3
                                             5


     A.4) Politicians are "opportunistic": they only care about holding

office, and they do not have "partisan" objectives.

     A.5) Voters are "retrospective." They judge the incumbent's performance

based upon output growth and inflation during the incumbents' term of office,

and heavily discount past observations.

     A.6) The timing of elections is exogenously fixed.

     Under these assumptions, Nordhaus derives the following testable

implications: (i) every government follows the same policy; (ii) towards the

end of his term of office, the incumbent stimulates the economy to take

advantage of the "short rum" more favorable Phillips curve; (iii) the rate of

inflation increases around the election time as a result of the pre—electoral

economic expansion; after the election, inflation is reduced with

contractionary policies A

     This basic model has recently been developed in two directions: first
by investigating the role of rationality and second the role of endogenous

timing of the elections. These two extensions are illustrated below.



2.2 Rational Political Business Cycle Models

     Persson and Tabellini (1990) propose a simple model which summarizes the

basic insights of this approach, due to Rogoff and Sibert (1988). Assumptions

A.l, A.3, A.4, and A.6 as in Nordhaus are retained. Assumption A.2 is

replaced by:

    A.2')      ,1e —
                       E(lrt/I     :   rational expectations

    A.2' ')            includes all the relevant information except the level of

"competence" of different policymakers.
                                          6


      Assumption A.5 is substituted by:

      A.5') Voters choose the candidate which is rationally expected to deliver

 the highest utility, if elected.

      A.5'') There are no differences in voters' utility functions.

      E(.) is the expectation operator and 'tl is the information set of the

 voters at time (t—l) when expectations are formed. A.2'') implies an

 asymmetry of information between the policymakers and the voters: the former

know their own competence, but the latter do not.5   Policymakers' "competence"
is defined as their ability of keeping unemployment low with   a relatively low
level of inflation.6

     By taking advantage of this informational asymmetry, and by trying to

appear as competent as possible before elections, politicians behave in a way

leading to a Nordhaus' type PBC. However, given voters' rationality and

awareness of politicians' incentives, the latter are limited in their

"opportunistic" behavior. Thus, the resulting cycles are more short lived and

less regular than in Nordhaus' model.

     The original proponents of the "competence" model, i.e. Rogoff and Sibert

(1988) and Rogoff (1990), consider a budget problem, rather than an

inflation/unemployment trade—off, but with identical assumptions about the

distribution of information. These papers have empirical implications on

opportunistic cycles on monetary and fiscal variables, rather than on

unemployment and output. In fact, the model by Rogoff and Sibert (1988) has

implications on the inflation rate similar to those of Nordhaus'   model, but
does not imply any correlation between elections and output or unemployment.
                                       7


2.3 Endogenous Elections

     Ito (1990a,b) and Terrones (1989) remove assumption A.6: the latter

extends Rogoff's (1990) model, while Ito (l990a,b) presents a simpler model in

which while the policymakers are strategic in choosing the timing of

elections, the voters follow rules of thumb in their voting behavior, That

is, Ito maintains A.5, while Terrones adopts A.5' and A.5''. These papers

suggest that early elections are called to capitalize on good economic

conditions. Thus, the better the state of the economy, the sooner elections

are called.

     Using Ito's simple and very insightful framework, suppose that the

government has no control on real economic activity and that voters' behavior

is described by A.5. Then, if high growth occurs soon after an election, the

incumbent may choose to call another election; if, instead, growth is low, he

waits: he has a good chance of capitalizing on a high growth period by

calling an election later in his term of office. However, as time elapses

from the previous election, the date at which an election has to be called

according to the law approaches. Then, even an average level of growth may

trigger an election; this is because the incumbent wants to avoid the risk of

reaching the last period with low growth. Thus, the probability that an

election is called should be an increasing function of the time elapsed from

the previous election and of the state of the economy.

2.4 The "Partisan Theory"; Hibbs (1977), (1987)

     A strong version of the "partisan theory" (henceforth PT) based upon a

non—rational expectation mechanism, adopts assumptions A.l, A.2, A.3 and A.6.

Assumptions A.4 and A.5 are substituted by:
                                            8

      A.4') Politicians are "partisan," in the sense that different parties

 maximize different objective functions. Left wing parties attribute a higher

 cost to unemployment relative to inflation than right wing parties.

     A.5''') Each voter is aware of the partisan difference and votes for the

 party which offers the most preferred policy.

     The assumption of partisanship is justified by the distributional

consequences of unemployment. In periods of high (low) unemployment, low

 (high) growth and low inflation the relative share of income of the upper

middle class, increases (decreases). On this point, see Hibbs (1987).

     Not surprisingly, this model implies that different parties choose

different points on the Phillips curve: output growth and inflation should be

permanently higher and unemployment permanently lower when the left is in

office than with right wing governments.7



2.5 "Rational Partisan Theory" (Alesina (1987))

     Alesina (1987) and (1988b) suggest a "rational partisan theory"

(henceforth RPT). This model adopts assumption A.l, A.2', A.3, A.4', A.5'''

and A.6. The objective functions of the two parties can be written as:


          Wi —             —          —          —          0
                 _o            ciJ2       bL{y       KiJ]       1;            (3)


where i — L,R identifies the "left" and the "right" parties. The difference

between the two parties can be summarized by at least one of these three sets

of inequalities:


          cL>cRo; bL>bRO; KL>KRO                                              (4)
                                          9

The last double inequality implies the time—inconsistency problem in monetary

policy pointed out by Kydland—Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (l983a,b).

Since at least one of the two parties targets a level of output growth which

is above the natural rate (normalized at zero), it introduces an "inflation

bias" because of the lack of precommitments in monetary policy. Thus, a test

of the RPT is indirectly a test for this specification of policymakers'

obj ective functions.

     This model generates a political cycle if we assume that uncontingent

labor contracts are signed at discrete intervals (which do not coincide with

the political terms of office) and that electoral outcomes are uncertain

because of shocks to voters' preferences or to voters' participation rates in

elections. The basic idea of the model is that, given the sluggishness in

wage adjustments, changes in the inflation rate associated with changes in

government create temporary deviations of real economic activity from its

natural level.

     More specifically, the following testable implications can be derived

from the model:   (i) at the beginning of a right wing (left wing) government

output growth is below (above) its natural level and unemployment is above

(below); (ii) after expectations, prices and wages adjust, output and

unemployment return to their natural level; after this adjustment period, the

level of economic activity should be independent of the party in office;

(iii) the rate of inflation should remain higher throughout the term of a left

wing government; note that this occurs even if cL — cR in (3), as long as

KL > KR or bL > bR.     That is, the time consistent (but sub—optimal) inflation

rate remains higher for left wing parties even after the level of economic

activity returns to its natural level.

2.6 Previous Empirical Results

     Most of the empirical studies on political cycles use post—war United

States data. The evidence in favor of the RPT is relatively strong; evidence

of "opportunistic" PEG is found for certain policy instruments (particularly

government transfers) for limited sub—samples: for recent surveys of this

empirical literature see Alesina (1988a) and Nordhaus (1989).

     Multi—country studies are more scarce. Alt (1985) is the first one to

formally test for partisan patterns in unemployment in twelve OECD democracies

and finds evidence quite consistent with this approach. Paldam (1979) finds

very weak evidence (if any at all) of Nordhaus' political business cycle on

output and unemployment using a sample of seventeen OEGD countries. The same

author (l989a,b) finds stronger evidence of partisan effects using annual

data. Alesina (1989) provides some qualitative tests with annual data using

the same sample of countries; his results suggest that the RPT is broadly

consistent with the evidence while the same paper does not find clear evidence

of PEG on growth and unemployment. Alvarez, Garrett and Lange (1989)    suggest
that the degree of success of "partisan policies" may depend upon the

characteristics of labor market institutions and of unions' behavior. On the

contrary, Sheffrin (1989) finds inconclusive results for the RPT. However,

Sheffrin's definition of TMunexpected change" of governments is questionable.

That paper disregards the fact that in several countries the same   party or

coalition was elected repeatedly with no electoral uncertainty. (See Alesina

(1990)).

     The contribution of the present paper is that, unlike its predecessors,

it considers all the different theories, including models with endogenous

elections, in a unified framework. Furthermore, unlike the recent work by
                                         11

Alesina and Paldam, we use quarterly data rather than annual data and make use

of different and more robust statistical tests. The use of quarterly data is

quite important since the precise timing of cyclical fluctuations in relation

to elections and changes in political regime is crucial for the theories.



3.   Panel Regressions

3.1 Data

     We consider all the OECD countries which have been democracies in the

sample period considered, which is 1960 to 1987. The extent of the sample is

limited by availability of quarterly data; in fact, for some countries not all

the series are available even for this period. The countries included are:

Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Cermany, Japan,

Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland,

United Kingdom, and the United States.

     The economic data are quarterly observations on inflation, output growth,

and unemployment. Inflation is defined as the yearly rate of change of the

CPI from IMF, IFS. Output growth is obtained as the rate of change of real

CNP (or CDP), also from IMF, IFS. For unemployment, we use the total

standardized unemployment rate from OECD. More details on country specific

data issues can be found in Table A—l in Appendix. The political data are

election dates, the dates of changes of governments, and the political

orientation of various governments. This information is summarized in Table

A—2. Dates of regime changes and elections do not always coincide in

parliamentary systems in which changes of coalitions take place not only after

elections. Sources for these political data are Alt (1985) and Banks (1987).

The identification of changes of political orientation of governments is
                                        12

usually unambiguous. Whenever ambiguities occurred in the case of large

coalition governments, we followed Alt's and Ranks' conventions. It should be

noted the countries for which positive results for the partisan theory are

found, are those in which there are no ambiguities about the classification of

government political orientation.



3.2 Specification of Empirical Tests

     The most direct way of testing the various theories is to run the

following panel regressions of time—series cross—section data, for instance on

output growth:

             —
                 a0
                      +    +
                               a2y2   ...
                                             ay   +
                                                      °n+l PDUM +             (5)

yt is the stacked vector of time—series data on output growth for the

countries in the sample and PDUM is a political dummy which captures the

implications of the different theories. The autoregressive specification for

the dependent variable is chosen as the "best" using standard techniques.

Similar regressions have been performed by McCallum (1978), Hibbs (1987),

Alesina and Sachs (1988) and Alesina (1988a) on U.S. data. These tests are

based upon the assumption that output growth and unemployment are generated by

a covariance—stationary stochastic process that can be expressed in

autoregressive form as in (5).

     Since the sample includes open economies (most of which are "small"),    we

must control for the effect of the world economy on domestic economies, for

two reasons. First, the "partisan" or opportunistic goals of the politicians

are likely to be defined, in small open economies, in relation to the rest of

the world. Second, regardless of the governments' goals, international trade
                                          13

and financial linkages make OECD economies highly interdependent.

     We have followed two approaches to capture these effects. The first one

is to redefine each country's variable as a difference between the actual

variable and a proxy for the OECD average of the same variable. The second

one is to add as a regressor in eq. (5) a proxy for a world or OECD average.

Our results concerning the relative performance of various political models

are insensitive to the procedure used. As an indicator of an OECD average of

each economic variable we consider the average of the seven largest economies

in our sample, which are the USA, Japan, Germany, France, the lix, Italy, and

Canada, weighted by each country's share of GNP over the total.8

     In the remainder of this section we present results of panel regressions

on the different political theories of the business cycle. We make use of a

fixed effect model with constant slopes. By doing so we take into account

differences in long—term growth rates, unemployment, and inflation across

countries but we assume that the other parameters of the model are constant

and equal across countries.9



3.3 The "Rational Partisan Theory" (RPT)

     The political dummy used is:


                                         in the N quarters starting with that of
                      +1
                                         a change of government toward the right

                                         a change of government toward the left

We tested the cases of N —    4,6,8.   This choice of number of quarters is

consistent with a wage contract model in which contracts have an average

length of 1 or 2 years.
                                        14

      Note that the variable DRPTN assumes values different from zero only

 following actual changes of governments, but not after every election if the

 same government is reappointed. According to the RPT theory, inflation

 surprises and thus output fluctuations may occur even if an incumbent is

 reappointed unexpectedly (Alesina, 1987). However, for long periods of time

 in many countries in the sample certain parties repeatedly won elections with

 virtually no political uncertainty. Furthermore, in countries with endogenous

 timing of elections, which are the large majority of the sample (see Table A—

 2), in every period there is at least "some" probability that   an election is
 called and that a change of government may occur.-0 In addition, in

parliamentary systems sometimes government changes occur in the middle of a

term, with no elections. Rather than trying to estimate the degree of

political uncertainty in every period, which would be rather difficult if not

impossible, we have chosen to estimate a somewhat weaker form of RPT, testing

for temporary effects on real variables after actual chanees of governments.

An additional reason for doing so, is that several macroeconomic models in the

"neo—Keynesian" tradition, imply that not only unexpected, but also expected

aggregate demand policy may have some real effects. Thus, according to these

approaches, stronger effects should found after actual changes of governments,

with actual changes of policies, relative to the case of reappointment of the

same government.

in quarter t. •The regressors are self explanatory: yW is the world growth

average (described above); the AR(2) specification has been chosen as the

"best" using standard techniques; the remaining regressors are country

dummies.

     The political dummy DRPT6 has the correct sign and is statistically

significant at the 1 percent confidence level: a change in government to the

right (left) leads to a transitory fall (increase) in output growth. The one

quarter lag in the political dummy is consistent with a reasonable interval

between change of regime (in quarter t) and change of policy (in period t+l).

The regressions with DRPT 4 and DRPT 8 (available upon request) yield

analogous results: the pattern of the coefficients suggests that partisan

effects are observable from about the second to the eighth/ninth quarters

after the election. These results are consistent with findings on United

States data by Alesina and Sachs (1988) and Alesina (1988a).12

     In column 2 of the same table we present the result of the same

regression for a subset of countries which have either a "pure" two—party

system or at least more clearly identifiable "left" and "right" coalitions.

These are US, UK, France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, and Canada.

The other countries in the sample have more fragmented political systems with

govertiments formed with large coalitions of parties (often center—left) which

sometimes are short lived and unstable. For obvious reasons, the second group

of countries is less likely to exhibit regular partisan cycles. In the second

regression, in fact, the coefficients on the political dummy are much larger

in absolute value and even more precisely estimated.
                                       16

      The values of the coefficients in the second column of Table 1 imply that

 about eighteen months after a change of regime toward the right (left) the

rate of growth of CNP is about 1.3 percent below (above) "normal". Thus, the

difference in the rate of growth between the beginning of a left wing

government and the beginning of a right wing government reaches a peak of
about 2.6 percent.

     In Table 2 the dependent variable is the difference (U1') between the

domestic unemployment rate, (Ut) and the "OECD unemployment rate," UW,

defined analogously to the average GNP growth. In evaluating results on

employment one has to be cautious because of problems of hysteresis (see

Blanchard and Summers, 1986). By taking the difference of domestic

unemployment from a world weighted average, unit roots problems are somewhat

mitigated, but certainly not eliminated. Table 2 shows results which are

quite consistent with those on GNP growth. The political dummy is significant

at the 1 percent level and the fit improves when the sample is restricted to

seven bi—partisan countries (note that New Zealand is missing from these

regressions because of lack of quarterly unemployment data). The dummy DRPT6

is lagged two quarters to capture the slow response of unemployment to policy

changes relative to output. In any case, analogous results (available     upon
request) are obtained if this variable is lagged only one quarter or when

DRPT4 and DRPT8 are used. The values of the coefficients in the second column

of Table 2 imply that about six quarters after a change of regime toward the

right (left) the unemployment rate is about 1.5 percentage points above

(below) normal)-3

       Let us now turn to inflation. The theory implies that one should observe

permanent differences across governments on the inflation rate. Thus, we have

defined a political dummy, RADM, as follows:


                           ÷1       if a right wing government is in office, includ-
                                    ing the quarter of the change of government
            RADM —
                           —1       if a left wing government is in office includ-
                                    ing the quarter of the change of government,


In Table 3 the dependent variable is domestic inflation (it)      defined   as the
                                    cpIt —cPI
rate   of change of CPI:        —              100 . The variable for world
                                      t—4
inflation (,iM) is defined analogously to the world output growth. 14

       In the first regression, which includes the entire sample of countries,

the sign of the coefficient on RADM(—1) is correct and it is marginally

insignificant at the 10 percent level Ct — —1.55).       The second regression

includes only the eight "bi—partisan" countries: here the coefficient on

RADM(—l) is larger and significant at the 5 percent level.

       The value of the coefficients in the second regressions imply a

difference in the steady state inflation rate between the two regimes of about

1.4 percent. This relatively low value reflects the fact that our sample

includes the sixties, with a low and stable inflation and countries, such as

Germany, with a low inflation rate throughout the sample period. We have run

the same regressions of Table 3 for the post—fixed exchange rates regimes,

from 1972.1 to 1987.4. In these regressions (available upon request) the

coefficient on the RADM dummy is more precisely estimated and implies (in the

sample of 8 "bi—partisan" countries) a difference in the inflation rate across

political regimes of about 2.5 percent.

       In fact, we have tested whether all the regressions of Tables 1, 2 and 3

  improve in the post 1971 period, since in the fixed
                                                        exchange rate period
  (1960—71 in our sample) the macroeconomic policies of each countries were more

 constrained and integrated. All the t—statistics on the political dummies

 improve and the value of the coefficients increase in absolute value in the

 post 1971 regressions, which are available. However, the problem in pursuing

 this comparison, pre and post—1971, is that there are very few changes of

 regimes in this period (see Table A—i); in many countries there are
                                                                       changes
 of regimes in the sixties. Thus, the political dummies pre—1971 regression

 would be very imprecisely estimated and hard to compare with the post—1971

 sample.

      In summary, these results are favorable to the RPT. The implication of

 this hypothesis is not rejected on both the level of economic activity (growth

 and unemployment) and inflation, particularly for a sub—set of countries with

more clearly identifiable government changes from left    to right and vice
versa. 15




3,4 "Partisan Theory" with Permanent Effects

     Hibbs' PT implies permanent differences in output and unemployment in

addition to permanent differences in
                                        inflation across governments. Thus, one
way of comparing the Hibbs' PT with the RPT is to run the same regressions of

Tables 1 and 2 using the "permanent"
                                        partisan dummy RADM rather than the

"transitory" political dummy DRPTN. The results are shown in Tables 4 and 5:

all the coefficients on the political
                                        dummy are insignificant, even though
with the right sign. In these tables the fixed effects coefficients are not

reported since they are very similar to those of Tables 1 and 2.    Additional

regressions with alternative lag structures (for instance lagging RADM more

than one quarter) yield no support for the theory.

     The results of section 3.2 and 3.3 viewed together, indirectly provide

some empirical support to the inflation bias model of Kydland and Prescott

(1977) and Barro and Cordon (l983a,b). In fact, these regressions show that a

permanent difference in inflation rate is associated with temporary deviations

of output and unemployment from trend. Thus, the governments that are more

concerned about growth and unemployment relative to inflation, after a

temporary initial expansion, are caught in the sub—optimal equilibrium with an

inflation bias. In fact, inflation remains high even though the level of

economic activity returns to its "natural" value. This is precisely the

feature of the sub—optimal time consistent equilibrium.



3.5 The "Political Business Cycle"

     Nordhaus' (1975) PBC model can be tested on growth and unemployment by

constructing a political dummy of the following form:


                        1       in the (N—I) quarters preceding an election
          NRDN —               and in the election quarter

                       C       otherwise


We have chosen N —   4, 6 and 8. A relatively short pre—electoral output
expansion is consistent with this theory based upon a short sighted

electorate, Nordhaus (1975, 1989). Furthermore, since in many countries in

the sample several elections occur in less than four year intervals, a longer

specification of the preelectoral period would seem unreasonable.
                                            20

      Tables 6 and 7 report the results on
                                                  output and unemployment for the 18
 countries in the sample, using NRD6. (The fixed effect coefficients are not

 reported.) In both tables the coefficients are insignificant; in the growth

 regression the coefficient has the opposite sign from the
                                                                  theory prediction.
 Several alternative specifications with NRD4 and NRD8, using the difference of

 domestic growth from the world as the dependent variable and alternative lag

 structures, yield no support for the theory.16 In fact, the coefficient on

 the political dummy has the "wrong" sign in the majority of the regressions.

      We also tested whether the bIRD dummy approaches statistical significance,

 when partisan effects are held constant.
                                                 Regressions including both the DRPT
 and the NRD dunjnies were run. Once
                                       again no support for the PBC was found,
while the DRPT dummy remained
                                 statistically significant (results are
available) 17

     The PBC not only as formulated in Nordhaus (1975) but also, with caveats

discussed above, in the "rational" models
                                                 by Rogoff and Sibert (1988) and
Persson and Tabeilini (1990) implies an increase of the inflation rate around

elections. In particular, the model by Rogoff and Sibert (1988) implies that

pre—electoral manipulation of monetary and fiscal policy, used to signal the

government competence in providing public goods and services without raising

taxes implies an increase of inflation
                                            immediately after each election.

Furthermore, governments may prefer to raise prices under their direct control

after, rather than before elections, thus
                                                 directly contributing to a post
electoral upward jump in inflation. We have tested this implication in Table

8, where the dummy ELE is defined as follows:

                            1   in the 4 quarters following an election, and in
                ELE —           the election quarter.

The dummy ELE is significant at the one per cent level. Additional

regressions (available upon request) confirm that the upward jump in inflation

does not occur before the election, but only in the election quarter and lasts

three to five quarters. If confirmed by direct findings on policy

instruments, this result suggests that around elections monetary and fiscal

policy instruments may be manipulated, even though these policies do not seem

to affect real economic activity, as implied by Rogoff and Sibert (1988) and

Rogoff (1990). Alesina (1989) presents some qualitative evidence which

suggests the possibility that budget deficits increase in election years.

RPT.   Table   9 reports the results on CNP growth. For each country in the

sample we report the regression with the best fit chosen between the six

dummies DRPTN(—J) with N —   4,6,8   and J —   1,2.   Countries may differ with

regard to the time delay in implementing a new policy after a regime change or

with regard to how persistent the transitory increase in output will be after

the policy change. This is the reason why the best fit for DRPTN might occur

at different lags for different countries. For economy of space, we report

the results on unemployment in Appendix (Table A—3) without comments. The

results of Table 9 are very consistent with those on unemployment: the rare

differences will be pointed out. Table 10 displays the results on inflation.

We report the "best fit" within five regressions with R.ADM(—J) J —       1,.. .5.
Longer lags in the inflation regression, relative to the growth regression,

can be easily explained by the lag between output and inflation movements

(*) In the regressions for these countries a third lag of the dependent variable was
significant, and was included. For France its coefficients were 0.183 (1.721); for
Belgium -0.241 (-2.937).

(**) In the regressions where DRPTN(-J) is used the two figures in parenthesis after the
coefficient estimate represent the horizon of the dummy variable (N — 4, 6, 8) and the lag
in DRPTN chosen in the regression. For example (8,2) in the Australian regression means
that we used DRPT8(-2).

(e) Germany had a large coalition of right and left parties between 66:4 and 69:1; also,
following Alt (1985), the entrance of the FOP in the Social Democratic government in 72:3
is considered a movement to the right. To consider the movement from the right to center-
left in the 66-69 period and from left to center in the 72-82 period, the variable RADM
assumes the value of -0.5 (instead of -1.0) in the first period and the value of -0.5
(instead of -1.0) in the second period. This finer variable (ADM) is lagged five quarters
i.e. (-5).
(f) For analogous reasoning to those ascribed to Germany, we used the ADM variable for
Austria.

following changes in macroeconomic policies. The results can be summarized in

three points:

1) In a large group of countries which includes Australia, Denmark, Germany,

France, New Zealand, the US, and the UK, all the regressions on growth,

inflation and also unemployment (see Table A—3) show clear evidence of RPT,

although not all the coefficients on the political variables are significant

at the usual confidence levels (5 or 10 percent) in every regression. Note

that Table A—3 shows that the regressions on unemployment for Australia,

Denmark, France, Germany and the U.S. show a five percent level of

significance on the coefficient on the political dummy (Table A—3). The

results on the UK are greatly strengthened if the sample is restricted to the

post—fixed rates period. The regressions on the sample 1970—1987 in Tables 9

and 10 show significant coefficients on the political dummy at the 5 percent

level. The significant difference between the pre— and post—1971 results for

the UK is explained primarily by the observation of the labor government

elected in October 1964. This government, constrained by a commitment not to

devalue the pound, could not pursue expamsionary policies. Thus, 13K growth in

this period (1964—66) does not outperform the relatively rapid OECD average

growth.

2) In a second group of countries which includes Austria, Belgium, Finland,

Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the coefficients on the political

dummies exhibit the sign predicted by the theory sometimes approaching

statistical significance, in either the growth or unemployment regressions

(Table A—3) but no significance in the inflation regression. In particular,

Sweden has a five percent significant coefficient on DRPT6 in the    growth
equation.
                                        23

 3) Canada and Italy show no significant coefficients in any regressions. The

 case of Canada, however, is explained by the almost perfect correlation

 between the US and Canadian business cycle. In fact the US   political dummies

 are statistically quite significant (five percent confidence level) in the

 Canadian equations!1-8 Thus, it is not clear whether for the purpose of this

 paper Canada really provides an independent observation.

      In summary, leaving aside Canada, six of the seven countries with more

 clearly identifiable left—right governments (that is the US, Cermany, France,

 the UK, Australia, and New Zealand) plus Denmark exhibit evidence of RPT

effects. One bi—partisan system, Sweden, is unclear. All the multi—party

parliamentary systems with large coalition governments show little    sign of
this type of cycle, particularly on inflation.19

     Let us now turn to PT with permanent effects: Table 11 reports the

country by country results on CNP growth. For each country we have chosen the

best fit between three regressions with political
                                                    dummy RADM(—J) J —   1,2,3.
The results for unemployment, which quite consistent with those on output, are

in the Appendix (Table A—4). Only Cermany does not reject the PT. For Sweden

the coefficient is borderline significant, but there is no indication of

partisan behavior in either unemployment (Table A—4) or inflation    (Table 10).
All the other countries clearly reject the theory; in several cases the

coefficient on the political dummy js opposite to the theory prediction.

     Table 12 reports country by country results on output for the PEC model;

results on unemployment are in Table A—S. In Table 12 we have chosen the best

specification between NRD4 an4 6.   In four countries, Cermany, Japan, UK and
New Zealand the coefficient on NRD is significant. In Australia and France

the coefficients have the sign inconsistent with the theory and are

statistically significant (or close to it) .   All   the other coefficients are

insignificant.

     Table 13 reports the country results on inflation. Several countries,

such as Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, and New Zealand show significant (ten

percent or better) post—electoral upward jumps in the inflation rate. In

several other countries (e.g., Japan, Norway, and UK) the sign is correct but

the t—statistic does not reach a significant level. Thus, in only two

countries, Germany and New Zealand, both the level of economic activity and

the inflation rate follow the predictions of Nordhaus' "political business

cycle" model.



5. Tests of the RPT model using Hamilton's (1989) model.

     It would be interesting to derive direct measures of the dating of the

business cycle in different countries and study their relation to the

political variables. Obtaining estimates of the dating of the business cycle

is not easy, either empirically or conceptually. The empirical problem is

that, while in the United States the NBER offers already—made estimates of the

peaks and troughs of economic activity, similar and comparable measures are

not available for the other OECD countries. From a conceptual point of view,

the recent literature on unit roots and GNP has offered a number of

alternative approaches to the problem of distinguishing between trend and

cyclical components of output. Most of the literature20 is based on the

assumption that GNP growth is characterized by a linear stationary process.

     In a recent paper, Hamilton (1989) studies the implications of specifying

the first differences of log GNF as a nonlinear stationary process.

Hamilton's idea is to consider the economy as characterized by two states, a

high—growth (expansion) state and a low—growth (recession) state and model the

switch between these two states as being governed by a Markov process. One of

the bi—products of the estimation of the model is a nonlinear filter that

delivers optimal estimates of the dating of the business cycle based on past

observations on output. In particular, for each quarter the filter provides

an estimate of the probability that the economy is in a recession (or a boom)

given the information available in the data. Using this filter, Hamilton

(1989) finds that "the best statistical estimates of which quarters were

historically characterized by negative growth states for the U.S. economy are

remarkably similar to NBER dating of business cycles". These results suggest

that one could use the same statistical approach to derive estimates of the

dating of the business cycle for other OECD countries in our sample.

     In this sectiàn we first derive estimates of the dating of the peaks and

troughs of the business cycle for a sample of OECD economies using Hamilton's

switching Markov model and then test the relation between these estimates of

the business cycle and the changes in political regime suggested by the RPT

model. Our use of Hamilton's approach is suggested by its success in tracking

the NEER dating of the business cycle in the United States and its ability to

deliver a synthetic estimate for each quarter of the probability that the

economy was in a high growth (expansion) or low growth (recession) state.

     Given the positive evidence in favor of the RPT model for countries with

two—party systems we have considered only these countries.21 To control for

the effects of the world business cycle on the growth rate of the various

economies, in our maximum likelihood estimates of Hamilton's model we take

yDIF (defined as the difference between country i growth rate and the average
                                       26

growth rate of the major OECD countries) as the two—state variable to be

explained.

     Once we have obtained an estimate of the dating of the business cycle, we

perform a regression of the estimated probability (PROBS) of being in a low

growth state (relative to the OECD average) on a constant, the dummy for the

RPT model (DRPTN) and the first lag of the dependent variable. The latter is

introduced to capture the observed persistence of the probability of being in

a particular state of the world. In other terms the basic regressions is:

             PROBSt —   + a1 PROBSt 1 + °2 DRPTNt 1 + t                       (6)

     Table 14 reports the results of fixed—effects panel regressions of

equation (6) above for 7 "bi—partisan" countries22. The political variable

(DRPT6), used to capture the effects of the RPT model, has the correct sign

and is statistically significant at the 1% confidence level.

     In Table 15 we report the results of separate time series regressions for

each of the seven countries considered. The coefficient on the RPT dummy

(DRPT) is significant at the 10% confidence level in five of the seven

countries (5% for United States, France and Sweden). These five countries

are: United States, Germany, France, Australia and Sweden. The DRPT

coefficient for the United Kingdom is significant (at the 10% level) only if

we start the sample in 1970 (as discussed above). The seventh country, Canada

does not show statistical significance for the RPT variable but, as discussed

in the previous section, the Canadian business cycle is mostly driven by the

U.S. cycle.

 6.    Endogenous Elections

       An empirical test of the model of Ito (1990a) is as follows. Define

as the probability that an election is called at time t and assume that an

election was held in period r and that, according to the law, an election has

to be held at least every n periods; Ito's model implies that        > 0, i:l,2,3
in:




               —
                   o+           +      —        for   r < t   r+n               (7)




       Table 16 displays this probit regressions for every country in the sample

in which the timing of elections is endogenous. Following Ito (l990a) the

variable TL is defined as the number of quarters elapsed from the preceding

elections while the other two regressors are output growth and inflation.

       The results for Japan, which do not reject the theory, are consistent-

with those of Ito (l990a,b). However, except possibly for Finland, no other

country in the sample supports the theory; in fact, there are at least as many

signs inconsistent with the theory as there are "correct" signs, even though

in either case they are all insignificant.

       Several different specifications of (7) were estimated in addition to

that presented in Table 16. First, we used the economic variables

(y and ir) defined in difference from the world average. Second, we tried

various lag structures. Third, following Ito (l990b) we used different

measures of the time elapsed from the previous election; we defined
Tl —       and 12 —
                        + O.OOt — (r—t) and we tried both of them (each at a time)

  instead of (r—t) in (7)23 The results of all these
                                                               regressions (available
  upon request) confirm the results of Table 16.

       These negative results should not be interpreted as a rejection of the

 basic, insightful idea of strategic choice of election         timing, for several
 reasons. First of all the economy is only one of the variables which may

 influence the choice of calling an election. A major success in foreign

 policy, or various events affecting negatively the
                                                            public image of the
 opposition, may be strategically used by the incumbent.          A careful study for
 each country of the interaction of economic
                                                     and non—economic factors would be
 very valuable but goes beyond the scope of the present paper. Second, the

 model of strategic timing of election is probably more applicable to

 countries, like Japan or the U.K.   ,   with   unified control rather than coalition
 governments. In fact, different members of coalition
                                                              governments may disagree
on the optimal time for calling an election, since
                                                           their expectations on their
relative popularity may diverge. Thus, in this institutional structure, the

decision about when to call an election,         appears much more as the result of a

non cooperative game between coalition members rather than an optimal

strategic decision of a unified government.
                                                       Finally, one may argue that,
particularly for the cases of weak coalition governments, the reverse

causation may be also important:
                                     governments collapse and elections have to
be called early, when the economy is doing poorly and the coalition cannot

agree on what to do (see Robertson (1983)). More
                                                         generally, in countries with
large coalitions and frequent elections (such as Belgium, Italy, the

Netherlands) coalition collapses are probably the result of more complex

politico—economic factors than the short run state of the economy.

 7. Conclusions

      The most interesting result of this paper is that the more recent models

 of political cycles significantly outperform their predecessors. The rational

 "opportunistic" model by Rogoff and Sibert (1988) and the rational partisan

model by Alesina (1987) are consistent with the overall pattern of results for

 several countries.

     The main finding of this paper can be summarized as follows:

1) With the exception of three countries (Germany and New Zealand and,

possibly, Japan), we found no evidence of a systematic opportunistic cycle of

the Nordhaus type either for output or unemployment.

2) The opportunistic political business cycle model with endogenous timing of

elections is rejected in every country, with the exception of Japan.

3) An electoral cycle on the inflation rate, consistent with the models of

budget cycles of Rogoff and Sibert (1988), was found.

4) The implications of the "rational partisan theory" are consistent with the

empirical evidence particularly for a subset of countries with a bi—partisan

system or at least with more clearly identifiable political changes from left

to right and vice—versa. This theory is less applicable, and in fact tends to

fail, in countries with large coalition governments with frequent government

collapses.

5) The "partisan theory" with permanent effects on output and unemployment is

generally rejected.

     Thus, a political cycle which seems to appear fairly consistently in

several countries is the following: left wing government expand the economy

when elected; for a while (about 2 years) they succeed, then inflation

expectations adjust and the economy returns to its natural rate of growth. At
                                        30

 this point, left wing governments are trapped into the time consistent

 equilibrium with an inflation bias a   la   Barro and Cordon (1983b). Note that

when left wing governments approach the new election in this high inflation,

they may try to reduce the latter, particularly if inflation is perceived as

the main economic problem of the time (Lindbeck (1976)). When right
                                                                         wing

governments are elected they fight inflation, causing a recession or a growth

slowdown. Later in their term, the economy goes back at its natural rate of

growth and inflation remains low.

     Two explanations can account for the relatively little evidence of a

Nordhaus type opportunistic cycle on growth and unemployment: First, a

"rational" electorate imposes a limit on this behavior; an excessive attempt

to pursue opportunistic policies may be perceived as counterproductive by

policymakers. Second, it may be quite difficult to create expansions

precisely timed before elections.

     However, the results on post—electoral inflation increase may signal the

occurrence of pre—electoral opportunistic budget policies. Alesina (1989)

presents some qualitative evidence which suggests that budget deficits tend to

increase in election years in several countries. Evidence on budget cycles in

the US is discussed in Tufte (1978), Alesina (1988a), and Nordhaus (1989).

Preelectoral fiscal "favors" to key constituencies may be electorally very

useful and easy to implement, relative to an attempt to increase the rate of

growth of CNP.

     These opportunistic monetary and fiscal policies may very well coexist

with the partisan cycles found in the data. Even "partisan" politicians

prefer to be in office, rather than out; by being in office they can implement

their desired goals. Thus, they may engage in short term pre—electoral
                                      31

opportunistic monetary and fiscal policies to enhance their chances for re-

election. Further research on a multi—country sample could shed more light on

this issue: in fact our results on inflation suggest that pre—electoral

manipulations of monetary and fiscal policy instruments may be the rule rather

than the exception.

1.   Furthermore, Nordhaus' "political business cycle" model did not receive a

convincing empirical support. Soon after the publication of Nordhaus' paper

Mccalluin (1978) and Paldam (1979) presented negative empirical results for the

U.S. and OECD economies respectively. More favorable results are shown by

Tufte (1978) on a sample including a few American elections.

2. By Okun's law the same model could be written in terms of the unemployment

rate.

3.   To be precise, Nordhaus (1975) assumes that policymakers control aggregate

demand and, indirectly, inflation. This difference is inessential and, in

fact, the more recent models simplify the analysis by assuming that the

government has direct control over the inflation rate.

4. Nordhaus' (1975) model predicts that inflation should increase before the

election. However, given time lags between the effects of aggregate demand

policies on output and inflation, it is possible to construct a model of the

Nordhaus type in which inflation increases immediately after, rather than

before the election. (See Lindbeck (1976)).

5. In Cukierman and Meltzer (1986) the asymmetry of information is related to

the knowledge of the realization of a random shock to the economy.

6. Formally, the degree of competence is modelled by adding a term in

equation (1) which changes over time and is known by the policymaker but

becomes known to the voter only with a lag. For an explicit test of this

"competence" model on United States data see Alesina, Londregan and Rosenthal

(1990)
                                          33

7. Note that Nordhaus' PBC and Hibbs' PT can coexist. If one assumes that

politicians are both opportunistic and partisan and voters are retrospective

as implied by A:5, one obtains a "weaker" form of PT which incorporates

elements of pre—electoral opportunistic behavior. See Frey and Schneider

(1978) and Nordhaus (1989).

8. In the regressions for the seven countries included in the creation of the

proxy for the OECD averages, we have used different proxies which exclude the

country in the left—hand side of the regression.

9. A priori, the correct dynamic specification of the model could differ

across countries but in country by country regressions we found that the same

AR specification is the best for almost all the countries in the sample.

However, even if the same AR specification applies to each country, the

estimates of the coefficients on the dynamic part of the model could differ

across countries and suggest the use of a variable—slopes and variable—

intercepts model. Given the significant loss of degrees of freedom involved,

this procedure was not adopted. Furthermore, country specific results are

discussed in Section 4.

10. Ellis and Thoma (1989) present an extension of the partisan model for the

case of endogenous timing of elections.

11. It is known that in the case of dynamic fixed—effects panel models such

as the one estimated here, the correlation between the error term and the

lagged dependent variables might lead to potentially biased and inconsistent

estimates of the parameters of the model (see Hsiao (1986)). The problem is

quite serious in panel sets where the number of agents (N) considered is large

but the number of times series observations (T) is small (data over a very

short period of time) .   In   that case the maximum likelihood estimator of the
                                       34

 dynamic model is inconsistent even if the number of agents becomes very large

 (see Anderson and 1jsiao (1982) and Nicke].l (1981)). The solution to this

 problem is to use instrumental—variable methods such as those suggested by

 Shargava and Sargan (1983) and Fakes and Griliches (1984). Our panel data

 set, however, does not suffer of the above problem because of the use of a

 long time series (usually 112 data points). As observed by Hsiao (1986), in

 the case where the time period T over which data are available is   large, as in

 our model, the parameter estimates of the standard fixed—effects dynamic model

 are consistent.

 12. Analogous results on the political dummy available are obtained by using

as a dependent variable the difference between domestic and world growth.

13.   The variable      shows in fact a high level of persistence. Given this

persistence, even a "temporary" policy shock as the one captured by the    dummy
DPRT6 has rather persistent effects.

14. One could add oil prices to the equation but the inclusion of the world

inflation variable already proxies for this role of oil shocks.

15. The significance of the coefficients of the political dummies in Tables

1, 2 and 3 does not result from the influence of any single country. If one

drops from the pull any of the 16 countries and retain the other 15, the

coefficients on the political dummies remain significant. These results are

available.

16. These results are available upon request.

17. An even more extreme version of this model of voters' myopia would imply

that they ignore the influence of the world economy on their countries'

performance and thus politicians simply attempt to expand their economies,

regardless of the world economy. This hypothesis can be tested running the
                                         35

same regressions of Tables 6, 7 without correcting for the effect of the world

economy. The results (available upon request) show no support for the PEC.

18. Results are available upon request.

19. Our results regarding the RPT theory on output growth and unemployment

are confirmed by another set of regressions in which we used a distributed lag

of the variable representing the changes in partisan regime, instead of the

DRPT variable. For the countries in which tables 9 and A—3 show a significant

DRPT effect we find that an F—test on the distributed lag variable rejects the

null hypothesis that the sum   of   all coefficients is equal to zero. These

results are available upon request.

20. See Nelson and Plosser (1982), Campbell and Mankiw (1987), Watson (1986),

Clark (1987), King, Plosser, Stock and Watson (1987).

21. Given our results in Table 9, Hamilton's tests on the other countries are

not likely to support the theory.

22. New Zealand is excluded from the sample because of lack of quarterly

data.

23. Tl is simply the number of quarters elapsed from the previous election as

a ratio of the maximum number of quarters between elections (i.e., n). T2 is

constructed such that it assumes a very high value (1000) when elections are

not anticipated. The idea is that the economy has no influence on the timing

in these cases (see Ito (1990b)).

 a RIGHT or LEFT indicates the type of government in power at the beginning of
the sample which is 1959:1. We also indicate for each country whether
elections dates are endogenous or exogenous and the official number of years
between two elections.

 b Elections denoted with an asterisk "*" are not included in tests of the
political business cycle theory because they are too close (less than two
years) to previous elections. They are however included in tests of the
opportunistic endogenous election model -

 c Both Germany and Austria had grand coalitions of Left and Right parties.
Thus, a finer administration variable was used in the RPT inflation and
partisan (Ribbs) regressions. This also explains the occurence of a rightward
shift from an already central Right leaning party.
