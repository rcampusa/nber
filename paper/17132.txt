                                             ABSTRACT

A long-standing debate pits those who think economic development leads to democratization against
those who argue that both result from distant historical causes. Using the most comprehensive estimates
of national income available, I show that development is associated with more democratic government—but
in the medium run (10 to 20 years). The reason is that, for the most part, higher income only prompts
a breakthrough to more democratic politics after the incumbent leader falls from power. And in the
short run, faster economic growth increases the leader’s odds of survival. This logic—for which I provide
evidence at the levels of individual countries and the world—helps explain why democracy advances
in waves followed by periods of stasis and why dictators, concerned only to entrench themselves in
power, end up preparing their countries to leap to a higher level of democracy when they are eventually
overthrown.

1 Introduction
Does economic development cause countries to become more democratic—and, if so, why do dictators

ever promote it? In the wake of the Arab uprisings of early 2011, these questions are particularly

topical. To many observers, the protests that shook regimes from Libya to Bahrain seemed a direct

result of modernization, which created glaring inequalities, spread literacy and access to

information, and provided networking tools such as Twitter and Facebook to mobilize discontent into

the streets (e.g. Giglio 2011). Yet if development undermines the control of authoritarian rulers, why

do those rulers nevertheless encourage it?

          One answer might be that they do not. Concerned precisely to forestall the mobilization of

opposition, some dictators deliberately de-modernize their countries. President Mobutu of Zaire

allowed his country’s infrastructure to decay, shrinking the network of paved roads along which

regime opponents might mobilize (Robinson 2001, p.28). However, while some dictators fit the

Mobutu mold, many others have overseen—and often actively supported—economic development.

Under South Korea’s General Park Chung-hee and Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew,

growth averaged more than six percent a year.1 Nor is this a uniquely Asian pattern. When Zine El

Abidine Ben Ali took over as president of Tunisia in 1987, GDP per capita at purchasing power

parity was $2,512. By the time he fled the country in January 2011, it was more than $8,000.2 On

Ben Ali’s watch, the adult literacy rate rose from 48 to 78 percent; enrollment in higher education

increased from 5 to 34 percent; the proportion of women in parliament rose from 4 to 28 percent;

internet users increased from zero to 34 percent; and mobile phone subscriptions soared from zero to

93 per 100 people.3 Dictators like Ben Ali may not grow their economies as fast as democratic leaders

do on average (Persson and Tabellini 2009). But the puzzle is why they grow them at all if doing so

hastens their overthrow in a democratic revolution.

       A second possibility is that Lipset and other modernization theorists were wrong: economic

development does not lead to democracy. Dictators need not fear modernization since modernization

does not erode the bases of their power. Examining the post-war period, Przeworski et al. (2000)

concluded that although development helped entrench democracies it did not increase the odds that

a dictatorship would become democratic. Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, and Yared (2008, 2009), also

focusing mostly on recent decades, contend that development has no impact on either the stability of

democracy or transitions to it if one controls for countries’ different historical legacies. However,

these claims have been challenged. Boix (2009) finds evidence of a link from higher income to

democracy if one includes data from before World War II. Benhabib, Corvalan, and Spiegel (2011)

also detect a relationship once data coverage is broadened and allowance is made for censoring at the

top of the democracy scale. I begin by replicating and extending the findings of Boix and Benhabib et

al. I confirm their results, but show that evidence linking income and democracy is much stronger in

the medium run (10-20 year periods) than in the short run (annual or five-year periods).

       So why do dictators promote the very economic changes that eventually predispose their

populations to demand political freedom? I argue that a mechanism analogous to what Hegel called

“the cunning of reason” leads rulers who seek only their own survival in power to support economic

growth. Economic development has different effects in the short run and the long run. In the long

run, it transforms societies, creating the preconditions for democracy. As a country’s national income

rises, its population becomes more differentiated, educated, bourgeois, tolerant, interconnected by

decentralized media, and eager to participate politically. However, that society is ready for

democracy does not mean a transition immediately occurs. I argue that in general higher income

only prompts a breakthrough to more accountable government after the incumbent leader falls from

power. And in the short run higher economic growth increases the leader’s odds of survival. By

raising citizens’ incomes, growth boosts the ruler’s popularity, intimidating potential rivals; by

increasing state revenues, it helps the ruler finance patronage or repression. Thus, in the short run

economic progress may facilitate the rollback of political freedoms. A Ben Ali may promote growth in

order to lengthen his tenure in office, and exploit the cushion of support generated by rising incomes


                                                  2
to tighten the screws on society, while simultaneously and quite unintentionally bringing about

changes that increase the odds of democratization when he is eventually overthrown.

       And no leader survives forever. International economic shocks may frustrate the dictator’s

efforts to promote domestic growth, or he may be deposed after losing a war or a civil war, or for

other non-economic reasons. When an autocrat falls, the level of economic development then

influences whether he is replaced by another dictator or a more democratic regime. Evidence for this

argument can be found both in individual countries and in global patterns of economic performance

and leadership turnover. I show that worldwide recessions and depressions are associated with more

rapid replacement of national leaders. This does not by itself produce democracy. In the 1930s, the

Great Depression destabilized democratic leaders in a number of poor democracies, prompting

reversion to authoritarian rule. But when global recessions cause turnover in dictatorships that have

become relatively rich under their previous rulers, waves of democratization result.

       In the following sections, I report statistical evidence for each step in this argument. First, I

reprise the current state of the debate about development and democracy, replicating the empirical

findings of previous papers using the most up-to-date data on national income, and demonstrating

that the income-democracy relationship is stronger in the medium run than in the short run. Section

3 then explores why this is the case, and shows that the impact of income on democracy is

conditional on leadership turnover. In periods with no change at the top, income has practically no

detectable effect, but in periods after a leader falls, higher income—or a more educated population—

is associated with increases in democracy. Section 4 examines the causes of leadership change and

shows that low economic growth makes it likelier the incumbent will be replaced. I instrument for

each country’s growth rate, using the trade-weighted average rate of growth in other countries,

which increases confidence that the effect is causal. Section 5 extends the analysis to the global

pattern of economic growth and leadership change. Estimating error correction models, I show that

global economic performance and the rate of leadership change are linked by both a long-run

equilibrium relationship and a short run dynamic one. Section 6 concludes.

2 Income and democracy

Since Lipset (1959), many scholars have held that as countries develop economically they tend to

become more democratic. This was consistent with the strong cross-national correlation between

income and measures of democracy observable in any given year. Moreover, a variety of plausible

mechanisms—from the spread of education and mass media to growing tolerance and social

differentiation—seemed likely to render citizens of richer societies both more eager to participate

and harder to control. 4 Confidence in this logic was shaken in the 1970s by the appearance of

military dictatorships in some relatively rich Latin American countries (O’Donnell 1988). But after

these returned to democracy in the 1980s they came to seem the exceptions that proved the rule.

        A stronger challenge emerged more recently. Acemoglu et al. (AJRY 2008, 2009) argue that

rather than economic development causing democracy, the two evolve in parallel, driven by factors

rooted in distant history. As early as 1500, some countries had good institutions that prompted rapid

growth and democratization, while others had bad institutions that retarded both economic and

political development. In tracing today’s cross-national differences to critical junctures many

centuries past, they drew on the historical work of North (1981), Moore (1966), and various others.

Empirically, they showed that in panels of countries between 1960 and 2000 (and also in a balanced

panel of 25 countries at 25-year intervals starting in 1875), the link between income and democracy

disappeared once country fixed effects were introduced to control for time-invariant factors.

        However, two still more recent papers rediscover the relationship. Boix (2009), using data

that go back to the early 19th Century, finds income to be significant, even including country

dummies. He argues that the 1960-2000 period was exceptional in that it overlapped with the Cold

War, during which the superpowers intervened to prevent regime change. Benhabib et al. (2011)

confirm that the relationship returns if data coverage is expanded.5 They also note that a significant

of education, see Glaeser et al. (2004) and Glaeser, Ponzetto, and Shleifer (2007); on value change, see Inglehart
and Welzel (2005).

5Besides extending the data into the 19th Century by use of Maddison’s estimates, they use the Penn World
Tables Version 6.3 rather than Version 6.1, as in AJRY (2008, 2009).

                                                        4
proportion of the data is censored by the top of the commonly used Polity democracy scale: once

countries reach a perfect score of 10, they cannot rise any higher. Since 1900, the share of countries

with perfect scores has averaged around 18 percent. Using methods that take such censoring into

account also increases the significance of the relationship.

        I begin here by replicating the main findings of AJRY (2008, 2009), Boix (2009), and

Benhabib et al. (2011), using the latest national income estimates of Angus Maddison and his

collaborators (Maddison 2010). As in these papers, I use two measures of democracy, one more or less

continuous, the other dichotomous. The first is the Polity2 index from the Polity IV dataset (2009

version). Constructed by scholars at George Mason University, this equals the difference between an

index of democracy and an index of autocracy, both of which measure in different ways the openness

and competitiveness of political participation and executive recruitment, along with the extent of

constraints on the executive.6 The data include all countries that currently have populations over

500,000, starting in 1800 or the year of independence. As in AJRY (2008, 2009) and Boix (2009), I

rescale the index, which runs from -10 to +10, to take values between 0 and 1. The dichotomous

measure was constructed by Boix and Rosato (2001) and used in Boix and Stokes (2003) and AJRY

(2009). This codes countries as democratic if elections are free and competitive, the executive is

accountable (i.e. the president is directly elected or the head of government is answerable to

parliament), and at least half the male population has the right to vote (Boix and Rosato 2001).

Coverage ranges from 22 countries in 1800 to 186 in 2000.7 Some studies have also used ratings

produced by the NGO Freedom House. However, since these begin in 1972, and even extensions go

back only to 1950 (Bollen 1998), they cannot test arguments about the pre-World War II experience.

        Since I contend that long run and short run effects of income differ, I construct panels of data




6For details, see www.systemicpeace.org/polity/polity4.htm. I use the Polity2 index, which, unlike the simple
Polity index, includes estimates for years in which the regime was in transition.

7I thank Carles Boix for sharing these data. The BR definition is similar to that of Przeworski et al. (2000).
However, the datsets differ on a number of cases. Combining the BR data with those of Cheibub, Gandhi and
Vreeland, which updates the Przeworski et al. data (CVG; available at José Cheibub’s website,
https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/cheibub/www/DD_page.html), I found 130 country-years in which BR coded the country
as democratic but CGV coded it as undemocratic. There were 175 cases where the opposite was true.

at different frequencies.8 I show results of each estimation for annual, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year, and

20-year panels and examine how findings differ across them, where relevant calculating the

cumulative long-run effect. 9 Rather than averaging the data for the given period, which would

introduce additional serial correlation, I follow AJRY (2008, 2009) in using the observations from

every fifth year for the five-year panel, and so on. I include in each regression the lagged value of the

dependent variable, again as in AJRY (2008, 2009) and Boix (2009), to capture persistence in

democracy, reduce serial correlation, and pick up any tendency to revert to the mean. The basic

model I estimate, as in AJRY (2008), can be written:

                                         d it   d it 1   yit 1  x 'it -1 β  t   i  uit                        (1)

where dit is the extent of democracy in country i in period t; yit 1 is the natural log of per capita GDP

in country i in the previous period; x it-1 is a vector of other covariates;                         i   is a full set of country


dummies;       t a   full set of year dummies; and uit a random error with E (uit )  0 for all i and t. I

calculate robust standard errors clustered by country.

            In Table 1, panels A-C, I estimate this model by OLS, using the Polity2 index as the

dependent variable. Panel A includes just 1960-2000. As in AJRY (2008, Table 3, column 2; 2009,

Table 1, Panel B, column 2), Boix (2009, Table 2, column 1), and Benhabib et al. (2011, Table 4,

columns 3 and 4), income is statistically insignificant with estimated long-run impact close to zero.

This is true at all panel frequencies. Panel B extends the data to include all observations for 1820-

2008. Now a new pattern emerges. In the 10- and 20-year panels, income is significant, with a

positive coefficient (the 15-year panel also fits the pattern, but income is only significant at p = .12).

The cumulative effect of income rises as the panel frequency falls, reaching .18 for the 20-year data.

            So far, I have not adjusted in any way for the fact that countries that reach the top of the

Polity scale cannot rise any higher. The simplest way to do so is to reformulate the question


8 AJRY (2008, 2009) focused on 5-year panels, and presented some models with annual, 10-year, 20-year, and
25-year data as robustness checks. Boix (2009) reported five-year, 10-year, and 25-year panels. Benhabib et al.
(2011) used five-year panels, with annual and 10-year panels as robustness checks.

9   In a model with a lagged dependent variable: d it   d it 1   yit 1 , the cumulative effect of income is  / (1   ) .

to ask whether higher income predisposes non-democracies to become more democratic. The Polity

creators recommend treating a Polity2 score of +6 as the lower bound for democracy. Panel C shows

results estimated on just countries with Polity2 scores below six in the previous period. This

increases the estimated effect of income, although the result for the 15-year panel is still not

significant.10

           Panels D-F show similar regressions using the dichotomous Boix-Rosato measure. I focus on

just countries that were non-democracies in the previous period and therefore drop the lagged

dependent variable. Since non-linear models cannot easily accommodate unit fixed effects, I begin

with simple linear models in Panels D and E, for 1960-2000 and 1820-2008, including full sets of

country and year fixed effects. Panel F reports results of a conditional logit fixed effects model, run

with the estimator of Chamberlain (1980), for which the estimates of structural parameters are

consistent.11 All models include year dummies. Again, we see the same pattern: once 19th Century

data are included, income is significant, with the largest estimated effects in 10- to 20-year panels.

           In Table A1 in the appendix, I present various alternative formulations, robustness checks,

and extensions. I try controlling for the country’s stock of accumulated democratic experience and for

the level of democracy in other countries, using measures devised by Persson and Tabellini (2009),

and also try restricting attention to the pre-1945 data. I rerun the regressions using the estimator of

Alan, Honoré, and Leth-Petersen (2008), which allows for censoring at the top and bottom while also

controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, as in Benhabib et al. (2001). I also estimate the models

with the dynamic GMM estimator of Arellano and Bond, as in AJRY (2008).12 Each method has its

own problems, about which more could be said. My goal is to address the existing debate by using

the same models as in previous papers wherever possible.

           These checks reinforce the main finding observed so far. If one includes data that go back to

the 19th Century, and especially if one also adjusts for censoring at the top of the Polity scale, higher

10   Results are similar if one excludes only countries with a perfect Polity2 score of+10: see Table A1 in appendix.

11   This can be estimated in STATA with the xtlogit, fe command (Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal 2008, p.272).

12The standard fixed effect OLS model in equation (1) can yield biased estimates because the lagged dependent
variable, dit-1, will be mechanically correlated with the error term for all periods before t.

income is significantly associated with movement towards greater democracy. In failing to detect a

relationship in annual data—and usually also in five-year panels—these results are in line with

AJRY (2008, 2009). However, in finding a relationship in panels at lower frequency, the results echo

those of Boix (2009) and Benhabib et al. (2011).

        The new point that I emphasize here is that the relationship between income and democracy

is clearest and strongest in the medium to long run (i.e. panels of 10 to 20-year periods). In fact, the

robustness tests in both Boix (2009) and Benhabib et al. (2011) also found larger estimated effects in

panels of 10 years or more, but neither paper commented on this. Year on year, there is little change

in measures of democracy. In annual panels, the coefficient on lagged democracy is close to one. But

as the interval between observations increases, the coefficient on lagged democracy falls; in 20-year

panels, it is close to zero or even negative, suggesting regression to the mean. If one wants to predict

how democratic a country will be next year, its current level of democracy is overwhelmingly

important. But if one wants to know how democratic it will be in 20 years, its current democracy

score helps little; its level of economic development is far more informative.13




3 The importance of leadership change

Why might income matter for democracy mostly in the medium to long run? There are probably

several reasons. Various aspects of modernization may affect politics with a lag. Rising literacy and

the spread of education will create pressure for more accountable government only after newly

literate and educated groups become politically aware and develop organizational skills. Time is also

required for urbanization and industrialization to translate into political mobilization.

        Here I focus on one reason. I hypothesize that the demand for democracy and the readiness

of society to sustain it have a greater impact in periods after change occurs in a country’s top

leadership. Political change is discontinuous. In most years, a country’s governing institutions are


13 The estimated effects are quite large. For instance, the difference between a per capita GDP of $2,000 and one
of $20,000 would correspond to a long-term difference of .41 on the 0-to-1 Polity2 scale if one uses the estimate
from Panel B (20-year data) or a difference of .62 points using the estimate from Panel C (20-year data).


                                                       9
highly inertial. But when, for whatever reason, the ruler of an autocracy falls, constitutional

questions suddenly come on the agenda. The direction and extent of political reform then depend on

what level of economic development the country has reached under the last dictator’s rule.14

           For years, a society may evolve under the surface, growing more complex, bourgeois, literate,

interconnected, media savvy, tolerant, and difficult to control, without any corresponding alteration

in the political superstructure—until a crisis occurs and the latent demand for participation

combines with the new potential for social organization. Leadership change by itself does not

produce democracy: one dictator may just replace another. Economic development by itself only

makes democracy more feasible. In the short run, growth without leadership turnover tends to boost

the incumbent’s popularity, enabling him—if he wishes—to curb political freedom. It is the

combination of economic development and leadership change that opens the way for political reform.

           Why does leadership turnover in countries that have become relatively rich have this effect?

There are at least three possible reasons. First, the new leader may himself be a product of the

country’s recent modernization. More educated than his predecessor, with more tolerant and liberal

values, this representative of a new generation may be readier to free the press, empower society,

and permit more political participation. In the Soviet Union under Leonid Brezhnev, per capita

income rose from $4,439 in 1964 to $6,536 in 1982.15 The share of Soviet adults with a high school

diploma increased on Brezhnev’s watch from 17 percent to almost 60 percent (Hough 1997, p.44). Yet

it was only after Brezhnev’s death—and those of two decrepit successors—that a member of the new

generation, Mikhail Gorbachev, took command and began a process of political decompression.

           Another possibility is that the new leader, although not himself more democratic in outlook,

recognizes that appealing to the new groups and interests engendered by modernization is his best

bet for political survival. Especially if the previous ruler fell in a crisis that undermined the old

regime’s legitimacy, his successor may see the need to compromise with such groups. One example

comes from Indonesia. After the long-time dictator General Suharto was forced from power by

14As Huntington noted, the decision of a failing authoritarian regime to democratize in the 1970s and 1980s
“almost always first required a change of leadership ” (1991, p.57) .

protests sparked by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, his vice-president, B.J. Habibie, promptly

relaxed controls over the press, legalized opposition parties, and promised democratic elections the

following year. By doing so, he diverted the opposition, which had been seeking to overthrow him

with street demonstrations, into instead preparing to run for office (Liddle 1999).

        A third possibility is that the fall of a dictator leaves modern and traditional factions or

social interests relatively balanced, and their leaders agree to more democratic procedures to avert

more violent modes of competition. Democracy may emerge by default as a means of sharing power.

In Spain’s post-Franco transition, there were many committed believers in democracy; but a

democratic order was accepted by Francoist elements in the armed forces because—especially after

the 1981 failed coup—they no longer had confidence that they could dominate by force.

        Table 2 presents evidence for this argument. I examine whether the link between income and

democracy differed in countries where the leader had recently been replaced from that in countries

where the same leader had remained in power. 16 The data on leader turnover come from the

Archigos dataset of Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza (2009a, 2009b), which contains information on

the top leaders of all independent states between 1875 and 2004 and on the manner in which leaders

left office. Archigos defines a country’s leader as “the person that de facto exercised power” (Goemans

et al. 2009a). In general, that means the prime minister in parliamentary regimes, the president in

presidential and mixed systems, and the communist party chairman in communist systems. Panel A

uses the Polity democracy measure, restricting attention as before to countries not already

democratic (i.e. with Polity2 less than 6), and Panel B uses the Boix-Rosato binary variable.

        The regressions support the conjecture that income has a different effect in periods following

turnover at the top. If the country’s leader had not been replaced, there was generally no

relationship between income and the country’s level of democracy, controlling for democracy one

period earlier (statistically insignificant coefficients, close to zero). However, if the leader had been

replaced, countries with higher income tended to move faster towards democracy. For periods of one


16 For instance, in the 5-year panel, I distinguish cases in which the leader had been replaced in periods t – 5

through t – 1 from those in which he had not.

to 15 years, the interaction term was statistically significant at least at p < .10 for the Polity measure.

For the dichotomous measure, it was significant for all but the 10-year panel.17 At extremely low per

capita income—the implied thresholds are mostly a few hundred dollars a year—leadership turnover is

associated with less democracy. But at higher income levels, a change in leader is associated with

movement towards democracy that is larger, the more developed the country.

            Panel C shows one mechanism by which higher income translates into more democracy when

accompanied by leadership change. As countries grow richer, their populations become more educated,

which increases the desire for political participation, enhances individuals’ capacity to organize, and

inculcates values of tolerance and compromise. Lipset thought a high level of education was “close to

being a necessary condition” for democracy (1959, p.80). Various scholars have reported empirical

evidence of this link (Barro 1999, Przeworski et al. 2000, Glaeser et al. 2004). However, Acemoglu et

al. (2005) argue that once fixed effects for country and year are included, the relationship disappears.

           To measure countries’ educational levels, I use estimates of the average number of years of

schooling among those aged 15 and older, compiled by Morrisson and Murtin (2009); data were

available at 10-year intervals for 74 countries in 1870-2010. Just entering the education variable into

regressions of democracy, including country and year fixed effects, education was not statistically

significant. However, education was strongly related to movement towards democracy in periods in

which the state’s leadership changed (second and fourth columns). As the populations of non-

democracies grow more educated, this lays the ground for movement toward more accountable

government. But the change comes, for the most part, only after the incumbent leader is replaced.

           One conceivable alternative interpretation is that the democracy coders take leadership change

itself to be a sign of democratization. In fact, of the 1,126 cases in the data of leader change in non-

democracies, only 84 were coded as transitions to democracy. Clearly, the coders do not equate the two.

Even if they did, that would not explain why the effect of income is greater after a leader is replaced.18


17   But note that a Fisher test of the residuals raises doubts about the stationarity of the 20-year panel.

18 Londregan and Poole (1996) found that leadership change and regime change were not related in their dataset.

The 1,126 leader replacements do not include cases of natural death, suicide, or retirement for ill health, and
exclude six cases where data on the regime in the following period were missing.

                                                            13
        That economic development matters mostly after leaders change helps to explain why one finds

no simple relationship between income and democracy in 1960-2000. Table A2 in the appendix shows

regressions similar to those in Table 2 for just this period. Statistical significance is weaker, as one

might expect given the smaller number of cases and the historically low rate of leadership turnover

after 1960 (see Section 5), but the results are generally consistent, especially for education.

        Another perspective on these results is offered by the record of political change in countries

where an authoritarian leader was lucky or skilled enough to preside over an extended period of rapid

growth. In the data there were 15 leaders under whose rule income per capita increased by at least 150

percent. Two of these—Konrad Adenauer of West Germany and Seretse Khama of Botswana—headed

governments in democracies (average Polity2 scores under their leadership of six or higher). Under

each of the other 13, the average Polity2 score was negative, indicating quite repressive non-

democracies. These “developmental dictators” are listed in Table 3.

        With the exception of Tunisia’s President Bourguiba, who during 30 years in power increased

his country’s Polity2 score by one point on the 21-point scale, none of these leaders left his country

more democratic than he found it, and a number exploited favorable economic conditions to reduce

political freedom. 19 (Of course, this partly reflects a selection effect: those dictators who did

democratize early on were more likely to lose office before their countries could achieve large increases

in income.) What is noteworthy is what happened after these developmental dictators lost power. In 10

of the 13 cases, the next 10 years saw movement towards democracy—often a dramatic breakthrough.

A decade after the deaths of Spain’s Generalissimo Franco, Portugal’s Prime Minister Salazar, and

South Korea’s General Park, their countries had leapt from dictatorship to democracy (Polity2 > 5).

Ten years after Indonesia’s General Suharto, Bulgaria’s First Secretary Zhivkov, and Mongolia’s

General Secretary Tsedenbal were forced out, their countries had also become democracies. In each

case, the country rapidly closed the gap that had opened under its former dictator between its stagnant

political institutions and its increased level of economic development.



19In some cases (e.g. Franco, Suharto), there is a little ambiguity because the Polity2 score rises in the year the
dictator left office. I assume in these cases that the improvement occurred after the dictator’s replacement.

             Not all countries made such a large jump. Taiwan’s democratization took a little longer but

   was equally dramatic when it arrived. Tunisia after Bourguiba and Iran after the Shah merely became

   slightly more pluralistic dictatorships. Libya after King Idris, China after Deng, and Singapore after

   Lee Kuan Yew recorded no increase in political freedom at all. Still, the average rise in the Polity2

   score in these 13 countries in the 10 years after the dictator fell, +8.5, is much larger than the average

   change in all 10-year periods for countries that started out as non-democracies, +1.0.20




   4 What causes leadership change?
   If higher income only leads to greater democracy when the ruler is replaced, what causes political

   leaders to fall from power? So far I have treated such turnover as exogenous. But, of course, it may

   20 If we lowered the threshold to consider all authoritarian countries where a leader doubled GDP per capita, this

   would reduce the average jump in the decade following the leader’s exit to +7.5 points. The additional six cases
   include two in which the dictator’s fall was followed by a leap to democracy (Hungary after Kadar and Paraguay
   after Stroessner), one intermediate case (Malaysia after Mahatir bin Mohammad: +3 points as of seven years
   later), and three in which there was no increase in political freedom (Saudi Arabia after Faisal, South Yemen after
   Ali Rubayyi: 0 points; and Jordan after King Hussein: -1 point).

                                                               15
itself be influenced by economic—and other—factors. In this section, building on previous work, I

estimate the determinants of leadership change.

        What might explain different rates of turnover? The nature of the regime and its formal

procedures for selecting top officials are obviously relevant (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003). In

democracies—especially those with short term limits—leaders are likely to change more often than in

autocracies. Among authoritarian regimes, turnover may be greater in some types than in others

(Geddes 1999). Dynastic monarchies aim to limit change to the aftermath of a ruler’s natural death. In

military regimes, generals may rotate in and out of political posts. Autocracies that use pseudo- or

partly democratic institutions such as elected legislatures to coopt opposition may achieve greater

stability (Gandhi and Przeworski 2007). On the other hand, it may be only regimes that already feel

threatened that resort to such strategies.

        Characteristics of individual leaders may also affect their tenure. Older rulers may be more

vulnerable to challenges, although those with greater experience may handle threats more adeptly

(Londregan and Poole 1996, Bienen and van de Walle 1991). The passage of time may help incumbents

to secure themselves, but discontent may also cumulate, rendering the effect of time unclear

(Londregan and Poole 1996). Wars are bound to matter (Bueno de Mesquita and Siverson 1995,

Chiozza and Goemans 2004). During a civil war, rulers are more likely to be overthrown. Almost by

definition, a ruler who loses a civil war is likely to fall, and one who wins is more likely to survive. The

implications of external war are less obvious. They may cause citizens to rally behind their

commander-in-chief, but they may also destabilize the incumbent. Victory should improve the leader’s

prospects, while defeat may prompt externally imposed or internally generated change. Finally,

stability or instability may spread across borders: the fall of one country’s ruler may encourage regime

opponents in others, producing regional waves of turnover.

        All these factors have been examined in previous work so I control for them here. But my key

hypothesis is that economic growth increases a leader’s odds of survival. I also look to see if the level of

economic development has a direct effect. And, motivated by earlier work, I check whether growth

affects turnover differently in democracies and non-democracies (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003).


                                                    16
           Scholars have used various statistical methods to analyze leadership change. I show results

with four alternative models. The dependent variable in each is a dummy that equals 1 if the leader is

replaced and 0 otherwise.21 First, to control for country and year in a way that parallels the previous

analysis, I estimate the relationship by OLS with country and year fixed effects. Second, to better

accommodate the non-linear nature of the dependent variable, I use a conditional logit fixed effects

model, including year dummies. I run both of these models on country-year data. Some papers have

analyzed leader-year data with hazard models (e.g., Chiozza and Goemans 2004). These have a

number of attractive features. For instance, besides gauging the impact of independent variables, one

can calculate a hazard rate at which leaders are replaced on average, other things equal. As in Bueno

de Mesquita and Smith (2010), I fit a Weibull hazard model, which allows the hazard rate to change

over time; how it changes depends on an “ancillary parameter,” p, which is estimated from the data. I

model this parameter as a function of whether the country is a democracy (Polity2 greater than 5).22

           One concern is that regressions of leader replacement on economic growth might pick up the

opposite causal process: more leadership change might, by creating uncertainty for investors, inhibit

growth. To address this, I estimate a model instrumenting for the growth rate with a trade-weighted

measure of average growth in all other countries. Specifically, the instrument is:

                                        g at   abt 1Ibt gbt                  I
                                                                               abt 1 bt                               (2)
                                                 ba                     ba


where g bt is the growth rate of GDP per capita in country b in period t; Ibt is an indicator that takes

the value one if the dataset includes data on growth in country b in period t and 0 otherwise; and

abt 1  X abt 1 / Yat 1 , where X abt 1   is trade between a and b in period t-1, and Yat 1 is country a’s GDP

in period t-1. The trade data come from Russett, Oneal, and Berbaum (2003); since these data end in



21 I code as 0 cases in which the leader died in office of natural causes, committed suicide, or retired because of ill

health as I wish to focus on removal through social action; of course, suicide and ill health might be prompted by
the stress of leadership challenges, but they will often be exogenous to such processes.

22   Bueno de Mesquita and Smith (2010) model this as a function of what they call “coalition size”. The Weibull
                                                 p 1
function can be written: h(t )  p exp( X  )t          , where h ( t ) is the hazard at time t, p is the ancillary “shape”
parameter,     X is a vector of explanatory factors, and  is a vector of their estimated coefficients.

                                                                    17
1992, I use the trade weights from 1992 for the years 1993-2008. Trade-weighted growth in other

countries is strongly correlated with growth in the first stage regression.23

        The main finding in Table 4 is that, as hypothesized, economic growth is a highly significant

determinant of the turnover of leaders. Where growth is higher, leaders are less likely to be replaced.

The coefficients cannot be compared directly across different methods of estimation, but growth is

statistically significant in all. In columns 3, 5, and 7, the interaction of growth with democracy is also

statistically significant and positive, implying that the effect of growth on leader survival is greater in

non-democracies than in democracies. (However, the interaction is not significant in the models with

multiple controls.)24 The estimates from the Weibull models in columns 7-8 imply that each additional

percentage point of growth reduces the hazard rate by 3-5 percentage points for leaders of non-

democracies, and by about 2 percentage points for leaders of democracies.

        Columns 3 and 4 suggest that the impact of growth on leader survival may, indeed, be causal.

No instrument is perfect. One can think of ways in which the exclusion restriction might fail; higher

growth in other countries might affect leadership turnover in the given country by influencing the

frequency of wars, for instance. Still, the results in columns 3 and 4 increase confidence that lower

growth causes more frequent leader replacement, and the estimated effect when instrumented is

considerably larger than that in columns 1 and 2. Leadership turnover does not appear to be related to

the level of income. With controls included—and generally even without—the coefficient on log GDP

per capita is close to zero and statistically insignificant.

        As expected, regime type also matters. Consistent with previous work, leaders are replaced

more often in democracies (Londregan and Poole 1996, Bueno de Mesquita and Smith 2010). I use the

rescaled Polity2 index in the basic regressions, but a dummy for Polity2 > 5 in those that control for



23This instrument is similar to one that AJRY (2008) use for per capita income. Although I tried to instrument for
income using an instrument corresponding to theirs, in the larger dataset used in this paper the instrument was
too weakly correlated with income to serve adequately.

24Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003) similarly find that economic growth has a greater effect in non-democracies
(small-coalition systems); however, they argue that the incentive to pursue growth will still be stronger in
democracies because they have a much higher baseline hazard rate (from estimates of the ancillary parameter).
My aim here is not to compare the motivation to promote growth under democracy and autocracy but just to show
that for dictators securing a higher growth rate is an effective way to reduce the odds of being deposed.

types of authoritarian regime, since these controls overlap with what Polity2 is supposed to measure.

Besides the coefficients on the democracy terms, estimates of the ancillary parameter suggest the

shape of the hazard function differs for democracies and non-democracies: the odds of losing office

fall over time in both, but much faster in non-democracies. For example, using model 8, in a non-

democracy the leader’s hazard rate after five years is just one third of his hazard rate after one

month; in a democracy, the rate after five years is still three quarters of the one-month rate.25

            Among the other controls, those related to war were most significant. A leader fighting a

civil war—or who had just lost one—was more likely to be deposed.26 Victory in a civil war was

associated with lower odds. The results for interstate war were less clear, but winning one may have

increased—and losing decreased—the leader’s tenure. In the hazard model, a leader’s age and more

previous spells in government were both associated with higher odds of replacement, but the longer

he had been in office this time, the lower were the odds.27 A faster rate of turnover in the region also

implied lower survival odds. However, none of these findings was significant when estimated in

country-year data with linear models or conditional logit, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity of

countries. Military regimes may replace leaders more often than other types of autocracy.

           These findings are generally consistent with those of Londregan and Poole (1996) and Bueno

de Mesquita and Smith (2010), who also analyzed the causes of leadership turnover. This is

interesting, in itself, since I am able to include a much larger number of data points, extending

further back in time, and to show that various results hold using a number of different estimation

methods.28 Neither of these papers instrumented for economic growth.29


25   The parameter p is exp(-.32 + .25) = .93 for democracies and exp(-.32) = .73 for non-democracies. Thus, the

ratio of the hazard rate after 60 months to that after one month is .93 exp( X  )60                 / .93 exp( X  )1       .75

for democracies and .73 exp( X  )60          / .73 exp( X  )1         .33 for non-democracies.

26   As in prior papers, I focus on civil wars that cause 1,000 battle-related combatant deaths within 12 months.

27 This is consistent with Bienen and van de Walle (1991), but not Londregan and Poole (1996); Bueno de

Mesquita and Smith (2010) found that age lowered survival for leaders of non-democracies, but not democracies.

28 In their leadership change regressions, Londregan and Poole (1996) report 2,707-2,798 observations, from

1952-1985; Bueno de Mesquita and Smith’s (2010) regressions include 1,452-5,831 observations, from 1960-
2000. Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003, p.303) report regressions for the impact of growth on leader survival that

                                                                  21
        The Archigos database distinguishes four ways leaders leave office. Besides death from

natural causes and removal by another state, they may be replaced in a “regular” or an “irregular”

manner. “Regular” replacements occur “according to the prevailing rules, provisions, conventions,

and norms of the country” (Goemans et al. 2009, p.272). Although such turnovers are the rule in

democracies, they also occur in authoritarian regimes, as, for instance, when an heir inherits the

throne in a dynastic monarchy. “Irregular” replacements occur amid abnormal events such as

military coups or popular revolts. In Table A3 in the appendix, I analyze regular and irregular

leadership change separately. Higher economic growth reduces the odds of being removed from office

in either a regular or an irregular manner; for both, growth may matter more in non-democracies

than in democracies. And, as before, the instrumental variables regressions suggest that the effect of

growth is much larger once endogeneity is taken into account.30

        In sum, dictators have an incentive to support economic growth since this increases their

odds of survival. Of course, this holds other things equal. Other survival strategies—such as

expropriating businesses to enrich key supporters—may depress growth (Bueno de Mesquita et al.

2003), so autocrats trade off the marginal benefit of growth against those of alternative approaches.

Dictators who control copious free resources in the form of oil rents or unconditional foreign aid may

focus on patronage and repression rather than stimulating the economy (Bueno de Mesquita and

Smith 2009). Still, economic downturns are such a familiar engine of public protest in authoritarian

states that dictators try hard to avoid them. From Tunisia’s Ben Ali to Chile’s Pinochet, many have



include 5,821 data points. Using Maddison’s GDP estimates, I am able to include 6,872-10,757 observations,
going back to 1875 in some cases. At times, broader time coverage requires dropping controls for which data
availability is a problem. My strategy is to include full sets of country and year dummies to pick up much of the
unobserved heterogeneity. Londregan and Poole also included country but not year fixed effects. Bueno de
Mesquita and Smith (2010) and Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003) used only hazard models without fixed effects.

29 Campante and Chor (2011) argue that the frustrated ambitions of over-educated youths increase the pressure

on incumbent leaders, accelerating turnover. In a panel of countries between 1976 and 2010, they show that, for
a given level of national income, the more educated the population was, the more frequently its leaders were
replaced. Since using even the most comprehensive data available on education levels would require a drastic
drop in coverage, I do not include controls for education and its interaction with income here. In regressions that
do control for these (not shown), the results for growth are similar (sometimes slightly less significant), and the
estimated effects of education and its interaction are generally consistent with Campante and Chor’s argument.

30The income level is not a significant determinant of either type of leadership change. Being in a civil war—
and having just lost one—were associated with higher odds of irregular, but not regular, replacement.

sought to ensure at least moderate growth. By the time these dictators did leave office, their

countries had become much more developed, enhancing the prospects of a political opening.




5 The global dimension

I have shown the relationship between economic growth and leadership change in individual

countries. But what about the world as a whole? Global economic progress is far from even.

Countries periodically succumb to recessions that spread across borders. One might expect to see

such economic contractions reflected in the rates of leadership turnover around the world. Economic

downturns are known to affect political attitudes. In the US, distrust of the national authorities rises

during recessions. During the recent international financial crisis, trust in government fell more in

those countries where unemployment rose the most (Stevenson and Wolfers 2011).

        To examine this, I constructed time series of the average growth rate in the world, the

proportion of countries experiencing negative growth—which is one definition of recession—and the

proportion of countries in which the leader was replaced. Table 5 reports two error correction models

that estimate both the long run equilibrium and short run dynamic relationships between economic

performance in the world and leadership turnover. The models take the form:

                        lt    g t   lt 1   g t 1   d t 1   yeart  ut           (3)

where l t is the proportion of countries that replaced their leader in period t; g t is either the average

growth rate of GDP per capita in all countries in period t (model 1) or the proportion of countries

with negative growth rates (model 2); d t is the average democracy score in all countries in t; yeart is

a variable equal to the year; and u t is a random error. I control for the world average democracy level

because we know from Table 4 that leadership turnover is higher in democracies. I also control for

year to allow for a possible long-term trend (the regressions confirm a downward trend). Finally, I

test the residuals from these regressions for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey Fuller and

Phillips Perron tests and show that we can reject with high confidence that they have a unit root.

           The results in Table 5 suggest there are, indeed, both long and short run relationships

between the state of the world economy and the rate of leadership change. In the short run, a one

percentage point fall in the average growth rate worldwide—as occurred, for instance, in 1961—

translates into a 0.6 percentage point increase in the number of countries where leaders are

replaced. A 10 percentage point increase in the number of countries with negative growth—as in

2001—is associated with an immediate 1.1 percentage point increase in the number of countries with

leadership change (which, in 2001, would mean about two additional leaders deposed).

           Besides the short run effect, leadership turnover and the proportion of countries with

negative growth are in a long run equilibrium: the more countries with contracting economies, the

more leadership change.31 To see the size of the total effect, it is useful to simulate a major global


31   There is probably also a relationship with the average growth rate, but it is significant at only p = .13.

downturn like that of the 1930s. Fixing the average level of democracy worldwide at its 1928 level,

and starting the rate of leadership turnover at its equilibrium level given the other variables, I

calculated what path of leadership change in the following years was implied by the pattern of actual

economic growth (using the model in Table 5, column 2). The share of countries with negative growth

increased from 23 percent in 1928 to 81 percent in 1931, before falling back to 21 percent in 1937.

Compared to the leadership change to be expected had the proportion of countries with negative

growth remained 23 percent, the model implies a rate of turnover higher by one percentage point in

1929, five points in 1930, and seven points in 1931 and 1932, after which the rate would have fallen

back to around its starting level by 1935. In combination, these higher rates would have resulted in

leaders being replaced in an additional 18 country-years.32

        In short, global recessions and depressions lubricate the system, increasing leader turnover.

This does not by itself produce greater democracy. What regime results when a ruler falls depends in

part on the country’s level of economic development. In poorer democracies, the incumbent’s

departure may prompt reversion to dictatorship, as in 1930s Europe. But for those non-democracies

that have reached a high national income, the odds favor transition to democracy.

        Finally, analysis of the global rate of leadership turnover suggests one reason why since

World War II the link between income and democracy has seemed to weaken. As Figure 1 shows, the

rate of leadership change in non-democracies has trended down since the early 20th Century, and it

has been at a historic low since 1950. If, as argued, economic development affects the political regime

mostly in periods after leadership change, lower ruler turnover should result in a weaker—and

harder to detect—relationship between income and democracy.

        Why were leaders changed less frequently in recent decades? Superpower competition during

the Cold War may have enabled dictators to bid for aid from Washington or Moscow, helping them

resist domestic challenges (Boix 2009). However, the rate remained low even after the Cold War’s

end. In the 1950s and 1960s, unusually broad and stable economic growth may have depressed


32I multiply the annual increments in the proportion of countries predicted to replace leaders by the number of
countries for which there were data in these years (67 to 69). Since some of the cases of turnover might have
been in the same countries, we cannot say in exactly how many countries change would have occurred.

                                                      25
turnover, as described here. Between 1946 and 1973, the share of countries where GDP per capita

fell was consistently low. However, severe recessions returned after the 1970s, so this cannot be the

whole explanation. In part, decreasing turnover probably reflects a selection effect: as more

autocracies turn democratic, those left are the hardest cases—countries whose dictators are

entrenched particularly securely or enjoy some unusual advantage such as vast mineral wealth. As

the balance among the world’s autocracies shifts from the likes of PRI Mexico and Greece’s generals

to Kim Jong Il’s North Korea and the Persian Gulf emirates, leadership change becomes rarer.

6 Conclusion
In Lectures on the Philosophy of World History, Hegel gave the name “the cunning of reason” to the

way great leaders, driven only by the “energy of their ego,” and seeking their own self-

aggrandizement, were unwittingly used by history for its own purposes (Hegel 1980 [1837], pp.86-9).

                                                           26
A Napoleon Bonaparte or a Julius Caesar sought only personal power and glory. Yet such men

became the tools by which outmoded political orders were destroyed and ever more universal forms

of the state brought into being. Of course, the logic identified here is not exactly Hegel’s; the notion

that economic development drives political change is closer to Marx. But the idea that autocrats,

merely by trying to ensure their supremacy and survive a little longer, end up preparing their

countries—and the world—for breakthroughs to democracy does have a Hegelian flavor.

        Dictators like Tunisia’s Ben Ali promote their countries’ economic development because

higher growth each year decreases the odds that they will be overthrown. Although some pretend

otherwise, most do not see themselves as preparing the ground for democracy after they depart. In

the short run, rising incomes allow them to freeze or even curtail political freedoms and popular

participation. But when they are eventually forced out—whether by a drop in growth, a civil war, or

some other shock—the level of income that their survival strategy has produced over the years

influences whether or not the country jumps to a higher level of democracy.

        Worldwide, this self-interested behavior of dictators produces a kind of democratic ratchet.

Periodic global or regional recessions turf out incumbent leaders at a higher rate than usual. When

recession comes after years of subterranean modernization within autocratic regimes, the extra

turnover translates into a wave of democratization. Neither economic development nor leadership

change by itself produces democracy, but together they increase the odds of transition. As long as

countries continue getting richer, better educated, and more modern in other respects, the screw

turns in one direction. In rich democracies, recessions also overturn incumbent leaders, although the

effect is weaker than in autocracies. But there is no sign that this threatens democracy.33

        It is worth restating that, empirically, it is the level of income, not recent growth, that is

associated with more accountable government. A high level of income stands in for many aspects of

modernity—broad and deep education, social complexity, communications technology, liberal


33 I ran regressions corresponding to those in Table 2, Panel A, but for just countries with Polity2 scores of 6 or

higher. The coefficient on ln GDP per capita interacted with leadership turnover was always either insignificant
or significant and positive, suggesting that even for countries near the top of the democracy scale, higher income
when accompanied by leadership turnover leads to more democracy. However, the relatively small number of
cases and the severe censoring issue in this subset dictates caution with regard to these results.

                                                        27
values—that increase the demand for and ability to sustain democracy. By contrast, the immediate

effect of high growth is to strengthen the incumbent ruler, reducing pressure for reform. Of course,

over time growth leads to high income, which, after the leader falls, increases the odds of a jump to

democracy. But poor countries can grow for some time before getting very rich. And relatively rich

and modern countries, even if growth stalls for a while, do not lose the ability to sustain democracy.

       This logic can explain the pattern of “two steps forward, one step back,” in which waves of

democratization are followed by stasis or even temporary reversions (Huntington 1991). The world

economy and the economies of subregions also exhibit a wave-like pattern of change. During periods

of high, relatively stable growth, incumbents—whether in democracies or autocracies—can entrench

themselves; those so inclined can use their popularity and increased budget revenues to curb popular

control. As Diamond notes, in developing countries from Nigeria to the Philippines executive abuses

have recently eroded democracy despite robust economic performance (2011, p.21). For a while, the

levels of democracy and economic development can get out of synch. But this increases the gap to be

crossed quickly when leadership change once again puts constitutional questions on the agenda.

        The logic also explains why modernization theory often seems at odds with current events,

and why breakthroughs to more accountable government frequently come as a surprise. Under

Brezhnev, Soviet society grew more educated, urban, and differentiated, without any sign of

democratization. In retrospect, we see that this prepared the ground for a significant leap forward

under Mikhail Gorbachev. In Indonesia under Suharto, per capita GDP more than tripled (Table 3).

Yet, two years before the general was forced out by street protests, his autocratic regime seemed to

informed observers more secure than ever (Liddle 2007). That democracy made almost no inroads in

North Africa and the Persian Gulf before the recent uprisings does not mean that these states will

not democratize in the future; it suggests they may move quickly once they start. Similarly, the

doubling of GDP per capita in Russia between 1998 and 2008 alongside the gradual hollowing out of

democratic institutions does not show that income and democracy are unrelated. It suggests a gap

has opened that may be closed faster than many expect.




                                                  28
       As usual, various caveats need to be considered. To have identified a pattern in the statistics

does not guarantee that the same pattern will continue to hold. History often changes direction. As

noted, leadership turnover in the remaining authoritarian states has been slowing since the early

20th Century. If this continues, shifts from dictatorship to democracy may become both rarer and

more extreme. It is also possible that as authoritarian government becomes increasingly restricted to

totalitarian regimes and oil states the processes witnessed to date may no longer operate.

       Although economic development is associated with democracy, that does not mean historical

junctures do not also matter. The country fixed effects capture the influence of such factors; many

are statistically significant, with large coefficients. For instance, in the 20-year panel in Table 1,

Panel B (1820-2008), the country fixed effects range from a high of .18 for India—suggesting it is

more democratic than predicted given its income—to a low of -1.44 for Qatar—which is far less

democratic than expected. The year fixed effects are also important. These increase through the 19th

Century until around the First World War, then oscillate in a range until the 1980s, when they shoot

up again. Controlling for income, countries were far more likely to become more democratic after

1985 than in previous eras. Of course, country and year dummies do not in themselves explain the

variation they capture. The statistical “horse race” between a single meaningful variable such as

income or education and scores or hundreds of meaningless dummies is hardly a fair contest. The

real challenge for believers in critical junctures is to define and measure a parsimonious set of

substantive variables that capture the historical causes of countries’ divergent paths and to show

that these fit the variation in democracy more closely than does income.

Income and Democracy, alternative formulations, extensions and
robustness checks
In Table A1, Panel A, I regress the Polity2 index on income for all countries whose Polity2 score in

the previous period was less than a perfect +10. Income is significantly related to democracy in the

10- to 20-year panels. To address the censored data problem, Benhabib et al. (2011) use an estimator

developed by Alan, Honoré, and Leth-Petersen (2008) that allows for censoring at the top and bottom

while also incorporating fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity. Panel B shows results

with this estimator, run using the STATA routine provided by Honoré.34 In the 10, 15, and 20-year

panels, I was able to include year fixed effects as well. In the 5-year and annual panels, this was not

possible because of the large number of parameters. Income is statistically significant in all panels,

with the magnitude of the effect increasing as panel frequency falls.

           The standard fixed effect OLS model in equation (1) can yield biased estimates because the

lagged dependent variable, dit-1, will be mechanically correlated with the error term for all periods

before t. To deal with this, AJRY (2008) also estimate using the dynamic GMM estimator of Arellano

and Bond. In Panel C I do the same, using the full 1820-2008 data, but excluding countries that

already had perfect democracy scores. The Arellano-Bond procedure is appropriate for panels with

few time periods relative to the number of units. This is clearly not the case for the annual data—in

fact, STATA was unable to estimate the model—so I show results for panels of from 5 to 20 years. In

the first three cases I instrument for both democracy and income with their second lags; in the 20

year panel, I include a second lag of the dependent variable to reduce autocorrelation and

instrument with the third lag of democracy and the second lag of income. The results follow the

familiar pattern, with the effect of income increasing as the panel interval grows, at least up to a

frequency of 15 years.

           The apparently greater impact of income in lower frequency panels might reflect merely the

larger share of pre-1945 observations in such panels; the proportion of these rises mechanically as

34   The STATA routine is available at Bo Honoré’s website, www.princeton.edu/~honore/stata/index.html.

                                                       33
the gap between panel years lengthens. Panel D shows that the same pattern of larger and more

significant income effects at medium-to-long panel intervals emerges also in a model run on just the

pre-1945 data. (The smaller number of observations means statistical significance is lower.)

           Countries’ odds of becoming democratic might depend on their past experience with

democracy. Persson and Tabellini (2009) constructed a sophisticated measure of accumulated

democratic experience, which they call “domestic democratic capital.”35 At the same time, the

likelihood of a transition in one country might be influenced by the extent of democracy in other

countries, especially those nearby (Gleditsch and Ward 2006, Gleditsch and Choung 2004).

Democratization tends to come in waves that are concentrated in time and space (Huntington 1991).

Persson and Tabellini also constructed an index of “foreign democratic capital,” which essentially

measures the average level of democracy in other countries, weighted by their distance.36 In panel E,

columns 1-5, I show regressions for 1820-2008, controlling for Persson and Tabellini’s measures of

domestic and foreign democratic capital. The results for income are largely unchanged.37

           Table A2 estimates the relationship between income and democracy, conditional on

leadership change, for just 1960-2000. Although statistical significance is weaker, the relationships

are similar to those in Table 2. Table A3 examines separately the determinants of regular and

irregular leadership change. Table A4 lists data sources.




35They assume this accumulates at a fixed rate in each year a country is democratic (Polity2 > 0) and
depreciates geometrically in years of autocracy. Specifically, domestic democratic capital,

                                                                                     ) (  )t , where i and j index countries, 

measures the distance between i and j, and ρ operationalizes a geographical limit beyond which influence falls
to zero, which they, in fact, estimate from the data.

37Note that this is not a test of the importance of domestic and foreign democratic capital, which are meant as
substantively richer substitutes for the lagged dependent variable and the country and year fixed effects, which
pick up much of the same variation. If the fixed effects and lagged dependent variables are dropped, the two
kinds of democratic capital are highly significant—see panel E, column 6.
