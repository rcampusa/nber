                                         ABSTRACT

Scholars engage in extensive debate about the role of families and corporations in economic
growth. Some propose that personal ties provide a mechanism for overcoming such transactions
costs as asymmetrical information, while others regard familial connections as conduits for
inefficiency, with the potential for nepotism, corruption and exploitation of other stakeholders.
This empirical study is based on a unique panel dataset comprising all of the shareholders in a
sample of early corporations, including information on such characteristics as gender, age,
occupation, household composition, real estate holdings and personal wealth. Related investing
was widespread among directors and elite shareholders, but was also pervasive among women
and small shareholders. Personal ties were especially evident among ordinary investors in the
newer, riskier ventures, and helped to ensure persistence in shareholding. “Outsider investors”
were able to overcome a lack of experience and information by taking advantage of their own
networks. The link between related investing and the concentration of ownership in these
corporations suggests that this phenomenon was likely associated with a reduction in perceptions
of risk, especially beneficial for capital mobilization in emerging ventures. These patterns are
consistent with a more productive interpretation of related investing and its function in newly
developing societies.

I. INTRODUCTION

Related investing refers to investors whose personal ties influence their decisions to enter or exit

the market, the composition of their portfolios, or other actions that they might not otherwise

undertake. Market efficiency is in part defined in terms of depersonalized transactions, so many

analysts regard related investing as a sign of the existence of inefficiencies. Some claim that the

exploitation of family networks offers a haven for potential redistributive or criminal activity.

Even if personalized interactions were initially prevalent because of productive reasons, it is

commonly contended that such connections should tend to diminish in importance as financial

markets and the economy matured. Most notably, Sir Henry Maine (1861) is frequently cited for

his proposal that societies evolve from communal relationships based on status or ascribed ties,

to contracting by autonomous actors. Thus, related investing is typically viewed as a temporary

phenomenon, and its persistence is associated with anomalous deviations from optimality, or

outright corruption. As the economy evolves, according to this perspective, one might expect

that transactions costs would fall, and that a transition would occur towards the arguably more

efficient state of depersonalized exchange.

       This evolutionary assumption is evident in the work of John Majewski (1996), who

examined the financing of transportation infrastructure in the antebellum period, drawing on the

experience of six railroad enterprises in Pennsylvania and Virginia. He found that early

expansions in transportation networks were financed by local residents or small investors who

were connected by ties of kinship and social capital or community spirit. Majewski argues that

the development of the Southern economy was retarded by the continued involvement of local

investors, whereas the Northeast expanded in part because its investments evolved away from the

“friends and family” approach towards arms-length professional transactions. Others have raised



                                                 3
the possibility that, while relational investing might be productive in certain circumstances, such

ties might be incompatible with efficiency within some organizational structures, and in

corporations in particular.1

        In today’s developing countries, a parallel extensive debate centers on the role of families

and corporations in economic growth. La Porta et al., (1999) point out that family businesses are

common in many parts of the world, and ownership in such firms is typically not dispersed.

Even though family ownership and control in business enterprise is pervasive, the scholarly

discussion tends to be somewhat skeptical and pessimistic about the contributions of kinship

groups. First, complementary institutions such as legal and political systems may be inefficient

and inadequate to support the needs of the corporate form. Second, research points to problems

in corporate governance, and the potential for the expropriation of shareholders by the groups

that control the company. Minority shareholders and other outside stakeholders can be

expropriated by such practices as nepotism and on-the-job consumption by entrenched family

members. Outside investors face the risk that both internal and external control mechanisms

may be too weak to protect them from “tunneling” or corruption in the firm. Acheson et al.

(2016) study Victorian England, and conclude that the negative effect of family ownership

depended on whether members of the group had control over the governance of the firm. A

survey of the extensive literature on tunneling and malfeasance by families points out that the

empirical context has been somewhat restricted, and calls for expansion of research to pay

attention to other settings (Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar, and Andros Gregoriou 2010).

        Although agency costs may be magnified in the presence of kinship ties among the

managers and leading shareholders, who can form blocks to transfer resources to themselves at

1
 See Ingram and Lifschitz (2006) who argue that kinship ties allowed family firms to reduce the risk of bankruptcy,
but that some types of relational governance conflicted with corporate modes of governance.


                                                         4
the expense of outsiders, groups with relational links can still generate net positive benefits.

Such benefits are especially evident in circumstances where institutional imperfections hinder

market transactions. Family networks can facilitate remedies for market failure, such as

investments in trust and social capital, the ability to monitor group members more effectively,

cheaper enforcement mechanisms, and the use of reputation to reduce informational

asymmetries. Relational contracts may result in stronger commitments or incentives to adhere to

agreements. Although one might expect that such ties would tend to weaken over geographic or

genetic distance, this is not necessarily the case. For instance, Avner Greif (2006) found that

Maghrebi traders formed coalitions that enabled them to overcome obstacles to long distance

trade. These private institutions functioned as commitment devices that enforced agreements

and deterred opportunism among market participants.

        Research on the corporate form of business organizations has tended to focus on the role

of managers, directors, and other elite investors in the firm.2 Naomi Lamoreaux (1996), for

instance, demonstrated the importance of “insider lending” in early U.S. capital markets.3 She

found that elite investors in banks tended to be related to each other, and these owners directed a

significant fraction of the loans in the bank to other insiders. Rather than unproductive

“tunneling,” Lamoreaux finds that relational links in the banking sector were an effective means

of mobilizing capital. Insider lending facilitated risky investments in venture capital for


2
  A significant amount of research on the role of corporations in early American development has focused on issues
in corporate governance (Bodenhorn 2012, Dunlavy 2006, Hilt 2008). In particular, they examine ownership
structures of the firms, and the causes and consequences of different voting rules. For instance, the charters of
corporations sometimes specified graduated voting rights that reduced the degree of control exerted by the largest
shareholders. Hilt analyzed the ownership structure of corporations in New York State in the 1820s, and concludes
that minority shareholders were in danger of being “oppressed” by majority shareholders, but the latter were
checked by corporate charters. Thus minority shareholders were granted disproportionate representation, and this
reduced the cost of capital and enhanced diversification of portfolios. Bodenhorn similarly finds that graduated
voting rules were prevalent in early American banks and were designed to attract small investors.

innovative initiatives as industrialization got underway. Outsiders were quite aware that their

stock purchases in the bank were destined to finance the other enterprises owned by the directors

of the bank. They likely benefited from access to investment opportunities in new ventures, for

the arrangement offered the uneducated investor the opportunity to gain enhanced profits beyond

the banking sector, while diversification reduced risk. Insider lending comprised an efficient

response to supply and demand, whereby outsiders were induced to make investments in the new

industries of the day primarily because of their trust in the reputation and experience of the

prominent families who founded the financial institutions. Familial and other social connections

substituted for incomplete markets and helped to resolve problems that arose in the presence of

such market imperfections as high risk and asymmetrical information.

       The almost universal focus on the role of elite participants in the ownership of firms and

corporations leaves open the question about whether relational connections were pervasive at all

levels of business organization. If family ties were concentrated among elite investors, the

implications for our understanding of the role of such ties would be different from the inference

if these patterns were common to all investors of the time. Indeed, Naomi Tadmor (2001) rejects

the conventional dichotomy between kinship circles and those who are unrelated, arguing that

the family relationship is necessarily both affective and instrumental. However, little empirical

research has been directed to the entire population of participants in the ownership and control of

the firm, nor to the extent and implications of their heterogeneity. Most research tends to be at

the firm level, although within-firm heterogeneity among owners can lead to significant

unobserved variation which necessitates the analysis of the cadre of investors outside the

managerial class. Such characteristics and patterns might have important implications for our

understanding of the nature and consequences of kinship ties in economic development.



                                                 6
        Similarly, although the structure of ownership might be expected to vary over the life

cycle of the firm and over time, the dynamics of firm ownership is still an understudied topic.

Kinship links are predicted to decline over time, but if they are found to have persisted during

economic development in an effective institutional environment, then their existence is less

likely to owe entirely to market imperfections. Helwege et al. (2007) examined how the

ownership of insiders changed over time, and concluded that moral hazard and informational

asymmetries were “irrelevant” to understanding changes in insider ownership. However, such

research does not control for family relationships which, as discussed above, tend to be pervasive

beyond the United States.4 Family ownership can be especially relevant to the dynamics of

shareholding in corporate organizations. Some regard familial relationships as a constraint on

the longevity of the firm, owing to incompetence or nepotism. On the other hand, the internal

incentives of the family unit might be more transparent and observable over time than in the case

of unrelated shareholders. The intergenerational links that characterize family membership can

thus provide a cost-effective signal to outsiders that a firm values continuity and future

exchange.

        This paper examines the nature of related investing at all levels in corporations and how

such patterns changed over time. The analysis is based on a new and unique data set drawn from

the population of investors in all Maine corporations during the antebellum period. The sample

includes information on counties, industries, enterprises, as well as individual investors in banks,

manufacturing firms and transportation enterprises. The shareholders have been matched with

the manuscript population censuses, to provide information on age, occupations and wealth of

individuals and household size. The data include cross-sections of the same firms over time,

4
  Sraer, D. and Thesmar, D. (2007) show that family firms comprised two thirds of enterprises listed on the French
stock exchange in the 1990s, and find that such firms out-performed their widely-held corporate counterparts by
making more effective use of inputs.

which permits the investigation of longitudinal changes in corporate ownership and the structure

of the firm.

       The results confirm the conventional finding that corporate elites tended to be related to

others within the firm. At the same time, nonelites, or the investors who were neither directors

nor the largest shareholders, were also bound by kinship connections. Related investing was

widespread among the ordinary investors, and seems to have been pervasive throughout the firm

and the corporate economy, during the critical period of early industrialization. The universal

nature of relational investing in these data suggests that further attention needs to be paid to the

entire ownership structure and not just to the apex. Family ties were especially evident among

the ordinary investors in emerging industries and in the newer, riskier investments, and may have

played a role in inducing inexperienced investors to contribute to the venture capital of the

period. The overall patterns are consistent with a more productive interpretation of related

investing and its function in developing societies.



II. EARLY CORPORATIONS IN MAINE

From an international perspective, the corporate form of business enterprise has been prevalent

in the United States to a far greater extent than in other countries. Unlike the general perspective

from studies in developed economies at the present time, the conclusions from research in

economic history tend to be more consistent with a favourable interpretation of the link between

corporations and family holdings. Corporations developed rapidly, in tandem with deep and

accessible financial markets in debt and equity. In the American colonies local and interstate

debt contracting were extensive and functioned effectively from the earliest decades (Khan

2008). Many scholars credit financial markets and the spread of the corporate form of business



                                                  8
organization with aiding the rapid industrialization and economic progress of the United States in

the nineteenth century (Irwin and Sylla, 2011).5

        In New England, banks and insurance companies were the first types of corporations with

diffuse ownership, and these enterprises attracted a diverse array of investors, including

relatively risk-averse savers such as trustees, women and the elderly. Banks provided “saver

education” that helped to inform new entrants in the market for corporate capital mobilization,

and both firms and investors in subsequent transportation and manufacturing ventures were able

to benefit from their example. In some instances, banks served as institutional investors which

helped to fund emerging enterprises and industries. Prior research has investigated banking

firms extensively, but a lack of systematic data has made it difficult to ascertain the extent to

which their investors differed from those who funded the “venture capital” of the nineteenth

century, and how these patterns varied over time.

        Records of the Maine experience offer insights into cross-sectional and longitudinal

comparisons of the financial structure of corporations. Maine was an early leader in the

chartering of U.S. business corporations and, as Figure 1 shows, its rate of incorporation

remained competitive with states of much larger populations. The growth in corporate

enterprises reflected a general expansion in the Maine economy across all sectors, ranging from

banks to shipbuilding, fisheries, lumber, and manufacturing. The state was among the nation’s

leaders in many extractive pursuits, most notably shipbuilding and lumber. However, during the

period under review there was a marked structural transformation in the state that was associated

with rapid economic growth in manufacturing and transportation, as well as general

industrialization. The first sawmill in the American colonies was established in Maine in 1634,

5
 For an extremist exposition of this thesis, see Wright (2002) who is convinced that "the root cause of early U.S.
economic growth (1780-1850) . . . is the development of the financial sector, not transportation and communication
improvements, not foreign trade, and not manufacturing firms" (193).

                                                         9
and almost one thousand mills were in operation by 1820. The proliferation of natural resources

and cheap sources of power propelled manufacturing in the “take off” phase during the early

nineteenth century. The area was remarkably rich in inventive inputs, and Maine inventors were

among the most innovative and productive in the nation, accounting for a substantial fraction of

the most valuable patents filed in the United States (Khan 2005). By 1860 the economy was

significantly diversified, the agricultural sector had shrunk to 40 percent, cotton manufacturing

was the fifth highest in the country, and the state ranked ninth overall in U.S. manufacturing.

Some of the largest enterprises in the country were founded in Maine, and their average output,

capital and employment in 1860 were exceeded only by firms in New York and Massachusetts

(Bateman and Weiss, 1975). Thus, the experience of this state in the antebellum period provides

a useful case study of the nature of capital mobilization during early industrialization.

         Maine granted charters to business enterprises through private acts of incorporation until

1875, after which general incorporation laws were passed, implying that the charter applications

for all of the firms in this study were individually vetted and approved by the legislature. In

1839 and 1841 the statutes required all business corporations to record and publish the complete

list of shareholders in the company, and this offers a unique opportunity to assess a panel of

corporate owners during a period of rapid industrialization.6 In 1845, 55 commercial enterprises

were organized as corporations in Maine, with an average of 64 shareholders. The Portsmouth,

Saco and Portland Railroad company was the largest firm in terms of the number of shareholders

(255), whereas the York Manufacturing Corporation had the greatest total capitalization

($1,000,000). During the antebellum period the number of firms and the extent of capitalization

expanded, and by 1855 the number of corporations had increased to 122 firms, with an average

6
  The 1839 law stipulated that banks should file their stockholders’ lists, and the law was extended in 1841 to
include all commercial (for-profit) corporations. The data in this study exclude nonprofit corporations such as
towns, religious and educational institutions.

of 107 shareholders. The largest railroad firms were owned by some one thousand shareholders,

and several corporations now had capital investments that exceeded a million dollars.7

         The data set (Table 1) comprises a random sample of roughly half of all corporations

filing in 1845, 1850 and 1855.8 These include 21 banks in 1845, and 15 nonbank firms; 13

banks and 17 nonbank firms in 1850; and 29 banks and 25 nonbank firms in 1855. The entire

sample includes some 13,900 individual observations of investors in these corporations.

Shareholder lists include the names of the individuals, the amount and/or value of shares held,

and their place of residence. The lists allow us to categorize related investors, who are defined

as individuals within a company who share the same surname. They also enable the

identification of women shareholders, corporate and nonprofit investors, trustees and other proxy

investors, the entire stock portfolio of a given investor, and persistence or turnover in ownership.

The names of stockholders were matched with the federal manuscript censuses in 1850 and

1860, which provided additional information on age, real estate and personal wealth, occupation,

household composition, and marital status.

         At the firm level, the charters that were granted at time of incorporation yielded

additional information on the founding members of the company, governance rules, the initial

capitalization, and stipulations about shareholder liability.9 These corporate charters provided

insights into restrictions on directors and officers of the corporation, voting rights, accounting

  The Atlantic &St Lawrence Railroad had 1747 shareholders, and the Androscoggin & Kennebec Railroad had
1221 shareholders. The Portland, Saco & Portsmouth Railroad had grown to 958 shareholders. The Boston &

Portland, Saco and Portsmouth Railroad, the York Manufacturing Corporation, and the Lewiston Water Power
Company.

  Dick Sylla and Robert E. Wright generously provided access to their database of corporate charters in Maine,
which supplemented the sample information on charters. The provisions of Maine corporate charters between 1840
and 1855 specified that the director should live in-state (40.4 % of all charters), directors had to be shareholders
(37.4%), number of directors (72.5 %), officers had to give a bond (33.3%). Proxy voting was allowed in all cases,
and graduated voting schemes were stipulated in 37.4 % of the charters, with only 2.9 % that allowed one vote per
person (Carlson 2007).

standards, and disclosure requirements. It is significant to note that Maine was an early

innovator in disclosure rules that were intended to protect outside investors: almost three-

quarters of the charters required the firm to offer financial statements to shareholders, and in

many cases shareholders had the right to inspect the books of the firm at any time. Each

enterprise is associated with a date of incorporation (and thus the age of the firm), limited

liability status, industry, total number of shareholders, total capitalization at par value (paid-in

capital for some), the names of the directors, presidents and other officers, and measures of

ownership concentration. Finally, county-level variables include population and its density, and

economic activity such as the percentage of employment and output in manufacturing, aggregate

estimated wealth from tax records, and urbanization.

       Many of these corporations under review were successful at the national, and even the

international, level. For instance, the North Wayne Scythe Company of Kennebec County was

chartered in 1848, by Reuben B. Dunn and J. E. T. Dunn, along with four other founding

members. Reuben Dunn was the President of the company, and he remained the majority

shareholder, with $67,500 in shares. The initial authorized capitalization of the enterprise was

$300,000, but in 1850 only $130,200 was paid in. The firm manufactured scythes and other

tools and implements, and ultimately grew to become the largest scythe manufactory in the

world. North Wayne scythes were awarded the first prize, a silver medal, at the 1851 Crystal

Palace Exhibition in London, England. During the Civil War a military contract for ten thousand

sword blades was granted and filled for the United States Government.



III. GENERAL PATTERNS OF SHAREHOLDING




                                                  12
This section considers general patterns of shareholding during the antebellum period, and

identifies the characteristics of safer, low-risk investments in the banking sector, relative to

newer and riskier ventures in the incipient manufacturing industry and transportation enterprises.

Banking and securities markets have been well-researched, especially financial centers such as

Boston, Philadelphia and New York, which were extensive and integrated by the end of the

eighteenth century (Bodenhorn 2000, Wright 2002). Lamoreaux (1996) shows that, in terms of

formal banking institutions, Maine was somewhat behind its Northeastern counterparts, but its

per capita access to funds was on par with the national average. Significantly less research has

been directed to the study of financial debt in “frontier regions,” although empirical evidence

does support the view that such markets were active and liquid from the earliest days of

settlement in the American colonies (Khan, 2008).

       A key question for understanding the process and extent of capital mobilization is the

geographical origins of investors. If shareholders reside in distant locations, it suggests that

information is cheaply available, or else that mechanisms to reduce transactions costs exist.

Localization of adequate sources of funding, on the other hand, could point to a fairly

sophisticated domestic financial system. Changes in these patterns over time offer insights into

the evolution of capital markets. Table 2 therefore presents the distribution of shareholding by

residence and industry over time. The residence of shareholders varies significantly by type of

industry, although in all cases the percentage of domestic investors increases over time. Banks

were predominantly owned by local residents, and over eighty percent of their shareholders lived

in Maine, a proximity that reduced investor risk and transactions costs. As might be expected,

nonresident investors had addresses in nearby states such as Massachusetts, and very few

stockholders were truly foreign (from other countries).



                                                  13
        It is interesting to note, by way of contrast, that manufacturing shares initially were

primarily owned by investors from out of state. However, this percentage fell over time, and in

the 1850s local residents accounted for the majority of the value of capital invested, indicating

that they held larger average numbers of shares of the company than the nonresidents.

Transportation was a volatile and risky industry, with booms and waves of bankruptcies from

turnpikes through railroads and the capital structure of transportation corporations similarly

experiences a marked change over time.10 Initially, out-of-state investors comprised almost two

thirds of the shareholders, but in the 1850s this pattern is reversed, and there is a significant

move towards local ownership of transportation corporations. These results are consistent with

the view that, over the course of economic development, a process of “investor education” was

underway. By the end of the antebellum era, Maine residents were adopting riskier portfolios,

and in the process, they provided funding for the enterprises that would contribute to the course

of industrialization and rapid economic growth that occurred during this period.11

        Alexander Gerschenkron had pointed to the special role of banks in promoting economic

development. Table 3 provides a useful perspective on the contribution of banks, bankers, and

other financial sector transactors in funding the growth process. Banks themselves were owned

by investors with links to finance, but these individuals accounted for only one third of bank

shares. Instead, it is interesting to note that almost one quarter of bank shares were owned by

investors with primary links to manufacturing, highlighting the symbiotic relationship which

Lamoreaux (1996) had identified. Only 15 percent of shares in manufacturing enterprises were

10
   It is not a coincidence that American bankruptcy law was closely tied to the experience of transportation
corporations and, as Skeel (2001, p. 48) points out, “the history of corporate reorganization is the history of
nineteenth-century railroad failure.”
11
   For a study of overall transportation patterns, see Wright and Murphy (2009), showing some 7,000 private U.S.
corporations had been chartered in the antebellum period to operate bridges, canals, ferries, railroads, and roads.
Private capital investment accounted for a significant share of total domestic output; according to Klein and
Majewski (2006) cumulative private sector investment in turnpikes between 1800 and 1830 in the New England and
Middle Atlantic states likely comprised over six percent of 1830 GDP.

                                                        14
owned by manufacturers, with 41.4 percent attributed to bankers and others in related

occupations.12 The role of manufacturers in capitalizing transportation networks is especially

noteworthy. At the other end of the spectrum, artisans and farmers played a relatively minor role

in securities markets throughout the economy, despite their prevalence in the population at large.

        The table also brings to the fore the disproportionately high participation of professionals

and white-collar workers in the financial underwriting of corporate enterprises in all three

sectors. This group might have been expected to be more risk-averse than financiers and

manufacturers, and to have been primarily attracted to the security and low risk of banking

investments. Instead, only 14.9 percent of bank stocks were owned by white-collar workers.

Another striking result is that this class invested more in the manufacturing sector than

shareholders whose occupation was in manufacturing (although obviously the table does not

control for income levels), and comprised the largest proportion of the funders of transportation

corporations. This finding is different from Majewski (1996) who argued that transportation

improvements generated spillover benefits that encouraged farmers to pay for railroads and

turnpikes, even if they were privately unprofitable. While manufacturers certainly benefited

from internal improvements, it is unlikely that professional and white collar workers were

motivated by such externalities.

        Table 4 reveals another departure from previous findings, regarding the role of women in

capital mobilization for firms. The stereotype of women investors points to their tendency to

cluster in the banking sector, which attracts the wealth of “widows and orphans” because of its

familiarity and perceived low risk, derived from fixed-income returns and predictable dividend


12
  See Fear and Kobrak (2010) who examined the role of “banks on board” and found that banks played a significant
role in corporate governance during the second industrial revolution, and this was especially true in the case of
investment banks in the United States before the advent of the Federal Reserve system.

flows. Scholarly arguments tend to be based on quite limited numbers of individuals and

institutions; for instance, Laurence (2008) studies six customers of Hoare’s Bank in England in a

discussion of how women evolved from consumers of banking services to purchasers of stocks.

Women investors in Maine typically owned disproportionately higher shares in bank stocks,

relative to manufacturing and transportation. Women were even the largest shareholders in the

Medomak Bank of Waldboro, and the Exchange Bank of Bangor. The percentage share of

female bank stockholders increased from almost 20 percent in 1845, to 26.1 percent a decade

later. As might be expected, the average size and value of their holdings was lower than those of

male investors. However, over time women’s portfolios increasingly included riskier equity

shares in manufacturing and transportation corporations. Most notable is the rapid increase in

ownership of transportation shares: by 1855 women comprised almost one quarter of investors in

this sector, and the value of their investments had more than tripled to 11.4 percent of shares.

These results are inconsistent with those of such case studies as Majewski’s, which found that

few females invested in transportation stocks; instead, they suggest that women investors in the

antebellum period may have been more similar to their male counterparts. Women were

increasingly drawn into underwriting securities in riskier, newer ventures, in which it might be

expected they would tend to have possessed little information or experience.

       These patterns raise the question of the mechanisms that underlay investors’ portfolio

decision-making. Laurence (2008) argues that, in England, both the business of the bank and

investments in the stock market occurred within the context of groups who were linked by

kinship, religion, and other noneconomic ties. This is a plausible hypothesis but, again, such

studies are limited to a few examples in a single industry. It would therefore be useful to

examine the extent to which related investing was prevalent, not just in a single sector, but across



                                                 16
the entire economy, and how these practices varied during the process of economic

transformation. The next section investigates the role of family connections in the mobilization

of capital during this period.



IV. RELATED INVESTING

The brothers of the Richardson family of Portland, Maine were all prosperous merchants in the

East India trade who, along with several other family members, became key insiders in some of

the most important new Maine ventures. Joshua Richardson was a Maine-born founder of the

Cumberland Bank in 1813, and also started the Merchants’ Bank with his brothers Israel

Richardson, and William Putnam Richardson. Joshua was involved in the Portland Gas Light

Company, the Portland Manufacturing Company, the Maine Bank, and the Atlantic and St.

Lawrence Railroad. He was an officer in several other firms, and acted as the President and

Chief Executive Officer of the Manufacturers and Traders Bank, in which his mother Eunice

Richardson was also a prominent shareholder.13 According to the census records, Joshua

Richardson held over $20,000 in real estate assets in 1850, while his brother Israel owned

$15,000. William Putnam was subsequently President of the American Insurance Company in

Salem, Massachusetts. In both developed and developing societies today, this network of

interlocking directorships and familial ties would likely raise questions about conflicts of

interest, and the potential for negative outcomes such as tunneling and the exploitation of

“outside” investors.

        Table 5 illustrates the patterns of related investing in banks, manufacturing, and

transportation corporations, by examining the percentage of investors within each industry who

  In 1845 Joshua Richardson held $1100 in shares, whereas Eunice Richardson owned $2100 in the Manufacturers
and Traders Bank.

                                                     17
owned shares in firms where at least one other shareholder was a relative. Contrary to the notion

of the demise of related investing during market expansion, the significance of kinship ties

instead increases significantly during the period of industrialization. In 1845, 40 percent of bank

shareholders could be counted as related investors, a figure which had grown to become almost

half of all shareholding a decade later. This was also true of corporations engaged in

manufacturing and transportation. The importance of kinship ties in manufacturing corporations

increased to the point where more than half of the value of shares was held by related investors.

Again, the most marked change was evident in transportation, where close to 70 percent of

shareholders could be considered as related investors. Unlike manufacturing, related investors in

transportation enterprises held smaller stakes on average, amounting to roughly half of the value

of shares.

       The standard studies of kinship networks in an economic context tend to focus on

corporate insiders, or officers who hold key managerial positions or directorships. Table 6

shows the prevalence of overall ownership and of related investing among such officers,

comprising treasurers, directors, or presidents in Maine corporations. Banks and manufacturing

exhibit similar trends over time. First, the officers of the firm remained roughly the same

fraction of the total number of shareholders: bank insiders comprised around seven percent of all

shareholders; directors and other key officials in manufacturing corporations numbered about

four percent of the shareholders. Second, insiders held disproportionately larger amounts of

capital, and their ownership shares increased significantly over time. By the end of the period,

insiders accounted for approximately 20 percent of the capital in banks, and 23 percent in

manufacturing enterprises. Once again, transportation is notably different from these other




                                                18
industries, with a more “democratic” distribution of shareholders and share value among the

officers of the corporation.

       The distribution of ownership concentration for overall corporate insiders is reflected in

the patterns for related investors. In 1845 a third of all officers were related to another

shareholder in the same firm, and this soon increased to over half of all insiders. Related

investing was largely responsible for the increase in the influence of insiders in both banking and

manufacturing corporations. In banks, related insiders initially owned 5.3 percent of total

capital, and this jumped to 13.5 percent of capital by 1855. Similarly, manufacturing exhibited a

sharp rise in the concentration of shares in the hands of related insiders, to 18 percent of the

capitalization of these firms. In the case of transportation, the level and degree of concentration

was significantly lower, since related inside investors owned no more than 3.6 percent of

outstanding shares.

       Women were far more likely to share a surname with another investor in the same firm.

In some cases, their shares were inherited from male relatives. For instance, in 1840 David

Wooster, a Justice of the Peace in Vinalhaven, owned $700 in the Lime Rock Bank of Rockland,

without any relatives listed in the roster. In 1845, his name does not appear among the bank’s

shareholders, but the records now include Lydia Wooster, a 66-year-old widow with $200 in real

estate wealth, holding $700 in shares of the Lime Rock Bank of Rockland. Her unmarried

daughter, 31-year-old Jane Wooster, who lived in the same household, owned $100 worth of

shares in the same bank. But apart from passively inheriting shares, women were also

represented as shareholders who had made active decisions about how to allocate their wealth.

When the York Bank was first incorporated in 1831, its biggest shareholder was the wealthy




                                                  19
widow Sarah Cleaves, followed by her children, Mary and Daniel.14 In 1845, after the death of

their mother, Mary Cleaves became the majority shareholder, and owned 10 percent of the bank;

whereas, her brother Daniel Cleaves was the second-largest shareholder, and served as the

President of the bank from 1849 through 1865. However, even if they were active investors, it is

impossible to determine whether these female related shareholders made decisions wholly

independently, or whether they were following the advice of relatives with more financial

experience. In any event, the general point is that, whether as active or passive investors, women

were more likely to be involved in financial decisions as part of a family unit.

         We can gain more insights into the characteristics of related investing if we exploit

variation in investments across industries in terms of gender. Table 7 shows that the number of

women shareholders increased from 385 (8.9 percent of the total) in 1845 to 1681 (15.4 percent)

a decade later. In 1845, 57.9 of women appeared on the roster of related investors, growing to 66

percent in 1855, in comparison to the 30.4 percent of men who were related to other shareholders

in 1845, and 54 percent in 1855. Part of the rising prominence of related investors owed to the

experience of women shareholders in transportation enterprises. By the end of the period, 78.5

percent of female stockholders in railroads, turnpikes, bridges, and similar corporations were

related to other investors in the same firm, significantly higher than the 50.7 percent in banks.

The lower prevalence of related investing in the stable banking industry, and the higher

incidence in transportation suggests that kinship ties played a role in attenuating transactions

costs in more venturesome enterprises.15 In particular, it is likely that the burden of these

that time, created from diverse successful investments and businesses in shipping, banking, land, and manufacturing.
Daniel Cleaves Jr. was around 25 years of age when the decision was made to contribute to the founding of the York
Bank.
15
   Majewski (1996) similarly concludes from his study of transportation corporations in two counties in PA and VA,
that kinship was a means of reducing transactions costs (in this case, a free rider problem). He found that 40-50
percent of the shareholders in most of these enterprises shared the same surname.

                                                          20
transactions costs were disproportionately felt by women and other groups that were financially

uneducated, less wealthy, or otherwise disadvantaged at equity investing.

         The notion that related investing aided in the democratization of securities markets is

supported by the kernel density distributions of related and unrelated investors, both in terms of

the value of shareholding (Figure 3) and the amount of real estate wealth in their investment

portfolio (Figure 4).16 Just as in the case of the kernel density estimate of the value of shares

held, there is greater “heaping” for related investors at the lower tails of the distribution of real

estate wealth, as well as in personal wealth (figure not included). The density estimates for the

transportation corporations and other enterprises are noticeably skewed leftward for related

investors, and to a greater extent than in the case of unrelated investors. This result suggests that

the current tendency for researchers to focus almost exclusively on the kinship networks of elite

investors is likely to miss what may be other crucial functions of related investing. Indeed, these

distributions provide visual confirmation that kinship ties were especially relevant for small

investors and individuals who were less wealthy.

         What was the impact of related investing on ownership in the firm? The regressions in

Table 8 examine the effects of related investing, ceteris paribus, on the shareholders’ ownership

stake in the firm, or the fraction of total shares that the individual holds.17 The cross-tabulations

had indicated that banks, manufacturing, and transportation corporations were characterized by

different processes and outcomes. Diffuse ownership in these industries was also determined by

A Gaussian density function was used as the kernel and nonparametric techniques were employed for the density
estimation.
17
   Regressions were also run that allowed the coefficients and intercepts to vary over each time period, and
controlled for the size of the firm in terms of the number of stockholders, and for the age and location of the firm.
These results confirmed that ownership by local Maine residents rose in each subsequent year. Shareholders in
transportation held lower amounts of ownership rights initially, but by 1855 they owned significantly higher
fractions of total equity in corporations. Related investing had grown over time, but the pattern was not due to the
elite insiders in the firm, it was rather because of the higher percentage of shares held by the “outsider” related
investors.

                                                         21
varying factors. For instance, in banking and manufacturing, farming areas were associated with

higher ownership concentration, but in transportation enterprises lower concentration occurred in

more prosperous farming regions. For banks, older firms had lower concentration of shares,

while the opposite was true of railroads. As one would expect, in all corporations directors and

other officers owned larger fractions of shares, and this was especially true of manufacturing

firms. The less advantaged shareholders, such as women investors, owned lower stakes in the

banking and manufacturing enterprises, but they held larger proportions of equity in

transportation. Directors in transportation held higher amounts of shares, but related investors

were associated with concentration to an even greater extent. This result is consistent with the

hypothesis that kinship networks encouraged their members to reduce perceived riskiness of

investments. Related investing arguably promoted a democratization of capital mobilization

during the early industrial period.

       The regressions in Table 9 show the determinants of variation in “persistence,” or the

holding of shares in a company for more than five years. As might be expected, concentrated

ownership (a higher fraction of equity held by an investor) was positively associated with

persistence. Elite officers of the firm, such as the President, were also more likely to retain

shares for longer periods, but occupation in general (such as white-collar status, or financial

backgrounds) was not a significant explanatory factory. Women were more apt to hold shares

for a shorter period, which is perhaps consistent with the notion of passive investing. Perhaps

unexpectedly, manufacturing shareholders tended to be longer-term investors, relative to banking

or transportation. The regression results suggest a positive role for related investing, in

explaining persistence of both elite investors with family ties, as well as the persistence of

nonelite investors.



                                                 22
IV. CONCLUSION

Related investing refers to family ties among the owners of firms, and has been found to be

pervasive in most parts of the world. Research has primarily focused on kinship networks

among elite investors such as corporate insiders, ignoring the characteristics of the rest of the

population of shareholders. From this perspective, related investing in securities markets is

typically held as anomalous and suspect, raising the possibility that insiders are taking advantage

of their family relationships to avoid or manipulate governance oversight. The negative

connotations are highlighted in regions where institutions are opaque and external controls are

nonexistent or ineffective; the use of kinship ties might compound the problem of corruption by

circumventing internal controls within the corporation. In short, related investing has been

regarded with caution because it has the potential to serve as a mechanism through which

resources within the firm are redistributed to the elite owners. Even in studies where personal

ties are acknowledged to play a productive role, such as overcoming transactions costs, it is

generally argued that their influence should decline and disappear as markets become more

developed and impersonal.

       The current project employs a more extensive data set of shareholders and firms than has

previously been available to reexamine the debate about related investing. The scope of

coverage encompasses a period when the economy of Maine was undergoing rapid

industrialization, and many of its corporations were leaders in the national sphere. It is generally

agreed that Maine institutions were effective and transparent, and helped to promote

technological change and economic growth. The results confirm that elite insiders, officers of

the firm including treasurers, directors, and its presidents, were typically connected to other



                                                 23
shareholders in the corporation. These familial networks did not decline over time, instead, they

increased as the economy developed. Moreover, it is striking that, when the analysis is extended

to all shareholders in the firm, the same patterns are detected; outsiders were able to overcome a

lack of experience and information by taking advantage of their own networks. As such, related

investing seems to have been a universal feature of equity markets in the antebellum period.

       This leads to the question of why kinship ties existed, not just among insiders, but also

among outside shareholders. At least one implication is that, although insiders might attempt to

use family networks to exploit other shareholders, their ability to tunnel is limited by the

countervailing power of family networks among outsiders. Rather than seeking to expropriate

their peers, related founders of Maine corporations introduced institutional mechanisms to ensure

transparency, disclosure and monitoring of the financial and accounting status of the firm.

Ideally, one would wish to determine whether related investing was associated with higher

earnings or profits but, in the absence of the necessary data, a systematic analysis of variation

across such factors as industry, gender, wealth, ownership concentration, and persistence shed

some light on the underlying mechanisms.

       The variation in the patterns that existed across the banking, manufacturing, and

transportation sectors suggests that family networks may have served to attenuate risks and

transactions costs, especially for inexperienced investors. The expansion of the railroads

required and attracted extensive investments in securities markets, that primarily consisted of

small investors who were likely to have been uneducated about financial assets. Women and

comparatively disadvantaged newcomers with lower stocks of personal and real estate wealth

were induced into making contributions to capital mobilization, perhaps because the external

benefits offered by their kinship networks reduced transactions costs. Investors with family



                                                 24
connections, for instance, were significantly more likely to persist in holding shares over a longer

term. Finally, the analysis of the effects of related investing on the concentration of ownership in

the corporations suggests that this phenomenon was likely associated with a reduction in

perceptions of risk, especially in the context of the mobilization of “venture capital” in

manufacturing and transportation. This may in part explain why, instead of declining over time,

related investing increased.

       The analysis here has more general implications for our understanding of the nature of

the firm. Standard approaches tend to be based on a dichotomy between family businesses

where governance might be compromised by personal tastes and affinities; and impersonal

corporations that are run by managers whose decisions are independent of the identities of the

owners. Alfred Chandler even contended that the British owed its loss of industrial leadership

owing to the prevalence of its style of “personal capitalism” based on family ownership. Khan

(2016), however, showed that family firms in France were able to compensate for the

institutional disadvantages that women entrepreneurs confronted. The results from this study of

extensive personal elements in shareholding throughout a successfully industrializing economy

instead suggests that the extent of personal ownership in firms lies along a continuum. Just as in

family firms, related ownership in corporations can play a productive role in the democratization

and dynamics of capital mobilization during early economic development.

Notes and Sources: See text for sources of data set. The shareholders were matched
in the manuscript censuses of 1850 and 1860 by names and town of residence. The
matching procedure was successful for approximately 47 percent of the sample. This
yielded information on state of birth, occupations, age, marital status, and wealth for the
subset of the matches. Artisans include labourers; white collar occupations include
“gentlemen” and other professionals except for those employed in finance, which
incorporates bankers, stockbrokers, and accountants.

    Notes and Sources: See text for sources of data set. Insiders are defined as all officers of the
    corporation who could be traced, including treasurers, directors, and presidents of the firm.
    Related investors/insiders are those shareholders/officers who share the same surname as another
    investor in the same enterprise. Established firms had been in existence for at least ten years.
    Closely held firms were owned by fewer than 20 shareholders. The excluded industry is banking.
    Population and farm value are estimated at the county level.
