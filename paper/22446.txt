                                         ABSTRACT

Do potential entrepreneurs remain in wage employment because of concerns that they will face
worse job opportunities should their entrepreneurial ventures fail? Using a Canadian reform that
extended job-protected leave to one year for women giving birth after a cutoff date, we study
whether the option to return to a previous job increases entrepreneurship. A regression
discontinuity design reveals that longer job-protected leave increases entrepreneurship by 1.9
percentage points. These entrepreneurs start incorporated businesses that hire employees—in
industries where experimentation before entry has low costs and high benefits. The effects are
concentrated among those with more human and financial capital.

1       Introduction

Entrepreneurship has long been thought to play a critical role in innovation, job creation and

economic growth (Schumpeter, 1911). There is now a large body of empirical evidence in support of

this view (e.g., King and Levine, 1993; Levine, 1997; Beck, Levine, and Loayza, 2000; Levine, Loayza,

and Beck, 2000; Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales, 2004). Yet, only a small fraction of the population

undertakes entrepreneurial endeavors. For example, in the United States, only 6.6 percent of the

labor force is self-employed (World Bank, 2015).

    While regulation and capital access are well-known impediments to starting a business,1 perhaps

the most fundamental reason people might avoid setting out on their own is the risk involved.

Entrepreneurs must invest time and capital in businesses that may ultimately fail. Perhaps equally

important, entrepreneurs may also face career risk. Indeed, a growing body of evidence suggests

that individuals who enter entrepreneurship and then re-enter wage employment, end up on a worse

career trajectory.2 This implicitly lowers the returns to entrepreneurship, as the value of the real

option to return to wage employment is an important component of those returns (Dillon and

Stanton, 2016; Manso, 2016).

    This idea of career risk motivates the widely-held belief that entrepreneurship increases during

recessions. Workers who have already lost their job face a lower opportunity cost of trying to start

a new business, though opinions vary as to whether entrepreneurship increased during the Great

Recession (Fairlie, 2010; Shane, 2011). In this paper, we use a natural experiment to investigate the

relationship between entrepreneurship and career risk. In particular, we examine whether granting

employees the ability to take prolonged leaves of absence, with guaranteed options to return to their

    1
      See, for example, Evans and Jovanovic (1989); Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian, and Rosen (1994a,b); Hurst and Lusardi
(2004); Bertrand, Schoar, and Thesmar (2007); Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff (2008); Kerr and Nanda (2009);
Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2015); Schmalz, Sraer, and Thesmar (2017); Mullainathan and Schnabl (2010); Bruhn
(2011); Branstetter et al. (2014)

      The literature generally finds that the effect of past entrepreneurship experience on wages is smaller than the
effect of past wage employment experience (e.g., Ferber and Waldfogel, 1998; Williams, 2002; Bruce and Schuetze,
2004; Kaiser and Malchow-Moller, 2011; Baptista, Lima, and Preto, 2012). Many have also argued that the stigma
of entrepreneurial failure discourages entry and explains much of variation in entrepreneurship across regions (e.g.,
Gromb and Scharfstein, 2002; Landier, 2006; Nanda and Rhodes-Kropf, 2013a). In addition to the potential wage
penalty, there are also likely search costs and other frictions involved in leaving wage employment and re-entering.

jobs, increases entry into entrepreneurship.

   While employees do not often have the ability to take job-protected leaves for the purpose of

starting a business, governments often require that such leaves be permitted surrounding the birth

of a child. Such leaves, if sufficiently long, could in principle be used to work on a business idea

while retaining the option to return to one’s previous job. Essentially, job-protected leaves reduce

the frictions to entrepreneurial experimentation (Manso, 2011; Kerr, Nanda, and Rhodes-Kropf,

2014). We think of this early-stage experimentation very broadly: “working on a business idea”

includes any part of the process of transitioning into entrepreneurship that would not be possible

while simultaneously working full-time in wage employment. In particular, it could include serious

brainstorming and research or preliminary tests of an idea’s viability.

   We focus on a reform to Canadian maternity leave laws that took place in 2000. The reform

extended job-protected leave entitlements to 12 months, approximately a 5.5-month increase. In

contrast, the U.S. mandates only 3 months of leave in total. Given that U.S. law expects employees

to return to work after 3 months, workers in Canada may be able to use their substantial additional

time to work on a business idea without career risk, even with a new child in the household.

Although maternity leave is not the first thing that comes to mind when considering sparks for

entrepreneurship, our setting provides stark variation in guaranteed outside options.

   Indeed, anecdotal evidence suggests that entry into entrepreneurship among Canadian women

increased following the reform. According to the Vancouver Sun, “a growing number [of mothers] are

using their maternity leave—now a full year in Canada—to either plan or start a new professional

direction in life. . . longer maternity leaves are making it easier for women to try their hand at starting

a business” (Morton, 2006). Danielle Botterell, author of the Canadian book Moms Inc., said in

an interview with the Globe and Mail, “We think the trend of mompreneurship, particularly in this

country, really took off when the government extended maternity leave to a year” (Pearce, 2011).

According to the Financial Post, a Canadian business newspaper, “there is a new breed of female

entrepreneurs using their maternity leaves to incubate real businesses” (Mazurkewich, 2010). One



                                                    2
entrepreneur interviewed used her maternity leave to start amassing clients, explaining that “my

maternity leave was my security blanket.” In her interpretation, job-protected leave time allowed

her to explore entrepreneurship while minimizing the risk to her career (Karol, 2012).

   Our empirical strategy exploits the fact that eligibility for extended maternity leave was tied to

the precise date a woman gave birth. In particular, mothers who gave birth on or after December

31, 2000, were eligible for the extended job-protected leave. Those who gave birth even one day

before were not. This type of reform lends itself to examination with a regression discontinuity

design. In particular, we examine whether mothers who gave birth just after the cutoff date are

discontinuously more likely to be entrepreneurs as of the next census five years later.

   To ensure that our estimates are not confounded by contemporaneous macroeconomic shocks or

other policies that change discontinuously at year’s end, our main empirical strategy compares the

regression discontinuity estimate for mothers, who availed themselves of this extended leave, with

that for fathers, who did not. That is, we implement a “difference-in-discontinuities” design (see,

e.g., Grembi, Nannicini, and Troiano, 2016; Lalive, 2008; Leonardi and Pica, 2013), which uses the

time trend of fathers to control for any other factors influencing entrepreneurship rates across the

cutoff date.

   Given that there are limitations on the extent to which the timing of births can be controlled,

“gaming” around the cutoff date is likely to be limited. Consistent with the difficulty of gaming, we

find no evidence of a jump in the birth rate after the cutoff date. Moreover, those who gave birth just

before and after the cutoff have similar ages, education levels, and ethnicities. These findings suggest

that there are no obvious confounds that would invalidate our strategy. The ability to control for

unobservable trends using fathers further strengthens the validity of our difference-in-discontinuities

approach.

   Our main outcome variable is self-employment status as of the next census five years later.

The 2001 Census is too close to the reform’s cutoff date, which prevents us from observing the

short-run dynamics induced by the reform. But the benefit of looking at long-term outcomes



                                                   3
is that the results cannot merely reflect transitory entry into entrepreneurship. We find that the

increase in job-protected leave entitlements leads to approximately a 1.9 percentage point increase in

entrepreneurship rates among mothers relative to fathers. This baseline result is robust to adding

various controls, examining different windows around the cutoff date, using different methods of

fitting the pre- and post-policy time trends, and defining entrepreneurship in different ways. As one

would expect, we find larger effects in provinces that had larger increases in job-protected leave.

Moreover, we find no effects around placebo cutoff dates in other years. The results are concentrated

among individuals with more human and financial capital, who may be more willing or able to start

a business. Also, consistent with the mechanism we have in mind, the new businesses that are

spurred by the reform tend to be in industries where exploring an idea prior to fully committing

has low costs (i.e., low startup capital requirements) or high benefits (i.e., high failure rates, hence

high real option value).

   Several pieces of evidence suggest that the incremental entrepreneurs we observe are engaging in

meaningful businesses. First, we measure entrepreneurship continuing five years after the reform. If

the reform only increased transitory entrepreneurship, we would not expect to see long-run effects

because the marginal businesses would cease operating within that time frame. Further, we find

that the effect of the reform on entrepreneurship is significantly stronger for those with ex ante

characteristics that predict higher-quality businesses. In particular, those with more education,

work experience, and access to capital respond more strongly to the reform. Finally, we also

find that the reform leads to an increase in entrepreneurs that incorporate their firms, hire paid

employees, work above the median number of hours, and earn above the median income.

   As a general matter, it is possible that new mothers have a stronger desire for job flexibility than

other workers and this generates a preference for entrepreneurship. However, our empirical strategy

compares new mothers who were (quasi-randomly) eligible for a longer period of job-protected leave

to new mothers who were not. So the desire for job flexibility does not confound our analysis. Rather,

job flexibility represents an underlying reason that entrepreneurship may be desirable. Past work



                                                   4
has suggested that such non-pecuniary benefits may be an important motivation for many potential

entrepreneurs, not just new mothers (e.g., Hurst and Pugsley, 2011). Non-pecuniary motivations

likely coexist with concerns about career risk and other factors influencing the entrepreneurship

decision. Just as there is uncertainty about whether one can create a business that generates

desired financial payoffs, there is also uncertainty about whether one can create a business that

generates desired non-pecuniary benefits. Thus, the ability to work toward creating such a business

in the absence of career risk may encourage entrepreneurship.

   We think it is plausible that our results may generalize beyond the particular group we study

in this paper. For example, one could imagine that if large technology companies in Silicon Valley

gave their employees a similar ability to take long job-protected leaves—for the explicit purpose of

working on a business idea—such a policy might lead to the creation of technology startups. Of

course, such a policy would also have significant costs associated with it. Conducting a full welfare

analysis is beyond the scope of this paper. Our purpose is not to advocate the use of job-protected

leave as a policy tool to promote entrepreneurship. Rather, we use job-protected leaves to shed

light on the extent to which potential entrepreneurs are deterred by worries about career risk.

   Our paper contributes to a growing literature that views entrepreneurship as a series of exper-

iments (see Kerr, Nanda, and Rhodes-Kropf, 2014, for an overview). While many entrepreneurial

projects may be negative NPV in a static sense, entrepreneurs can engage in cheap experiments that

reveal information about a project’s prospects. Conditional upon that information being favorable,

the project may become positive NPV; thus, there is value in the real option to continue. In closely

related work, Manso (2016) and Dillon and Stanton (2016) model the dynamics of experimenta-

tion in self-employment and quantify this option value. According to the experimentation view,

frictions to experimenting are the chief impediment to entrepreneurship. Such frictions can be due

to regulation (Klapper, Laeven, and Rajan, 2006), technology (Ewens, Nanda, and Rhodes-Kropf,

2018), organizational constraints (Gompers, 1996), or financing risk (Nanda and Rhodes-Kropf,

2013b, 2017). In our setting, job-protected leaves could reduce the cost of experimentation by giv-



                                                 5
ing entrepreneurs the ability to work on an idea while being shielded from long-term negative career

consequences.

    More broadly, we contribute to a large literature on factors that discourage entrepreneurship.

Entry regulations limit entrepreneurship both across (Djankov et al., 2002; Desai, Gompers, and

Lerner, 2003; Klapper, Laeven, and Rajan, 2006) and within countries (Mullainathan and Schnabl,

2010; Bruhn, 2011; Branstetter et al., 2014). Much work has also examined whether relaxing

financial constraints increases entrepreneurship (Evans and Jovanovic, 1989; Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian,

and Rosen, 1994a,b; Hurst and Lusardi, 2004; Bertrand, Schoar, and Thesmar, 2007; Mel, McKenzie,

and Woodruff, 2008; Kerr and Nanda, 2009; Adelino, Schoar, and Severino, 2015; Schmalz, Sraer,

and Thesmar, 2017); whether entrepreneurship training programs or exposure to entrepreneurial

peers increases entrepreneurship (Karlan and Valdivia, 2011; Lerner and Malmendier, 2013; Drexler,

Fischer, and Schoar, 2014; Fairlie, Karlan, and Zinman, 2015); and whether allowing unemployed

individuals to continue receiving payments from unemployment insurance after starting a business

increases entrepreneurship (Hombert et al., 2014).3 Our paper differs in its focus on career risk. We

are not aware of any other work examining whether potential entrepreneurs hesitate to enter because

they are afraid to worsen their fallback option. Our findings are consistent with Manso (2011), who

shows that the optimal contract to motivate innovation (or experimentation more generally) involves

a commitment by the principal not to fire the agent.



2       Conceptual Framework

2.1     Model Setup

In order to fix ideas, we present a stylized model of the entrepreneurial entry decision in our

context. The model describes how the choice to explore entrepreneurship can respond to changes

in job-protected leave policy when workers worry about career risk.
    3
     While our paper is superficially like Hombert et al. (2014) in that we study a form of employment insurance,
we differ in our focus on career risk. The reform that Hombert et al. (2014) study only applies to unemployed
individuals who do not face career risk in starting a business. Their focus is instead on learning about the quality of
the entrepreneurs who are spurred to enter by that reform relative to the quality of other entrepreneurs.


                                                          6
   At time 0, an employed worker chooses the length of leave she will take, t. The worker may

use this time to experiment with entrepreneurship. The maximum length of available job-protected

leave guaranteed by law is denoted by TL . The benefit of taking a longer leave is that the potential

entrepreneur receives a more precise signal about X, the payoff to entrepreneurship. This payoff

is the present value of future earnings conditional on becoming an entrepreneur after the leave

period ends, plus any non-pecuniary benefits from entrepreneurship. We assume this payoff follows
                                   
a normal distribution, X ∼ N µ, η10 . At the end of the leave, the worker receives an unbiased
                                                                                       
                                                                                     1
signal s(t) about X, with signal precision increasing in t. That is, s(t)|X ∼ N X, h(t)   , where
           0              00
h(0) = 0, h (t) > 0, and h (t) < 0. This captures the idea that experimentation reduces uncertainty

about entrepreneurial payoffs but has decreasing marginal benefits. In what follows, we assume the
                               √
specific functional form h(t) = t. Of course, if the job-protected leave is associated with the birth

of a child, it may be unrealistic to assume that the marginal benefits of leave time for increasing

signal precision are highest at the start of the leave. To account for this, simply think of a non-

discretionary amount of medical/childcare leave time where no entrepreneurial experimentation

occurs prior to time 0 in the model.

   When the leave ends at time t, the worker updates her beliefs about the distribution of en-

trepreneurship payoffs, X, based on the realization of her signal s (t). She then chooses between

entering entrepreneurship and returning to wage employment. If she returns to wage employment,

her payoff is y (1 − δ(t)). This is comprised of two parts: first, y represents the present value of

future earnings from wage employment; unlike X, it is not stochastic. Second, y is multiplied by

1 − δ(t) ≤ 1 to capture the idea that taking a longer leave may lead to a wage penalty. Note

that, although the employer cannot legally penalize workers for taking a longer leave, it is not

clear how strictly this can be interpreted. Even if there is no nominal wage decline when t is high,

subsequent promotions, wage growth, and job-security may be negatively affected by longer leaves

(Rossin-Slater, 2017).




                                                 7
    We assume the following functional form for the wage penalty:

                                                      
                                                      
                                                      θdt if t ≤ TL
                                                      
                                                      
                                          δ(t) =                           .
                                                      
                                                      
                                                      dt
                                                              if t > TL


The parameter d ≥ 0 represents the rate at which wages would decline with time out of the

labor force, absent job-protection.4 Higher values of d mean that the payoff from subsequent wage

employment decreases more quickly as a function of leave time. If the worker chooses to take a

leave that is longer than the legally-guaranteed period of TL , she bears the full brunt of the wage

penalty. This is equivalent to quitting her job, and then re-entering wage employment subsequently

after a period of time t > TL . The parameter θ ≤ 1 captures the degree of shielding provided by

job-protected leave. At the extremes, job-protected leave offers full protection from any earnings

impact when θ = 0, and no protection at all when θ = 1. We are only interested in cases where

θ < 1; otherwise job-protected leave is ineffective.

    Recall that the worker chooses the length of her leave, t, at time 0. Then, at the end of the

leave, she decides whether to enter entrepreneurship or return to wage employment based on the

signal s (t) that she draws. When she chooses the optimal t at the beginning of her leave, she takes

into account the fact that at the end of the leave she will select the career path that provides the

highest expected utility given her updated beliefs. Thus her time-0 expected utility maximization

problem is:

                     max EU (t) = max E { max [ EU (X|t) , EU (y (1 − δ (t)) |t)] } .
                      t≥0              t≥0


We assume that individuals are risk-averse and have exponential utility given by U (x) = −e−λx ,

where λ is the coefficient of absolute risk aversion.




   4
     One could think of d as capturing skill depreciation. It also captures other labor market frictions. For example,
since workers may start out in jobs where they earn a premium from being matched with a good firm, they risk losing
that premium if forced to find a new job after taking leave without job protection (Song, Price, Guvenen, Bloom,
and Von Wachter, 2015; Card, Cardoso, Heining, and Kline, 2016).


                                                          8
2.2   Model Implications

To understand the tradeoff an individual faces when choosing the length of leave at time 0, first

consider the case when θ = 0. In this case, there is no wage penalty. The payoff from returning

to wage employment is simply y during this period, which is a constant. Further assume that she

is risk neutral. Such an individual knows that, on average, she will expect the same payoff from

entrepreneurship after a leave of length t as she does at time 0. That is, since taking a longer leave

only increases the precision of her signal about X, but does not change the underlying distribution

of X, she cannot expect to become more optimistic or pessimistic about X based on her choice of t.

   However, while the mean of her future expectations is invariant to t, the variance of her future

expectations is increasing in t. Since she can always return to wage employment and receive y

when her future expectations about X turn out to be low, her overall payoff at date 0 is convex

in her future expectations about X. Given this convexity, taking a longer leave is valuable since it

increases the variance of her future expectations. Intuitively, the ability to enter entrepreneurship

in the future is a real option. The value of this option increases, the more the individual will learn

about the payoffs from entrepreneurship before having to decide whether or not to pursue it. Absent

other forces, this pushes people toward taking as much leave as they can.

   But there is also a potential cost of taking a longer leave, which comes from the wage penalty.

This is the key tradeoff in the model. With full shielding, the wage penalty is only felt when a

worker takes more than the maximum amount of leave—i.e., quits her job and subsequently returns

to wage employment. With partial shielding, it is also felt to a lesser extent when a worker takes a

leave that is shorter than the maximum.

   This tradeoff leads to the following predictions, which we state formally in Proposition 1 below.

More available leave time makes people more likely to enter entrepreneurship when either (1) there

is full shielding and the rate of the wage penalty is sufficiently high or (2) there is partial shielding

and the rate of the wage penalty is neither too low nor too high. This is because, if the rate of the

wage penalty is very low (with either partial or full shielding), people take more than the maximum

amount of leave—i.e. quit their jobs to explore entrepreneurship. So increasing the maximum has

no effect. If the rate of the wage penalty is very high (and shielding is only partial), people take

less than the maximum amount of leave. Increasing the maximum again has no effect.5

    Outside of these extremes, job-protected leave provides a valuable backstop for entrepreneurship.

In the intermediate cases, workers value the increased precision of s (t) they get from taking a longer

leave, but not enough to accept the wage penalty at the full rate d. Thus they take the longest job-

protected leave guaranteed by law, setting t∗ = TL . For these workers, an increase in TL increases

the length of time during which they face the wage penalty at the lower rate θd. This makes longer

experimentation worthwhile, as they can now obtain a more precise signal at a lower cost in terms

of the wage penalty.

    More formally, we can prove the following proposition.


Proposition 1. Assume that µ − 2ηλ0 < y. This means that prior beliefs make entrepreneurship less

attractive than wage employment absent any signal.

(i) Full Shielding (θ = 0) :

    There exists a d such that:
                                ∂t∗              ∂P rob(Entrepreneur|t∗ )
        For d ≥ d, t∗ = TL ,    ∂TL   > 0, and            ∂TL               > 0.
                                ∂t∗              ∂P rob(Entrepreneur|t∗ )
        For d < d, t∗ > TL ,    ∂TL   = 0, and            ∂TL               = 0.

(ii) Partial Shielding (0 < θ < 1) :

    There exists a d and d¯ such that:
                    ¯ t∗ = TL ,       ∂t∗              ∂P rob(Entrepreneur|t∗ )
        For d ≤ d ≤ d,                ∂TL   > 0, and            ∂TL               > 0.
                                ∂t∗              ∂P rob(Entrepreneur|t∗ )
        For d < d, t∗ > TL ,    ∂TL   = 0, and            ∂TL               = 0.
                ¯ t∗ < TL ,     ∂t∗              ∂P rob(Entrepreneur|t∗ )
        For d > d,              ∂TL   = 0, and            ∂TL               = 0.

    5
      It is not immediately obvious that a higher t∗ increases the probability of entrepreneurial entry. In particular, if
the ex ante payoff from entrepreneurship is sufficiently high relative to wage employment, obtaining more information
will actually tend to push individuals away from entering entrepreneurship. However, we argue that for the individuals
we are interested in, the ex ante payoff from entrepreneurship (after risk-adjustment) is unlikely to exceed the payoff
from wage employment by so much. If it did, these individuals would not have started out in wage employment in
the first place. It turns out that µ − 2ηλ0 < y is a sufficient condition for the probability of entrepreneurial entry to
increase with t∗ . This is equivalent to the requirement that individuals would not wish to enter entrepreneurship
absent any signal.

3    Data

Our data come primarily from the Canadian Census of the Population, which is administered every

five years by Statistics Canada. The census enumerates the entire population of Canada. Eighty

percent of households receive a short census questionnaire, which asks about basic topics such as

age, sex, marital status, and mother tongue. Twenty percent of households receive the long-form

questionnaire, which adds many additional questions on topics such as education, ethnicity, mobility,

income, employment, and dwelling characteristics. Respondents to the long form survey typically

give Statistics Canada permission to directly access tax records to answer the income questions.

Participation in the census is mandatory for all Canadian residents. Aggregated data from the

census are available to the public. Individual-level data are only made publicly available 92 years

after each census and in some cases only with the permission of the respondent. However, for

approved projects, Statistics Canada makes the micro-data from the long form survey available

for academic use. We use these confidential micro-data in our study. While the data are at the

individual level, they are anonymized. Just as with the U.S. Census, individuals and households

cannot be linked across census years. So although the census is administered to the whole population

every five years, it is not possible to form a panel and we rely on exclusively cross-sectional data.

Our primary sample consists of parents from the 2006 census who (we infer) had their first child

within 60 days of the December 31, 2000, reform date. There are 86,565 such parents in the census.6

    One key variable for this study is the date on which parents had a child. While the census does

not directly record this information, it can be inferred fairly well. In particular, the census records

family relationships within a household and the date of birth for all members of the household. So we


    6
      Due to restrictions from Statistics Canada, all of our results (including observation counts) are reported using
census weights. Because participation in the census is mandatory and the 20 percent of households selected for the
long form survey is random, the weights are generally very close to 5 for all respondents. That is, one observation in
the sample data is representative of approximately 5 observations in the population data. Because the weights are
so uniform, our results change little when they are unweighted.


                                                         11
assume that parents had children on the birth dates of the children residing in the same household

as themselves.7 Of course, non-biological family relationships within a household will lead to some

degree of measurement error (e.g., step-children and children adopted as non-newborns). But this

measurement error is likely small in magnitude and, if anything, it would bias us against finding

any effect.

    The other key variable for our study is entrepreneurship, which we proxy with self-employment,

as is common in the literature. Respondents to the long form census must provide information on

both their total income and self-employment income. In most cases, this information is obtained

directly from their tax filings. Our primary definition of self-employment is someone who receives

at least 50 percent of total income from self-employment.8 Separately, respondents must also report

whether they consider themselves self-employed based on their primary job. We favor the income-

based measure as it comes from administrative data. However, we show in robustness tests that

our results are similar when using self-reported entrepreneurship. Note that both measures of

entrepreneurship include individuals who have incorporated their businesses or hired paid employees.

Thus, we are not limited to studying sole proprietorships.

    Table 1 shows basic summary statistics for mothers and for fathers who had their first child

within 60 days of the December 31, 2000 reform date. While the sample is selected based on the

inferred birth of a child around December 31, 2000, the summary statistics reflect information as of

the 2006 census. In our sample, 4.2 percent of mothers are self-employed as of 2006 when using the

definition based on self-employment income. Based on self-reports, 7.1 percent identify themselves

as being self-employed. The average mother in the sample is approximately 33 years old and has

1.76 children as of 2006. About 28 percent are college graduates. The rate of self-employment for

fathers is higher, as is their age.9 The last two lines of the table show income and work hours.


   7
      We use children reported in the 2006 census to infer child birth dates in a window around December 31, 2000;
therefore the relevant children would be around five years old as of the 2006 census date.
    8
      Canadian taxes are assessed based on individual income, not combined spousal income as in the U.S. Thus, our
data record self-employment and wage employment income for each individual.
    9
      Note that there are fewer fathers than mothers in the sample because there are more households with only a
mother present than households with only a father present.


                                                       12
These are about twice as large for fathers as for mothers, with the differences largely driven by

the extensive margin: 39 percent of mothers report zero work hours and mean work hours increase

to 34.5 when those reporting zero are excluded. Although dramatic, these gender differences do

not influence our estimation, which focuses on discontinuous changes for mothers (as compared to

changes for fathers) around December 31, 2000.

     Since our study relies on policy variation in Canada, the results will naturally be specific to that

setting. Nevertheless, to determine whether our sample is substantially different from a comparable

sample in the United States, we compute analogous summary statistics with U.S. data. Appendix

Table A.1 uses data from the 2006 American Community Survey to produce a U.S. version of

Table 1. We restrict the sample to parents with a five-year-old child and apply the same variable

definitions as in Table 1. The two samples show very similar characteristics, and in particular,

similar self-employment rates. Canadian parents in our sample thus appear quite comparable to

their U.S. counterparts.



4        Maternity Leave Policy in Canada

Canada’s ten provinces have significant legal and fiscal autonomy, and in particular, have pri-

mary responsibility for labor legislation. Despite this autonomy, legislatively guaranteed maternity

leave—the right to return to a pre-birth job after a specified period of absence—has several common

features across the provinces (Baker and Milligan, 2008b).10 First, employees are protected from

dismissal due to pregnancy. Second, a maximum period for the leave is always prescribed, and the

provinces do not mandate any paid leave. Initially, the laws of several provinces provided guidance

on how the period of leave should be split pre- and post-birth, but current practice is to leave this

to the discretion of the mother and employer. Third, the laws specify a minimum period of employ-

ment for eligibility. This varies widely: initially 52 weeks of employment was common, although

the recent trend is toward shorter qualification periods. Fourth, most laws specify which terms
    10
    In addition to the ten provinces, whose combined population is 34 million, Canada has three territories with a
combined population of 100,000, located north of 60 degrees latitude.


                                                       13
of employment are preserved during the leave and any responsibility of the employer to maintain

benefits. Finally, the laws of some provinces establish rules for extending leaves because of medical

complications or pregnancies that continue after term.

   While provinces only mandate a period of unpaid leave, the federal Employment Insurance

system provides partial income replacement. Prior to 2001, Employment Insurance provided partial

income replacement for 25 weeks surrounding the birth of a child (a 2-week unpaid waiting period

followed by a 25-week paid leave period). In 2001, the Employment Insurance Act was reformed to

allow for up to 50 weeks of partial income replacement (a 2-week unpaid waiting period followed

by a 50-week paid leave period). Those on leave receive 55 percent of their normal income up to a

maximum determined each year based on mean income levels (at the time, $413 CAD per week, or

about $275 USD). Of course, temporary income replacement is less useful if one’s pre-birth employer

does not approve of the leave, and the absence were to cost the new mother her job. Prior to the

2001 reform to the Employment Insurance Act, provinces required that employers grant anywhere

from 18 to 35 weeks of job-protected leave surrounding the birth of a child. Following the reform,

all provinces increased the mandated guarantee to at least 52 weeks to match the new income

replacement period set by Employment Insurance (including the 2-week waiting period). Following

the reform, 35 out of the 52 weeks of job-protected leave could technically be split between the two

parents however they prefer. In practice, very few families allocated job-protected leave time to

fathers instead of mothers (Baker and Milligan, 2008a).

   Table 2 shows the maximum leave period by province, before and after the 2001 reform. Quebec

is excluded from the table as it is the one province that did not change in 2001, mandating 70 weeks

of job-protected leave throughout. The average province went from approximately 30 weeks to 52

weeks, an increase of approximately 5.5 months. Given that maternity leave entitlements usually

increase gradually over time, this reform represents one of the largest year-over-year increases in

any country.

   A key aspect of the reform’s implementation for our purposes is that it was tied to the date



                                                 14
a woman gave birth. Those who gave birth on or after December 31, 2000, were entitled to an

extended leave. Those who gave birth even a day before were not. Despite unhappiness among

those who just missed the cutoff, this policy admitted no exceptions (Muhlig, 2001).

     In terms of the timing of the reform’s announcement, the federal budget was announced on

February 29, 2000, with the December 31, 2000, cutoff date for extended income replacement

eligibility. In principle, this announcement pre-dated the cutoff sufficiently so that parents could

delay pregnancy until a point where they would be sure to give birth under the new rules. But

recall that the federal announcement only concerns income replacement, not job protection. The

provinces, which determine rules surrounding job protection, did not announce that they would

extend job-protected leave until November 2000 at the earliest. In several cases, they claimed that

they would not be extending job-protected leave, even though they later ended up doing so.11 Thus,

all of the mothers who gave birth around what turned out to be the cutoff date for the extension in

job-protected leave, conceived long before they knew whether job-protected leave would be extended

in their province and, if so, what the cutoff date would be.



5        Empirical Strategy

While there was a discontinuous jump in the maximum length of leave available to parents who had

children around the reform cutoff, this does not necessarily mean that there was a change in actual

leave-taking, as individuals may not have made use of the additional time available. If the reform

had no effect on actual leave-taking, we would not expect to find an effect on entrepreneurship.

While respondents do not retrospectively report the length of previous leaves taken, which would

allow us to look for a discontinuous jump in leave-taking around the cutoff date, they do report

whether they are currently on leave as of the census date. We therefore trace out the probability of

a respondent being on leave on the census date as a function of the number of weeks between the

date of birth of the respondent’s youngest child and the census date. We do this separately using
    11
     Two provinces (Alberta and Saskatchewan) waited until the first half of 2001 to announce the extension and
retroactively extended job-protected leave for those who gave birth after the December 31, 2000 cutoff date.


                                                      15
data from the 1996 and 2006 censuses, which are five years before and after the reform, respectively.

   Figure 1 Panel A shows that in all weeks following birth, the probability of employed mothers

being on leave is indeed greater in 2006 than in 1996. Of course, these two samples are ten years

apart and leave-taking behavior may have changed over these years for reasons other than the

reform. To address this possibility, we also look at the 2001 census. Mothers who gave birth 0–19

weeks before the 2001 census date were eligible for the extended leave, whereas those who gave

birth 20 or more weeks before the census date were not. We find that for those in the 2001 census

who had access to the additional leave time, their leaving-taking behavior was nearly identical to

that of those in the 2006 census. For those in the 2001 census who did not have access to the

additional leave time, their leave-taking behavior was nearly identical to those in the 1996 census.

This strongly suggests that the reform was indeed the main driver of the change from 1996 to 2006.

We repeat the same exercise for fathers in Panel B and find little change in leave-taking behavior

over the same years. The reluctance of fathers to use parental leave is consistent with prior research

(Lalive and Zweimüller, 2009; Schönberg and Ludsteck, 2014; Dahl et al., 2016). Dahl, Løken, and

Mogstad (2014) find evidence that the reason fathers are reluctant to take parental leave is due to

fears about how employers and co-workers would react. In other words, the perceived stigma costs

for fathers to take leave is high enough that they do not do so, even when given the legal right.

   Thus, it appears that there was a discontinuous increase in the amount of leave available to and

taken by mothers who gave birth just after the December 31, 2000 cutoff date, while fathers did not

change their leave-taking behavior. Aside from leave-taking, mothers on each side of the cutoff are

likely to be similar in terms of other characteristics. The reform thus lends itself naturally to analysis

with a sharp regression discontinuity design (RDD). However, some potential concerns remain with

such an empirical strategy. First, a simple RDD relies on the identifying assumption that other

factors influencing the dependent variable evolve smoothly across the cutoff. However, given that our

running variable is calendar time, this may not be the case. For example, macroeconomic conditions

do not necessarily evolve smoothly over time. Thus, the reform cutoff date might happen to coincide



                                                   16
with a macroeconomic shock that affects entrepreneurial entry. Second, since our cutoff date is the

last day of the calendar year, one may worry that other things may change discontinuously around

that date. For example, other policies (e.g. policies related to taxes or school eligibility) may

differ discretely across the cutoff. To address the possibility of such confounds, we use fathers as a

control group. As Baker and Milligan (2008a) suggest, fathers are a natural control group in the

context of this reform; the reform did not affect their leave-taking behavior, but contemporaneous

macroeconomic shocks, as well as other policies, are likely to affect them and mothers similarly.

Consistent with this idea, we find that the time-series correlation between the entrepreneurship

rates among mothers and fathers in Canada is 0.95.12 Also, Appendix Table A.2 shows that the

cross-sectional correlation between individual characteristics (e.g. age, education, and ethnicity)

and entrepreneurship status is statistically indistinguishable for mothers and fathers in our sample.

   Thus, rather than using simple RDD, we implement a “difference-in-discontinuities” design (see,

e.g., Grembi, Nannicini, and Troiano, 2016; Lalive, 2008; Leonardi and Pica, 2013). This empirical

strategy differences out any discontinuous change in entrepreneurship rates among fathers from

that among mothers. To fix ideas on how this is implemented, first consider a simple RDD. In our

context, this would mean estimating equations of the form:



                  yi = α + τ P osti + f1 (DayChildi ) + P osti × f2 (DayChildi ) + i ,               (1)



where yi is an outcome of interest for mother i; DayChildi = DateChildi − C, which is the

date mother i had a child (DateChildi ) relative to the reform cutoff date (C); and P osti =

1{DayChildi ≥ 0}, which is an indicator equal to one if mother i gave birth on or after the
cutoff date. The control functions capture time trends around the cutoff. In particular, the func-

tion f1 (.) captures a smooth trend on the left side of the cutoff, and the sum, f1 (.) + f2 (.), captures

a (potentially different) smooth trend on the right side of the cutoff. The coefficient τ captures any

discontinuity between these trends at the cutoff.
  12
    This calculation is based on annual entrepreneurship rates from the Canadian Labor Force Survey from
1995–2010.


                                                   17
    The RDD literature recommends estimating equation (1) using local linear regression (see e.g.,

Fan et al., 1996; Imbens and Lemieux, 2008; Lee and Lemieux, 2010; Gelman and Imbens, 2017).13

This means limiting the sample to mothers who gave birth within a narrow bandwidth, h, around

the cutoff date and imposing linearity on the control functions. Within a narrow bandwidth, it is

reasonable to assume that the control functions are approximately linear. One could also allow the

control functions to follow higher order polynomials, but doing so has been shown to be problematic

(Gelman and Imbens, 2017). Observations within the specified bandwidth around the cutoff are

also weighted according to some kernel function. A triangular kernel, which puts more weight

on observations near the cutoff, has been shown to be optimal in the RDD literature (Fan et al.,

1996).14 For a given bandwidth and kernel, one can then estimate local linear regressions of the

form:

                     yi = α + τ P osti + δ1 DayChildi + δ2 P osti × DayChildi + i .                           (2)


    In order to use fathers as a control group, we convert this model into a difference-in-discontinuities

design. Specifically, we augment the sample to also include fathers who had children within the

same bandwidth around the cutoff date. We then augment equation (2) by fully interacting all

terms with an indicator variable for mothers:



               yi = M otheri × [α + τ P osti + δ1 DayChildi + δ2 P osti × DayChildi ]

                        +[a + tP osti + d1 DayChildi + d2 P osti × DayChildi ] + i                            (3)



Thus, we allow mothers and fathers to have their own smooth control functions on each side of the

cutoff and their own potential discontinuities at the cutoff. The coefficient τ now represents the

difference between the discontinuity for mothers (t + τ ) and that for fathers (just t). This difference,

τ , is our estimated treatment effect and will be labeled T reatment in the tables.


  13
      For recent examples in the finance literature of RDD estimation using local linear regression, see, e.g. Berg
(2015); Malenko and Shen (2016); Campello et al. (2018); Li, Liu, and Wu (2018).
   14
      In practice, the choice of kernel generally makes little difference (Imbens and Lemieux, 2008)


                                                        18
   Our primary outcome of interest is an indicator equal to one if individual i is an entrepreneur

as of the 2006 census date, as defined in Section 3. Thus, we are examining the effect of extended

job-protected leave on entrepreneurship status approximately five years later. We do not examine

entrepreneurship status in the 2001 census because the census date falls too close to the reform

date. The 2001 census was administered on May 15, only about 4.5 months from the reform date.

This means that individuals who just qualified for extended leave by giving birth shortly after

December 31, 2000, would still likely be on leave by the census date, as they would be eligible for 12

months of leave. Even those who began working on a business while on leave would probably report

“leave” rather than “self-employment” as their labor force status during the leave period, in order to

remain eligible for the benefits of leave. As a result, we cannot observe whether these individuals

entered entrepreneurship during or immediately after their leave. However, looking at long-term

outcomes has the benefit that our results cannot reflect merely transitory short-term entry into

entrepreneurship.

   To interpret the estimates, note that employees always had the option to take a short job-

protected leave or a long non-job-protected leave, even prior to the reform. The latter was possible

in the following sense: a worker could always quit her job, leave the labor force, and then re-enter

whenever she wanted. Following the cutoff date, employees retained the option to take a short job-

protected leave, but now could instead take a long job-protected leave, if desired. So τ measures

the causal effect of giving employees the option to take a long job-protected leave relative to a long

non-job-protected leave. If job protection (and career risk) were not specifically important in the

entrepreneurial entry decision, we would not expect to see any effect, as unlimited non-job-protected

leave was always available.15




  15
    Note that the reform extended the income replacement period as well. We will discuss the potential role of
income replacement in Section 6.7.

6        Results

6.1      Validity of Empirical Design

We begin the analysis by examining the validity of our empirical design. To the extent that the

timing of births can be controlled, one concern is that different types of individuals might choose to

locate themselves on the right side of the cutoff threshold. Conditional on the timing of pregnancy,

the timing of births is difficult to control precisely, as the length of pregnancy naturally varies by

five weeks (Jukic et al., 2013). Nevertheless, scheduled Caesarean deliveries or induced births could

conceivably be shifted within a small window, although it is likely easier to shift births earlier in time

rather than later, as would be required in our setting.16 Baker and Milligan (2014) find no evidence

of gaming in birth timing around the reform we study in this paper. Similarly, Dahl, Løken, and

Mogstad (2014) find no evidence of gaming around a similar reform in Norway. However, Dickert-

Conlin and Chandra (1999) do find evidence that births are moved from the beginning of January to

the end of December in the U.S. to take advantage of tax benefits.17 To minimize gaming concerns,

we focus on first-time singleton births (i.e., we exclude twins, second children, and so forth), as

these deliveries are considerably less likely to be scheduled in advance. We categorize a birth as a

first-time singleton birth if a child residing in the same household as a parent is the oldest child

in the household and no other children in the household share the same birth date. Still, some

gaming remains possible even for these births. Such gaming may even be related to the mechanism

we have in mind—individuals who want to explore entrepreneurship select into the longer leave to

allow themselves the ability to do so. Alternatively, it may simply be those who are savvier about

how to game the reform are also more inclined towards entrepreneurship, but the reform has no

effect on their ability to become an entrepreneur.

     To test for gaming in an RDD framework, McCrary (2008) suggests checking for a discontinuity


    16
      Caesarean sections are also much less common in Canada, where the overall rate is 20 percent lower than in the
U.S. (OECD, 2015).
   17
      More recent work suggests that the magnitude of birth timing in the U.S. is small and largely due to misreporting
rather than actual shifting of births (LaLumia, Sallee, and Turner, 2015).


                                                          20
in sample density at the cutoff. Indeed, in our context, gaming would imply that births that would

otherwise have occurred prior to December 31 instead occur after. Moreover, it is likely easier to

delay a birth that would have otherwise occurred close to the cutoff date than one that would have

occurred far in advance. Thus, if gaming is present in our sample, we would expect a discontinuous

jump in sample density around the cutoff, as mass is shifted from the left of the cutoff to the right.

To test whether this is the case, we aggregate our data to the day level and estimate



             N umBirthst = α + τ P ostt + δ1 EventDayt + δ2 P ostt × EventDayt + t ,             (4)



where N umBirthst represents the number of (first-time singleton) births on date t, and EventDayt

measures the distance to the reform cutoff date. This is analogous to the RDD specification in

equation (2), but with the outcome being the birth rate rather than an entrepreneurship measure.

If there is gaming, we expect τ to be positive—that is, there should be a discontinuous jump in the

birth rate around the cutoff date.

   The results of this exercise are shown in Panel A of Table 3. We estimate equation (4) using

bandwidths ranging from 60 days to 30 days and a triangular kernel. We find no significant discon-

tinuity in the birth rate at the reform date for all bandwidths. The point estimates are positive, but

insignificant both statistically and economically. If we take the point estimates seriously, despite

being statistically indistinguishable from zero, they imply that 12.55 to 17.5 births in total across

Canada may have been shifted from the pre-reform period to the post-reform period. Appendix

Table A.3 shows that these point estimates are even smaller when one accounts for the fact that

there is a small, statistically insignificant jump in the birth rate around January 1 in non-reform

years. Figure 2 shows these results graphically. The lines correspond to the estimated linear trends

on each side of the cutoff, and the insignificant discontinuity at the cutoff date corresponds to the

estimated coefficient on P ostt . We see a smooth evolution of birth density across the cutoff date.

The absence of gaming is consistent with Baker and Milligan (2014) who find that the reform had

no effect on the spacing of births.


                                                 21
   Given that there is no evidence of gaming, it is plausible that those who gave birth just before

the cutoff date are similar to those who gave birth just after, both in terms of their observable and

their unobservable characteristics. In other words, around the cutoff date, eligibility for extended

leave is as good as randomly assigned. While we cannot test whether individuals on each side of

the cutoff are similar in terms of unobservable characteristics, we can test whether they are similar

in terms of observable characteristics. To do so, we estimate equation (2), with parents’ observable

characteristics as dependent variables. We choose characteristics that are largely fixed at the time

of childbirth so they are unlikely to be affected by the treatment. The results are shown in Panel B

of Table 3. We find no discontinuity in terms of age, education, or ethnicity for parents who have

a child around the cutoff date.

   Finally, our focus in this section has been on gaming in the timing of births within a small window

around the cutoff date. However, one may also be concerned about the timing of pregnancies if

the cutoff date were known far enough in advance. As discussed in Section 4, job-protected leave

is regulated at the provincial level and provinces did not announce that they were extending job-

protected leave until November at the earliest—meaning that those who gave birth within a narrow

bandwidth around the December 31 cutoff date conceived long before they knew that job-protected

leave would be extended or what the cutoff date for the extension would be. Moreover, even if

some people correctly anticipated the cutoff date and timed their pregnancy accordingly, as long as

births were not timed within a narrow bandwidth around the cutoff, it would remain fairly random

exactly which side of the cutoff people ended up on. Thus, our empirical strategy would still yield

an unbiased estimate of the causal effect of the reform, but we would be estimating the causal effect

among the types of people who had a due date close to the cutoff date. This group would consist

of (1) those who had unplanned pregnancies, (2) those who had planned pregnancies but did not

anticipate the cutoff date, and (3) those who had planned pregnancies and anticipated the cutoff

date but did not delay the pregnancy for the sake of extended job-protected leave. We could not say

anything about the causal effect among the residual group: those who planned their pregnancies,



                                                 22
anticipated the cutoff date, and found it worthwhile to delay. However, it seems plausible that the

effect may be largest among this group. In that case, our estimates would represent a lower bound

of what we would find were the reform completely unanticipated.


6.2   Main Findings

We now present our central results, examining whether mothers who had access to longer job-

protected leave were subsequently more likely to forgo wage employment and become entrepreneurs.

Specifically, we estimate equation (3) on the sample of parents who had their first child (excluding

multiple births) around the December 31, 2000, cutoff date. The main outcome of interest is whether

the majority of an individual’s income came from self-employment as of the May 16, 2006, census

date. We estimate local linear regressions using a triangular kernel and bandwidths ranging from

60 days around the cutoff date down to 30 days.

   The results are shown in Panel A of Table 4. The row labeled T reatment corresponds to

the estimated coefficient τ on M otheri × P osti in equation (3), which is our estimated average

treatment effect. As Panel A shows, we find a positive and statistically significant average treatment

effect. This means that, relative to fathers, mothers giving birth right after the cutoff date are

discontinuously more likely to be entrepreneurs than those giving birth right before. The estimated

magnitudes are quite stable using different bandwidths. Across the different specifications, we find

a 1.9 to 2.1 percentage point increase in entrepreneurship following the policy change.

   Figure 3 shows our results graphically. The grey dots represent the raw data—the share of

mothers within 3-day bins around the cutoff date who became entrepreneurs minus the share of

fathers within the same bins who became entrepreneurs. The solid lines represent the regression

estimates—predicted values based on the coefficients obtained from estimating equation (3). The

dashed lines represent 95% confidence intervals. The discontinuity in the solid lines at time zero

corresponds exactly with the average treatment effect reported in column (4) of Table 4. Note that,

although the confidence intervals slightly overlap in the figure, the difference between the two lines



                                                 23
(i.e., the discontinuity at time zero) is statistically significant at the 1% level.18

    The full set of coefficient estimates that generate this figure are shown in column (1) of Ap-

pendix Table A.4. As can be seen, the estimated coefficient on the P osti variable is statistically

insignificant, meaning that there is no statistically significant discontinuity at the cutoff for fathers.

The coefficient on M otheri × P osti (i.e., our estimated treatment effect) is positive and statistically

significant, meaning that the discontinuity for mothers is significantly larger than that for fathers.

The estimated coefficient on M otheri is negative and statistically significant. This reflects the fact

that mothers are generally less likely than fathers to be entrepreneurs. The remaining coefficients

are all statistically insignificant. Thus, the slopes of the time trends for fathers and mothers are

statistically indistinguishable from zero, both before and after the cutoff date. Column (2) shows

that these results remain similar when we use a uniform kernel rather than a triangular one.

    As discussed in Section 5, our difference-in-discontinuities strategy should largely address con-

cerns that our results are driven by year-end effects. Nonetheless, to further rule out such concerns,

we perform two placebo tests. First, we examine whether there is a discontinuous jump in 2006

entrepreneurship rates for mothers who had a child around December 31 of non-reform years. Specif-

ically, we pool parents who had their first child around December 31 in the reform year with parents

who had their first child around December 31 in previous years, going back to 1991. We then es-

timate a variant of equation (3), in which we interact all of our covariates with a Ref orm Y eari

indicator variable. This takes the value of one for births within the narrow bandwidth h of Decem-

ber 31, 2000, and zero for all other births. Results are shown in Panel A of Table 5. The coefficient

on T reatmenti , without an interaction, now represents the size of the difference-in-discontinuities

estimate around December 31 in non-reform years (i.e., Ref orm Y eari = 0). As we would expect,

we find no evidence of a “treatment effect” in non-reform years. The coefficient on the interaction

term, Ref orm Y eari × T reatmenti , represents how much larger the difference-in-discontinuities


   18
     It is possible, and in fact, common, for there to be a statistically significant discontinuity at the cutoff, even when
the confidence intervals on each side of the cutoff in the corresponding figure overlap (Knezevic, 2008). Essentially,
the regression tables are testing whether the difference between the two lines is significant, while the figures are simply
showing independent 95% confidence intervals on each side of the cutoff.


                                                            24
estimate is around December 31 in actual the reform year. Again as we would expect, we find a

significantly larger treatment effect in the reform year.19

    One limitation of this test is that the length of time between the cutoff dates and the subsequent

measurement of entrepreneurship status is different in the placebo reform years than in the actual

reform year. In Appendix Table A.5, we instead use data from the 2001 census to examine 2001

entrepreneurship rates among parents of children born around December 31, 1995. In this case,

the time between the placebo cutoff date and the measurement of entrepreneurship status is the

same as in our baseline regressions. We again find no discontinuity around the placebo cutoff date.

Overall, this evidence suggests that our baseline results are indeed driven by the reform rather than

year-end effects.

    To interpret the magnitude of our result, we would ideally like to compare it to other estimates

of how much wages influence labor supply choices. Since our variation is not in wages, we must

first determine the wage increase that would be equally valuable as the increased job protection.

Then we can ask, for a given percentage change in the value of one sector relative to another, what

share of the workforce would switch sectors? We express this as a semi-elasticity and compare the

magnitude to other estimates of how wages influence discrete choices related to labor supply.

    To compute our implied semi-elasticity, we need an estimate of the monetary value of job pro-

tection. Dillon and Stanton (2016) estimate that the option value of being an entrepreneur for

one year, with the opportunity to return to paid work subsequently, is worth 7 percent of lifetime

earnings. We estimate that providing a very similar sort of option through job protection generates

a 1.9 percentage point increase in entrepreneurship. The implied semi-elasticity of sectoral choice

with respect to wage equivalent is thus 0.019/0.07 = 0.27.

    We are not aware of existing direct estimates of this same parameter. However, the empirical lit-

erature has estimated analogous parameters for other types of discrete labor supply choices. Chetty

(2012) finds an extensive margin labor supply elasticity of 0.25. Nicholson and Souleles (2001) find
  19
     To be clear, T reatmenti corresponds to M otheri × P osti in a variant of equation (3) in which all variables are
interacted with a reform year indicator; Ref orm Y eari × T reatmenti corresponds to Ref orm Y eari × M otheri ×
P osti .


                                                         25
that physicians’ specialty choice exhibits a semi-elasticity of 0.25 with respect to income. Lockwood,

Nathanson, and Weyl (2017) estimate a wage elasticity of 1.42 for the share of workers choosing

careers in finance. In an economy with formal and informal sectors, Becerra (2015) estimates an

elasticity of formal sector labor supply with respect to the net-of-tax income share above 1. Of

course, these existing estimates are considering outcomes very different from choosing a spell of

self-employment. But together they demonstrate that discrete choices of whether, how, and where

to work can be quite responsive to income differences. When quantifying our result in terms of

responsiveness to an equally valuable wage increase, it is in the lower range of these existing esti-

mates.


6.3   Robustness

Table 6 shows that our baseline results are robust to a range of alternative regression specifications.

In our baseline specification, we use a triangular kernel, as this has been shown in the RDD literature

to be optimal (Fan et al., 1996). Nonetheless, Panel A of Table 6 shows that results remain similar

when using a uniform kernel rather than a triangular kernel. In our baseline specification, we also

estimate linear control functions, as Gelman and Imbens (2017) show that high-order polynomials

are problematic as RDD control functions. Nonetheless, Panels B and C of Table 6 show that our

results remain similar when we use quadratic and cubic control functions, although the magnitudes

are slightly larger in these cases.

   In a valid RDD or difference-in-discontinuities setting, controlling for additional covariates should

not be necessary, as such covariates should not change discontinuously across the cutoff. Only the

treatment should change discontinuously across the cutoff. Therefore, any discontinuity in the out-

come variable can be attributable to the treatment rather than other confounding factors. Nonethe-

less, in Table 7, we test whether our results are robust to the inclusion of controls. Column (1)

repeats the baseline regression from Table 4 column (4). Columns (2) through (8) sequentially add

ethnic origin fixed effects (225 categories), education level fixed effects (3 categories), urban/rural



                                                  26
fixed effects, age controls (age and age-squared), province fixed effects, stock market controls (the

log value of the Toronto Stock Exchange index on the date of childbirth), and exchange rate controls

(the Canadian-U.S. dollar exchange rate on the date of birth). Finally, column (9) allows the effects

of these control variables to differ between mothers and fathers, by interacting each of them with a

mother indicator. Across all specifications, the magnitude of our estimated treatment effect remains

quite stable.


6.4     Heterogeneity

In this section, we explore how the effect of job-protected leave documented above varies across

provinces, which experienced differential increases in leave availability, and across individuals, who

may differ in their propensity to start a business.


6.4.1    Heterogeneity Across Provinces

In Section 2, we derived conditions under which extending job-protected leave can increase en-

trepreneurship. When these conditions hold, a longer increase in available leave time should lead

to more entrepreneurship than a shorter increase. As shown in Table 2, there is some heterogene-

ity across provinces in how much additional job-protected leave time was available after the cutoff

date. For example, in Alberta, available leave time increased by 34 weeks, while in Ontario, it only

increased by 17 weeks. The first type of heterogeneity we examine is whether the reform had a

larger effect in provinces experiencing a bigger change.

   In Table 8, we estimate a variant of equation (3), in which we interact all variables with the

change in available weeks of leave in an individual’s province. To make the estimates easier to

interpret, we standardize the change in available leave time by subtracting its mean and divid-

ing by its standard deviation. Thus, the coefficient on T reatmenti , without an interaction, now

represents the difference-in-discontinuities estimate corresponding to a province experiencing the

average change in available weeks of leave (i.e., standardized ∆W eeks Leavei = 0). As we would

expect, this coefficient matches the effect estimated in the baseline regression from Table 4. The

                                                 27
coefficient on the interaction term, ∆W eeks Leavei × T reatmenti , represents how the difference-

in-discontinuities estimate varies as the change in available leave time deviates from its mean (in

units of standard deviations).20 We find that the estimated treatment effect is larger in provinces

with larger increases in leave time. This is consistent with the predictions of our conceptual frame-

work. In addition, it lends further support to the idea that our baseline results are indeed driven

by changes in job-protected leave, as opposed to some other mechanism.


6.4.2    Heterogeneity Based on Individual Characteristics

We also explore whether the effect of the leave extension varies across individuals with different char-

acteristics. It is plausible that some people will be more sensitive to job-protected leave availability

than others because they are more willing or able to start a business. For example, individuals with

more education or work experience may have human capital that better positions them to work on a

business idea during a job-protected leave. In addition, individuals with higher human capital may

face a higher rate of skill depreciation. For such individuals, leaving their job to experiment with

entrepreneurship absent job-protection may be costlier in terms of the wage penalty they would

face should they return to wage employment. These individuals should therefore have stronger

incentives to take advantage of the job-protection. In terms of financial capital, individuals with

high-income spouses may be less financially constrained and thus better able to start a business

given the opportunity.

    To test these predictions, we examine whether the effect of job-protected leave differs for those

with and without a college degree, those above and below the median age at childbirth (since age

is a proxy for work experience), and those with a high-income and low-income spouse. Table 9

shows the results. Consistent with the discussion above, in columns (1) and (2) we find that there

is a positive effect of job-protected leave on entrepreneurship for those with a college degree, but

no effect for those without one. The p-value of the difference in coefficients is shown below the

  20
     To be clear, T reatmenti corresponds to M otheri × P osti in a variant of equation (3) in which all variables are
interacted with the standardized change in weeks of leave available in an individual’s province; ∆W eeks Leavei ×
T reatmenti corresponds to ∆W eeks Leavei × M otheri × P osti .


                                                         28
estimates. The difference between columns (1) and (2) is significant at p < 0.01. In columns (3)

and (4) we find a positive effect among individuals above the median age at childbirth, and no effect

among those below the median age. The difference is significant at p < 0.05. Finally, in columns (5)

and (6) we find a positive effect among individuals with a spouse making above the median income

and no effect among individuals with a spouse making below the median income. In this case, the

difference is significant at p < 0.1.21 Overall, the results suggest that the effect of job-protected

leave on entry into entrepreneurship is higher for those with more human and financial capital and

thus a greater ability to enter.


6.5     Mechanism

Our results thus far show that offering employees extended job-protected leaves makes them more

likely to pursue entrepreneurship. Our posited mechanism is that job-protected leaves allow en-

trepreneurs to explore business ideas without putting their non-entrepreneurial career trajectories

at risk. If that is indeed the channel through which the effect operates, we should expect stronger

results when experimentation prior to entry has low costs or high benefits (Kerr, Nanda, and

Rhodes-Kropf, 2014; Ewens, Nanda, and Rhodes-Kropf, 2018).

    We expect the costs of experimentation to be low in industries with low startup capital require-

ments. In such industries, it is relatively inexpensive to obtain information about the prospects

of a business idea. We expect the benefits of experimentation to be high in industries with high

failure rates. In such industries, the downside protection provided by job-protected leave will be

more valuable.

    To operationalize these ideas, we obtain data on industry-level startup capital requirements from

the Survey of Business Owners, following Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2015). We also obtain

data on industry-level 5-year failure rates from Bureau van Dijk’s Orbis database.22 In both cases,


   21
      One caveat regarding the spousal income results is that we can only measure spousal income as of 2006. Ideally,
we would observe spousal income prior to childbirth and split the sample based on that. Nonetheless, since income
is persistent, 2006 spousal income may be a reasonable proxy for 2001 spousal income.
   22
      For each industry in Orbis, we compute failure rates for private firms during their first five years of existence.


                                                          29
industries are defined based on 2-digit NAICS codes. We then decompose our dependent variable

according to each of these measures. For startup capital requirements, we define an indicator

variable equal to one if an individual is an entrepreneur working in a high startup capital industry

(startup capital requirements above the median) and another if the individual is an entrepreneur

working in a low startup capital industry (startup capital requirements below the median). These

two variables add up to our original dependent variable. We decompose entrepreneurship based on

industry failure rates analogously.23

    Table 10 shows the results using these decompositions. In columns (1) and (2) we find that

extending job-protected leave increases low startup capital entrepreneurship, but has no effect on

high startup capital entrepreneurship. In columns (3) and (4) we find that extending job-protected

leave increases high-risk entrepreneurship, but has no effect on entrepreneurship in low-risk indus-

tries. As one would expect, the coefficients in each pair of columns add up to our baseline estimate.

Overall, these results are consistent with the view that job-protected leave drives entrepreneurial

entry by insulating entrepreneurs from downside risk and enabling them to experiment.


6.6    Business Quality

We next consider the types of firms that these individuals are starting: are they small, transitory

ventures or do they engage in substantive economic activities? The first observation to note is

that we measure businesses that still exist five years after the cutoff date. If the reform only

increased transitory, negligible ventures, we might expect to see no long-run effects because these

businesses would cease operating within that time frame. Further, the effect of the reform on

entrepreneurship is significantly stronger for individuals with ex ante characteristics that predict

higher-quality businesses. In particular, those with more education and more work experience

respond more strongly to the reform.

    Nonetheless, to further explore the quality of these businesses we use self-reported information
  23
    Examples of low startup capital industries in our sample include professional services, construction, retail trade,
and educational services; examples of high failure rate industries include professional services, transportation and
warehousing, retail trade, and environmental services.


                                                          30
about them. Our primary measure of entrepreneurship thus far has been based on self-employment

income. However, respondents to the long form census questionnaire also self-report whether they

are self-employed. If they identify themselves as self-employed, they further report additional infor-

mation about their business.

   We begin by making sure that our results are robust to using self-reported entrepreneurship as

the dependent variable. In the first column of Table 11, Panel A, we re-estimate equation (3), with

self-reported entrepreneurship. The results are similar to our main estimates in Table 4. The mag-

nitudes are larger, but the mean of this dependent variable is also higher than our baseline measure.

Next, we decompose this self-reported entrepreneurship variable into two separate variables: an

indicator equal to one if the individual reports being self-employed with an incorporated business,

and an indicator equal to one if the individual reports being self-employed with an unincorporated

business. In columns (2) and (3), we find that the reform increases incorporated entrepreneurship

but has no significant effect on unincorporated entrepreneurship. As expected, the coefficients in

columns (2) and (3) sum to the coefficient in column (1). Similarly, in columns (4) and (5) we de-

compose self-reported entrepreneurs into those that hire paid employees and those that do not. We

find that the reform increases job-creating entrepreneurship but has no effect on non-job-creating en-

trepreneurship. In Panel B, we examine work hours and income. In this case, we define a high-hour

entrepreneur to be one working above the median number of hours, and a low-hour entrepreneur to

be one working below the median number of hours. We similarly define a high-earning entrepreneur

to be one earning above the median income, and a low-earning entrepreneur as the complement.

We find that the reform leads to an increase in high-hour and high-earning entrepreneurs, but leads

to no change in low-hour or low-earning entrepreneurs.

   It should also be noted that we may be limited in our ability to detect low-quality entry, as

low-quality entrants are less likely to still be operating at the point when we can observe them

(5 years later). Thus, the main finding from Table 11 is that the reform does appear to increase

high-quality entry. We cannot determine whether it increases low-quality entry as well, since those



                                                 31
entrepreneurs may exit before the 2006 census.

   While these findings do not necessarily indicate that the reform led to so-called “transformational

entrepreneurs” (Schoar, 2010; Hurst and Pugsley, 2011), they do seem to indicate the creation of

meaningful businesses. Moreover, even if one were skeptical about the quality of these businesses,

understanding the relation between career risk and entrepreneurial entry remains important. The

role of career risk may generalize beyond the particular group we study in this paper. For example,

one could imagine that if large technology companies in Silicon Valley gave their employees a similar

ability to take long job-protected leaves—for the explicit purpose of working on a business idea—such

a policy might lead to the creation of technology startups.


6.7     Alternative Explanations

6.7.1    Job Flexibility

One alternative explanation for our results is that new mothers have a stronger desire for job

flexibility than other workers. However, our estimates should not be influenced by changes in

preferences that result from having a child, as everyone in our sample has a child. Conditional on

having a child, we compare those who (quasi-randomly) were eligible for a longer period of job-

protected leave to those who were not. Therefore, we do not think of job flexibility as providing

an alternative explanation for our results. Rather, job flexibility is an underlying reason that

entrepreneurship may be desirable.

   In particular, even if those in our sample were only interested in entrepreneurship for job flexi-

bility reasons, our results would still suggest that career risk deters potential entrepreneurs. Prior

to the reform, employees always had the option to quit wage employment and create a flexible job

without the security of job-protection. The primary thing the reform changed was to allow them

to experiment while maintaining the option to return to their previous job. Put differently, our

conceptual framework allows for uncertain payoffs from entrepreneurship, both pecuniary and non-

pecuniary (Schoar, 2010; Hurst and Pugsley, 2011). Job-protection allows employees to reduce this



                                                 32
uncertainty before making a major career change.


6.7.2    Skill Depreciation

Another possibility is that longer leaves cause employees’ skills to depreciate. In this case, workers

might lack the skills to return to their previous jobs, essentially forcing them into entrepreneurship.

Again, recall that the “treatment” in this natural experiment is not a longer forced leave. If taking

a short leave is optimal for employees from a skill-depreciation standpoint, they could still take

a short leave after the reform. If the benefits of additional time away outweigh the costs of skill

depreciation, they could always have taken additional time away before the reform (without job-

protection) and eventually have entered self-employment. In other words, long leaves that forced

workers into self-employment were available before the reform as well. Therefore, there is no reason

to expect the reform to lead to an increased tendency for employees to take such leaves.

    Moreover, one would expect “skill-depreciation entrepreneurs” to be lower quality entrepreneurs.

But we find an increase in high-quality entrepreneurship. In addition, if employees were forced out

of their jobs due to skill depreciation, we would expect job continuity to decrease. However, using

panel data, Baker and Milligan (2008a) find that the reform we study in this paper actually increased

job continuity with pre-birth employers.24 Finally, even if an employee’s skills did depreciate, she

would have grounds to bring legal action were she forced out of her job as a result of having taken

job-protected leave.


6.7.3    Financial Constraints

Another potential explanation is that longer leaves simply relax financial constraints. However, in

2000, employment insurance only provided 55 percent income replacement up to a maximum of $413

CAD per week (about $275 USD). Thus, the reform does not represent a positive wealth shock,

   24
      Note that Baker and Milligan’s (2008a) results are entirely consistent with ours. Longer job-protected leave
entitlements can lead both to greater entry into entrepreneurship and greater job continuity. Longer leaves may
cause some people to leave their pre-birth employer to start a business. However, longer leaves may simultaneously
cause even more people to return to their pre-birth employer who otherwise would have left the labor force or become
unemployed.


                                                        33
as people earn significantly lower income while on leave. If someone had an idea but insufficient

capital to pursue it, she would most likely still have insufficient capital while on leave. Moreover,

we find stronger effects in provinces that had larger increases in job-protected leave time. If changes

in paid leave time were driving our results, we would not expect this, as all provinces had the same

increase in paid leave.

    Finally, to further disentangle the effects of job-protection and income replacement, we repeat

our baseline analysis using the sample of parents who gave birth in Quebec. Quebec increased job-

protected leave to 70 weeks many years earlier and did not change it along with the other provinces.

Thus, a mother who gave birth just after December 31, 2000, in Quebec would be eligible for more

paid leave than one who gave birth before, but no additional job-protected leave. In Appendix Table

A.6, we re-estimate our baseline specification using the sample of parents who gave birth in Quebec.

We find insignificant effects of the reform in this case.

    Overall, it seems unlikely that changes in paid leave entitlements drive our results. Instead, the

job-protection aspect of the reform appears to be the key factor. These results are also consistent

with Dahl et al. (2016) and Stearns (2016), who find that increases in paid leave without changes

in job protection have little effect on a wide variety of outcomes.



7    Conclusion

Choosing to start a business is inherently a risky proposition. In this paper, we highlight the

importance of one particular type of risk: the downside risk that an entrepreneur faces when giving

up alternative employment. If a potential entrepreneur starts a venture that ultimately fails, it is

hard to obtain as good a job as the one she could have otherwise had. We have adduced empirical

evidence that this phenomenon is indeed a relevant consideration for potential entrepreneurs, by

showing the effect of job-protected leave availability. When Canadian mothers are granted the

ability to take extended leaves of absence, during which they are guaranteed the option to return

to their job, their entry into entrepreneurship increases. They enter in industries where the cost of


                                                  34
experimentation is low and downside protection appears most valuable. The resulting businesses

are economically meaningful, as our results are not driven by new businesses that quickly fail.

Instead, the entrepreneurs that are spurred to enter tend to incorporate their business and hire paid

employees. They also tend to have more human and financial capital. We conclude that potential

entrepreneurs are indeed concerned about their downside risk in the event they want to return to

paid employment.

   These results suggest a key role for well-functioning labor markets in facilitating entrepreneur-

ship. Potential entrepreneurs are also potential employees (Gromb and Scharfstein, 2002). It is

much easier to take a big risk with one’s career when there is a good fallback option in place.

We show that job-protected leave can provide this fallback option in some circumstances. Flexible

and well-functioning labor markets can do the same, and may, therefore, play an important role in

facilitating entrepreneurship.

                                Leave Taking Before and After Reform
Panel A shows the share of employed mothers on leave in the census reference week (the week ending the
Sunday before the census date) as a function of the number of weeks between their most recent child’s birth
and the reference week. Panel B shows the share of fathers. We calculate these shares separately using data
from the 1996 census (before the reform), the 2001 census (before or after the reform, depending on the
child’s exact birth date), and the 2006 census (after the reform).

     This table presents summary statistics for mothers and fathers who had their first child (excluding multiple births) within 60 days of the December
     31, 2000 reform date. All variables reflect information as of the 2006 census date (May 16, 2006). Number of Children is the total number of children
     the parent had as of the census date. Entrepreneur (income-based) is an indicator equal one if the parent receives at least 50% of his/her total income
     from self-employment. Entrepreneur (self-reported) is an indicator equal to one if the parent self-reports as self-employed. Age is the parent’s age as
     of the census date. Bachelor’s Degree indicates having a Bachelor or above Bachelor degree. Minority indicates being in a non-white ethnic group.
     Total income indicates total annual personal income (in 2006 USD). Work hours indicate the average number of work hours per week. Sample sizes
     are weighted and rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 as required by Statistics Canada.

Panel A of this table tests for gaming around the cutoff date. It estimates the following local linear regression
with a triangular kernel and bandwidths ranging from 60 days to 30 days:

                   N umBirthst = α + τ P ostt + δ1 EventDayt + δ2 P ostt × EventDayt + t ,

where observations are at the day level and the sample consists of days around the December 31, 2000, reform
cutoff date; N umBirthst represents the number of (first-time, singleton) births on date t; EventDayt is the
date relative to the cutoff date; and P ostt is an indicator equal to one if the date is on or after the cutoff date.

Panel B of this table tests for discontinuity in the observable characteristics of parents who had a child
around the cutoff date. It estimates the following local linear regression with a triangular kernel and a 30
day bandwidth:

                   Characteristici = α + τ P osti + δ1 DayChildi + δ2 P osti × DayChildi + i ,

where observations are at the parent level; in columns (1)–(3) the sample consists of mothers who had a
first child (excluding multiples) within 30 days of the cutoff date; in columns (4)–(6) the sample consists
of analogous fathers; DayChildi represents the date parent i’s child was born relative to the reform cutoff
date; P osti is an indicator equal to one if parent i had a child on or after the cutoff date. Other variables
are defined as in Table 1. Sample sizes are weighted and rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 as required by
Statistics Canada. Standard errors are clustered by week. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%,
5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

                                             Baseline Results
This table tests whether increased job-protected leave availability causes an increase in entrepreneurship using
a differences-in-discontinuities framework. It estimates the following local linear regression with bandwidths
ranging from 60 days to 30 days and a triangular kernel:

           Entrepreneuri     = M otheri × [α + τ P osti + δ1 DayChildi + δ2 P osti × DayChildi ]
                             + [a + tP osti + d1 DayChildi + d2 P osti × DayChildi ] + i ,

where observations are at the parent level; the sample consists of parents who had a first child (excluding
multiples) within a specified bandwidth around the December 31, 2000, cutoff date; Entrepreneuri is an
indicator equal to one if over 50% of parent i’s income is from self-employment as of the 2006 census;
DayChildi represents the date parent i’s child was born relative to the reform cutoff date; P osti is an
indicator equal to one if parent i had a child on or after the cutoff date. The row labeled T reatment in the
table corresponds to the coefficient τ in the above equation and represents the estimated average treatment
effect. Sample sizes are weighted and rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 as required by Statistics Canada.
Standard errors are clustered by week. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels,
respectively.

                                Placebo Test Using Non-Reform Years
This table compares the difference-in-discontinuities estimate from placebo years prior to the reform with
the estimate in the actual reform year. The sample consists of parents who had their first child (excluding
multiples) within a specified bandwidth around December 31 in the years 1991–2000. All variables from
the equation in Table 4 are then interacted with a reform year indicator equal to one for parents who had
a child around December 31 in the year 2000. All other variables are defined as in Table 4. The coeffi-
cient on T reatment, without an interaction, represents the size of the difference-in-discontinuities estimate
around December 31 in non-reform years (i.e., Ref orm Y ear = 0). The coefficient on the interaction term,
Ref orm Y ear × T reatment, represents how much larger the difference-in-discontinuities estimate is around
December 31 in the actual reform year relative to non-reform years (Ref orm Y ear × T reatment corresponds
to Ref orm Y ear × M other × P ost). Sample sizes are weighted and rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 as
required by Statistics Canada. Standard errors are clustered by week. *, **, and *** indicate significance
at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

     This table repeats the analysis of Table 4 adding a range of different controls. Column (1) repeats the baseline regression from column (4) of Table
     4. Columns (2) through (8) sequentially add ethnic origin fixed effects (225 categories), education level fixed effects (3 categories), urban/rural fixed
     effects, age controls (age and age-squared), province fixed effects, stock market controls (the log value of the Toronto Stock Exchange index on the
     date of childbirth), and exchange rate controls (the Canadian-U.S. dollar exchange rate on the date of childbirth). Column (9) allows the effect of
     these control variables to differ between mothers and fathers, by interacting each of them with a mother indicator. Sample sizes are weighted and
     rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 as required by Statistics Canada. Standard errors are clustered by week. *, **, and *** indicate significance at
     the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

                                     Heterogeneity Across Provinces
This table examines whether our main results differ across provinces with different lengths of leave extension.
We repeat the analysis of Table 4, allowing all variables to interact with the change in available weeks of
leave in an individual’s province. We standardize the change in available weeks of leave by subtracting
its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. The coefficient on T reatment, without an interaction,
now represents the difference-in-discontinuities estimate in a province experiencing the average change in
available weeks of leave (i.e., standardized ∆W eeks Leave = 0). The coefficient on the interaction term,
∆W eeks Leave × T reatment, represents how the difference-in-discontinuities estimate varies as the change
in available leave time deviates from its mean (in units of standard deviations). Sample sizes are weighted
and rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 as required by Statistics Canada. Standard errors are clustered by
week. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

     This table characterizes entrants into entrepreneurship based on industry characteristics. It repeats the analysis of column (4) of Table 4, decomposing
     the dependent variable. The dependent variable in column (1) is an indicator variable equal to one if an individual is an entrepreneur working in a
     high startup capital industry (startup capital requirements above the median). The dependent variable in column (2) is an indicator variable equal to
     one if the individual is an entrepreneur working in a low startup capital industry (startup capital requirements below the median). Columns (3)–(4)
     decompose entrepreneurship based on industry failure rates analogously. Industry startup capital requirements are defined as the mean of startup
     requirements for firms in a 2-digit NAICS industry from the Survey of Business Owners. Industry failure rates are defined as 5-year failure rates for
     private firms in a 2-digit NAICS industry from Bureau van Dijk’s Orbis database. Sample sizes are weighted and rounded to the nearest multiple

     column (2) of Panel A is an indicator variable equal to one if an individual is a self-reported entrepreneur who has incorporated his/her business.
     The dependent variable in column (3) of Panel A is an indicator variable equal to one if the individual is a self-reported entrepreneur who has
     not incorporated his/her business. Columns (3)–(4) of Panel A decompose self-reported entrepreneurship based on whether individuals hire paid
     employees. Columns (1)–(2) of Panel B decompose self-reported entrepreneurship based on whether individuals report working above or below the
     median number of hours. Columns (3)–(4) of Panel B decompose self-reported entrepreneurship based on whether individuals report earning above
     or below the median income. Sample sizes are weighted and rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 as required by Statistics Canada. Standard errors
     are clustered by week. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

                                                Entrepreneurship and Cross-Sectional Characteristics
    This table shows the cross-sectional relationship between various characteristics and the probability of being an entrepreneur as of the 2006 census.
    Characteristics are interacted with a mother indicator to test whether the association between a characteristic and entrepreneurship is different
    between mothers and fathers. Columns (1) through (5) are estimated using OLS and columns (6) through (10) are estimated with Logit. The sample
    is the same as that used in column (4) of Table 4. Sample sizes are weighted and rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 as required by Statistics Canada.
    Standard errors are clustered by week of childbirth. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

    B     Proofs
    B.1    Bayesian Learning
    We begin by characterizing the learning process. At the end of the leave, upon observing the signal, a worker forms a posterior about the
    payoff from entrepreneurship: X|s(t). It can be shown that her posterior expectation is

                                                                                           η0           h(t)
                                                                      E[X|s(t)] =                 µ+           s(t),
                                                                                        η0 + h(t)    η0 + h(t)

    and the posterior variance is
                                                                                                        1
                                                                                   V ar[X|s(t)] =             .
                                                                                                    η0 + h(t)
                                                                          

    Therefore, X|s(t) ∼ N        η0 +h(t) µ   +   η0 +h(t) s(t), h+h(t)        .
        Using variance decomposition, V ar[E[X|s(t)]] = V ar(X) − E[V ar[X|s(t)]] = η10 − η0 +h(t)
                                                                                                1

    in t, while the variance of the posterior expectation increases in t. Therefore, we also have
                                                                                          
                                                                            1        1
                                                        E[X|s(t)] ∼ N µ,      −              .

    B.2    Optimization
    To simplify notation, let ht stand in for h(t), st for s(t), and δt for δ(t). At T = t, the worker chooses entrepreneurship if the expected
    utility based on her updated belief is higher than the utility from wage employment, i.e., EU (X|st ) > EU (y(1 − δt )).       We assume
    individuals have exponential utility: U (x) = −e  −λx                                                                       2
                                                          , where λ is the coefficient of absolute risk aversion. For x ∼ N µ, σ , the expected
                               −λµ+λ2 σ2
    utility will be EU (x) = −e        2 .

        The worker maximizes expected utility at time 0 by choosing the optimal t:

                                                      maxEU (t) = max E { max [ EU (X|t), EU (y (1 − δt ) |t)] } .
                                                       t≥0                 t≥0

                               η0             ht           1
    Note that X|st ∼ N       η0 +ht µ   +   η0 +ht st , η0 +ht       , so U (X|st ) follows a log-normal distribution. Specifically,
                                                                                            "                             #

    Since job-protected leave only applies to those who did not quit their job for entrepreneurship before leave starts, we are only interested
    in individuals for whom Pr (Entrepreneurship|t = 0) = 0, i.e., those for whom µ − 2ηλ0 < y.

    B.3    The effect of leave extension
    Having derived expressions for expected utility and the probability of entrepreneurship as a function of t, we can now prove Proposition
    1. To do so, we first prove several lemmas.
                                    λ
    Lemma 1. Assuming µ −          2η0   < y, Pr (Entrepreneurship|t) increases in t.

                                µ−y(1−δt )− 2(η λ+h )
                                                   t
                                                                                                                            √      0       1            0
    Proof. First, let f (t) =      q

        Because µ−y − 2ηλ0 < 0, it can be easily seen that f (t) > 0. At the boundary, when t increases from TL to TL +, δt increases discretely.
    Therefore f (t), and hence Φ(f (t)), also increases discretely at the boundary. We therefore proved that P rob(Entrepreneurship|t) always
    increases in t.

                                                                                0

     K(f ) = − σσ0 > 0. Therefore K(IM R) is always positive and therefore                                                 ∂d  =    ∂f ∂d

     Proof. First we define some notation. Let, EU0 (t) represent the expected utility function that would prevail if we let δ(t) = θdt for all t,
     including t > TL . Similarly define t∗0 as the t that maximizes EU0 (t). Next define:

                                                                    EU0∗ (d) = maxEU0 (t; d, θ)

                                                                     EU ∗ (d) = maxEU (t; d, θ)
                                                                                     t≥0
                                                            ∆EU ∗ (d) = EUl∗ (d) − EUr∗ (d).
           We start with the case of full shielding. With θ = 0, we know from the proof of Lemma 3 that regardless of d, EU (t) is strictly
     increasing for t ≤ TL . By Lemma 3, If d = 0, EU (t) is smooth around TL and E(t) is increasing in t for all t. By Lemma 2 we know that
     for d > 0 there is a discrete drop in EU (t) at t = TL . By Lemma 4, we also know that there exists a d such that for all d > d, EU (t)
                                                                                                                  ∂t∗
     is decreasing for all t > TL . It follows that for all d > d, t∗ = TL . It also follows that for all d > d, ∂T L
                                                                                                                      > 0, because as we said before
     EU (TL ) > 0. Finally, Lemma 1 shows that, assuming µ − 2η0 < y, the probability of entry into entrepreneurship is increasing in t∗ .
           0                                                            λ

           Next consider the case of partial shielding. We know from Lemma 3 that when d = 0, t∗0 = +∞. Similarly, from Lemma 4, when
                                                                    ∗
              ˜ t∗ = 0. Finally, from Lemma 6, we know that, ∂t0 < 0. Therefore, there must exist a unique crossing point d¯ such that t∗ d¯ = TL .
                                                                                                                                               
     d > d,      0                                                 ∂d                                                                      0
     Notethat, EU      (t) = EU0 (t) for all t ≤ TL ;∗ However, by Lemma 2, EU (t) < EU0 (t) for all t > TL . Therefore, with d = d¯ it must be that
      ∗    ¯       ∗  ¯
     t d = t0 d = TL . We know that ∆EU d > 0. Since ∆EU ∗ (d) is a continuous function, there must exist a d such that for all d < d¯
                                                          ¯
                                                           

     and it is still the case that ∆EU ∗ (d) > 0 and t∗ (d) = TL . Let d denote the lowest such d.
           Given the way that d¯ and d were defined, we know that for d ≤ d < d,      ¯ EU0 (t) is maximized at some t∗ (d) > TL . Since Lemma 5
                                                                                                                          0
                          00
     shows that EU0 (t) < 0, EU0 (t) must be strictly increasing up until this maximum and strictly decreasing afterward. Therefore, since
     EU (t) = EU0 (t) for t ≤ TL , it must be the case that EU 0 (TL ) > 0 for d ≤ d < d. ¯ Combining this with the fact that t∗ = TL implies that
      ∂t ∗
     ∂TL > 0.
14




           Given the way that d¯ was defined, we also know that for d > d,  ¯ EU0 (t) is maximized at some t∗ (d) < TL . Since Lemma 5 shows that
                                                                                                                0
           00
     EU0 (t) < 0, EU0 (t) must be strictly increasing up until this maximum and strictly decreasing afterward. Note that, EU (t) = EU0 (t)
     for all t ≤ TL ; However, by Lemma 2, EU (t) < EU0 (t) for all t > TL . Thus, EU (t) is also maximized at t∗0 (d) < TL . In other words,
                                                 ∂t∗
     t∗ (d) < TL . Under these conditions, ∂T      L
                                                     = 0. By a similar argument, we also know that for d < d, t∗ (d) > TL . Under these conditions,
      ∂t ∗
     ∂TL = 0.
           Finally, Lemma 1 shows that, assuming µ − 2ηλ0 < y, the probability of entry in entrepreneurship is increasing in t∗ .
