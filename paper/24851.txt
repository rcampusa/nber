The Welfare Implications of Health Insurance

                                          ABSTRACT

We analyze the financial value of insurance when individuals have access to credit markets.
Loans allow consumers to smooth shocks across time, decreasing the value of the smoothing
(across states of the world) provided by insurance. We derive a simple formula for the
incremental value of insurance and show how it depends on individual age, health, and income
and on the features of available loans. Our central contribution is to derive formulas for aggregate
welfare that can be taken to data from typical studies of health insurance. We provide both exact
formulas that can be taken to data on the distribution of medical expenditures and income and an
approximate formula for aggregate data on medical expenditure. Using the Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey we illustrate how the incremental value of insurance is decreasing with access to
loans. For consumers in the sickest decile, access to a five-year loan decreases the incremental
value of insurance by $338 (6%) on average and $3,433 (36%) for the poorest consumers. We
also find that our approximate formula is a reasonable proxy for the exact one in our data.

A central parameter of interest in health care policy is the value of health care
insurance. Economic theory suggests health care insurance could improve both the health and
the financial status of beneficiaries. Health care insurance lowers the price of medical care to
beneficiaries on the margin and therefore may increase consumption of care. If increased care
improves health, insurance may thereby improve health of beneficiaries. Moreover, health care
insurance may be a more efficient means of raising capital for health care expenditures than
alternatives such as current income, savings, or borrowing. Therefore, insurance may be able to
reduce the overall cost of medical care – the price charged by the provider plus the cost of raising
capital to pay that price – even for inframarginal consumption of care.
While there is some dispute about the impact of insurance on health in the U.S., there is a
consensus that it has positive financial impacts on beneficiaries. Reviews by Freeman, Kadiyala,
Bell, and Martin (2008) and Levy and Meltzer (2008) found well-designed but non-randomized
studies showing a positive effect on health. However, both the RAND and the Oregon health
insurance experiments reported that increased utilization from insurance 2 had little effects on
health, except for the poor 3 in the RAND study (perhaps because they were credit constrained)
and for self-reported psychological ailments such as depression in the Oregon study (Finkelstein
et al., 2012; Newhouse, 1993). By contrast, a wide array of studies – including the both the
RAND and Oregon experiments – have noted that health insurance reduces out of pocket (OOP)
payments and perhaps indebtedness.
The problem for economists, however, is that most studies of health insurance measure financial
benefits in terms of OOP expenditures, but it is difficult to translate these into welfare. 4 OOP
payments imply foregone non-medical consumption, but the welfare effect depends on the
amount of non-medical consumption sacrificed and the marginal utility of that consumption.
These parameters in turn depend on the cost of financing those OOP payments, whether by
saving, current income or borrowing. For example, if OOP payments are financed by borrowing,
then the cost of financing OOP payments is lower when interest rates are low. Since insurance
displaces OOP payments, this implies that the value of insurance falls as (real) interest rates fall.
To get at the welfare value of the foregone consumption of OOP payments, we model
consumers, who might suffer a health shock, as having a choice of whether to finance medical
care with insurance or with credit. We allow consumers to vary on medical risk, age, and
income and we consider different models of insurance pricing. This model generates positive
implications about who seeks insurance and who obtains loans. At its core, the choice depends
on whether, given the ability to smooth foregone consumption over time, is it worth the added

  There is consistent evidence that health care insurance increases health care utilization (Buchmueller, Grumbach,
Kronick, & Kahn, 2005).

  Even these effects were not statistically significant. However, RAND could not rule out the possibility of
medically significant benefits.

  Knowing that insurance reduces indebtedness suffers the same problem. While reduction in indebtedness tells us
how OOP were financed, it does not tell us the value of foregone consumption unless we know the cost of borrowed
capital.

cost to also smooth consumption over states of the world (i.e., across members of the pool). If
so, then insurance is superior. If not, loans are preferred.
Moral hazard plays a complex role. Insurance creates the potential for moral hazard because it
lowers the consumer’s price for marginal care, perhaps inducing excess care. This inefficiency is
reflected in a higher premium, which translates into a higher cost of financing care with
insurance. Thus, moral hazard in insurance makes loans more attractive. Yet loans also face
moral hazard. This comes from bankruptcy protection for debtors in case of default. The higher
the risk of default, the higher the interest rate on loans to compensate creditors. Thus moral
hazard in loans makes insurance more attractive.
Some implications of the model depend on the nature of insurance pricing. When insurance is
community-rated, i.e., all member of an insurance pool pay the same premium regardless of their
expected medical expenditures or “risk-rating”, high risk individuals unsurprisingly prefer
insurance to loans because their expenditures are cross-subsidized by the low risk. Less
obviously, when insurance is experience-rated, i.e., an individual’s premiums depends on her
risk-rating, there are countervailing forces where high risk individuals may actually prefer loans
because the high risk implies less smoothing of costs across people/states of the world, whereas
loans at least distribute those costs over time periods.
Regardless of how insurance is priced, older individuals tend to prefer insurance. The reason is
that older individuals have fewer periods of life remaining in which to repay loans, so their
sacrificed consumption for debt repayment is concentrated in fewer years. The sacrifice of
utility is thus greater for the old than the young for any given level of debt.
In addition to the positive predictions, we use our model to derive formulas for the welfare
impacts of insurance. For the sake of realism in the US context, we focus on community-rated
insurance and ask about the impact of switching from insurance to loans for one year in a
population that is otherwise insured in other years. We present exact formulas and also
approximations based upon Taylor expansions. The formulas derived from approximations
depend only on the variance and average level of health expenditures and the coefficient of
relative risk aversion, whereas the exact formulas the full distribution of potential shocks and a
specified utility function. Both formulas require income, the interest rate and loan duration, and
the markup on insurance. 5
We apply our formulas to data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). For our
exact formulas, we group households into bins of predicted health expenditures and use the
distribution of actual shocks for each bin as an estimate of the distribution of possible shocks that
a household in that bin faced ex-ante. Using CRRA utility we calculate the value of insurance for
an individual for different loan lengths and cost assumptions. As expected, insurance is more
valuable for sicker individuals, but only under community-rating. More interestingly, loans
make insurance less valuable. In our baseline case, the ability to borrow decreases the


5
  In a future draft we plan to adapt the formula to public insurance and account for the cost and benefits of insurance
premium subsidies financed by public funds.

incremental value of insurance by an average of $65 (relative to no loans). This is relative to a
baseline of $1,147 for the average value of insurance to individuals without access to loans. For
the sickest decile the average decrease is $338 (6%) and the maximum is $3,433 (36%). More
generally, the value of insurance is decreasing in the length of time for which individuals can
borrow, but increasing in the cost of financing loans.
We compare the results from the exact formulas to the results from our approximation formula to
judge the accuracy of the latter. The approximation does reasonably well on average, but
overestimates the value of insurance for the poorest individuals and the healthiest individuals; it
underestimates it for the sickest. The approximation for the effect of the length of the borrowing
period on the relative value of insurance is also only accurate for those in the middle of the
health distribution.
Our paper contributes to the sizable literature on the welfare implications of social insurance,
particularly health insurance. As Einav, Finkelstein, and Levin (2010) note in their
comprehensive review, nearly all existing papers in this literature focus on inefficiency in the
market for insurance due to adverse selection (consumers’ private information about their own
risk). 6 The benchmark for these studies is either insurance with complete information or another
insurance contract with private information. 7
By contrast, our paper uses as a benchmark the case of no (or less) insurance, i.e., it seeks to
calculate the value of pure insurance. Here its main contribution is elaborating on the idea that
the better are other consumption smoothing tools, e.g., credit markets, the lower the value of
insurance. Another contrast is that, to the extent we examine an inefficiency from insurance, it is
due to moral hazard not adverse selection. 8 (In a future draft we will account for adverse
selection along the lines that Handel, Hendel, and Whinston (2015) do, though our aim will
remain understanding how credit markets affect the value of insurance.)
This paper is closely related to Finkelstein, Hendren, and Luttmer (2016), which uses the
approach of sufficient statistics (Chetty, 2009) to value Medicaid using data from the Oregon
Health Insurance Experiment. Whereas the present draft of our paper focuses on the value of
private insurance, Finkelstein et al. (2016) examine the net welfare benefits of subsidized (free)
public insurance, i.e., the pure insurance plus the transfer benefit from Medicaid minus the cost
of public funds to finance those benefits. There is nonetheless an overlap because both examine
consumption with and without insurance to estimate the welfare value of pure insurance,
particularly the value of reducing OOP medical expenditures.



6
  For example, Einav, Finkelstein, and Cullen (2010) use variation in prices to identify consumer demand and
marginal and average costs to estimate the welfare loss from adverse selection in private health insurance. See also
Carlin and Town (2009).
7
  For example, Bundorf, Levin, and Mahoney (2012) examine impact of private consumer information (or the
equivalent, non-utilization by sellers of information about consumers in pricing) and compare welfare amongst
employer plans with community or experience rating and plans with uniform and non-uniform employer
contributions.

  Whether that selection is on risk or propensity for moral hazard (Einav, Finkelstein, Ryan, Schrimpf, & Cullen,
2013).

There are multiple ways to estimate the impact of insurance on consumption. One approach
Finkelstein et al. (2016) employs is to view OOP payments as lost consumption. This approach
implicitly assumes that consumers have no access to credit markets and cannot smooth OOP
costs over time. This may overestimate the value of insurance. Another approach that paper
employs is to directly examine consumption. That consumption reflects the savings or
borrowing that was enlisted to smooth consumption. However, if one cannot measure all
consumption lost in past or future periods of due to health shocks, this approach may
underestimate the value of insurance. We follow a third approach, which is to reallocate OOP
payments over time assuming that consumers borrow to smooth consumption. We allow for the
fact that, because of borrowing, concurrent consumption is reduced by less than the full amount
of the OOP payments (like the second approach in Finkelstein et al. (2016)), and we also capture
the effect of that borrowing on consumption in later time periods when the loan taken out to
cover OOP payments is repaid. 9 However, this approach is only as accurate as its assumptions
about the type of loans consumers can and do access.
Our model is similar to the model Dobkin, Finkelstein, Kluender, and Notowidigdo (2016)
employ to understand how consumers finance hospital bills. There are two important
differences. First, Dobkin et al. (2016) emphasizes the impact of sickness on income. The paper
examines how hospital shocks were financed using the Consumer Expenditure Survey and
reported that borrowing declined after shocks among both the insured and uninsured, a result
suggesting that shocks reduce income and thereby capacity for borrowing. 10 Our model does not
presently account for income shocks or the effect that those have on borrowing. That said, just
as individuals are able to borrow less because of income shocks, they are also able to insure less
as income shocks cannot generally be smoothed with insurance. Second, Dobkin et al. (2016) do
not treat debt collection by providers as credit, though it is trade credit and an important
consequence of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 1986 (EMTALA), which
requires hospitals to treat first and collect payment later, i.e., to extend credit to their customers.
Our assumptions about access to credit implicitly account for trade credit as they do not specify
the source of the credit.




9
  As Finkelstein et al. (2016) say, their first approach over estimates the value of insurance because it assumes that
consumption is reduced by the full OOP payments. Their second approach potentially understates the value of
insurance because it does not account for the consumption loss in later periods due to borrowing. Our approach is in
the middle because we allow for the consumption loss to be smaller than the OOP payments, but also include the
consumption loss in later periods.
10
   It should be noted that their evidence does not conclusively demonstrate that people cannot borrow because of
income shocks following hospitalization. The uninsured have a smaller absolute reduction in borrowing than the
insured after a health shock, a result consistent with the uninsured borrowing more relative to the insured. This
result is unconditional on income, but the uninsured have less income in their data so their borrowing capacity
should be less not more than the insured. While the authors conduct a difference-in-difference analysis on matched
individuals from insured and uninsured groups (reported in their appendix) which shows borrowing declines more
amongst the uninsured on a percentage rather than absolute basis, it is absolute levels rather than percentages that
matter for borrowing as hospital bills reflect costs rather than the income of beneficiaries.

Our overall analysis is most closely related to Handel, Hendel, and Whinston (2015). That paper
calculates the welfare value of one-year insurance contracts under community rating versus
experience or risk rating. 11 It also compares these two pricing schemes when consumers have
access to credit. It reports that the relative advantage of community rating declines with access to
credit because saving reduces the relative cost of reclassification risk. Unfortunately, the paper
provides an estimate of the difference in value between the two insurance contracts with credit
and without credit, but not the absolute value of a given insurance contract with and without
access to credit, the focus of this paper. Going beyond Handel et al. (2015), this paper also
considers how different aspects of the credit contract (interest rate, repayment period) affect the
value of each type of insurance contract.
The remainder of the paper has three parts. Section I presents a simplified version of our model
of consumer choice between health care insurance and loans to cover treatment for health
shocks. (A more realistic model is presented in the appendix.) We discuss the positive
implications of the choice model. Section II derives formulas and approximations for the
welfare value of health care insurance. Section III estimates formulas with data from MEPS. 12

I. Theory
To illustrate the basic tradeoffs, this section presents a simplified model of consumer choice
between health care insurance and loans for financing the medical care required to treat a health
shock. Simplicity is achieved mainly via two assumptions. First, we assume that individuals
face only one potential shock per period. Second, we focus the model on the choice of insurance
or loans in a single period of the model, assuming that the consumer has insurance in all other
periods. In the appendix we present a somewhat more general model. In addition, our numerical
analysis uses a model with a distribution of shocks, relaxing the first assumption.
To provide a conservative estimate of the value of credit markets we also assume that the
individual only has access to loans to cover the cost of medical care in case she suffers a health
shock; she cannot use the credit markets to more generally smooth consumption across time.
Because we hobble credit markets in this manner and the value of insurance falls with the value
of credit markets, the model here provides an upper bound on the value of insurance. The
appendix also presents results from a model that allows credit markets to be used more generally
to smooth consumption, providing a lower bound on the value of insurance.
A. Simplified model
We will model an individual from a larger population of heterogeneous consumers. For
simplicity, all consumers have an identical per period utility function 𝑢𝑢(𝑐𝑐) that draws value
exclusively from consumption, not from health. To abstract from the issue of state-dependent




11
   Their main insight is that, whereas community-rated insurance suffers adverse selection, experience-rated
insurance suffers reclassification risk and the welfare cost of reclassification risk outweighs the welfare cost of
adverse selection.
12
   In future drafts we will extend the analysis to other settings.

utility, health shocks are modelled as health expenditure shocks that reduce overall consumption.
All consumers share a discount factor of 𝛽𝛽.
Consumers vary in age, income, and the health risk that they face. The individual we model will
live for 𝑇𝑇 more periods. If 𝑇𝑇 is large, we have a younger individual and, if 𝑇𝑇 is small, an older
individual. In each period, the individual earns income 𝑦𝑦. Consumption is equal to income net
of medical expenses and any credit market transactions. Each period, with probability 𝜋𝜋, the
individual incurs a medical expense that reduces her income available for consumption by 𝑝𝑝. In
the population at large, consumers may vary in 𝑇𝑇, 𝑦𝑦, and 𝜋𝜋.
The individual must decide how to smooth consumption given this shock. She has two options –
purchase health care insurance or borrow money. We assume that in periods 2, … , 𝑇𝑇, the
individual chooses to purchase health care insurance. We focus on the consumer’s choice in
period 1 of whether to buy insurance or take out loans to cover the medical shock. Naturally,
this choice must be made before the period 1 shock is realized.
Insurance. If the consumer chooses insurance, she pays a premium at the start of the period
equal to 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝑞𝑞, where 𝑞𝑞 is the component of the premium that reflects expected costs absent
insurance and 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 is the markup on insurance.
The expected costs 𝑞𝑞 depends on how insurance is priced. If insurance is community-rated, then
it depends on the average risk of the people in the insurance pool, i.e, 𝑞𝑞 𝐶𝐶 = 𝜋𝜋 𝐶𝐶 𝑝𝑝, where 𝜋𝜋 𝐶𝐶 is the
average 𝜋𝜋 in the pool. Conversely, if insurance is experience-rated, then the expected cost
depends only on the consumer’s own risk, i.e., 𝑞𝑞 𝐸𝐸 = 𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋. For the main analysis, we will assume
insurance is community-rated. Later we discuss how the results differ under experience-rated
health care insurance.
The markup on insurance, 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 (𝐿𝐿𝐼𝐼 , 𝜖𝜖), embeds the load 𝐿𝐿𝐼𝐼 on insurance and moral hazard from
insurance. The load includes administrative costs. The moral hazard is attributable to the excess
consumption of care due to insured individuals facing, on the margin, a price that is less than the
full marginal cost of care; it therefore depends on the price elasticity of demand for medical care,
𝜖𝜖. The moral hazard cost is not simply the cost of additional care purchased by consumers under
insurance because this excess care does have value. Rather it is the cost of the additional care
(care beyond the level of consumption the individual would have chosen if she faced the full
marginal costs of medical care), minus the dollar value of that care to the consumer. Obviously,
the markup is increasing in the elasticity of demand for care.
Loans. If the consumer chooses a loan, she must pay back 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 𝑝𝑝 over 𝑛𝑛 periods at an interest rate
𝑟𝑟. We require that 𝑛𝑛 ≤ 𝑇𝑇, so people with more remaining periods (younger people) have access
to loans with a longer repayment period. The amount borrowed is 𝑝𝑝. The total amount to be
repaid includes a factor 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 that captures the administrative costs of lending (e.g., underwriting),




                                                      7
which, for symmetry, we shall call the load on loans. 13 The interest rate and repayment period
affect the amount of consumption the consumer must forego each period for repayment of the
loan. The repayment amount is 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 per period during periods 1 through 𝑛𝑛, where 𝛼𝛼 satisfies
                                             𝛼𝛼      𝛼𝛼               𝛼𝛼
                                    𝛼𝛼 +         +          + ⋯ +              = 1.
                                           1 + 𝑟𝑟 (1 + 𝑟𝑟)2       (1 + 𝑟𝑟)𝑛𝑛−1
The 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 component of the repayment is in some sense the fair component of the repayment which
is multiplied by the load, 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 . Consistent with this idea, we assume that the interest rate
corresponds to the individual’s time preference, that is 𝛽𝛽 = 1/(1 + 𝑟𝑟); this implies that 𝛼𝛼 =
(1 − 𝛽𝛽)/(1 − 𝛽𝛽 𝑛𝑛 ).
Choice. If the individual chooses community-rated insurance in period 1, then her utility is

                                                   𝐼𝐼
                                                     1 − 𝛽𝛽 𝑇𝑇
                                                𝑉𝑉 =           𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 𝑝𝑝).
                                                     1 − 𝛽𝛽
The individual must pay a premium each period, which reduces her consumption by 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 𝑝𝑝. We
assume that if community-rated insurance is offered, no experience-rated insurance is offered,
otherwise the insurance market could unravel a la Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976), a topic which is
not the focus of this paper.
If the individual instead chooses to borrow to smooth her period 1 shock, her utility is

                                1 − 𝛽𝛽                                                              1 − 𝛽𝛽

If there is no shock, the individual loses no consumption in period 1, and must pay insurance
premiums in periods 2 through 𝑇𝑇. If there is a shock, the individual pays a part of the shock
(specifically, 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 𝑝𝑝) directly and borrows the remainder of the shock ((1 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 )𝑝𝑝) in order to
smooth consumption across the first 𝑛𝑛 periods. In periods 2 through 𝑛𝑛, she pays that period’s
premium and her per period loan repayment. Thus in periods 1 through 𝑛𝑛, the individual pays
𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 𝑝𝑝 + 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼(1 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 ). From period 𝑛𝑛 + 1 onwards, the individual only pays her
insurance premium.
The incremental value of insurance over the value of loans, 𝑉𝑉 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 = 𝑉𝑉 𝐼𝐼 − 𝑉𝑉 𝐿𝐿 , is

          𝑉𝑉 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 = (1 − 𝜋𝜋) �𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 𝑝𝑝) − 𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦)�                                                                     (1)




13
  We don’t explicitly allow for the possibility of default on a loan, but if it existed this “moral hazard” on loans
would be reflected in 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 . As with insurance, the cost of default would be the added borrowing cost minus the
benefit the individual would receive from the ability to default. Since the focus of this paper is the value of
insurance rather than the value of credit access, we keep credit pricing simple and do not allow for community-rated
loans.
                                                                    8

If the individual takes out insurance and there is no shock, she loses the premium 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 𝑝𝑝 in
period 1. However, if there is a shock, then the individual gains for the first 𝑛𝑛 periods because
she avoids having to repay 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 𝛼𝛼(1 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 )𝑝𝑝 each period on a loan. We superscript the
incremental value with 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 (upper bound) because we have hobbled credit markets by allowing
them to be used only for smoothing the health expenditure shock when it occurs, not for saving
absent a shock. Since the value of insurance is falling in the value of credit markets, this
provides some semblance of an upper bound on the value of insurance.
In general, loans only have value over insurance if loans have a cost advantage over insurance,
meaning that they have lower load or that community rating makes insurance a bad deal for a
low risk individual. To see this, consider the special case where there is no load on insurance or
loans (i.e., 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 = 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 = 1) and we focus on the “average” individual whose actual risk is
identical to average risk (i.e., 𝜋𝜋 = 𝜋𝜋 𝐶𝐶 ). Using (1 − 𝛽𝛽 𝑛𝑛 )/(1 − 𝛽𝛽) = 1/𝛼𝛼, the incremental value
of insurance becomes
                                                                  𝜋𝜋                                                               (2)
        𝑉𝑉 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 = (1 − 𝜋𝜋) �𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦 − 𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋) − 𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦)� +                �𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦 − 𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋) − 𝑢𝑢�𝑦𝑦 − 𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋 − 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼(1 − 𝜋𝜋)��,
                                                                  𝛼𝛼
which is positive by Jensen’s inequality. 14 The consumer already smooths across time by paying
a constant premium each period so, when insurance is fair (which the assumptions for this
special case guarantee), loans offer no cost advantage over insurance.
That being said, even if insurance is more valuable than loans, the incremental value of insurance
is lower when consumers have access to loans than when they do not. To see this, note that no
loans is equivalent to reducing 𝑛𝑛 to 1, which in turn increases 𝛼𝛼 to 1, and that 𝜕𝜕𝑉𝑉 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 /𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 > 0.
Intuitively, with no loans, consumers have worse options for smoothing in the absence of
insurance.
B. Positive implications
Effect of risk. Risk is affected by both the probability of shock and the price of medical care.
As the probability 𝜋𝜋 rises, the incremental value of insurance rises: 𝜕𝜕𝑉𝑉 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 /𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 > 0 (for fixed 𝜋𝜋 𝐶𝐶 ).
This is driven by the well-known point that community rating cross-subsidizes higher-than-
average risk members of the pool.
With experience rating, things are more interesting. First, consider changing an individual’s
probability of a shock only in the first period. We show in the appendix that 𝑉𝑉 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 is concave in



14
  To see this, multiply through by 𝛼𝛼 and rearrange Equation (2) to obtain
                      (𝛼𝛼(1 − 𝜋𝜋) + 𝜋𝜋)𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦 − 𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋) − �𝛼𝛼(1 − 𝜋𝜋)𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦) + 𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋(𝑦𝑦 − 𝑝𝑝[𝛼𝛼(1 − 𝜋𝜋) + 𝜋𝜋])�.
Note that 𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦 − 𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋) in the first term is utility of the average consumption in the second and third terms, i.e., 𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦)
and 𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦 − 𝑝𝑝[𝛼𝛼(1 − 𝜋𝜋) + 𝜋𝜋]), where the weights are 𝛼𝛼(1 − 𝜋𝜋)/(𝛼𝛼(1 − 𝜋𝜋) + 𝜋𝜋) and 𝜋𝜋/(𝛼𝛼(1 − 𝜋𝜋) + 𝜋𝜋), the same
relative weights as those on the second and third terms.

                                                                    9
𝜋𝜋1 , the first period probability of a shock, and that 𝑉𝑉 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 = 0 at 𝜋𝜋1 = 1. For the marginal
person 15 who is indifferent between insurance and loans, higher first period risk actually pushes
them towards loans (because of the concavity). To see the intuition for this, consider what
happens as 𝜋𝜋 approaches 1, e.g., for chronic conditions. In that case experience rated insurance
loses its smoothing advantage because the premium rises to the point where the individual pays
the cost of the near-certain shock.
In reality, risks are strongly positively correlated across periods, so if we want to compare people
with different risk levels, we need to consider the implication for higher risk in future periods as
well. Changing an individual’s risk in future periods creates a countervailing effect. The
increased premium payments in future periods raises the marginal utility of income in those
periods, meaning loan repayment is costlier in those periods. As a result, it is costlier to take out
a loan in the first period, so insurance is more valuable. The net effect of changing the risk
probability in all periods is ambiguous.
These experience-rated dynamics are not purely hypothetical. While health care insurance in the
U.S. is largely community-rated, in some pockets it is meaningfully experience-rated. For
example, in pools that suffer a lot of adverse selection or in the small group market, individual
experience can affect premiums. Moreover, even under the ACA, insurers are allowed to
discriminate to some extent on age, family size, and health behaviors such as smoking. 16
Medical price inflation, reflected in a higher 𝑝𝑝 also affects the risks people face. There is not a
substantial difference between the effect of price under community-rated and experience-rated
insurance, so we focus on the former. First consider changing the price only in the first period.
The increased price is more costly in terms of utility when the person takes loans than when they
chose insurance (since consumption is lower), so if loans are “costlier” (𝜋𝜋𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 > 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 ) a higher
price in the first period unambigiously increases the incremental value of insurance. However if
insurance is “costlier” (𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 > 𝜋𝜋𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 ) there is a countervailing effect because the load is
multiplicative. The higher the price, the more individuals have to pay for insurance above the
“fair” price.
The fact that higher prices this period are associated with higher prices in the future again
complicates things. Higher expected insurance premiums in years 2 through 𝑛𝑛 raise the marginal
utility of consumption in those periods, which makes taking out a loan in the first period more




15
   That is, the marginal person with 𝜋𝜋 > 0. Someone with 𝜋𝜋 = 0 is also indifferent between loans and insurance, but
that case seems less relevant; the effect of increasing 𝜋𝜋 for them depends on the loads on loans and insurance. If
there is a fixed cost of insurance (rather than a multiplicative load), then [𝑉𝑉 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 ]𝜋𝜋1 =0 < 0 and there could be another
𝜋𝜋1 > 0 at which an individual is indifferent between insurance and loans and an increase in 𝜋𝜋1 pushes them towards
insurance. Concavity means that this will be at a lower 𝜋𝜋1 than the one referenced in the main text.
16
   Prior to the ACA, small group insurers could discriminate between prices of different pools. Even under the
ACA, insurers can discriminate so long as the highest premium charged a pool member is no more than 3 times the
price of the lowest charged a pool member.

costly. Since higher prices in future periods increase 𝑉𝑉 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 the net effect of changing 𝑝𝑝 in all
periods is unambiguously positive if 𝜋𝜋𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 > 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 , but otherwise could go either way.
Our model of financing care captures the idea from Nyman (1999) that insurance has “access
value” when the individual cannot access very expensive care using loans because the price of
that care exceeds her lifetime income and thus her ability to repay. To see this, note that, the
individual lacks access to loans when 𝑦𝑦 < 𝑝𝑝(𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 + 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 𝛼𝛼(1 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 )) as the individual cannot
cover loan servicing. This inability to pay for the loan can be captured by assuming an infinitely
negative utility for negative consumption. So if 𝑝𝑝 > 𝑦𝑦/(𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 𝛼𝛼 + 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 (1 − 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 𝛼𝛼)), then 𝑉𝑉 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 is
infinite as long as 𝑝𝑝 < 𝑦𝑦/(𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 ). 17
Effect of age. Age operates to increase demand for insurance through two mechanisms. Most
directly it decreases 𝑇𝑇. This in turn may lower 𝑛𝑛 since necessarily 𝑛𝑛 ≤ 𝑇𝑇. As the loan period
falls, the repayment rate 𝛼𝛼 rises, which reduces the smoothing benefit of loans and thereby
increases the incremental value of insurance.
A second mechanism is that age is empirically associated with greater 𝜋𝜋. Under community
rating, older individuals are more likely to be above average risk and thus prefer insurance
because their insurance premiums are subsidized by younger, lower risk individuals.
Effect of credit market access. The robustness of credit markets can be reflected both in the
amount of time individuals can borrow for, 𝑛𝑛, and in the interest rate, 𝑟𝑟. For a fair interest rate,
i.e., 1 + 𝑟𝑟 = 1/𝛽𝛽, increasing the borrowing period allows individuals to smooth across more
periods thereby increasing the value of loans and decreasing the incremental value of insurance.
If interest rates are “unfair” so 1 + 𝑟𝑟 > 1/𝛽𝛽, increasing 𝑟𝑟 while holding 𝑛𝑛 constant increases the
cost of borrowing in that it increases the per period repayment on the loan, 𝛼𝛼𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 𝑝𝑝. This in turn
reduces utility under loans, increasing the incremental value of insurance.
These points are particularly important for low income countries where a central implication of
under-developed credit markets is that loans are only available for short lengths of time, such as
one year, and interest rates are high (Duflo, 2005). Improving credit markets such that 𝑛𝑛 rises or
𝑟𝑟 falls could substitute for increasing access to insurance. 18
Effect of administrative costs and price elasticity. The value of insurance – however priced –
is declining in the markup on insurance, i.e., in load and moral hazard, a well-known point.



17
  These conditions are not mutually exclusive so long as 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 < 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 + 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 𝛼𝛼(1 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 ), which holds so long as
𝑚𝑚 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 < 1, which is a necessary assumption for this question to be interesting since otherwise everyone would be
     𝐼𝐼

better off paying 𝑝𝑝 when they experienced a shock than paying the insurance premium 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝜋𝜋 𝑐𝑐 𝑝𝑝 > 𝑝𝑝.
18
  These results are also relevant for high income countries, though less for future policy and
more for understanding the demand of insurance. Over the last 50 years, consumer access to
credit has improved – largely due to the proliferation of credit cards (Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia, 2015). Our model suggests, therefore, that the value of insurance – holding prices
constant – should have fallen. (In aggregate the effect is likely swamped by high medical price
inflation having increased demand for insurance during the same period.)
                                                                11
Since moral hazard is increasing in the price elasticity of demand for medical care, the value of
insurance declines with that elasticity. Conversely, it is increasing in the markup on loans, i.e.,
administrative costs of banks. One thing that makes the latter somewhat less important than the
former (even if 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 = 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 ) is that, the markup on loans only has to be paid if loans are taken out,
i.e., if there is shock, whereas the markup on insurance has to be paid in all states.
C. Extensions
Coinsurance and moral hazard. The model above assumes that insurance pays for the entire
health shock. Many insurance plans require the individual to pay a fraction of the health
expenditures as “coinsurance.” If insurance is “fair” (experience rating and no markup), this
decreases the value of insurance since it only imperfectly smooths the shocks. However, when
there is a markup on insurance (𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 > 1), individuals may prefer incomplete insurance since they
do not have to pay the markup on the part of the price that they pay out of pocket.
One of the motivations for coinsurance is to reduce moral hazard. The more price-elastic
consumers are, the more moral hazard there will be and the larger the effect of coinsurance on
moral hazard. If 𝜖𝜖 is the arc-elasticity19 and 𝛿𝛿 is the coinsurance rate (often around 20%) then
the relationship between the quantities demanded with and without insurance is
                                       Qins 1 + 𝛿𝛿 − ϵ(1 − 𝛿𝛿)
                                            =                     .
                                        Q     1 + 𝛿𝛿 + ϵ(1 − 𝛿𝛿)
We do not have the exogenous variation in our data to estimate 𝜖𝜖 so we use a range of values
from the literature. In considering different co-insurance rates we account for both the direct
effect of the copayments on consumption in different states and the effect, via moral hazard, on
the price of insurance.
Income shocks. Health shocks can also affect an individual’s income. Dobkin, Finkelstein,
Kluender, and Notowidigdo (2018) find that for those admitted to the hospital, the income
declines by an average of 20% of the pre-admission income. In MEPS the income shocks are
smaller, roughly 20% of medical expenditures, but still potentially important.
Income shocks are similar to co-insurance in being a risk that is not covered by insurance.
However, they need not be proportional to the health expenditure shock. Income shocks make
loans less valuable relative to insurance because they increase the marginal utility of
consumption (by lowering income) exactly in the states of the world where one must make loan
payments. This effect is compounded when income shocks from hospitalization last multiple
years (Dobkin et al., 2018).


II. Welfare formulas



                             𝑞𝑞1 −𝑞𝑞2       𝑝𝑝1 −𝑝𝑝2
19
     The arc elasticity is              /              (a negative number). Unlike an elasticity, it can be estimated even when one of
                             𝑞𝑞1 +𝑞𝑞2       𝑝𝑝1 +𝑝𝑝2
the prices is zero.
                                                                           12
In this section we derive formulas for welfare that can be taken to data. Because individuals in
real life – and the data – face multiple health expenditure risks each period, we now allow
individuals in the model to face a more general distribution of shocks. Specifically, we assume
an individual faces many possible shocks, indexed by 𝑖𝑖, that occur with probability 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 and cost
𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 . The value from Equation (1) of insurance relative to loans becomes

      𝑉𝑉 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 =               �                 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 �𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝]) − 𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦 − 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 )�                                         (3)
                     𝑖𝑖: 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 <𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝]

          1
      +                �                  𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 �𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝]) − 𝑢𝑢�𝑦𝑦 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝] − 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 𝛼𝛼(𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝])�� ,
          𝛼𝛼
               𝑖𝑖: 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 >𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝]

where 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝] indicates the expected medical expenditure for the community-rated risk pool. As
before, the individual must choose whether to insure all her shocks or none of them. Even if an
individual chooses not to purchase any insurance, she does not necessarily smooth all her shocks
by borrowing. If an individual has a shock that is less than what the premium would have been
(and the premium will be in later years) she just pays for it directly out of present consumption.
In that case she is better off by 𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦 − 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 ) − 𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝]) relative to buying insurance. If the
shock is higher, she will pay the initial 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝] directly and borrow the remaining 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 −
𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝]. In this case she is worse off by 𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝]) − 𝑢𝑢�𝑦𝑦 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝] −
𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 𝛼𝛼(𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝])� relative to buying insurance. No health shock corresponds to 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 = 0; for
that term in the first summation, we get back the 𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝]) − 𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦) term seen in Equation
(1).
If individual data on medical expenditures for a population is available, this quantity can be
calculated directly (with data or assumptions or on 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 , 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 , and 𝛼𝛼 and an assumption on the
functional form of 𝑢𝑢) as we do in the next section.
The value of insurance can also be approximated using data on the mean and variance of medical
expenditures for a population. One way to approximate the value of insurance is to take a second
order Taylor approximation of 𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦 − 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 ) and 𝑢𝑢�𝑦𝑦 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝] − 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 𝛼𝛼(𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝])� around
𝑦𝑦� = 𝑦𝑦 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝]. However, since with limited credit markets (for the upper bound on insurance
value) the individual only borrows after large shocks and does not save after small ones, this
would yield a somewhat messy formula with conditional means and variance (conditioned on
whether price is above or below the community-rated premium). Those conditional moments are
hard to measure from the data as they depend on knowing the full distribution of shocks (or
assuming a convenient functional form).
Two assumptions that simplify the approximation are that (1) credit markets allow the individual
to save (for 𝑛𝑛 periods) as well as borrow to smooth the shock in period 1 and (2) 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 = 1, so that,
the rate the individual pays when borrowing is equal to what they get when saving. Because the
banking system is doing a bit more work, namely it allows both borrowing and saving, the
relative value of insurance falls, so this valuation is below the upper bound in Equation (3). In
this case the value of insurance relative to loans is approximately


                                                                              13
                   1          ′ (𝑦𝑦          𝐼𝐼 [𝑝𝑝])]
                                                         𝑢𝑢′′ (𝑦𝑦�)
               𝑉𝑉 ≈ � 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 �𝑢𝑢 �)[𝛼𝛼(𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 −𝑚𝑚 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐     −            [𝛼𝛼(𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝] − 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 )]2 �.

This weighted sum is an expectation from the perspective of an individual. If we then take the
expectation across all individuals in the risk pool, we obtain

                  1 ′             𝐼𝐼 )𝐸𝐸 [𝑝𝑝]
                                                𝑢𝑢′′ (𝑦𝑦�) 2

                  𝛼𝛼                                2

Pulling out 𝛼𝛼𝑢𝑢′ (𝑦𝑦�) and normalizing by 𝑢𝑢′ (𝑦𝑦�) yields
                     𝑉𝑉            𝐼𝐼
                                                      1 𝛾𝛾                                             (4)

                  𝑢𝑢′ (𝑦𝑦�)                           2 𝑦𝑦�
where 𝛾𝛾 is the coefficient of relative risk aversion (and 𝛾𝛾/𝑦𝑦� is the coefficient of absolute risk
aversion). Intuitively, the value of insurance, in dollar terms, is declining in the expected cost
(because the effect of load and moral hazard are multiplicative) and increasing in the variance of
shocks and relative risk aversion. Income reduces the impact of risk but also reduces the
marginal utility of consumption.
Estimating this requires much less information that the full formula does. One only needs data
on 𝑟𝑟 or 𝛽𝛽 and the loan period (to calculate 𝛼𝛼), the markup 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 on insurance (including moral
hazard), the community-rated expectation 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝] and variance 𝑉𝑉𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝] of health expenditure shocks,
and the coefficient of absolute risk aversion (or the coefficient of relative risk aversion 𝛾𝛾 and
income net of the premium 𝑦𝑦�). If one wanted an apples-to-apples comparison of the incremental
value of insurance using individual data and the approximation, note that one would want to
convert the former into a measure of dollars by dividing by 𝑢𝑢′(𝑦𝑦�).
We can easily derive an approximation for how much ignoring loans leads one to overestimates
the welfare value of insurance. Without loans, the full shock must be borne in the present period
regardless of interest rate; with loans the repayment rate is extended and the full shock can be
smoothed over 𝑛𝑛 periods. Hence, the overestimate is Equation (4) when 𝛼𝛼 = 1 (for 𝑛𝑛 = 1)
versus 𝛼𝛼 for larger 𝑛𝑛:
                              𝑉𝑉    1 𝛾𝛾                                                               (5)
                       Δn � ′ � ≈         (1 − 𝛼𝛼)(𝑉𝑉𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝] + (1 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 )2 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐2 [𝑝𝑝]).
                           𝑢𝑢 (𝑦𝑦�) 2 𝑦𝑦�
Because 𝛼𝛼 is declining in the loan repayment period and rising in the interest rate, this
overestimate is increasing in the repayment period and falling in the interest rate. Intuitively, the
overestimate is proportional to the variance of the shocks, the level of risk aversion and,
critically, the ability of loans to reallocate OOP payments to future periods at low capital cost.

III.    Welfare estimates
A. Data
We use data from the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey from 1996 to 2014. For the present
analysis we focus on the value of private insurance so we drop households with a member who is
                                                          14
65 or older at the end of the year, since those individuals are eligible for Medicare, and
households with income below 138% of the federal poverty line who are eligible for Medicaid. 20
We are left with 335,870 individuals in 136,299 households.
Since welfare is naturally very sensitive to consumption at very low levels, we censor the
distribution of health shocks to ensure consumption above a certain level. Importantly, we also
use this censored distribution in calculating the expected costs for the insurance premiums. In
limiting the right tail risk, censoring inevitable decreases the value of insurance somewhat, but it
would decrease it dramatically if we did not correspondingly lower the premiums. Also, since the
effect of censoring is larger for sicker consumers, not adjusting the premiums would make
insurance particularly unattractive for high risk consumers. 21
Table 1 shows the summary statistics for the sample. It is about half female; the average age is
32. The average (median) individual income is $33,889 ($24,894) and for households it is
$81,770 ($66,116). For privacy reasons, diagnoses are aggregated to Clinical Classification
Codes. The average person has diagnoses in 1.38 of these 252 categories; the median person has
1. On average there are 2.44 people (including children) in a household.
B. Calculation using individual level data on shocks
In addition to the characteristics of the insurance and loan markets, the value of insurance
relative to loans depends on the utility function, the distribution of health risks and income. We
use a utility function with constant relative risk aversion
                                                    𝑐𝑐 1−𝛾𝛾
                                              𝑢𝑢 =          .
                                                   1 − 𝛾𝛾
We assume a coefficient of relative risk aversion, 𝛾𝛾 = 2. 22
To estimate the part of an income change that is a shock, we first try to remove the lifecycle
component for income changes. We regress the change in income on dummies for each age
group 𝑔𝑔 and initial income
                                         Δ𝑦𝑦 = 𝛼𝛼 + � 𝛽𝛽𝑔𝑔 + 𝛽𝛽2 ⋅ 𝑦𝑦 + 𝜖𝜖 .
                                                       𝑔𝑔
We then calculate an adjusted income change

   The interplay between back-stop government insurance and the value of private insurance is an important
interaction we want to explore.
21
   This is not quite equivalent to setting a consumption floor because the censoring of the shocks is not income
dependent. The concern with using a consumption floor is that the distribution of shocks is then income dependent
and the community-rated premiums become income dependent, but that is an alternative approach we intend to
explore.
22
   Chetty (2006) argues that the coefficient of relative risk aversion is at most 2. Using this upper bound is favorable
to the value of insurance.

To estimate the distribution of medical expenditures and income shocks that each household
faces, 23 we first regress, at the individual level, medical expenditures on age, sex, and dummies
for diagnoses they had at the beginning of the year in which we observe expenditures. 24 We then
calculate predicted expenditures for each individual and aggregate them to the household level.
For each household size, we divide households into deciles of predicted medical expenditures.
We use the distribution of medical expenditures and income shocks in a given decile for the
distribution of potential shocks that each household in that decile faced ex-ante.
Within a group of households that are all facing the same distribution of potential shocks, the
only part of the value calculation that varies by household is income. Since calculating 𝑉𝑉 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 is
somewhat computationally intensive we calculate it at the mid-point of each income ventile for
each health expenditure risk group instead of for every household. To have the values in dollar
units, which are more intuitive than utility units, we divide by the marginal utility of income and
report 𝑉𝑉 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 /𝑢𝑢′ (𝑦𝑦 − 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝]) in all the graphs and calculations. For our baseline we use 𝑛𝑛 = 5,
𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 = 1.1, and 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 = 1.3 as plausible values and we show how the results change as these vary.
Figure 1 shows the average across income ventiles of the dollar value of insurance relative to
loans for different size households for each decile of health expenditure risk. It shows the value
for both community and experience rating. As expected, the value is increasing in sickness for
community rating. It is fairly flat for experience rating. For a family of two with community
rating, the average incremental value of insurance ranges from -$4813 for the healthiest decile to
$6,208 for the sickest.
To avoid showing 4 graphs for every result, we focus on households with 2 people for the rest of
the analysis. Results for other household sizes are similar. Also, consistent with the focus in the
text, we use the values for community-rated insurance.
Our model suggests that ignoring loans leads to an over-valuing of insurance. Our calculations
suggest that the value of insurance falls by $65 on average if one goes from not allowing loans to
allowing 5 year loans with a load of 1.1. For the sickest decile the average decrease is $338 (6%
of the utility of insurance without loans) and the maximum (for the poorest consumers) is $3,433
(36%). Going from no loans to loans means going from an effective 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 of 1 to an 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 of 1.1. To
see the effect of loan length without this conflating factor we compare longer loans (𝑛𝑛 = 5, 10)
to a two-year loan. Figure 2 shows the average change in the incremental value of insurance
across sickness bins and income. As expected, increasing the length of time for which
households can borrow decreases the value of insurance, particularly for the sickest people –




23
   Though some of the calculations would be simpler at the individual level, members of a household naturally co-
insure each other’s risk, so we think this the appropriate unit of analysis.
24
   The MEPS surveys each household in two consecutive years, asking about past health events and spending. We
use conditions reported at the end of the first year and the expenditures reported at the end of the second year.

who have the highest initial value of insurance under community rating – and for the poorest –
who most value the decrease in annual payments from the longer loan.
Unsurprisingly, the value of insurance is decreasing in 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 and increasing in 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 . The left panel of
Figure 3 shows the change in the value of insurance relative to 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 = 1 for 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 = 1.1, 1.3. The
right panel shows the change relative to 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 = 1 for 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 = 1.1,1.3. Under community rating, the
effect of the insurance load does not vary much by health since everyone pays the same
premium. 25 The effect of 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 is largest for the sickest households since they have to pay the
additional load on a larger (on average) loan payment.
C. Calculation using Taylor approximation
To see how accurate the Taylor approximation is, we compare it to the results using the complete
data. To compare apples-to-apples we redo the above calculation allowing individuals to
optimally save for 𝑛𝑛 periods when they don’t have a shock or have a shock smaller than the
premium. We also set 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 = 1, to be comparable to the approximation.
Figure 4 shows the approximate value and the exact value for each health decile across income.
The right panel shows the averages across health bins for each ventile of income. This averaging
is not ideal because different health groups have different cutoffs for their income bins, but it
allows us to see how the approximation does on average. The approximation overestimates the
value of insurance for the poorest individuals. These are the ones for which the next term in the
Taylor expansion would be most negative.
We can also compare the approximation of the effect of loan length, based on Equation (4), with
the calculated value. Figure 5 shows this comparison. 26 Similar to the levels approximation, the
approximation over estimates (in absolute value) the change for healthy groups and
underestimates it for sick groups. The change in 𝛼𝛼 resulting from the changed loan length is
multiplied by the variance, which is much higher for the sicker groups than for the population as
a whole, so an approximation using group specific aggregate statistics would be more accurate.
IV. Conclusion
The private value of health insurance as a method of financing medical care depends on how
consumers would finance care in the absence of insurance. Greater access to credit reduces the
incremental financial value of insurance. The impact is non-trivial: for the sickest decile of
consumers, the value of insurance falls by 6% on average and up to 36% for the poorest
consumers.




25
   The effect is slightly increasing with health bin because those in the sicker bins tend to be wealthier on average
and we normalize 𝑉𝑉 by 𝑢𝑢′(𝑦𝑦�). Equal shifts in 𝑉𝑉 generate a larger shift in 𝑉𝑉/𝑢𝑢′(𝑦𝑦�) for those with lower marginal
utility – those with higher income.
26
   Since we’ve set 𝑚𝑚𝐿𝐿 = 1, for the approximation, we can now compare to 1 year loans. The graphs are truncated at
the 8th decile so the relative values can be seen when they are close. The calculated change is roughly twice as large
in the 10th decile as in the 8th.
                                                          17
The value of insurance depends on how it is priced and the duration of sickness. Moving from
community rating to experience rating reduces the incremental value of insurance to the sick
because it eliminates the cross-subsidy from community rating. Increasing the duration of
shocks increases the incremental value of insurance because loans have to be repaid when
consumers have higher marginal utility due to future medical bills.
We provide precise and approximate formulas for calculating the welfare value of insurance - not
just its effect on out-of-pocket payments, which have no natural welfare interpretation. Our
approximation requires few parameters (𝑟𝑟 or 𝛽𝛽, the loan period, the markup 𝑚𝑚𝐼𝐼 on insurance
(including moral hazard), the community-rated expectation 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝] and variance 𝑉𝑉𝑐𝑐 [𝑝𝑝] of health
expenditure shocks, and the coefficient of absolute risk aversion) to calculate and is reasonable
for consumers with average levels of sickness.
Our analysis has implications for policy. First, it affects cost benefit analyses of public insurance
expansions. It also suggests that insurance pricing is critical to determining the value of
insurance, for reasons other than the usual adverse selection arguments. Second, it suggests that
some of the welfare gains of health insurance may be obtainable by improving access to credit.
Extension of this analysis to debtor protections such as bankruptcy would have implications for
those protections.
There are a number of natural directions in which to extend this research. First, there are a
number of parameters that could be estimated more precisely. On the insurance side, there is the
markup on insurance due to moral hazard. On the credit side, there is the markup on loans, again
including any moral hazard due to default opportunities. Second, the model should be
generalized to allow for consumers to choose period by period whether to insure or use credit to
finance medical care shocks. Third, it would be helpful to extend the model empirically to
account for adverse selection in the manner that Handel et al. (2015) do. Intuitively, adverse
selection with community rated plans, without strict mandates and policy regulations to offset
that moral hazard, yields a result under community rating that is closer to experience rating. This
could have first order effects on estimates of the private value of insurance. Fourth, it would
help to adapt the model to the policy environment. Notably, this includes accounting for the
Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which effectively provides interest
free credit for hospital treatment, and debtor protections, which cap repayment costs. This
reduces the relative value of insurance.

Note: This figure shows, for each family size the value of insurance relative to a 5 year loan when the load on
insurance is 1.3 and the load on loans is 1.1. The value is the average across the twenty income ventiles for each
decile of health risk. Health risk is determined by predicting individual medical expenditures and aggregating to the
household level. Households are grouped by predicted total expenditure and a household is assumed to face the
distribution of medical expenditure shocks observed in its decile. Experience rating is based on the expected risk in
each decile. Community rating is based on expenditures in the whole population.
