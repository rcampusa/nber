with     respect to the choice of price index, and are stable over time. Our results

show that before 1979 a negative relationship of ex ante real returns with inflation

and nominal interest rates does appear for the longer maturity assets. In fact, the

relationship grows stronger with increases in maturity length. This suggests that

although short—term U.S. Treasury bills were, of all the assets we study, the best

hedge against expected inflation, none of the assets were a perfect hedge. We find

a statistically significant change in the stochastic process of bond returns in

1979, with nominal interest rates and ex ante real holding returns being positively

correlated in this latter period. This is not true for stocks, however. While the

above results are robust to the choice of price index, we show that estimating the

level of cx ante real returns depends crucially on the price index chosen.

    Given the importance of ex ante real interest rates to economic decision

making, it is no surprise that much empirical research focuses on them.1 Several

recent studies find that the ex ante real returns for short—term U.S. Treasury

securities are not constant and are negatively correlated both with inflation and

with nominal interest rates. This paper examines the extent to which these findings

hold for assets of longer maturity, are robust with respect to the choice of price

index, and are stable over time.

    We expand the set of assets studied to include those of lonqer maturity, both

publicly and privately issued, for two reasons. First, their ex ante real returns

may differ substantially from that of a short—term nominally riskiess security.

Second, because longer—maturity assets have risk characteristics closer to capital,

their ex ante real returns are potentially more relevant for investment and savings

decisions. We explore the use of various price indices because the index used in

most studies, the Consumer Price Index, severely overstates inflation during the

1970s as a result of its inappropriate treatment of residential housing costs.2

This overstatement casts doubt on an important finding of previous studies ——   that
there are long stretches of time during the 1970s when ex ante real rates are

significantly negative. Given the existence of holding costs for the goods relevant

to most price indices and the absence of a riskiess real return, no arbitrage

conditions are violated by a negative ex ante real rate. However, its persistence

is problematical because asset holders are typically assumed to have a positive rate

of time preference, which ensures a positive ex ante real rate in the long run.

    We find that before 1979 a negative relationship of ex ante real rates both

with inflation and with nominal interest rates appears for the longer maturity

assets as well as the short-term nominally riskiess asset; indeed the relationship

grows monotonically with the maturity of the asset. This suggests that although

short-term U.S. Treasury bills are, of all the assets we study, the best hedge

against expected inflation, none of the assets are perfect hedges.3 Our results

also indicate that nominal interest rates are not a reliable indicator of the
                                                        2




 tightness of credit markets, since they are negatively correlated with ex ante real

 returns on all assets examined.

        The   use   of a more accurate price index than the Consumer Price Index results in

 noticeably different estimates of ex ante real rates                              rates that are qenerally

higher and statistically significantly negative for far shorter periods of time.

Our findings on the relationship of ex ante real interest rates with inflation and

nominal interest rates are, however, robust to the choice of price index.

        When we examine the behavior of financial markets since October 1979, we find a

statistically significant change in the stochastic process of ex ante real returns

on bonds. In contrast to the earlier period, after October 1979 nominal interest

rates are positively correlated with ex ante real returns. However, this change in

the stochastic process appears only for bonds and not for common stocks Given the

small amount of data since 1979, we clearly consider these results tentative;

nonetheless they suggest topics for future research.


II •    METHODOLOGY



        Following Fisher (1930), at each time t the ex ante, or expected, real return

earned from holding an asset for j                 periods can be decomposed into an expected

nominal return and an expected inflation rate:
                                                   .e
                                    rr                       _re                   (1)

where    rr is the expectation at time t of the real return earned by holding an

asset from time t to time t+1, i1 is the expectation at time t of the nominal

return earned by holding an asset from time t to time t+j, and ir.                                 is   the

expectation at time t of the inflation rate from time t to time t+j.

Similarly, the ex post, or realized, real return can be decomposed into an ex post

nominal return and an ex post inflation rate:

clear that ex ante and ex post real returns will diverge when either the nominal

return on the asset or the inflation rate is uncertain. It is also clear that if

the nominal interest rate and inflation surprises are observable, the ex ante real

interest rate is observable. Much measurement of ex ante real returns is based on

equation (3), with survey data used to construct e2. and a i—period default free

bond that ensures €1                =   0.
                              t,j
     We use an alternative procedure to estimate ex ante real interest rates.

The procedure does not require survey measures of inflation,4 allows for estimation

of the ex ante real return on all assets —                         not   just j—period default free bonds -

and simultaneously allows us to measure the correlation of ex ante real rates with

variables that are observable at time t. The critical assumption underlying the

methodology is rationality of expectations; this assumption ensures that forecast

errors are uncorrelated with past information. Specifically,


                                                                            =    0,    (4)

                                                   P(rrtXt) =    x.
Note that when the ex ante real interest rate is constant,                                        = 0    for all

regressors except a constant term.

        Obviously P(rr .Jx) cannot be used directly, because                                            is unknown, and so

we use

equation is estimated for each of the seven assets we study.

     There are several important econometric issues concerning this estimation

strategy that need to discussed Formal demonstration of the following points can

be found in Mishkin (1981b, 1982, 1984) and CUrnbV, Huizinga and Obstfeld (1983).

1. Given the rationality of expectations,                            will be a consistent estimate of 3.

    That is, using ex post real rates will asymptotically yield the same estimate of

          as a reqression using ex ante real rates. Although we cannot observe the ex

    ante real rate, we can estimate it and can infer information about its

    relationship with other variables known at time t via ex post real rate

    regressions.

2. We do lose information by using ex post real interest rates in the regression

    rather than ex ante rates, The presence of the forecast errors

                     and 2 • in
         t,j
             •

                                    t,j       equation (7) means that               will be estimated less

   precisely;          that is, the standard errors of the estimated paramters will be

    larger. In addition, as the maturity of the asset lengthens we expect more

   volatility in the asset price, so the variance of the holding period return
                                           5




    should increase, increasing the variance of ci1. We thus expect less precise

    estimates of        for common stocks and long—term bonds than for short—term

    bills.

3. The coefficient 3, and hence its estimate 3, does not imply that                     causes

    the ex ante real interest rate, only that X helps to predict it. Without

    further information,          should be interpreted only as measuring the correlation

    between         and ex ante real returns.

4. For the case j > 1 that we consider here, the data is overlapping; that is, the

   holding period is longer than the observation interval. In this case, estimated

    standard errors of the parameters reported by typical regression packages will

   generally be inconsistent. The problem stems from the fact that when

    i > 1, c1_1,1 and €2t-11 are not in the information set                      because they

   are not known until time t+j—1 > t. Thus, in contrast to the nonoverlappinq

    case of j=1 where the rational expectations conditions of equation (4) imply

    that €1         and 2         are serially uncorrelated, El     .,            and
              t,j           t,j                                   t,j
    therefore r12 are likely to be serially correlated. In this case, consistent

   estimates of the standard errors for          can be computed with methods outlined

   by Hansen (1982) or Cumby, Huizinqa and Obstfeld (1983). The estimates used

   here are similar to those used by Hansen and Hodrick (1980) but are more

   general, because they allow for conditional heteroscedasticity of the regression

   residuals. Tests of the null hypothesis that the residuals were conditionally

   homoscedastic indicated rejection in our sample.5

5. With respect to testing hypotheses such as the constancy of ex ante real

   returns, tests that are joint for all assets together will have increased power

   even though the equation for each asset is efficiently estimated in isolation.

   In doing a joint test, however, the correlation of the                estimates obtained

   from regression equations for different assets must not be ignored. One reason

   this correlation can be expected to be nonnegligible is that all regression

   errors contain the common element E2tj unexpected inflation.

III. DATP


     This paper analyzes monthly data from 1959 to 1981 on real returns over a three

month holding period for the following seven securities:    (1) three month Treasury

bills (TBILL3), (2) six month Treasury bills (TBILL6), (3) twelve month Treasury

bills (TBILL12), (4) intermediate—term (5—10 years maturity) Treasury bonds

(INTBOND) (5) long—term Treasury bonds (over 10 years maturity) (LONGB0Nt), (6)

long-term corporate bonds (CORPBOND), (7) common stocks (STOCK). The nominal return

data is obtained from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) at the

University of Chicago. Because there are no Treasury bills with more than three

months of maturity until 1959, the data for the six— and twelve—month bills cannot

be collected before this date. In fact, twelve month bond data are not available

until late 1963. The bonds chosen for the intermediate—term bond returns are an

update (supplied to us by Lawrence Fisher) of the same securities used in Fisher and

Lone (1977). The bonds chosen for the long—term bond returns are an update

(supplied by Roger Ibbotson) of those used in the Ibbotson and Sinquefeld (1976)

long—term Treasury bond return index. The corporate bond data are derived from the

Ibbotson—Sinquefeld corporate bond returns index and the CRSP NYSE value-weighted

index, is used to calculate the stock returns.

     The three month holding period has been chosen because a shorter holding period

would increase timing problems created by the sampling methods used to construct the

price indices. The problem is that the price components in th indices are sampled

at different times over the course of the month. Thus it is not clear what is the

appropriate dating for the price index. With monthly holding periods, the dating

can easily be off by as much as half of the holding period. With three month

holding periods, the dating can be off by only one—sixth.

     Four price indices are used here to construct inflation and real interest

rates. The first is the CPI, the price index most frequently used in empirical

research on real rates. In January of 1983 the Bureau of Labor Statistics began
                                        7




calculatincT the official CPI using a new "rental equivalence" measure for the

residential housing component. Our second price index, denoted CPIX, reconstructs

the CPI from 1959 to 1981 using this new procedure.6 This is likely to be the most

accurate of our four price indices and its use should lead to the most reliable

measures of inflation and real rates. The third price index is the Personal

Consumption Fxpenditure Deflator, denoted PCED, which comes from the National Income

and Product Accounts but is available monthly. The index, like the CPIX, does not

suffer from the inappropriate treatment of housing found in the CpI, but it differs

from the CPIX in being a variable weight index. The PCED is not without problems for

our study; unlike other indices, it is available only in seasonally adjusted form

and, more important, it uses more interpolation of prices than the other indices do.

Finally, we use the Producer Price Index, denoted PPI. It does not include

residential housing in any manner but has the drawback that it is constructed with

list prices rather than transactions prices.

IV. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

P. Results for the pre—October 1979 period

     The relationship of real rates with inflation and nominal interest rates for

the 1959:5 to 1979:10 sample period is described in Table 1. The post 1979:10 period

is dealt with later in the paper because, as we shall see, the stochastic process of

real rates undergoes a major shift near the end of 1979. The inflation coefficients

are qenerated from regressions where the        variables include a constant term and

the inflation rate for the past three— months. The nominal three month bill

coefficients are obtained from regressions where the        variables include a

constant term and the nominal rate on three— month U.S. Treasury bills known at

time t. The timing of both the inflation rate and the nominal bill rate clearly

reflects that     must be a subset of          the information set agents have

available to form their ex ante real rates for period     t.7

     The inflation coefficients tell us that ex ante real rates on all seven assets

are negatively correlated with inflation, Regardless of the price index used, all

the inflation cefficients are negative, many of them significantly     P.n extremely

interesting finding is that as maturity length increases, and the asset gets closer

in its risk characteristics to capital, an increase in inflation is associated with

an even larger decrease in the ex ante real return. For example, the Cpix results

indicate that a one—percentage—point increase in the inflation rate is associated

with a 28—basis—point drop (a basis point is 1/100 of a percentage point) in the ex

ante real rate on three month U.S. Treasury bills, a 65—basis—point decline in the

ex ante real rate on long—term U.S. Treasury bonds, and a 192—basis—point decline in

the ex ante real rate on common stocks.

     The x2 statistic at the bottom of each column tests the null hypothesis

that all seven coefficients in the column equal zero.1° This is a joint test of the

constancy of ex ante real rates on all seven assets. The low values of the marginal

significance levels indicate that the null hypothesis can always be rejected at the

1% level. As the asterisks indicate, constancy of ex ante real rates is rejected

less frequently for the longer maturity assets. Despite their more negative

coefficients, there is less statistical significance because the standard errors

increase. As described earlier, this is exactly what we expect since the forecast

error of the nominal return, cl1 should become more variable with lengthening

maturity. Both because of this and because of the consistent pattern of the

coefficients, our view is that an appropriate interpretation of the Table 1 results

is that ex ante real returns on intermediate term bonds, long—term bonds, and common

stocks are negatively associated with inflation. The absence of statistical

significance is a reflection of the low power of the tests.11

     The nominal three month bill rate coefficents follow a pattern similar to that

of the inflation coefficients. They are all negative, many are significantly so,

and they increase as we go to the longer maturity assets. Again, constancy of the

ex ante real return for all seven assets is soundly rejected by the x2 values.

Rejection is widely spread across the seven assets. The negative coefficients
                                       10




 indicate that a nominal interest rate, such as that on three month U.S. Treasury

 bills, is a poor indicator of the tiqhtness of credit markets. When we use the

nominal yield to maturity for each asset as the explanatory variable in the

regression for that asset, the findings are similar. During times of high nominal

rates, credit market conditions are not tight; rather the contrary is true, with low

ex ante real rates on all assets.12

     For the sample period studied here, previous evidence has found that movements

in the nominal three month bill rate primarily reflects movements in expected

inflation.13 Since inflation is a highly positively autocorrelated series, the

inflation rate over the past three months should also be highly positively

correlated with the expected inflation rate. Thus the inflation and interest rate

coefficients of Table 1 convey information about how ex ante real rates are

correlated with expected inflation. They suggest that, while of all the assets we

study three month U.S. Treasury bills are the best hedge against expected inflation,

all assets are an imperfect hedqe. Additional evidence supporting this proposition

is presented in Huizinga and Mishkin (1983). Our results are in general agreement

with those of Fama and Schwert (1977), who also find that as assets lengthen in

maturity and become more like equity, they become worse inflation hedges. However

Fama and Schwert's conclusion that U.S. Treasury bills and bonds of five—year

maturity or less are reasonably good hedges against expected inflation is not

supported here. The main reason for the difference is that our sample includes the

high inflation sample period after 1971 while Fama and Schwert's does not. As has

been documented in Nelson and Schwert (1977), Mishkin (1981b), and Fama and Gibbons

(1982), the period before 1971 is one with little variation in ex ante real rates

and inflation. This makes it difficult to detect a negative relationship between ex

ante real rates and expected inflation. However, with the additon of the highly

variable data after 1971, the neqative asociation clearly emerges.

     The conclusions described above are robust to the use of different price

indices -— a comforting finding. We should still be concerned, however, that the
                                          11




overstatement of inflation by the CPI in the 1970s may lead to misleadingly low

estimates of ex ante real interest rates. To see how severe the bias is from using

the CPI, we plot in Figure 1 the estimated ex ante real return for three month U.S.

Treasury bills using both the CPI, the broken line, and CpIx, the solid line. We

use the CPIx because we consider it to be the most reliable of our price indices.

Although it is not reported here, the effect of choosing the Cpix instead of the cpi

is similar for the other six assets. As described in Section II, the estimated ex

ante real rates are the fitted values from regressions of the ex post real rate on

information   available at the beginning of the period. Our     regressors were a

constant   term,   the inflation rate over the past three months, the current nominal

return on three—month U.S. Treasury bills and a fourth order polynomial in time that

proxies   for economic variables left out of the specification.
       The comparison of the two   measures is quite illuminating, Both measures show

that   ex ante real interest rates were higher in the    1960s than in the 1970s.

However, from 1964    onward, estimated real rates   using CPIx are almost always above

those using CpI, especially so during 1968—71, 1973—75, and 1977—79. These are all

periods of rising inflation and nominal interest rates, periods when the CPI is most

likely to overstate inflation.

       Although both estimated ex ante real returns turn negative in mid 1972, those

based on Cix are significantly negative only during the short period from late 1975

to 1977, while those using the CPI are continuously significantly negative from 1974

onward. This is easily seen because, as an approximation, only rates that lie

outside the range        are significantly different from zero at the 5% level of

significance.14 Previous findings of persistently negative ex ante real interest

rates have apparently been spurious, a result of the CPIs mismeasuremerit of

inflation.


B. Stability of the Stochastic Process of Real Rates

that real rates have undergone a major shift in the 1980g. We look at this

phenomenon with a standard test for the stability of the coefficients in the CPIX

regressions of Table 1, testing for a stable relationship of ex ante real rates with

inflation and with nominal rates. We use 1959:5 to 1979:10 as one time period and

1979:11 to 1981:10 as the other. The breakpoint was chosen to coincide with the

shift in the Federal Reserve policy regime towards a monetary agqregates tarqet and

away from interest rate targets. The choice of this breakpoint is somewhat

arbitrary and we are by no means sure that the shift in the stochastic process for

real rates occurred at this time. We intend to pursue a statistically based

approach to the dating of the breakpoint in future research. Nevertheless, the

advent of the new Federal Reserve policy has seemed to coincide with major changes

in the behavior of U.S. financial markets.

     Table 2 contains the      values for testing coefficient stability and the

coefficients estimated for the 1979:11 to 1981:10 period. Because there are only

twenty four highly autocorrelated observations for this latter period, whether using

asymptotic distribution theory to test coefficient stability is appropriate is a

serious question. A set of Monte Carlo simulationst5 indicates that the small

sample distribution of the test statistics is quite different from the asymptotic.

For example, in the case of using CPIX in the nominal bill rate regression for

TBILL3, the real probability of rejecting the null hypothesis of coefficient

stability when it is true, using a 5% significance level and the asymptotically

valid x2 distribution, is 26.1%. VIsing the asymptotic distribution can,

therefore, lead to rejecting the null hypothesis far too often. For this reason, the

significance levels calculated by the Monte Carlo simulation are used for both the

tests of coefficient stability in panel A and tests of coefficients equal to zero in

panel B.

     The results of panel A indicate that for the nominal bill rate reqressions, the

equality of coefficients in the pre— and post—October 1979 periods is strongly

rejected for the short—term assets. However, there are no rejections for any
                                      14




assets with the inflation coefficients. Although we do not report them here, we

also performed stability tests where the 1959:5 to 1979:10 period was split in

half. These tests rarely reveal a rejection of coefficient stability; the shift in

the stochastic process of real rates after 1979:10 is more noticeable than any shift

we have detected before this date.



     A deeper understanding of why stability of the nominal bill rate coefficients

is rejected is provided by Panel B of Table 2. The coefficients for the latter

period tell a very different story than than those for the earlier one, After

1979:10 an increase in the nominal interest rate on three month U.S.   Treasury bills
is associated with a rise in the ex ante real return on all assets except common

stock. In contrast to the pre 1979:10 period, when the nominal and ex ante real

rates on three month U.S. Treasury bills were negatively correlated, in the latter

period an increase in the nominal rate relects a one—for—one increase in the ex ante

real rate. That is, the nominal hill rate coefficient in the TBILL3 regression is

not statistically different from one using CPIX. Furthermore, with the exception of

stocks, the maqnification effect found in the earlier period is'still present; hut

it now indicates that high short-term nominal rates are associated with higher real

rates on longer maturity assets relative to those on short—maturity assets. The

inflation coefficients in Panel B also undergo a large shift from their pre—October

1979 levels. However, this shift is not statistically significant because, despite

some large coefficients, the relationship between real rates and inflation is not

statistically significant in the latter period.

    Taken together, the combined results of Tables 1 and 2 can be characterized by

the followinq relationship among ex ante real rates, expected inflation, and the

nominal interest rate on three—month U.S. Treasury bills. In the pre—Octoher 1979

period, the ex ante real return on all seven assets studied here is negatively

related to expected inflation, and given the positive autocorrelatation of

inflation, negatively related to actual inflation. Further, although the ex ante

real rate on three—month U.S. Treasury bills is not constant, their movement is

sufficiently small, as is demonstrated by Fama and Gibbons (1982) and uizinqa and

Mishkin (1983), so that nominal three month bill rate movements mainly reflect

changes in expected inflation. This, when combined with the negative correlation

between real rates and expected inflation, accounts for the negative correlation

between the nominal bill rate and the seven cx ante real rates displayed in Table 1.

     In the post-October 1979 period, movements in the ex ante real rates appear to

have been highly variable and uncorrelated with expected inflation, thereby breaking

the link between cx ante real rates and actual inflation. Because of the high

variablilty in the ex ante real rate on three month U.S. Treasury bills, movements of

their nominal rate no longer primarily reflect changes in expected inflation but

rather movement of the real rate. The result for CPIX and TBILL3 presented in Panel

B of Table 2 emphasizes this result, because it implies that in the post—October 1979

period a regression of inflation on a constant and the nominal three—month bill rate

yields a coefficient on the bill rate of —.16. This is significantly different from

one, the value we should get if the nominal rate is primarily reflecting expected

inflation. The positive correlation of the nominal bill rate and the cx ante real

rates on all assets except stock displayed in Panel B of Table 2 then means that the

real rates on bills and bonds have been positively correlated in this latter period.

The neqative relationship between the nominal rate on three—month bills and the ex

ante real return on common stock indicates a divergence of the real rate on stock

from that on other assets. This result is certainly one that merits further

investigation.


V. CONCLUSIONS


     This paper discusses a methodology for measuring cx ante real interest rates on

assets with different risk characteristics and for examining their correlation with

inflation and nominal interest rates. It is applied to the 1959—1981 time period for

the following seven assets: (1) three—month U.S. Treasury bills, (2) six—month U.S.
                                        17




Treasury bills, (3) twelve—month U.S. Treasury bills, (4) intermediate—term (5—10

years maturity) TJ5 Treasury bonds, (5) long—term (10—20 years maturity) u.s.

Treasury bonds, (6) long-term corporate bonds, and (7) common stock. The importance

of choosing a price index for constructing inflation and real rates is also examined.

The major findings are as follows:


1 •   Pre—October 1979, the negative association between ex ante real rates and both

      inflation and nominal interest rates, which was previously found for short-term

      U.S. Treasury bills, appears for all the assets in this study. Indeed, the

      negative association is even larger for the longer—maturity assets. This

      suggests that all seven assets have been poor hedges against expected inflation,

      and that the longer—maturity assets have been the worst hedges.

2. The results described above are robust with respect to the use of price indices

      other than the Consumer Price Index (cPi). The puzzling finding of previous

      research that ex ante real returns on short—term U.S. Treasury securities were

      persistently negative in the 1970s, however, appeals spurious and due to the

      CPI's mismeasurment of inflation. A more reliable estimate of ex ante real

      returns, one that uses a more accurate price index, finds statistically

      significant ex ante real rates for far shorter periods of time.

3. A statistically significant shift in the stochastic process of real rates does

      occur sometime around the October 1979 change in the Federal Reserve's policy

      regime. In contrast to the pre—October 1979 period where ex ante real rates arid

      nominal rates are negatively correlated, the post-october 1979 period has real

      and nominal rates moving together. In particular, movements in the nominal

      interest rate on three-month U.S. Treasury bills no longer primarily indicate

      changes in expected inflation, but rather the movement of the ex ante real

      return. There also seems to be a change in the relationship between the ex ante

      real returns on stock and the ex ante real return on bills and bonds near the end

      of 1979.

    (1982), Mishkin (1981b,1982,1984) and Huizinqa and Mishkin (1983). More detailed
    references on earlier work can be found in Mishkin (1981h).

2. See Blinder (1980)

3. The notion of a hedge aqainst expected inflation was suqqested in Fama and
    Schwert (1977). It is not a standard use of the term because the holder of the
    asset is not protected against an unanticipated event. Nevertheless, the meaning
    of hedge as used here should be clear.

4. As is indicated in Mishkin (1981a), survey data on expected inflation mas not be
    a reliable guide to the bond markets rate of expected inflation.

5. Conditional heteroscedasticity in the error term is heteroscedasticity that can
    be explained by movements in the regressors. We test for this by regressing the
    squared residuals from our estimated equations on the squared regressors.
    Significant coefficients on any variable except the constant term is evidence of
    conditional heteroscedasticity. Space does not permit us to report the results of
    all these tests. However, for the regressions where the CPIX price index is
    used, the t-statistics on the squared values of inflation (in a regression of the
    squared residual on a constant and squared inflation) are TBILL3: 1.51, TBILL6:
    1.71, TBILL12: 2.01, INTBOND: 2.56, LONGBOND: 2.23, CORPBOND: 3.36, and STOCK:
    1 .79. It should be noted that the method of correcting the estimated parameter
    standard errors used here does not require a parameterization of how the variance
    of the error is related to the regressors.

6. The rental equivalence measure, first announced in October 1981, became the
    official residential housing component for the CPI for All Urban Consumers in
    January 1983. The CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers will continue
    to use the old home-ownership method until January 1985. A detailed description
    of the new rental equivalence measure can be found in the CPI Detailed Report,
    January 1983 issue. The CPIX should be a better index than the CPI less home
    mortgage interest costs, a series often used to minimize the mismeasurment of
    prices by the CPI, because this latter index still includes a large interest rate
    component via its inclusion of the purchase price for new homes. We thank Robert
    Dennis of the Congressional Budget Office for providing us with the CPIX data
    back to 1959.

7. Our sample period starts in 1959:5 because the PCED price index is not available
    until 1959. The dating of the real returns follows the convention described in
    Section II, so that a time period 1959:5 to 1979:10 has the return from May 1,
    1959 to July 31, 1959 as its first observation and the return from October 1,
    1979 to December 31, 1979 as its last. The first observation for the inflation
    rate regressor is constructed using the January and April 1959 price indices. By
    using the April index to explain the real return from May to August, we are
    assuming that agents know the April price index on April 30. In fact, the April
    index will not be announced until sometime in May. However, replacing the
    January-April inflation rate with the December—March rate does not change our
    results appreciably. See Huberman and Schwert (1983) for evidence on this issue
                                     19




    in the Israeli bond market. The nominal three—month bill rate used as a
    reqressor for the first observation is the rate on April 30, 1959. There is no
    seasonal adjustment of any data, except for PCED which we could not get in
    seasonally unadjusted form. We have constructed tests where all data except PCED
    are seasonally adjusted with Box—Jenkins (1976) seasonal models and the results
    are essentially the same.

8. In computing the standard errors reported in Table 1, the error terms of the
    regressions are assumed to have nonzero autocorrelations at lags one and two.
    This is based on examination of the sample residuals. For example, when using
    cP1X, the first twelve autocorrelations of the residuals from a regression of the
    ex post real rate for TBILL3 on a constant and the inflation rate are .68, .35,
    —.03, —.07, —.08, —.02, —.01, .04, .12, .22, .25 and .25. The non—zero
    autocorrelations at lags one and two are exactly what one should expect given the
    quarterly real rates and monthly data. Since lagged real rates do not appear as
    regressors the u component of the error term, and hence the entire error term,
    can display autocorrelation at any lag without violating our assumptions of
    rational expectations. The rise in the autocorrelations near lag twelve can be
    interpreted as a mild seasonal fluctuation in the ex ante real rate that is not
    captured by the inflation rate. Sample residuals from other equations display
    essentially the same pattern of autocorrelations, though for the bonds and stock
    equations there is no evidence of a seasonal. This is not surprising since the
    larger variance of the forecast errors         and         in the equations for
    the longer maturity assets should make a seAonal hardet3to find.

9. When the coefficients in Table 1 differ significantly from equation to equation,
    it is evidence of a risk premium in the returns. This issue is formally addressed
    in Huizinga and Mishkin (1983).

10. The test statistic at the bottom of each column is distributed as a x2 random
    variable with seven degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis that all seven
    coefficients in the column are zero. Its marginal significance level is the
    probability, when the null hypothsis is true, of getting a test statistic as high
    as, or higher than, the one observed. Thus a marginal significance level smaller
    than .01 indicates rejection of the null hypothesis at the 1% level.

11. When we test the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between inflation
    and the cx ante real return on the four long—term assets —— i.e. jointly test
    that the coefficient of inflation is zero for the INTBOND, LONGBOND, CORPBOND,
    and SICK equations —- we get       values of 13.90 for CPI, 14.68 for CPIX, 11.68
    for PCED, and 18.74 for PPI. This indicates rejection of the null hypothesis at
    the 1% level for CPI, CPIX, and PPI and rejection at the 5% level for PCED. Thus
    our tests do have some power to reject the hypothesis that inflation is
    uncorrelated with the cx ante real return for long—term assets.

12. When we included both the yields to maturity and the three month bill rates as
    regressors, the coefficients for the yield variables became insignificantly
    different from zero. Thus the term structure of nominal interest rates apparently
    provides no additional information about short—term ex ante real returns above
    and beyond what is captured by the nominal three—month bill rate.

13. See Fama(1975), Mishkin (1981b), Fama and Gibbons (1982), and Huizinga and
    Mishkin (1983).

14. The standard errors of the estimated real rates are calculated under the
    assumption that unexpected inflation is the major component of the error term.
    These standard errors do show some variation over time but do not differ greatly
    from .5%. The calculations used are described in Mishkin (1981a).

15. m do the Monte Carlo simulations, the inflation rate, nominal interest rate on
    three month rI•S• Treasury bills and residuals from each of the fourteen CPIx
    regressions reported in Table 1 were fit to a univariate time series process.
    Using the estimated time series representation, including the estimated
    correlation of the innovations in the series, two thousand and replications of
    each of the fourteen regressions were run. A replication consisted of generating
    a new regressor, generating a new residual, generating a new dependent variable
    from the regressor, the residual and the coefficients reported in Table 1 and
    finally, estimating the equation.
