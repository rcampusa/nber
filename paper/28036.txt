                                         ABSTRACT

We document trends in affective polarization during the coronavirus pandemic. In our main
measure, affective polarization is relatively flat between July 2019 and February 2020, then falls
significantly around the onset of the pandemic. Two other data sources show no evidence of an
increase in polarization around the onset of the pandemic. Finally, we show in an experiment that
priming respondents to think about the coronavirus pandemic significantly reduces affective
polarization.

1     Introduction

In the early US coronavirus pandemic, the response of politicians and media outlets in the US
diverged sharply along partisan lines (Carothers 2020; Simonov et al. 2020). Perhaps as a response,
partisan differences have also emerged among individual citizens in both beliefs about the severity
of the pandemic and social distancing responses (Allcott et al. 2020). Affective polarization—the
extent to which partisans feel more negatively toward the opposing political party than toward their
own—is also at a multi-decade high (Iyengar et al. 2019).
      In this context, commentators have expressed concern that the coronavirus pandemic may be
driving Americans further apart (Carothers 2020; Tierney 2020; Victor 2020). Others have noted
that such a national emergency could reduce polarization by bringing partisans together in facing a
common threat (Quarcoo and Kleinfeld 2020; Van Bavel et al. 2020). Shifting media consumption
patterns may also influence polarization (Ritter 2020).
      We use multiple data sources to document trends in affective polarization during the coron-
avirus pandemic. Two of three data sources suggest that affective polarization declined with the
onset of the coronavirus, with the third suggesting neither a decline nor an increase. A survey
experiment adds further evidence in support of a decline.


2     Results

2.1     Descriptive Trends in Affective Polarization

Panel A of Figure 1 reports trends in our measure of affective polarization towards partisans us-
ing Nationscape data that covers more than 300,000 interviews between July 2019 and July 2020.
Panel A shows that, prior to the rise of the coronavirus in the US, affective polarization was rela-
tively flat and this flat trend extends back to July 2019. However, after the first coronavirus-related
death, affective polarization begins to decline. In the aftermath of George Floyd’s death, affective
polarization increases—nearly returning to pre-pandemic levels.
      Panels B and C of Figure 1 reports trends in affective polarization using alternative data sources.
One series (Panel B) indicates a large and statistically significant decline in affective polarization
while the other series (Panel C) indicates a small and insignificant increase.

2.2      Survey Experiment

We also conduct a survey experiment with three treatment conditions and 1503 respondents. In the
coronavirus treatment, respondents are asked to read two news article excerpts that cover the initial
phases of the coronavirus pandemic and to reflect on their own experiences and faith in the United
States’ ability to address the pandemic at its onset.1 In the placebo treatment, respondents are
asked to perform the same exercise but for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s financial separation
from the UK royal family. In the pure control group, respondents are not asked to perform any
exercise.
      Panel A of Figure 2 reports the estimated treatment effects on the difference between own-
party and other-party views. Relative to the pure control group, the coronavirus prime reduced an
index of affective polarization by 3.8 units (p-value = 0.042) on a 0 to 100 scale. The coronavirus
treatment effect is larger in magnitude than the placebo’s, though this difference is not statistically
significant (p-value = 0.290). Panel B focuses on feelings towards the other party. The coronavirus
prime improved an index of feelings towards the other party by 3.5 units (p-value = 0.005) and this
effect is significantly larger than the placebo’s (p-value = .046). Similar results are observed for
many of the individual components of the index.
      Despite the coronavirus treatment effects reducing polarization, more than two-thirds of our
survey respondents indicated that the coronanavirus has made the public more politically divided.


3       Discussion

One potential mechanism for the decline is the creation of a new sense of unity in response to a
national threat. Though elite messaging and observed social distancing behaviors exhibited impor-
tant partisan differences (Allcott et al. 2020), focusing only on differences in behaviors masks the
overwhelming unity in early-stage responses. Between January 2018 and March 2020, the share
of Americans indicating “we’re all in it together” increased from 63 percent to 90 percent (More
in Common 2020).
      Shifts in news consumption, particularly local news consumption, may be another contributing
mechanism. A poll series by Gallup shows that between December 2019 and March 2020, the
share of Americans paying a “great deal” of attention to local news increased from 22 percent to
44 percent (Ritter 2020). Both Republicans and Democrats consider local news to be less ideologi-

cally biased, and there is evidence that local news attenuates polarization (Darr et al. 2018; Brenan
2019). National outlets may have also shifted news coverage away from other political issues to
focus on the pandemic.
    Moreoever, when facing a global pandemic, Americans may be preoccupied with other concerns—
lowering the general salience of political divisions.
    While we cannot cleanly separate the causal effect of the coronavirus pandemic from similarly
timed events, the combination of the descriptive trends and the survey priming experiment suggest
that the coronavirus pandemic did not increase and may have even decreased affective polarization
in the United States.


4   Material and Methods

Across datasets, we define affective polarization to be the weighted average of individual’s feelings
towards one’s own party minus feelings towards the other party. We include leaners, but exclude
pure independents. We use survey weights when available consistently across a given data series.
We apply an affine transformation to all measures of affect so they range between 0 and 100.
    For the survey, we recruited 1503 respondents on Bovitz Inc.’s survey panel between Septem-
ber 29, 2020 and October 4, 2020, and we exclude 88 respondents that failed an attention check.
The protocol was approved as exempt by Northwestern University’s IRB (STU00212339), and in-
formed consent was obtained at the beginning of the survey. The survey analysis was pre-registered
at aspredicted.org (#48474). For each category of affect questions (feelings thermometer, trust, per-
ceived traits, and social distance), we first rescaled responses to range between 0 and 100 before
taking the average across responses within a given category for each individual. We then take the
average across categories to construct the index for each respondent. There are one, one, eight, and
three questions associated with the feeling thermometer, trust, perceived traits, and social distance
categories respectively.
    Replication code and data from Nationscape, Druckman et al. (2020), and our own survey
experiment will be posted upon final publication at https://osf.io/dra7s/. Data from the American
National Election Study is available at https://electionstudies.org/data-center/. The survey instru-
ments are available in the SI appendix.

Note: Figure shows trends in affective polarization using three distinct data sources. Panel A reports affective polar-
ization towards partisans for each ten-day period in the Nationscape data. Panel B reports the difference (Republicans
minus Democrats) in average feelings towards Donald Trump from ANES surveys in December 2018, December
2019, and May 2020. Panel C reports affective polarization using a panel of respondents from Druckman et al. (2020)
who completed surveys in July 2019 and April 2020. The Druckman et al. (2020) data report lower levels of affective
polarization because their measures had an embedded experiment that varied the target evaluated (e.g., "Democrats,"
"moderate Democrats") (see Druckman et al.’s supplementary material), and restricting analysis to questions about
“Democrats” (not shown) also produces a flat trend with a level more similar to the Nationscape measure. The first
dashed vertical line indicates the first period in which a covid-related death was reported. The second dashed verticle
line indicates the period in which George Floyd’s death occurred. The .025 and .975 quantiles of a nonparametric
bootstrap with 1000 replicates stratified by time period are used to construct the confidence intervals.

Note: Figure reports estimated treatment effects of the coronavirus and placebo primes relative to the pure control
group. Panel A reports estimates on measures of affective polarization (own party minus other party). Panel B reports
estimates on measures of affect towards the other party. Both panels report estimates separately for each of four
question categories (feelings thermometer; trust; perceived traits; and social distance) and for an index averaging
across categories. The 95 percent confidence intervals are constructed using heteroskedastic robust standard errors.
Above the bars, we report the p-value from a two-sided test of equality between the coronavirus and placebo treatment
effects using robust standard errors.

articles from last spring.

COVID-19 swept across the United States last March and April, leading states to issue stay-at-
home orders. To remind you of ongoing events during this time we are next re-printing segments
of two newspaper articles from March and April, 2020. We will then ask you to reflect about your
experiences at that time, when the United States faced this uncertain threat.

Business Insider, March 11, 2020

The WHO officially declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on March 11 after spreading
to more than 100 countries around the world. “WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the
clock, and we’re deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the
alarming levels of inaction,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters.

USA TODAY, April 2, 2020

The world soared past the 1 million mark in confirmed coronavirus cases, jobless numbers skyrock-
eted, Democrats delayed their national convention and the nation’s preeminent infectious disease
expert required a security detail on Thursday. More bad news landed early Friday: The U.S. death
toll topped 6,000 President Donald Trump and federal health officials predicted a “very painful”
period in the country’s fight against the public health emergency.

Business Insider, January 8, 2020

After months of speculation, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle put the rumors to rest and officially
announced they were stepping down from their duties as senior royals. The Duke and Duchess
of Sussex said they planned on being financially independent and split their time between North
America and the United Kingdom

USA TODAY, January 9, 2020

About an hour after their announcement, another palace announcement, sent in an email from
the office of the private secretary and the spokesperson for Queen Elizabeth II, landed in media
inboxes. "Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage," the statement
said carefully. "We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated
issues that will take time to work through."

<Polarization Questions>

<All respondents see the following questions. In these questions, “<Outparty>” appears as “Re-
publican” for Democratic and Independent respondents, and as “Democratic” for Republican re-
spondents. “<Inparty>” appears as “Democratic” for Democratic and Independent respondents,
and as “Republican” for Republican respondents.>

<Polarization Measure: Thermometer>

We are now going to ask you a set of questions about the Republican and Democratic parties.

<Page Break>

We’d like you to rate how you feel towards the Democratic and Republican parties on a scale
of 0 to 100, which we call a “feeling thermometer.” On this feeling thermometer scale, ratings
between 0 and 49 degrees mean that you feel unfavorable and cold (with 0 being the most unfavor-
able/coldest). Ratings between 51 and 100 degrees mean that you feel favorable and warm (with
100 being the most favorable/warmest). A rating of 50 means you have no feelings one way or the
other. How would you rate your feeling toward the Democratic and Republican parties?
the <Outparty> Party [0-100 Slider]
the <Inparty> Party [0-100 Slider]

<Polarization Measure: Traits>

Now we’d like to know more about what you think about the <Outparty> Party. Below, we’ve
given a list of words that some people might use to describe them.

For each item, please indicate how well you think it applies to the <Outparty> Party:

the country? [Almost never; Once in a while; About half the time; Most of the time; Almost always]

How much of the time do you think you can trust the <Inparty> Party to do what is right for
the country? [Almost never; Once in a while; About half the time; Most of the time; Almost
always]
