Obesity as a Barrier to the Transition from Welfare to Work

                                           ABSTRACT

This paper utilizes a rich longitudinal data set -- the Women’s Employment Study (WES) n to

investigate whether obesity, which is common among women of low socioeconomic status, is a

barrier to employment and earnings for current and former welfare recipients. We find evidence that,

among current and former welfare recipients, high body weight is a greater barrier to labor market

success for white women than for African-American women. Among white women, we consistently

find a negative correlation between weight and labor market outcomes such as employment, hours

worked, and earnings. Among African American women, weight is not correlated with employment,

hours worked, or earnings, but it is correlated with the percentage of months spent on welfare

between interviews. We provide suggestive evidence that these differences between white and

African-American women in the relationship between body weight and labor market outcomes are

partly due to differential weight-based discrimination in employment.

                                      1. Introduction

       In 1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act

(PRWORA) replaced the entitlement to Aid to Families with Dependent Children

(AFDC) with block grants through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).

PRWORA required that at least 50 percent of all recipient families work or be in work

preparation programs by the year 2002, and set a lifetime limit of 60 months of receipt of

federal cash assistance, although states were allowed some flexibility in exempting

individual cases from these requirements. As a result of welfare reform, expansions of

the Earned Income Tax Credit, and increased federal and state funding of child care

subsidies, cash welfare benefits to families with non-working parents fell dramatically

after 1996, while public spending supporting working families increased dramatically

(Blank, 2002).

       Because PRWORA required most welfare recipients to seek employment, there is

much policy interest in identifying barriers that reduce their probability of employment.

Danziger et al. (2000) examine a variety of such barriers and document that a range of

human capital, physical health, and mental health factors affect the probability that a

single mother will satisfy TANF work requirements. Jayakody and Stauffer (2000)

examine the effects of mental health barriers in particular. Corcoran, Danziger, and

Tolman (2003) find that persistent physical health problems, mental health problems, and

child health problems are associated with shorter employment spells among current and

former welfare recipients.

       One potential barrier to the employment of current and former welfare recipients

that has not been previously studied is obesity. Among women in the U.S., the



                                             2
prevalence of obesity is above average for those of low socioeconomic status (Sobal and

Stunkard, 1989). Obesity represents a potential barrier to labor market success because

obese females tend to earn less than healthy-weight females; this relationship is stronger

for white than African-American females (Averett and Korenman, 1999; Cawley, 2004).

The recent and rapid rise in the prevalence of obesity in the U.S. – from 15 percent

during 1976-1980 to 30.9 percent during 1999-2000 (Flegal et al., 2002) – makes it

particularly important to understand how obesity affects the transition from welfare to

work.

         This paper utilizes unique panel data on a sample of current and former welfare

recipients to answer the following questions: How do employment, earnings and the

extent of welfare use vary with body weight? Do the correlations between obesity and

labor market outcomes and between obesity and welfare use vary by race? Are these

correlations explained by mental health or physical health?

         We find a consistent correlation between weight and adverse labor market

outcomes among white current and former welfare recipients, but, for most outcomes, a

negligible correlation among African-American respondents. For white respondents, a 10

percent increase in weight in pounds from the sample mean is associated with a 12

percent decrease in the probability of current employment, an 8.9 percent decrease in the

probability of full-time employment, 5.4 percent fewer hours worked per week, 5 percent

fewer months worked between survey waves, a 16 percent increase in the percent of

months spent on welfare between waves, and 10 percent lower earnings in the previous

month.




                                             3
       Among the African American respondents, weight is not significantly correlated

with most labor market outcomes. However, a 10 percent increase in weight in pounds

from the sample mean is associated with a 10.9 percent increase in the percent of months

spent on welfare between survey waves. We conclude that while weight may be a barrier

to employment for white current and former welfare recipients, among African American

women weight appears to be largely uncorrelated with employment and earnings, though

it may be a barrier to leaving welfare.



                                          2. Methods

       The goal of this paper is to generate consistent estimates of the relationship

between weight and labor market outcomes and between weight and welfare use among

current and former welfare recipients. We study a variety of outcomes: binary, skewed,

and percentages. For binary outcomes (e.g. whether the respondent has a full-time job),

we estimate logit models of the form:

                                    Yit = Wit β + X itγ + ε it

where Yit represents the outcome Y of woman i at time t and Wit represents her weight at

time t. X is a vector of variables that affect the outcome Y (such as measures of human

capital) and ε is the residual, which we assume follows a logistic distribution.

       For outcomes that are skewed (e.g. hours worked last week), we estimate semilog

models of the form:

                                  An Yit = Wit β + X itγ + ε it

That is, we take the natural logarithm of the outcome and regress it on weight and the

other regressors. Because the log transformation assigns no value when the variable is



                                                4
equal to zero, we take the natural logarithm of these variables after recoding earnings

from $0 to $1 and hours worked from 0 to 1.

       For outcomes that are percentages (e.g. percent of months worked) we use the

logit transformation of the dependent variable and estimate models of the form:

                             An(Yit /(1 − Yit )) = Wit β + X itγ + ε it

Because the logit transformation assigns no value when the percent is equal to either zero

or one, zero values were recoded as .001 and values of one were recoded as .999.

       We estimate these models using pooled longitudinal data from two survey waves

that included self-reports of weight. To address possible correlation over time in the

error terms of each individual, we cluster-correct the standard errors. We estimate all

models separately by race because there are differences in the ways that whites and

African-Americans perceive their own weight (Stearns, 1997), and because previous

studies have found significant differences across race in the correlations between weight

and labor market outcomes (Averett and Korenman, 1996; Cawley, 2004).




                      3. The Women’s Employment Study (WES)

       The Women's Employment Study (WES) was designed to facilitate the analysis of

the ways in which a variety of human capital, mental health, physical health, and family

problems affect the ability of current and former welfare recipients to obtain and retain

employment and make the transition from welfare to work. A key goal of the WES is to

examine how the presence of such barriers affects the response of former recipients to

new welfare program mandates.



                                                 5
       The initial sample consisted of 874 single mothers receiving cash welfare in

February of 1997. The sample was systematically drawn with equal probability from an

ordered list of the universe of active single-mother cases of the Michigan Family

Independence Agency. It is not a nationally representative sample; the sample was

geographically limited to one urban county in Michigan, and cases were proportionately

selected by zip code, age (18-54 years), and race (White non-Hispanic or African-

American non-Hispanic). We refer to these two groups as whites and African-

Americans; since there are no Hispanics in the WES sample, it will be taken for granted

that both of these groups are non-Hispanic.

       The data were collected in personal interviews conducted by trained interviewers

through the Survey Research Center in the Institute for Social Research at the University

of Michigan. Interviews for the first wave were conducted in Fall 1997. Wave 2 was

conducted in Fall 1998, Wave 3 in Fall/Winter 1999, Wave 4 in Fall 2001, and Wave 5 in

Fall 2003/Winter 2004. In each wave, attempts were made to contact respondents, but

not non-respondents, to the previous wave. Response rates were 86 percent in wave 1

(N=753), 92 percent in wave 2 (N=693), 91 percent in wave 3 (N=632) and 91 percent in

wave 4. (N=577). There seems to be no systematic attrition in the sample, so

observations are not weighted.

       The WES is well-suited to studying obesity as a barrier to the transition from

welfare to work. First, it contains a rich set of labor market outcomes and welfare use

measures. We examine the following: an indicator variable for whether the respondent

is not currently working, an indicator for current full-time employment, hours worked per




                                              6
week, percent of months worked since last interview, percent of months on welfare since

last interview, and own earnings last month.

       Second, the WES includes information on height and weight. In wave 3,

respondents were asked to self-report their height in inches. In both waves 3 and 4, they

were asked to self-report their weight in pounds. In this paper, models of the relationship

between weight and labor market outcomes and weight and welfare use are estimated

using data from waves 3 and 4.

       Previous research has documented substantial reporting error in self-reports of

weight (Rowland, 1998; Cawley, 2000). Reporting error may bias coefficient estimates

(Bound, Brown, and Mathiowetz, 2002), so we correct for it using data on measured

height and weight from a special health supplement to waves 3 and 4 of the WES. Only a

subset of WES respondents participated in this supplement (N=299), so it is not possible

to use measured weight for all respondents. The correlation involves using measured

height and weight for the subset of WES respondents as validation data for the heights

and weights reported by all respondents; details are provided in the Appendix.

Throughout this paper we use measures of weight and height that have been corrected for

reporting error.

       This paper uses two measures of body weight: weight in pounds and body mass

index (BMI). BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters

squared. BMI is the standard measure of fatness in epidemiology and medicine (U.S.

Department of Health and Human Services, 2001); it is used to classify individuals as

overweight and obese by the U. S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), the World Health

Organization, and the International Obesity Task Force (Flegal et al., 1998).




                                               7
         Kaplan et al. (2003) compared the BMI of women in the WES health supplement

to that of women of the same age and race in the National Health and Nutrition

Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2000. They find that the mean BMI of WES

respondents is 16 percent higher than that in the NHANES sample, which reflects the

negative correlation between socio-economic status and obesity among women in the

U.S.

        We also experimented with a third measure of weight: the clinical weight

classification, established by the NIH. According to this classification, a respondent

whose BMI is below 18.5 is underweight, one whose BMI is at least 18.5 but less than 25

is healthy weight, one whose BMI is at least 25 but less than 30 is overweight and one

whose BMI is 30 or higher is obese (U.S. National Institutes of Health, 1998; Epstein and

Higgins, 1992). However, when we included indicator variables for underweight,

overweight, and obese as our controls for weight, none of the three coefficients was

statistically significant. We were concerned that the relatively small cell sizes (four

weight classifications times two race groups) precluded accurate estimates of the

coefficients, so we experimented with including just one indicator. Even then, whether

the indicator was for overweight or obese, the coefficients associated were generally not

statistically significant.

        The distribution of weight is skewed further to the right for the African-

Americans in WES than the white respondents. Twenty-five percent of whites meet the

clinical definition of healthy weight, compared to 15 percent of African-Americans.

Forty-nine percent of white respondents, and 56 percent of African-Americans, are obese.

Kaplan et al. (2003) find that the prevalence of obesity among white WES respondents is




                                              8
nearly twice as high as that among white female NHANES respondents of the same ages.

In contrast, the prevalence of obesity among African-American WES respondents is only

slightly higher than that among black female NHANES respondents of the same ages.

       We control for height in inches when our regressor of interest is weight in pounds.

It is not necessary to control for height when BMI is our regressor, as it is a measure of

weight-for-height.

       Summary statistics for the WES sample of whites appear in Table 1A, and those

for African-Americans in Table 1B. A comparison of Tables 1A and 1B indicates that

the two samples have different mean weights. The average weight of whites is 180.72

pounds, while that of African-Americans is 185.29 pounds.

       While we do not use an indicator for obesity as a measure of weight, our study

concerns obesity as a barrier to employment because the average woman in our sample is

obese. The average BMI is 31.35 among whites and 32.16 among African-Americans.

       In this paper, we limit analysis to labor market and welfare use outcomes in

waves 3 and 4, when weight was reported. However, at times we examine cumulative

measures of labor market performance, such as the percent of months worked since the

previous interview and the percent of months on welfare since the last interview. When

we examine cumulative measures, we must assume that the individual’s unobserved

weight during the period between waves was equal to her self-reported weight.

       We control in each regression for factors that affect labor market participation and

performance, specifically: measures of human capital, demographic and personal

characteristics, and child characteristics. We control for the following measures of

human capital: indicator variables for no job market skills, low job market skills, less




                                             9
than a high school education, and more than a high school education. We control for the

following demographic and personal characteristics: indicator variables for age category

(18-24, 25-34, and 35-44, with the highest category, 45+, omitted), respondent is

currently living with a husband or cohabiting with an unmarried partner, respondent

never married, the respondent either has no car or no driver’s license, and respondent has

a conviction for a crime other than a traffic offense. The child characteristics controlled

for are: the number of children the respondent cares for, the number of children between

the ages of 0 and 2 that the respondent cares for, and indicator variables for whether one

of the respondent’s children has a physical or mental health problem. We also include an

indicator variable for year to capture differences in economic conditions between Fall

1999 when wave 3 was fielded and Fall 2001 when wave 4 was fielded.

       After estimating our initial models, we seek to determine the extent to which

weight is correlated with labor market outcomes and welfare use after controlling for the

respondent’s mental and physical health. The additional regressors added to the model

are: an index of physical limitations (in which a higher score reflects better health), and

indicator variables for whether the respondent meets the diagnostic screening criteria for

major depression or other mental health problems (such as general anxiety disorder,

social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol dependence and drug dependence),

and whether the respondent rates her own health as fair or poor; see Danziger et al. 2000

for a detailed discussion of WES variables.




                                    4. Empirical Results




                                              10
   We present in each table the coefficients, t statistics, and elasticities associated with

the weight variables: either weight in pounds or BMI.

   The first outcome examined is whether the respondent is working at the time of the

interview. Table 2 indicates that white females who are heavier (whether measured in

weight in pounds or BMI) are more likely to report that they are not currently working.

Both coefficients are statistically significant at the 10 percent level. For white females,

an increase in pounds of 10 percent from the mean is associated with a 12 percent

increase in the probability of not working. In contrast, the coefficients on weight in

pounds and BMI for African-Americans are not statistically significant.

   The second outcome is whether the respondent is employed full-time at the time of

the survey. Heavier white females are less likely to be employed full-time; the

coefficients on both weight in pounds and BMI in Table 3 are statistically significant at

the 5 percent level. For white females, an increase in pounds of 10 percent from the

mean is associated with an 8.9 percent decrease in the probability of full-time

employment. Weight is not correlated with the probability of full-time employment for

African-American respondents.

   Table 4 indicates that heavier white females tend to work fewer hours per week than

lighter white females. The coefficients imply that, ceteris paribus, a 10 percent increase

in pounds from the mean is associated with 5.4 percent fewer hours worked per week.

Again, no significant correlation was found for African Americans.

   We examined the percent of months worked since the last interview in Table 5.

Heavier white females worked a smaller percentage of months between waves, whether

weight is measured in pounds or BMI; both coefficients are significant at the 5 percent




                                             11
level. For white females, a 10 percent increase in pounds from the mean is associated

with a 5 percent decrease in months worked between waves.1 Neither weight nor BMI is

statistically significant for African-Americans.2

       We also study the percent of months on welfare since the last interview; these results

are presented in Table 6. For whites, a 10 percent increase in pounds is associated with a

16 percent increase in the percent of months spent on welfare between waves. Weight is

also correlated with months on welfare for African-Americans; a 10 percent increase in

pounds is associated with an 11 percent increase in the percent of months spent on

welfare between waves. This is interesting for two reasons. First, the magnitude of the

effect is large. Second, this finding is different from the pattern of the other outcomes:

weight is not correlated with the probability of employment, the probability of full-time

employment, hours worked, or months worked, for African American females.3

       Finally, we examine the relationship between weight and own earnings last month in

Table 7. Among whites, a 10 percent increase in weight from the mean is associated with


1
    In regressions in which the dependent variable is a percentage that has been logit transformed, the
elasticity is calculated as: ε = (1− Y )W β where Y is the average outcome of interest in the
sample, W is the average weight in the sample, and β is the coefficient on weight. For example, the
elasticity of percent months worked since last interview with respect to weight in pounds for white females
(see Table 5 for the coefficient and Table 1A for the means) is equal to
ε = (1− Y )W β = (1− .7) *180.72* −.0094 = −0.51
2
  The percent of months worked since the last interview includes former welfare recipients who have
moved completely off the welfare rolls and into the labor force and “combiners,” those who both work and
receive cash welfare benefits. To study the former group in isolation, we also analyze the percent of
months since the last interview that the respondent was wage reliant, defined as the months in which she
earned wages and received no cash benefits. Consistent with the results in Table 5, we found that heavier
white females spent fewer months wage reliant since the last interview. There was no statistically
significant relationship for African-American females.
3
  The variable for percent of months spent on welfare includes both those who are not working at all and
those who work some hours in the months in which cash benefits were received. To distinguish the former
group, we examine the percent of months that the respondent was welfare reliant, defined as a month in
which the respondent received cash welfare but did not have any wages. Consistent with the results in
Table 6, both weight measures are statistically significant at the 10% level for both whites and African-
Americans.


                                                       12
10 percent lower earnings. The correlation of weight with log earnings in the WES is

larger than that of weight with log wages in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth

(NLSY); while a ten-pound increase in pounds among white females in the WES is

associated with 5.5 percent lower earnings, a ten-pound increase in weight among white

females in the NLSY is associated with 1.4 percent lower wages (Cawley, 2004). Part of

the discrepancy in magnitudes is due to the WES results reflecting both the correlation of

weight with wages and the correlation of weight with hours worked, whereas the NLSY

results are simply for wages.

   Using the method of instrumental variables, Cawley (2004) finds evidence that the

relationship is causal; that is, weight lowers wages for white females. If that causal

relationship exists in the WES as well, the relative results suggest that weight represents a

greater barrier to earnings for white current or former welfare recipients than for the

population of white females as a whole. The coefficient on weight in the log earnings

regression is not statistically significant for African American women.

   For convenience in comparing results across outcomes and groups, Table 8 presents

the marginal effect or elasticity of each outcome with respect to weight in pounds and

BMI for both white and African-American respondents. Consistently, outcomes are more

elastic to weight for whites than for African-Americans.

   Obesity is correlated with depression (Williamson and O’Neil, 1998), but that may be

the result of obese individuals becoming depressed about their physical condition or the

result of depression leading to increased calorie consumption. Obesity is also correlated

with physical health, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, gallbladder

disease, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cancer, arthritis, and gout (Pi-Sunyer,




                                             13
2002; Bray, Bouchard, and James, 1998). While some illness is caused by obesity, in

other cases illness limits physical activity and contributes to obesity.

    Because the extent to which mental and physical health are the causes or

consequences of obesity is not clear, we did not control for them in the models discussed

above. Now, to establish a lower bound on the correlation of weight with labor market

and welfare use outcomes, we add to our set of regressors measures of mental and

physical health. We first add variables that indicate whether the respondent meets

diagnostic screening criteria for major depression and for other mental health problems

measured in WES.4 Second, we add to the original model an indicator variable for

whether self-reported health is fair or poor, and an index of physical health limitations.5

Third, we add both the mental health and the physical health controls to the original

model.

    Our results (not shown, available on request) are robust to the inclusion of the mental

health variables. Point estimates of coefficients and t statistics fall, but the weight

variables tend to retain their statistical significance for white females.

    When we control for physical health (not shown, available on request), many weight

coefficients are no longer statistically significant for whites; the exception is the weight

coefficient for the outcome percent of months on welfare since the last interview, which

remains significant and positive. For African Americans, some interesting results appear.

Weight in pounds and BMI become statistically significant in the regressions for whether


4
  The correlation between weight in pounds and depression is .014, and that between BMI and depression is
.006. The correlation between weight in pounds and the mental health problems variable is .015, and that
for BMI and mental health problems is .022.
5
  The correlation between weight in pounds and self-reported health is .080, and that between BMI and
self-reported health is .094. The correlation between weight in pounds and the physical limitations scale
(on which a higher score is better health) is -.206, and that for BMI and the physical limitations scale is -
.217.


                                                     14
the respondent is not currently working and for hours worked per week. A surprising

finding is that the coefficients have the opposite sign than those for whites: controlling

for health, heavier African-American females are more likely to work, and tend to work

longer hours, than lighter African-American females. These results suggest that there are

two types of heavy African-American respondents: those with physical limitations that

prevent them from working, and those without physical limitations who are likely to

work (and to work long hours). If one does not control for physical limitations, then

overall weight appears to have no correlation with labor market outcomes for African

Americans.

   When we add controls for both mental and physical health problems, most of the

weight coefficients are no longer statistically significant. The only ones remaining

significant are: for white females, weight in pounds and BMI in the regression for

percent of months on welfare since last interview; for African-American females: weight

in pounds in the regression for hours worked per week.

   Overall, the addition of mental and physical health problems indicate that weight is

correlated with both mental and physical health problems, but it is unclear in which

direction the causal arrow points. Obesity may increase the likelihood of depression and

physical limitations, and vice-versa.



                                         5. Discussion

       Welfare reform in the late 1990s created incentives for welfare recipients to work.

In order to facilitate labor market participation for this population, it is necessary to know

the barriers they face to employment. This research represents a step in that direction




                                             15
because it identifies a little-recognized barrier to employment and earnings for certain

welfare recipients: obesity.

       We consistently find a correlation between weight and adverse labor market

outcomes among white respondents even in a modestly-sized sample. For white females,

a 10 percent increase in weight from the mean is associated with a 12 percent decrease in

the probability of current employment, an 8.9 percent decrease in the probability of full-

time employment, 5.4 percent fewer hours worked, 5 percent fewer months worked

between survey waves, 16 percent more months spent on welfare between survey waves,

and 10 percent lower earnings.

       Among African American respondents, weight is only correlated with one

outcome: welfare receipt. A 10 percent increase in weight in pounds is associated with a

10.9 percent increase in the percent of months spent on welfare between waves. It is

intriguing that, for African-Americans, weight is not correlated with employment, full-

time employment, or hours, but it is correlated with months on welfare.

    There exist three broad categories of explanations for our findings. The first is that

obesity lowers wages and reduces employment; for example, by impairing health or

because of workplace discrimination against heavier respondents. The second is that

unemployment and/or low earnings cause obesity. This would be true if poorer people

consume cheaper, more fattening, foods. The third category of explanations is that

unobserved variables cause both obesity and impair labor market performance. A

limitation of this paper is that we can only speculate on the causal relationship embedded

in the correlations we observe. However, Cawley (2004), using the method of




                                            16
instrumental variables, finds a causal relationship between weight and lower wages for

white, but not African-American, females.

   The full policy implications of our findings depend on the underlying causal

relationship. If obesity causes unemployment and low wages, one strategy for easing the

transition from welfare to work may be to expand Medicaid to cover treatment for

obesity, nutrition counseling, and weight loss treatments. Medicaid coverage of anti-

obesity pharmaceuticals and surgical treatments for obesity are determined on a state-by-

state basis (American Obesity Association, 2002). To the extent that such treatments

improve labor market outcomes and reduce welfare use, public savings may offset some

of the cost of such expansions. Obviously, a cost-effectiveness analysis of expanded

Medicaid coverage is beyond the scope of this paper.

   It is not clear why our results differ so radically for whites and African-Americans.

One possibility is that there exists employment discrimination on the basis of weight that

is more punitive towards white than black females. Researchers have tested for weight-

based discrimination in laboratory settings; participants are asked to make hiring or

promotion decisions on the basis of materials that include photographs, videotapes, or

descriptions indicating the worker’s weight. The weights are manipulated to determine

the extent to which hiring decisions are driven by discrimination against the obese.

Reviews of this research (Roehling, 1999; Puhl and Brownell, 2001) document abundant

evidence of weight-based discrimination at every stage of employment, from the hiring

decision through wage-setting and promotion. Roehling (1999) found that weight

explains a greater proportion of the variance in hiring decisions than even race or gender.

A recent reflection of such sentiment is found in the 2003 Gallup Consumption Habits




                                            17
Survey, in which 20 percent of respondents answered that they would be less likely to

hire a job applicant if they learned that the applicant was overweight (Gallup, 2003).

    In an attempt to determine whether weight is correlated with labor market outcomes

for white females as a result of workplace discrimination, we use a question that was

asked of a subset of the WES sample: whether at their current or most recent job they

were discriminated against because of their weight.6 Such discrimination is reported by

3.7 percent of overweight and obese white respondents and 1.6 percent of overweight and

obese African-American respondents, a difference that is significant at the ten percent

level.7 This is consistent with the hypothesis that the difference between white and

African-American females in the earlier results is due to differential weight-based

employment discrimination.

    Strauss and Pollack (2003) find in a sample of adolescents that being overweight is

associated with a smaller social network of friends among white females but not African-

American females. If this is also true for adult women, and a network of friends fosters

employment, then this may also help explain the pattern of results across race.

    The sociological literature offers another possible explanation for the differences in

results between whites and African Americans: obesity has a more adverse impact on the

self-esteem of white females than on that of black females, who report perceiving higher

weight as a signal of power and stability (Stearns, 1997). Averett and Korenman (1999)

find that obesity is associated with lower self-esteem among white females, but not black

6
  For current workers, the wording of this wave 4 question is: “On your current main job, have you been
discriminated against because your weight was too high or too low?” For non-workers, the question was
worded: “On your most recent job, were you discriminated against because your weight was too high or too
low?”
7
  If we limit our analysis to obese respondents, weight-based discrimination is reported by 5.0 percent of
whites and 2.4 percent of African-Americans. The sample sizes are small (199 obese white and 292 obese
African-American respondents), so although the point estimate of the difference in means is larger, the
difference is only significant at the 12 percent level.


                                                   18
females, but they also find that controlling for differences in self-esteem does not explain

differences across race in the relationship between obesity and wages. Future research

should pursue explanations for such dramatic differences across race in the correlation

between weight and labor market outcomes.

          Appendix: Correcting for Reporting Error in Weight and Height

       This appendix assesses the extent of reporting error in weight and height in the

WES, and corrects for it. We use data on measured height and weight from a health

supplement to waves 3 and 4 in which respondents were weighed and measured at a

clinic or in their home by trained nurses. Only a subset of WES respondents (N=299)

participated in this supplement, so it is not possible to use measured weight for all

respondents. We use measured height and weight for the health supplement respondents

as validation data for the heights and weights self-reported by all respondents.

       Wave 3 interviews concluded in January 2000 and wave 4 interviews began in

October 2001. The measurements of weight and height took place between June 2000

and May 2001. A limitation of the data is that the measurements did not take place on

the same day as the interview; that would be ideal because the measurement would reflect

the true value of weight at the time weight was self-reported. We compare measurements

taken during calendar year 2000 with wave 3 self-reports, and measurements taken

during calendar year 2001 with wave 4 self-reports.

       A comparison of measured and self-reported weight among participants in the

WES health supplement suggests that self-reports of weight likely contain error. The

exact degree of reporting error cannot be determined, because the weight measurement

and self-report did not occur on the same day, but large differences between the two

measures are likely due to reporting error. The correlation between measured weight and

self-reported weight is .90, and the correlation between measured height and self-reported

height is .91. On average, WES respondents who participated in the health supplement

underreported their weight by 9.9 pounds or 4.4 percent. There is no clear pattern of



                                             20
misreporting of weight by actual weight; underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and

obese women all on average underreport their weight by roughly ten pounds. This is in

contrast to previous studies, e.g. Rowland (1989), which have found in nationally

representative samples that the degree of misreporting rises with actual weight.

        We correct for reporting error using the method of Lee and Sepanski (1995) and

Bound et al. (2002). Specifically, measured weight (height) was regressed on actual

weight (height) for the participants in the health supplement.8 Based on the results of a

Chow test, the validation regression for weight was estimated separately for white and

African-American respondents, and the validation regression for height was estimated for

whites and African-Americans pooled. Reported values were strong predictors of

measured values; the R2 was .88 in the weight regression for whites, .77 in the weight

regression for African-Americans, and .84 in the height regression for both groups

pooled. Self-reported height and weight for all WES respondents are then multiplied by

the coefficients on the reported values and the intercept is added, using the weight

coefficient estimated using the appropriate race group. The fitted values of weight in

pounds, height in inches, and BMI, corrected for reporting error, are used throughout the

paper. All of the models reported have also been estimated using self-reported weight in

pounds and BMI, with very similar results.

        Appendix Table 1 lists the mean values of the weight and height variables both

before and after the correction for reporting error. On average, the corrected weight is

considerably higher than self-reported weight; this causes large changes in the

percentages of respondents who fall into certain clinical weight classifications. For

8
  The reported value was the only regressor used in the weight and height regressions. We experimented
with including measures of age, education, and reported value squared, but the coefficients were not
statistically significant.


                                                   21
whites, the average corrected weight is roughly twelve pounds greater than the average

self-reported weight, while for African-Americans the average corrected weight is eight

pounds higher than the average self-reported weight. The fraction of respondents who

are classified as clinically underweight or healthy weight falls dramatically after the

correction. There is little change in the percent of respondents classified as overweight,

but there is a large increase in the percent classified as obese; an extra 13 percent of

whites and an extra 14 percent of the African-Americans are newly classified as obese

after the correction for reporting error. The means of reported and measured height are

very similar; previous studies also found that self-reported and measured height are quite

similar (Rowland, 1989).

Notes:
   1) In rows 1 and 2, which reflect logit regressions, the elasticity of outcomes with
       respect to weight is calculated as: ε = [1−Λ( X ' β )]*W βW where X is the vector
      of regressors, β is the vector of coefficients, W is the average weight in the
      sample, and βW is the coefficient on weight.
   2) In rows 3 and 6, which reflect regressions in which the dependent variable has
      been transformed by the natural logarithm, the elasticity is calculated as ε = W βW .
   3) In rows 4 and 5, which reflect regressions in which the dependent variable is a
      percentage that has been logit transformed, the elasticity of outcomes with respect
      to weight is calculated as: ε = (1− Y )W βW where Y is the average outcome of
       interest in the sample,W is the average weight in the sample, and βW is the
       coefficient on weight.

  Notes:
     1) Respondents report their height and weight; self-reported BMI and clinical weight
         classifications are derived from those reports.
     2) Correction method described in Appendix 1.
     3) This sample consists of only the subset of WES respondents whose weight and
         height were measured. In contrast, the summary statistics in Tables 1A and 1B
         reflect the entire sample of WES respondents.
