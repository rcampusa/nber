Health and Nutrition in the Preindustrial Era:
Insights from a Millennium of Average Heights in Northern Europe

                                               ABSTRACT


        This essay places the debate over human welfare during industrialization in the context of very
long-term economic developments by examining an important aspect of living standards--health and
nutrition--since the Middle Ages. I use average stature determined from military records along with a
neglected source, skeletal data. Average heights fell from an average of 173.4 centimeters in the early
Middle Ages to a low of 165.8 centimeters during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This decline
of 7.6 centimeters exceeds by a factor of two any downturns found during industrialization in several
countries that have been studied. Moreover, recovery to levels achieved in the early Middle Ages was
not attained until the early twentieth century. The paper links the decline in average height to climate
deterioration; growing inequality; urbanization and the expansion of trade and commerce, which
facilitated the spread of diseases; the global spread of diseases associated with European expansion and
colonization; and conflicts or wars over state building or religion. Because it is reasonable to believe that
greater exposure to pathogens accompanied urbanization and industrialization, and there is evidence of
climate moderation, increasing efficiency in agriculture and greater inter-regional and international trade
in foodstuffs, it is plausible to link height gains that began in the eighteenth century with dietary
improvements.

         For over half a century, quantitative economic historians have pondered the fates

of workers and other segments the population during the industrial revolutions of the

nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. While everyone agrees that the standard of

living eventually improved, much discussion has focused on how various groups fared

during the decades that industrialization actually unfolded. Scholars of the subject have

asked who gained and who lost in the process (and why), and whether industrialization

was accompanied by events that adversely affected health and human welfare. In the

case of England, debate has been particularly lively and factions have coalesced into

camps of optimists and pessimists. Controversy persists because evidence about the past

is often meager and, in any event, health and human welfare are complex and difficult to

assess under the best circumstances of data availability (for a discussion of issues, see

Engerman, 1997).

         This paper places the debate over human welfare during industrialization in the

context of very long-term economic developments by examining an important aspect of

living standards--health and nutrition--since the Middle Ages. I use average stature

determined from military records along with a neglected source, skeletal data.1

Considering the industrial period as a backdrop for comparative study, I describe the U-

shape that average heights took over the past millennium in northern Europe and suggest

a research agenda for analyzing this remarkable time trend in health and nutrition.2



I.       Background

1
 Average heights calculated from skeletal data have long been used by physical anthropologists but little
used by other social scientists. For a study of England oriented toward medical historians, see Stephen
Kunitz (1987).




                                                     1
        Although lacking survey results on the subject, I suspect that few scholars would

challenge whether the substantial resources allocated to the standard of living debate have

been worthwhile investments as a whole. No doubt, many would object to some books or

papers, but all would recognize that industrialization has been the biggest news of the

past two centuries on the economic front. Unquestionably, industrialization transformed

social and economic life, and even poor groups within modern industrial countries have

greater access to most types of material goods and live longer lives than the upper classes

in the pre-industrial era. Study of industrialization is also warranted for insights that may

help guide developing countries now undergoing the process.

        Considerable devotion to the subject of welfare during industrialization is

justified, but the neglect of the preindustrial era is curious. The lack of attention cannot

be explained by a supposition that industrialization was the only major dynamic feature

of social and economic life over the past several millennia. Earlier transformations were

arguably on par if not more significant, including the shift from foraging to farming, the

rise of cities, and European expansion and colonization that began in the 1400s.

        The neglect might be explained by temporal distance from the present, a forceful

point among those scholars who believe that modern policy implications should flow

from the work of most if not all economists, including economic historians. People of

this persuasion may ask what could possibly be learned about problems in the modern

world by studying the preindustrial era. In reply, one might observe that the preindustrial

world of the past is relevant because parts of today’s developing regions approximate

preindustrial conditions of the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries. More importantly,

                                                   2
study of preindustrial economies is justifiable as a form of basic research. All social

scientists understand the value of large, diverse samples for generalizing about human

behavior, and the past is certainly diverse. In any event, economic historians, and

historians, are seldom beholden to arguments that research must demonstrate immediate

applications. Many are content in viewing research purely as consumption, or satisfying

desires of intellectual curiosity.

        On a practical level, data availability is a problem, at least for the type of

monetary measures that economists are accustomed to using, such as real GDP, real

wages, or wealth. While it is certainly not true that abundant data exist for the taking, it

is also not true that evidence is completely lacking. Over the years I have been impressed

by the ingenuity of historians and economists in developing new data resources, a record

that leads one to doubt whether most useful sources have been exploited. Recently, the

frontiers of research were extended backward in time and over space, at least in the

dimension of wages and prices (Allen, 1998).

        Finally, new data sources and methods have been developed for assessing human

welfare. Speaking metaphorically, one may think of the history of human welfare in a

country or region as a long sausage or salami; each slice represents a year (or other time

unit) of social performance that can be divided into broad categories of health, material

goods, and psychological elements, which may have spiritual or metaphysical

components. The example of the new anthropometric history shows that a significant

portion of the health component is measurable from military records and other sources of

height data (Steckel, 1998). Skeletal evidence greatly extends backward in time the

portion of the salami that is visible, broadens it to include women and children, and




                                               3
unlike stature alone, includes information on degenerative health processes associated

with hard work and aging. This paper makes a small down payment on the larger

research agenda of integrating the analysis of preindustrial height data from skeletal

records and military sources into the literature of economic history.



II.    Height patterns during industrialization

Before attempting to study human health and nutrition in preindustrial times, it is

necessary to determine when the industrial period began. Although some scholars debate

whether ”revolution” should be appended to “industrial” in describing the process, the

changes were revolutionary from the perspective of several centuries of history. Because

it was a complex phenomenon involving many dimensions of change that occurred at

different rates in various countries, its chronological dates are inevitably fuzzy. Rostow’s

stages of economic growth are now viewed as inordinately rigid, but economic historians

agree that England was the first industrial country and that the process spread from west

to east across Europe. It is useful to identify various steps or stages of the general

process based on the extent of mechanization, the rate of economic growth, percent of the

labor force involved in agriculture, and the amount of technological change. In the early

industrial period, the transition to a modern industrial economy began. Industrialization

and modernization spread geographically and diversified in the middle period, and

became widespread and dominant in the late industrial phase. Notably, a few countries

do not fit the classical mold of industrial change. Because they retained large agricultural

sectors or experienced little mechanization and developed few factories, the term

“modernization” may be more appropriate in describing their experiences. Australia, for




                                              4
example, relied extensively on agriculture and mining, while the Netherlands (lacking

coal and waterpower), developed banking, shipping, and services.

       Table 1 depicts average heights and other information during early, middle and

late stages of industrialization in 8 countries whose adult male heights were studied in

Steckel and Floud (eds.), Health and Welfare during Industrialization. In examining the

table, one is struck by the diversity of experience across countries in heights, and in life

expectancy and the percent urban. Average heights varied by over 15 centimeters within

each phase, while the percent urban differed by as much as 30 percentage points in the

early phase (the Netherlands versus the United States) and nearly 50 points in the late

phase (Japan versus Sweden). While all life expectancies were somewhat compressed in

the preindustrial phase, differing by less than 13 years (Australia versus the UK), by the

late phase Australia had leaped ahead of the pack (65.4 years) while Japan lagged nearly

20 years behind (47 years).

       Height and life expectancy. In arguing for average height as a general welfare

measure, it is useful to consider its relationship to a more widely employed measure of

health--life expectancy at birth. The connection between average height and life

expectancy in a historical setting is most reliably calculated for the late industrial period,

when better estimates of life expectancy are available. Figure 1 shows the scatter

diagram for the US, UK, the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Germany, Japan, and

Australia. The estimated regression line is (t-values in parentheses):



               Height = 152.48 + 0.330 (Life Expectancy), N = 8, R2 = 0.40

                    (18.03)    (1.98)




                                               5
The average height of adult men increased by 0.33 centimeters for every year by which

life expectancy increased. The scatter diagram reveals that Japan is a substantial outlier,

and if this country is omitted, the R2 rises to 0.79 and the regression coefficient is

statistically significant at 0.01. Japan’s stature was much too low, given its life

expectancy, probably because the time frames of the two measures are different.

Conditions in the 1930s and early 1940s, when the young adults of mid-century were

growing children, were likely worse than those forming the basis for life expectancy in

1950, a few years following the end of World War II. It is also possible that the height-

life expectancy relationship is somewhat non-linear at low levels of health.

       Height and urbanization. Table 1 shows that average male height and per cent

urban (towns or cities of 2,500 population or more) varied widely across the countries

during the middle phase of industrialization, a period of intense change. With regard to

stature, the extremes were established by the Australians (172 cm) and the Japanese, who

fell more than 13 cm behind. In urban development, the Swedes had the smallest share

living in towns or cities (only 17.2%) while the Japanese were the most urban (60%).

       It was not accidental that the Japanese were both the shortest and the most urban.

In an era before widespread, effective investments in public health and personal hygiene,

the congestion and turnover associated with urban living increased the chances of

exposure to pathogens. Other features detrimental to health are often found in cities, such

as a large number of poor people who lacked access to food, clothing and shelter that

would have increased resistance to disease.




                                               6
       The scatter diagram in Figure 2 confirms the adverse effect of urbanization on

health. The estimated regression equation is (t-values in parentheses):



                 Height = 174.07 – 0.153 (Per cent Urban), N = 8, R2 = 0.27

                      (40.69) (-1.47)



For every percentage point increase in the degree of urbanization, average male height

fell by about 0.15 centimeters. This magnitude is significant in a practical sense because

the transition from a low (say, 20%) level of urbanization to a moderately high level (say

50%) would have decreased average height by 4.5 centimeters. The notable outlier to the

inverse relationship was Australia, which had the tallest population and the second

highest level of urbanization. If Australia is dropped from the regression, the t-value

rises to –2.60, R2 increases to 0.57, and the regression coefficient increases (in absolute

value) by 50%.

       What factors explain the exceptional nature of health and urbanization in

Australia? One was the relative geographic isolation of the country from major disease

currents that affected cities in Europe and in North American. Another is the remoteness

of the major cities within Australia from each other, which helped to reduce the spread of

infectious disease. Moreover, Australia’s industrialization (or modernization) occurred

late enough to benefit from significant investments in public health. This last feature

distinguishes Australia from Japan, which was also a late industrializer within this group.

       Temporal patterns. Additional factors that influenced heights during

industrialization, and possibly in the preindustrial period, can be discerned from study of




                                              7
temporal patterns within countries. The patterns can be placed into three categories of (a)

important declines in health during a large phase of industrialization; (b) sustained, but

not necessarily monotonic, improvement; and (c) a mixture that featured a series of short

cycles.

          Figures 3 and 4 show that the US and the UK fit the first pattern. Americans were

very tall by global standards in the early nineteenth century as a result of their rich and

varied diets, low population density, and relative equality of wealth. Between 1830 and

roughly 1880, however, the average height of American men fell by about 3 centimeters,

a reversal that was not offset until the 1920s. Consistent with this height decline, life

expectancies tabulated from genealogies also show a deterioration near the middle of the

century (Pope 1992). Researchers in the field have suggested numerous possible causal

factors for the decline, including the spread of disease affiliated with the development of

railroads, canals, and steamboats (for discussions see Steckel, 1995 and Komlos, 1998).

Also mentioned are higher food prices; growing inequality, the emergence of business

cycles that led to malnutrition during contractions, urbanization, and the rise of public

schools that exposed children to major diseases. Unfortunately, research has not

advanced to the point of assigning plausible weights to these factors.

          Although health deterioration also occurred in Britain during the early-mid

nineteenth century, the timing is probably more coincidental than emblematic of similar

causal factors at work. While it is possible that growing trade and commerce spread

disease, as in the United States, it is more likely that a major culprit was rapid

urbanization and associated increased in exposure to diseases (Floud and Harris, 1997).

This conclusion is reached by noting that urban born men were substantially shorter than




                                               8
the rural born, and between the periods of 1800-1830 and 1830–1870 the share of the

British population living in urban areas leaped from 38.7 to 54.1%.

       Sweden realized the most sustained increase in health during the most intense

period of industrialization (late nineteenth century), but France, the Netherlands, and

Japan also posted significant, if somewhat interrupted, gains. Figure 5 shows that average

adult male heights in Sweden rose from 168 to 172.5 centimeters between 1860 and

1900. The only downturn was the small reversal that occurred during the crop failures of

the late 1860s, which had little to do with industrialization (Sandberg and Steckel, 1997).

Paralleling the growth in stature were declines in childhood mortality rates of roughly

50%. It is notable that Sweden had the least urbanized population among the eight

countries studied, and it also benefited from public health measures such as vaccination,

and from relatively low food prices created by the spread of potato cultivation and

imports of food from America.

       Most noticeable in the Dutch experience (Figure 6) was the large pre-industrial

height decline that was caused in part by rising food prices and stagnating nominal wages

(i.e. a decline in purchasing power). This trend was not reversed until the conscription

years of the late 1850s (birth years of the late 1830s). Thereafter, average heights

increased more or less continuously into the twentieth century with the exception of the

reversal and stagnation of those measured from the late 1880s through the late 1890s.

The latter was associated with the income decline of the 1860s and the economic

depression of the 1870s (Drukker and Tassenaar, 1997).

       The French experience (Figure 7) of the late nineteenth century is similar to that

of the Netherlands. On the eve of industrialization, both populations attained about 164




                                             9
centimeters and both realized slow and steady growth in heights with the exception of the

slight reversal and stagnation for those measured in the last decade of the century. The

steady advance in heights was accompanied by steady progress in economic measured

such as GDP per capita and by life expectancy. Like the Netherlands, France also

experienced a decline in economic conditions that affected average heights; a downturn

in real wages in the early 1860s was followed by a decade and a half of stagnation (Weir,

1997).

         Figure 8 shows that Japan opened the industrial era at the turn of the twentieth

century with the smallest stature (about 157 centimeters) of any industrializing country.

Hampered by a low protein diet, thereafter progress was slow and significantly correlated

with per capita GDP but adversely affected by economic policy that diverted resources to

the military (Honda, 1997). Its high level of urbanization and modest investments in

public health were obstacles to human health and physical growth. Economic stagnation

in the 1920s and the depression of the 1930s (which was rather mild in Japan) brought the

modest gains in height to a halt in the mid 1930s.

         Germany (Figure 9) realized gains in health during industrialization, but progress

was choppy, or otherwise interrupted by relatively brief cycles in height (Twarog, 1997).

Adult males reached about 163.5 centimeters (average of rural and urban) in the province

of Württemberg on the eve of industrialization, which began in the 1860s. A small spurt

in average heights occurred during the 1870s, followed by decline and stagnation in the

1880s. This temporal pattern was related to the financial crash of 1873 and the

subsequent depression that lasted into the early 1890s. Occupational differences in

stature indicate that the professional classes were protected during the early phases of the




                                              10
economic depression and the loss in health was concentrated among the middle and lower

classes. Thus, growing inequality played an important role in Germany’s health trends

during industrialization.

       Figure 10 shows two features distinguish the Australian experience: the tall

stature (about 172.5 centimeters) on the eve of modernization that was followed by a

large cycle in heights whereby the average height of the mid 1870s was not attained again

until the second decade of the twentieth century (Whitwell et. al., 1997). The tall stature

is undoubtedly related to an inexpensive but diverse diet that was also rich in protein, a

phenomenon supporting the view that Australia was a workingman’s paradise. Even

though the share living in urban areas was relatively high (about 50%), overall population

density was low and the country and its major cities were relatively isolated, which

hampered the spread of communicable diseases.

       But some troubles occurred even in these relatively idyllic circumstances. The

height downturn of the 1880s and 1980s was the result of a double whammy. The share

living in urban areas was already high (43% in 1881) and then jumped eight percentage

points in the decade following. A sanitary crisis followed and typhoid fever, which

disproportionately affected the young, was epidemic in the cities. Although the pace of

urbanization fell considerably during the 1890s, GDP declined and remained relatively

low for a decade, thereby dampening any hopes for quick recovery in heights and health.

       Generalizations. Study of height and mortality patterns in counties diverse by

time period of industrialization and by environmental factors indicates that a combination

of general tendencies and idiosyncratic factors affected health during the industrial

revolutions of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In an era when public health




                                             11
policies were often lacking or meagerly enlightened by theories of disease causation,

urbanization was a widespread culprit in ill health within countries studied in Europe and

in the Pacific, and within the US. Height was inversely correlated with degree of

urbanization across countries, and rising urbanization led to health deterioration,

especially in England, Australia, and Japan.

       Major business cycles also affected heights and health. France, the Netherlands,

Germany, and Australia were victims of major downturns. Changing economic

opportunities, in the form of growing inequality, adversely affected heights in Germany

and the US.

       Diets were important for health and human growth. Countries with the tallest

men (Australia and the US) had excellent access to a variety of foods, including several

rich sources of protein. Food was expensive and the diet was low in protein in the

country with the smallest stature (Japan).

       Lastly, public health policy (or lack thereof) was also important for heights.

Countries that industrialized early, such as the US and the UK suffered the most, in part

because the adverse effects of trade and population concentrations on health could not be

offset by health policies informed by reliable theories of disease causation. Merely

arriving late on the scene was no guarantee of protection against the byproducts of

industrialization, however, as shown by the Japanese case where resources that could

have been used for public health and human growth were diverted to the military.




                                               12
III. Preindustrial heights

         Among the 8 countries studied in Health and Welfare during Industrialization, all

but Germany have some military height data that cover small portions of the preindustrial

era. In the absence of detailed information, economic historians may tend to view the

preindustrial world as a vague but homogeneous lump defined by its heavy reliance on

agriculture, the preponderance of home manufacturing, and antiquated methods of

production. Table 1 shows, however, that on the eve of industrialization, average heights

ranged widely from 155 centimeters in Japan to approximately 173 in the United States

and Australia. Most European countries clustered near 164 or 165 centimeters, but the

Swedes reached 168.

         In all but the United States, the preindustrial populations were also smaller, often

by several centimeters depending upon the exact years of the comparisons. Considering

the preindustrial and middle phase, for example, the height differences shown in Table 1

were about 2 centimeters in France, roughly 4 centimeters in Japan, the Netherlands and

Sweden, and about 5 centimeters in Britain (but note that average heights declined

significantly in Britain for cohorts born in the 1840s and early 1850s). Average heights

in the US were about 3 centimeters lower in the middle compared with preindustrial

times.

         What were the important socioeconomic conditions affecting preindustrial

heights? It would seem appropriate to begin with mechanisms that were powerful in

explaining height differences during industrialization—urbanization and abundant access

to land. The two countries with the tallest people (Australia and the US) score well on




                                              13
the latter category, and Sweden was the tallest and least congested of the European

countries. Access to land tended to ameliorated poverty, helped promote dietary diversity

and reduced the spread of disease by lowering population density. Countries with the

shortest populations were relatively urban, a feature long known to have impaired health.

Australians were tall despite a large (30%) urban population, likely because the cities

were isolated from each other and from much of the rest of the world.

         If low urbanization and low population density were good for health, it is a fair

question to ask why so many of the preindustrial populations were so short, compared

with their industrial counterparts. After all, the adverse factors of urbanization and

population density tended to increase with industrialization. With the exception of the

US and Britain in the late industrial phase, there must have been something good for

health about industrialization that more than offset the features that were bad.

         Extending the Record. Before attempting to generalize, or even beginning to

formulate a research agenda on the possible causes of small stature in the preindustrial

era, it is essential to inspect additional evidence. Figures 3-10 make clear that the time

span available for study of preindustrial heights from military records is rather short (or

nonexistent) in all countries.3 Skeletal data, in which stature is inferred from long bone

(femur) lengths, provide some information on the more distant past.4 Before examining

the results, it is worth noting that biases of unknown magnitudes can affect average

heights calculated from skeletal data. The excavated burials may not reflect the once-


3
  Some 17th century military records in France contain measurements of soldiers, which are useful for
studying pre-industrial trends in heights. Komlos, Hau and Bourguinat (2001) report an upward trend (with
moderate fluctuations) in average height for birth cohorts of the late 17th century to the mid 18th century.
Further search efforts might reveal additional preindustrial height records for other countries.
4
  On average, approximately 26 per cent of a person’s height is contained in the thigh, as expressed in the
femur bone. The most widely used formula for converting femur length into height was developed by
Trotter and Gleser (1952).


                                                     14
living population if burials were geographically dispersed, excavation was incomplete or

quality of preservation of the bones was poor. Therefore, in this line of work it will be

useful to compare results from a particular site with those from sites where these

problems are thought to be minimal.

       Table 2 gives details from individual studies found in a search of the literature in

physical anthropology from sources easily accessible in the United States. Although

some results were available for other parts of Europe, only northern Europe had studies

that span the entire period from the early Middle Ages to the present. My first effort

leaves a gap for the 15th and 16th centuries, which additional search may fill.

       Table 3 summarizes results by era for those studies that give evidence for time

periods as small as two or three centuries. Studies reporting results for burials during

“Medieval Era” or the “Middle Ages” are lumped together in the middle of the table. It is

remarkable if not stunning that the average heights during the early and late Middle Ages

exceeded those observed for the eve of industrialization by several centimeters. While

one should always devote some attention to the issues of representativeness and sampling

in skeletal data, the large number of studies covering several northern countries suggests

that the results cannot be dismissed as a statistical fluke or aberration. It is conceivable

that all of the estimated heights for the Middle Ages were biased upward by some as yet

undiscovered process of selection, but one would then wonder why that selection process

ceased to be a factor in the centuries immediately prior to industrialization.

       Generalizing about pre-industrial height trends will be difficult without more

evidence for the 15th through the 18th centuries. It seems reasonable to suggest, at least

tentatively, that net nutritional conditions of the past millennium reached a low point in




                                              15
Europe prior to the onset of industrialization. Between the Middle Ages and the

twentieth century, heights were U-shaped with a minimum attained sometime between

1450 and 1750, when historical heights become widely available from military records.

The onset of the decline (and ultimately its causes) can be established only by a search

for more evidence from published or unpublished sources.5

         Taking the evidence at face value indicates that average heights fell from an

average of 173.4 centimeters in the early Middle Ages to a low of 165.8 centimeters

during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This decline of 7.6 centimeters exceeds

by a factor of two any fluctuations observed during industrialization. Recovery to levels

achieved a millennium ago was not attained until the early twentieth century. Both the

extraordinary level relative to recent times, and the U-shaped time trend are remarkable

phenomena worthy of considerable study.

         Some people may claim that genetic factors are responsible for the tall statures

observed during the Middle Ages, pointing to the fact that northern Europeans are taller,

even today, than those from more southern European countries (Schmidt, Jorgensen and

Michaelsen, 1995). But the southern Europeans of the modern period, who tend to be

poorer, are catching up, and in any event, studies of children around the globe indicate

that children who grow up under similarly good environmental conditions have about the

same heights (Malcolm, 1974; Martorell and Habicht, 1986). If genetic factors were

relevant, presumably they had little or no effect on the trend within areas surrounded by




5
  Along with 3 co-investigators, I am planning a research project to undertake an extensive project that will
collect and analyze data from skeletons covering the last 10 millennia in Europe. The effort will obtain not
just heights (from femur lengths) but also information on degenerative joint disease, dental decay, anemia,
and other skeletal indicators of chronic biological stress.


                                                     16
the North Sea and the Baltic. Thus, I seek environmental explanations for northern

Europe’s U-shaped trend in stature.

       In suggesting candidates for further study, it is relevant to recall that average

height measures a population’s history of net nutrition—diet minus claims on the diet

made by work and by disease. Urbanization and growing population density, which

occurred during industrialization, increased exposure to disease. Could the diet have

been poorer and work more arduous in preindustrial times, by enough to offset the

benefits of lower population density? And if the diet was poorer and work was more

arduous, why was net nutrition so good before the sixteenth century?

       The data at hand confront conventional wisdom about changes in living standards

since the Middle Ages, and lead one to ask: Why did net nutrition decline sometime

between the Middle Ages and the pre-industrial period? Why did heights generally

improve during the nineteenth century, albeit with interruptions in some countries, when

some factors adverse to heights (urbanization, inequality and business cycles) were

getting worse?

       As I do not have convincing answers to these questions, I look forward to

additional research. It seems to me, however, that the millennium long U-shape of

average stature in northern Europe might have been connected with six major

phenomena: climate change, growing inequality in real incomes after 1500, urbanization

and growth of trade that spread diseases, wars of state building, religious conflicts, and

the global spread of new varieties of disease associated with European expansion and

colonization. We are faced, then, not with a dearth of plausible explanations but rather




                                             17
measuring their impacts on health and weeding out influences among those that were

unimportant.

         Possible causes of good net nutrition during the Middle Ages. At the outset, it is

useful to consider why average heights were surprisingly large during the Middle Ages.

One might debate the representativeness of the results, something that is useful more

generally of findings so at odds with preconceptions. Because numerous skeletal studies

are essentially uniform in reporting statures in the Middle Ages that were tall by

standards of the late nineteenth century, however, it seems prudent to accept them at face

value (at least provisionally) and move to possible explanations.6

         According to the data at hand, northern European heights did not consistently

exceed those of 800-1300AD until the early twentieth century. One important factor in

this remarkable may have been climate. Agriculture during the period from about 900 to

1300AD benefited from what climate historians call the “Medieval Warm Period” (see

Figure 11). Based on ice cores, tree rings and other sources, climate historians believe

that temperatures during this era were as much as 2-3 degrees (centigrade) warmer than a

few centuries later, and 0.7 to 1.0 degrees above 20th century averages (see Fagan, 2000).

At the beginning of this era, the Vikings settled Iceland and later Greenland. This

temperature change may not appear to be significant, but it was enough to extend the

growing season by 3-4 weeks in many settled regions of northern Europe. The weather

was sufficiently warm that commercial vineyards were viable 300 to 500 kilometers north

of their range in the 20th century. Moreover, it allowed cultivation of previously


6
 This is not the first time that anthropometric historians have found surprising if not startling results. The
very small statures of slave children followed by remarkable catch-up growth, the American height decline
during the mid-nineteenth century, and the very tall statures of the equestrian Plains tribes in the United
States are three additional examples.


                                                      18
unavailable land at higher elevations. Therefore a population that was probably smaller

relative to later eras, quite possibly had a portfolio of better land from which to choose in

producing crops. A result would have been more agricultural output (at the same or less

work effort) compared with the centuries immediately following the Middle Ages.

       It is well known that economic isolation, in the form of little trade beyond local

interaction, also characterized life during the Middle Ages, at least relative to later

centuries when regional commodity markets developed significantly. Anthropometric

historians have noted the benefits to health and average heights of geographic isolation,

low population density, or lack of commercial development for outlying areas within

Sweden, Austria-Hungary, Japan, Ireland, and the United States (Sandberg and Steckel,

1987; Komlos, 1989; Shay, 1986; Margo and Steckel, 1982, 1992; Nicholas and Steckel,

1997; Cuff, 1998). The protective effect of isolation, in the era before effective public

health, probably operated through insulation from communicable diseases. In this regard,

it is notable that the bubonic plague made its dramatic appearance in the significant

revival of trade during the late Middle Ages.

       Urban areas were bad for health, as established from their high mortality rates and

the small statures of those who resided in such places for a significant portion of their

childhood growing years. To my knowledge, this demographic phenomenon was found

in all areas of the world until the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries, when public

health measures and improvements in personal hygiene significantly reduced exposure to

pathogens. Moderately large cities were absent from northern Europe until the late

Middle Ages (for discussions of urban growth see De Vries, 1984; Hohenberg and Lees,

1985). As late as the end of the 13th century, significant urbanization was confined




                                              19
mainly to southern Europe, in northern Italian towns such as Milan, Florence, Venice and

Genoa, each of which probably exceeded 100,000 in population. At this time, Paris was

the only city in northern Europe that may have fallen into this category. The southern

Low Countries were moderately urbanized by the late Middle Ages (the 14th century), but

the largest city, Ghent, probably had no more than 50,000 inhabitants, while London and

Cologne held fewer than 40,000 people at this time. Therefore, the overwhelmingly rural

distribution of the population was an asset for health.

       Possible factors in the health decline. A cooling trend began around 1200 and by

the 14th century, weather related events began to cause havoc in northern Europe (Fagan,

2000). By the late 14th century the Vikings had abandoned Greenland and in the next

century England no longer cultivated wine. By 1600, when the coldest two centuries of

the Little Ice Age began, pack ice surrounded Iceland for much of the year, the Thames

River often froze during the winter, glaciers advanced significantly in the Alps, and vast

schools of cod had long since left European waters for warmer temperatures of the

western Atlantic. The climate change was likely to have imposed greater economic and

health costs on northern Europe where food production existed under weather conditions

that were closer to the margin.

       Important for agricultural production and health, the climate change was irregular.

Imbedded within the general cooling period of 500-600 years were numerous seesaws of

15 to 40 years duration, several of which are visible in Figure 11. The changing weather

patterns made it difficult for individuals alive at the time to identify true long-term trends,

which were noticeable only with intergenerational perspective. The lack of knowledge

about actual trends postponed adaptations to the cooling climate, and during temporary




                                              20
reversals of cooling, encouraged investments in ways of farming and living that later

proved unsuccessful.

          Urbanization and growth of trade that began in the late Middle Ages gathered

steam in the 16th and 17th centuries. In northern Europe, there was only one city of

100,000 or more people in 1500 (De Vries, 1984, 73). By 1600 the number of people

living in such places had quadrupled, and within another century it had tripled again. As

height studies for the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries show, large cities

were particularly hazardous for health, acting as reservoirs for the spread of

communicable diseases (Steckel and Floud, 1997, chapter 11). Therefore, it would not be

surprising if urbanization following the Middle Ages contributed to an overall decline in

health.

          The spread of disease that began with revival of trade and urbanization were

reinforced by another source of pathogens that began in the late 1400s, and later

intensified: global exploration and trade. The voyages of Columbus and Vasco da Gama

were merely the first of thousands by which Europeans acquired global information that

was used to build and maintain colonial empires. Within 300 years, Europeans had

mapped most of the globe and established numerous colonies or trading centers on all

continents or islands significant for producing saleable products. Syphilis is only one of

numerous diseases that spread during this era. It is well known that the early stages of

globalization began in the late 1400s and eventually led to the world-wide diffusion of

many diseases into previously isolated regions or continents (Crosby, 1972, 1986).

          As a measure of net nutrition, average height is adept at measuring a population’s

consumption of basic necessities such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. In




                                              21
countries with high levels of per capita GDP, most people have enough of these to satisfy

basic needs. But in poor countries or among the poor in moderate-income countries,

large numbers of people are biologically stressed or deprived, which leads to stunting. In

addition to income, average height is therefore sensitive to the degree of inequality

(Steckel, 1983; 1995). It is difficult to acquire information about income or wealth

inequality in the distant past, but Hoffman et al. (2000) have been ingenuous in

assembling related information by using information on the prices of products heavily

consumed by the rich or by the poor. In their study of price patterns for staple foods and

fuels relative to the prices of luxury goods, such as servants, they find that real inequality

rose considerably during the 16th century and remained high until the 20th century. It

was during the era from 1500 to 1650, however, that the rich benefited most from soaring

land rents (a source of income for many of the well-off) while the poor faced higher

prices for food, housing and land. As far as Hoffman et al. can tell, this trend persisted

throughout most of Europe. Since the poor comprised a large segment of the population,

it is plausible to believe that growing inequality could have increased biological stress in

ways that reduced average heights in the centuries immediately following the Middle

Ages.

        Although state building could be credited, in many cases, with eventually

improving economic efficiency, the early stages of the process also absorbed resources,

cost human lives in conflict, and may have increased inequality. Someone might be able

to argue that religious wars and conflicts improved health when or shortly after they

occurred, but I find it difficult to imagine a mechanism. From the War of the Roses in

the late 15th century and the Reformation in the early 16th century, many parts of Europe




                                              22
were in sporadic and sometimes protracted conflict or turmoil until the conclusion of the

Napoleonic wars in 1815.

       It would be premature to attempt to identify an era that was the worst in the last

millennium for European health and nutrition, but the 17th century is a leading candidate.

Contributors to The General Crisis of the Seventeenth Century (Geoffrey Parker and

Lesley Smith, eds., 1997) focus on Europe but argue that the hardship probably spread

well-beyond this region. During this century numerous adverse forces acted together. It

was part of the coldest period of the Little Ice Age, and subsistence crises were

numerous. Religious turmoil was raging as signified by the Thirty Years War, and

political instability was marked by the English Civil War and by numerous peasant

uprisings. Economic inequality was intense as indicated by the rise in the price of

necessities relative to luxuries. Global colonization and the associated spread of diseases

were in full swing, as was a rapid increase in the number of large cities. It remains,

however, to connect these events to changes in average stature.

       Height Recovery. The forces that led to increasing average heights are difficult to

pinpoint without additional evidence on the times and places where increases occurred. It

is hard to see how industrialization could have reduced exposure to pathogens. Growing

population congestion, migration and trade associated with the process were likely to

have spread communicable diseases. If correct, one must look to other factors, such as

the retreat of the Little Ice Age that could have contributed to higher yields in agriculture.

There were also other sources of improving productivity in agriculture that began in the

18th century, such as new crops for forage and food, new crop rotations, enclosures, better

drainage systems, and mechanical equipment. McKeown (1983) has been the strongest




                                              23
advocate for better diets in improving health, and Fogel (1994) has used data on average

heights and agricultural production to buttress and quantify this point of view. Razzell

(1993) and Livi-Bacci (1983) have raised doubts or downplayed the contribution of

nutritional inputs to improving health, citing factors such as the independence of many

diseases from nutrition, human adaptability to food availability, smallpox inoculation,

and changing virulence of diseases.

         While more research should be done, connections have been made between rising

heights and improving diets in specific countries. Weir (1997) argues that growing meat

consumption contributed significantly to rising heights in nineteenth-century France.

Sandberg and Steckel (1980) suggest that diffusion of potatoes was important to

improvements in stature in Sweden in the early nineteenth century. More generally,

dietary improvement in nineteenth-century Europe was made possible by technical

improvements, such as light iron plows, steam threshers, mechanical harvesters, and

commercial fertilizers, as well as by agrarian reforms such as enclosures or emancipation

of serfs (Jones, 1968; Trow-Smith, 1967; Tracy, 1964). In the middle of the nineteenth

century, diets also received a boost from the free trade movement. This and greater speed

and lower transportation costs on long ocean voyages made it feasible to import

foodstuffs from Australia and from the land-rich countries in the Western Hemisphere,

principally the US, Canada, and Argentina (O’Rourke and Williamson, 1999). There is

also evidence that public health measures, though based on an inaccurate theory of

disease causation, were somewhat effective in reducing mortality rates in cities (Szreter,

1988).




                                            24
       An increase in average height may have been assisted by gains in consumption

per person that followed from reductions in conflicts that absorbed resources. Although

there were some revolutions and assorted small wars in Europe during the nineteenth

century, the Napoleonic Wars, which ended in 1815, was the last major conflict until

World War I. Some religious strife persisted, but in fewer places and at lower levels than

existed during the Reformation.



III.   Concluding Remarks

       While there are qualifications to be noted, the major empirical finding reported in

 this paper is the U-shaped pattern in average heights from the early Middle Ages

 through the late nineteenth century in northern Europe. After a long period of

 approximate stability at levels that were impressive even by standards of the late

 nineteenth century, heights declined sometime after the end of the Middle Ages.

 Plausibly, the height decline might be linked with climate change that accompanied the

 onset of the little ice age; growing inequality; urbanization; the global spread of diseases

 after the late 1400s; and conflicts associated with state building and religion. Because it

 is reasonable to believe that greater exposure to pathogens accompanied

 industrialization, and there is evidence of growing efficiency in agriculture and greater

 trade in foodstuffs, it is reasonable to link height gains during the early and mid

 nineteenth century with dietary improvements.

       Much research remains to be done on the exact time-path of average heights, and

substantially more information from skeletal evidence is available. A large research

program is now in the planning stages to gather this evidence and analyze it in light of




                                             25
related information on climate and of socioeconomic information from historical sources

and from the archaeological record.

       For over half a century economic historians have focused on the question of

whether there was immizeration during industrialization, a debate that has split

researchers into camps of optimists and pessimists. This is and continues to be an

interesting topic for research. But with the perspective of 1000 years of history, whatever

happened with regard to downturns in welfare during this era, they were likely small

compared to the vast changes that probably occurred since the early Middle Ages.

Therefore, economic historians who are inspired by variation and diversity in the

historical record would do well to consider this much broader time span of evidence.
