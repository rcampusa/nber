                  Union Effects: Wages, Turnover, and Job Training

      This study explores the existence of a net union premium and of the
 extent of rationing by quality of the resulting excess supply. The net
union premium was estimated by relating changes in wages to changes in
union status of the same worker in longitudinal panels (NLS and MID), and
by two   cross—section wage level regressions, a "prospective't and "retrospective"
which permit   more direct observation of selectivity in hiring. Over a
half of the cross—section differential of over 20% for the "same" (stan-
dardized) worker is a net union rent and much of the rest reflects a quality
adjustment in hiring, as measured by wages. This conclusion was less reliable
for older workers.

     Subsequent analysis explores the effects of successful union wage
pressure on: quit rates, fringe benefits, wage profiles, and training.
     The reduction in quit of union joiners depends on the size of the
net wage premium. Quit rate differentials are also positively related to
the gross, cross—section wage differentials within groups of workers,
classified by location and occupation, less so by industry.
     In Section 4, it is hypothesized that the imposition of larger fixed
labor costs (such as fringes) helps to deter employers from preferring
reductions in hours to reductions in men, and it helps to stabilize employ-
ment in the face of fluctuating demand, by a more frequent use of overtime
and of temporary layoffs in the union sector. This hypothesis links the
size of fringe benefits to the union wage gain. An analysis of firms in
70 industries confirms this link.
     Union pressure is exerted on the whole tenure profile of wages. The
explicit linking of wage levels to seniority reduces     incentives for worker
investment   in general (transferable) training. The total volume of training
is indeed reported to be smaller in union jobs, and this is consistent with
the flatter profile.

 Introduction




     Growing numbers of empirical studies confirm the prevalence of the following

 features which distinguish unionized from non—unionized labor markets:   (1) Higher

wages (2)A larger share of fringe benefits in total compensation (3) Lower quit

rates and lesser turnover, and (4) Flatter age—profiles of wages. These findings

appear to hold both in the aggregate, as when more unionized industries are

compared with less or non-unionized, and in micro-data where a variety of

variables are used to control for personal and, less frequently, firm characteris-

tics which might affect these differences.

     Traditionally, economists have been concerned with the relative wage and

much less the employment impact of unionism, just as they have been concerned

with price—quantity impacts of product monopolies. On the other hand, students

of industrial relations tend to emphasize non-wage aspects of unionism in the

work setting. Some time ago (1958) H.G. Lewis dichotomized aspects of unionism

into "monopolistic" and "competitive". In the first category are the imposition

of wages above competitive levels,either by union restriction of supply or by

threats of strikes implicit in collective bargaining. In the second are all those

activities of unions and work rules espoused by unions which need not be in-

consistent with competitive wage—setting. However, these "two faces" of unionism

do not correspond to wage and non—wage aspects of unionism: union induced non—

wage conditions may also impose higher costs on employers, inconsistent with competi-

tion. Conversely,unjon—nonunjon wage differentials need not reflect monopoly rents,

     *   The comments of H. Gregg Lewis have been most helpful. Thanks are due
         also to Reuben Oronau. Non Hashimoto, and John Pencavel. I am grate-
         ful to Robert Shakotko for helpful discussions and for the supply of

but may be merely compensatory, reflecting a faster and more regimented pace of

work (Duncan and Stafford, 1980) or higher quality of workers in unionized jobs.

       The wage—push hypothesis receives almost little or no attention in analyses of other

features of unionized labor markets listed in the first paragraph. Thus with "voice", as a

substitute for "exit", unionized workers quit less frequently than others. With

longer expected stay, the probability of receiving initially non-vested pensions

increases, hence larger pensions (a major part of fringe benefits) are demanded

by union workers. Other explanations of larger union fringes run      from union

democracy   which favors the older worker to union management of pension funds
as an   instrument of power. Finally, the flatter union wage profile is seen as
a   result of union egalitarian or bureaucratic compression of the wage structure.
       Although some or all of these hypotheses may be valid, it is   possthle   to
view   the union wage pressure as a source, if not necessarily an exclusive one

of all of the features I have enumerated. It is the purpose of the present study

to test this proposition empirically.


1. Union Wage Gains

       Before I proceed to explore the effects of union wage pressure on turnover, fringe

benefits, and wage profiles, it is necessary to establish that unions indeed

succeed in pushing their wages above competitive levels. A large literature

(see review by Parsley, 1980) answers this question positively, by observing

a differential in favor of union members after controlling for a large number

of worker personal characteristics in wage level regressions. However, un-

measured differences in labor quality may still be responsible for part or all

of the wage gap. The question is whether, indeed, the same worker, and not

merely his statistical surrogate, receives higher wages in union   than   in non-

union employment.
                                           —3—

        If the existence of a net union wage gain is confined in           this   fashion, we

 would expect its size to be smaller than the cross—sectionally observed union

 wage differential. This is because above equi1ibrimi wages imply queues on the

 supply side which must be rationed.1 Only in the case of probabilistic rationing

  ("first come, first served") and of rationing by       price    (union dues) or by discrimi-

 nation and nepotism would the observed net wage gain equal          the   gross wage diffe-
 rential observed in the cross—section.          But,     employers have incentives to

 reduce the increase in labor costs imposed by the union by systematic rationing,

 that is by hiring more productive workers from the queue. The increase in labor

 costs cannot, however, be completely offset in this fashion partly because the

 marginal cost of screening for quality is positive and because of technological

 constraints in the production function. Moreover, where unions have a voice in

 hiring, as in the closed shop and in union hiring halls, there are no obvious

 incentives for upgrading of labor quality, and rationing is largely probabilistic.

Rationing by price (in corrupt unions) or by discrimination and nepotism is out-

 lawed, in principle, but its existence cannot be excluded.

       The empirical analysis described below relies on observing wages received by

the same worker before and after his change of union status. This approach was

used most recently by Duncan and Stafford (1980)2and, thus far, most comprehensively

by Wesley Mellow (1981). Duncan and Stafford observed wage changes of a small

sample of union joiners between 1968 ar      1971 in the       Michigan Panel Survey of

Income Dynamics (MID),   and   Mellow in two one—year intervals (1974—75 and 1977—78)

in the much larger sample of the Current Population Survey (CPS) . Large data
sets, like the CPS sample, are needed to observe adequate numbers of workers
who    change union status, since their   proportion     is   quite small. An alternative
to using   the CPS is pooling of   the longitudinal     samples. Although the annually
surveyed samples in the MID and NLS     (National   Longitudinal Surveys) are much

1Theexistence of union induced queues has been inferred in an econometric analysis

                                               —4—



smaller than the CPS,     their   advantage lies in some of the information not available

in the CPS.   Especially   useful in this context is information on job mobility and

job tenure.

     In the work to be described I pooled the MID sample in order to relate annual

changes in wages of white men over the 10—year period 1968—1978 to changes in their

union status. Since the NLS panels contain information on union status            in the

years 1969 and 1971,1 I   utilized   this single interval for the same analysis on the

two NLS panels of young white men (who were 17-27 years old in 1969) and older

white men (who were 48—64 in 1969). The MID contains all ages, but as in the NLS,

I limited the sample to non—students and to a maximum age of 64. For (partial)

comparability with the NLS, I also stratified the MID panel into young (less than

30) and older (30—64) stthsamples.


  did not use the less adequate telephone survey of 1970 which also contained
questions on union status.
                                          —5.-




        The statistical analysis relies on wage functions, where the dependent

variable is the logarithm of hourly earnings, and the independent variables

are education (Ed), experience (x)      and its square (x2), length of job tenure

 (T)   and its square (T2), marital status (Mar), health status (Hith), local (Lun)
and national unemployment rate (Nun) .       These   are the "standardizing" variables.
The main focus is on the additional (dmmiy) variables tJij, where i and j index
the first and second period, and have values         (0,1), 0 denoting non—union status

and    1, union membership. Thus Uoo means non—union both years, U01 = union
joiner (between the first and second survey), U = union          leaver, and U11 =

union stayer. These four union status categories were also cross-classified
by mover-stayer status, and for movers by form of separation (quit, layoff)

and whether moved within or between industries.

       Wage level equations were used separately for the first and second year

bracketing the changes.1 Both equations contain the same union dtmmies. Thus

in "year 1" equations, the dimimies indicate prospective changes (or continuation)

of union status, while in "year 2" they indicate recent change. Both are useful

in exploring selectivity in hiring. The specification of wage change equations

is derived by taking first-differences of the variables in the level equations.

Thus the experience variable becomes tx       = 1 for all, and its coefficient enters
the intercept, but x2 differs with     the   level of experience. The tenure variable

T equals 1 for job stayers but becomes negative (—T, where T is length of job

tenure on the preceding job). Correspondingly, T2 is positive for stayers,

but is negative and equals    —T2   for movers. Standardization for tenure is

important: since wages grow with tenure (exoerience held fixed), wage change

estimates from regressions which omit tenure depend on how long recent movers

stayed on the previous job. Put another way, estimates which omit tenure indicate

the immediate wage change in moving from one job to another, while the present

 11n the NIS the first year is 1969, the second 1971. in the MID the pairs of
  years are adjacent.
                                               —6—

specification estimates the wage change from the prior to the current job, at

comparable tenure levels. This is, clearly, a more appropriate measure of returns

to job mobility, or to change in union status.


       Although the pooling of ten periods provides an effectively much larger

sample      of the MID observations, the smaller NLS sample      is in   some respects
superior: fewer observations are lost due to incomplete responses,            and hourly

wage refers to the current job rather than to the calendar year as in the MID.
The NLS also contains an alternative union status definition in addition to

union membership (UN), a question on whether the job is covered by collective
bargaining (CB).
       In   the   MID, job   and   union status changed between surveys, which were   taken

in   the second quarter of each year. Wage changes, however, refer to calendar

years. Since we bracketed status changers by adjacent years, if the reported

wages are indeed weighted annual figures, they could underestimate the true

change by is much as 33%. We checked on the degree of bias in several periods

(1976, 1977, 1978) when the question on wages was asked for the current job.

The so estimated bias was on average 21%. The bias could be removed by

leaving out two years between "year 1" and "year 2". But this would have

eliminated        a large fraction of job changers, whose tenure at moving is
short.
                                         —7—



     Table 1 shows sample means (i.e. proportions) of the union status categories

 for the young and old men panels by alternative definition of union status in NLS

and in MID. 28.3% of the young men and 36.3% of the old men were union members

in 1969. A somewhat larger proportion (33.2%
                                                 and 39% respectively) were covered
by collective bargaining   agreements. Union—nonunj turnover    is quite large
among the young and much smaller among   older job movers. A surprising and some-
what puzzling statistic is the number of union status changers who do not change

jobs (firms) -—   it is as large as the number of union joiners who are movers
among the young and even larger among the old.     The preponderance of stayers who are
union status changers is even stronger in MID, in which the proportion of all

movers appears to be smaller than in the NLS.



 1However,(tlM) is, in effect, a subset of (CB), since only those
  collective                                                      reporting
             bargaining coverage were asked whether they are union members.
  The (CB) definition is available in MID only for a few periods, so it could
  not be utilized in the pooled sample.

      Although some stayers may become union members, after a short period in the union

 shop, or by switching jobs within the firm, or by the firm becoming unionized,

 the figures for job stayers who change union status appear to be inflated by

 misreporting or misclassification. This is especially likely in the MID samples,

 where wages of union status changers who are job stayers are about                 the same
 (relative to the   base   group) before and after the change, (see Table 5)

      Table 2 presents estimates of the 1969 to 1971 wage changes in the NLS

 by union change category, net of the other        variables   (these are shown     in Appendix
 Table Al), classified by mobility status, age, and definition of union sector

 (tJM: union membership, CB: coverage of wage by collective bargaining agreement).

Ntmbers in Table 2     are regression coefficients, with t-statjstjcs shown in

parentheses.

     Using point estimates and the union membership criterion, young men who

joined unions by changing fixins    got   a 17.6% increase in wages, while older men

gained 7.4%. However, by the collective bargaining criterion, the gain was

similar for young and old (13.5% vs. 11.6%) .        The figures for the     older   men are

barely significant. The wage changes are adjusted for inflation and are net of

the wage change experienced by the base group of non—union stayers. Firm

stayers who report joining unions show smaller gains, with lesser statistical

significance. Although it may be advisable to discount (or ignore?) the

estimates for stayers, there is still a question whether the figures for job

movers should be viewed as the net union premium: even if they did not join a

union, young movers between non—union firms (U00) gained 3.5          to   6.4%.    If   such

gains measure the return on costs of mobility, the net profit of joining unions

by moving is reduced to between 7%    and 14% for the young movers, and is comparable
for the older union joiners although the statistical reliability of           the    estimates
for the older group is much weaker.

      When the movers' separation is distinguished by quit and layoff (see

 Table A3, upper panel), the gain from joining a union is about the same

 regardless of manner of separation, though for movers within the non-

union sector (TJoo) the gain is a positive 5—6% for quitters and near zero

 for those laid—off. These distinctions are not perceptible for the older

union joiners whose sample further divided into quit and layoff becomes

miniscule. However, old non—union movers (U00) experience zero gains in

quitting and significant losses by layoff.

     In turn, when movers are distinguished by moves between or within in-

dustry (Table A3, lower panel), (at the 2-digit level), gains to young union

joiners were observed only for inter-industry movers. They are not significant

for within-industry movers, but the latter comprise no more than 20% of

young movers who join unions, Again, no significant differences can be

observed in the small samples of older movers.

     Movers who left unions (U10 in Table 2) suffered losses which exceeded

the gains of movers who joined unions. The losses were even greater when the

separation from the union job was by layoff, and when the move was between

industries. Again less confidence should be attached to such findings for

the older men. If the    loss   of union leavers is to be viewed as another

measure   of the union prnius (with a negative sign) ,   it   is not clear why it is
so much larger than the positive measure. The discrepancy may reflect further
sorting by layoff from union firms, but the basis for such speculation is weak.
     Table 3 presents estimates of annual wage change equations, pooled over the
period   1968 to 1978 in the MID. Only one definition of union status      (union

membership) is available for all the    years.   The findings, coefficients of union

dusm'ies, are shown for all ages and for the two age groups, below age 30, and

30—64, separately.

        Young men who join the union by changing firms            gain    about 13% in wages;

the cider men's gain of 4% is not statistically significant. The average

gain for all is 9%. This reduces to 6% for the young and less than 5% for

all, if the union premium is viewed as net of the return to mobility into a

non-union job. However, when the moves of union joiners are classified by quit

and by layoff, (Table A4, upper panel), the gain by quitting was significantly

larger: 19.8% for the younger and 11.8% for the older group. The non—union

quitters had gains of 12.4% and 4.6% respectively. A net premium which would

take into account the returns to mobility makes the net differential about 7%

for quitters in both age groups. Again, as in the NLS, the gain for union
joiners who are movers shows up in inter-industry mobility.
       Compared to the NLS,      MID   estimates of the average union premium appear to
be    somewhat smaller.1     A major difference is in the estimate of losses of union
leavers:   they are larger than the       gains   of   joiners in the NLS, but insignificant
in    MID. However, the      insignificance in the MID sample atpiies only to the young
group.    among those over 30, union leavers who quit gain 12% while those laid

off lose 8.6%. No significant wage changes are observed for persons who did

not change jobs. Reported changes of union             status in this group      are more

questionable     than in the NLS sample.

       To sinarize the findings in both the NLS and MID:                  (1) Estimates of wage changes

of union joiners are near 15% for young (<30) white men and 4—12% for older men. If

gains from (non-union)       mobility   are subtracted from       these   estimates, the net union

premium   is   reduced to between 6—14% for the young joiners.

                       (2)    The union premium apears be larger for the young than
                                                             to

for   the older men. This is not true if collective bargaining rather than union
membership is a criterion (in the NLS). Ncr is it true in MID if union joiners
quit from the preceding job.
  1Recall (p.6, above) that MID estimates of wage changes tend to be understated.
                                              —14—


            (3) The union premium is clear and significant mainly if union joiners

quit the preceding job and moved between (2-digit) industries, as 80% of them did.

            (4) Union     leavers lose more   than i.mion joiners gain in the NLS. In

the MID sample, only union leavers over 30 who were laid off lose as much or more than

joiners gain. There is no evidence of losses for the younger union leavers.



2. Cross—Section Differentials and Selectivity in Hiring

           Tables 4 (for NLS) and S (for MID) present coefficients on union status

dummies in two crdss—section wage regressions, year 1, prior to the change in

union status, and year 2 after the change.Thus for job movers the coefficient on U1 in

th&'prospective"regression (year 1) estimates the wage of prospective movers from

non—union to union jobs (e.g. a coefficient of 1.2 means 1.2% points larger than

the wage of the base group = nonunion stayers). The coefficient of U01 in the

"retrospective"regression (year 2) estimates the wage on the new union job of

these recent union joiners, again relative to the base group in year 2,

       If the existence of a union premium induces employers to select more pro—

ductive labor, we would expect prospective union joiners to have       higher   wages in

the prior, nonunion job than other nonunion workers. We have to be careful,

however, to compare wages of new hires into union jobs with wages of new hires

into non-union jobs: employers select among new hires. Thus the difference

between the coefficients of U01 and U00 of job movers          in the prospective regression

(year 1) measures the upgrading in hiring into union jobs. Although

union joiners had a prior non—union wage about the same as the base group of non-

union stayers, their wages were significantly higher (about 10%) than the prior

non—union wage of new hires into non—union jobs. This selectivity differential

appears to be similar for the young and old NLS samoles and is roughly comparable

in   size (a bit   smaller)               to the net union premium estimated from
the wage changes.

           The comparison of coefficients on               and U of MD movers (Table 5)            in
year 1 yields the           conclusion   that workers newly hired     into   union jobs had, on

average, higher wages on the preceding job in the non-union sector than non-

union workers hired into non—union jobs. The difference is smaller in the

Michigan Panel than it was in the NLS.               3ut   this is a result of two      opposite
differentials by age. The young workers hired into union jobs had 8% higher

wages       than the prospective non—union hires, a figure cormarab1e to the selec-
tivity differential estimated for young NLS workers. However, the older group
of new      hires (30+) had       lower wages than   the comparison     group of non—union hires.
        Inspection of year 2 wages of new hires in their new jobs               shows that the

wage differential between non—union workers (in year 1)                 who moved to union    and
non—union jobs respectively (in year 2) has just about doubled                   (roughly from 10       to

20%) between year 1 and year 2 in both NLS                 and MID samples of young workers.
Thus   the union—nonunion differentials (among new hires in year 2) reflect
selectivity in hiring and, a net union wage premin in about equal measure.
For    the older worker the results are mixed: In the NLS the union-nonunion

differential among new hires (year 2) more than doubled compared to year 1,

while in the MID the differential changed from negative in year 1 to positive

in year 2.

       A sharper view                      of these comparisons is shown in Table 6. A

little arithmetic is helpful in inspecting the table.                                    First,

it is clear that the increment in the             wage differential between union and
non—union new hires from year 1 (on the old jobs, both non—union) to year 2

(on the new jobs, one union, the other non—union) is in principle,1 ecuivajent

selectivity, since:

with   returns on costs of mobility netted out.

       The interpretation expressed on the left hand   side   of (1) justifies the use

of   the second term on the right hand side: Emphasis on new hires coming from the non-

union sector; where wages may be assumed to reflect the marginal value product,

justifies the netting out of returns to mobility of workers moving within the

non—union sector only.

       Column(l) of Table 6 shows the cross—section union non-union differential

 for new hires. Column (2) shows the selectivity (upgrading) differential, which

is a component of the union—nonunion wage gap (1). Column (3) is the difference

between (1) and (2), the implicit net union wage premium obtained by new hires.

For comparison, Column (4) shows the net union wage premium estimated from the

wage—change    regressions, and Column (5), the cross—section union—nonunion wage
differential among stayers (coefficients of U11 of stayers in year 2) ,      which

comes closest to the usual regression estimates of the union—nonunion differential
in   the cross—section.

       Judging by the first two columns of Table 6, selectivity in hiring, as measured

by prior wages, accounts for almost one half of the union-nonunion wage differential

among young new hires in the IlLS, but less in the MID. The time-series estimates of

the net wage premium (col. 4) are comparable to the implicit cross-section estimates

(col. 3) in NLS, but they are smaller in the MID. For the older group in MID,

selectivity into the union (ccl. 2) appears to be perverse, that is negative.

           The analysis sunnnarized in Table 6 contains several innovations:   (1) It

relies on estimates of wage changes of workers whose union status        changes   as they move

between       firms. This is because reports of changes in union status while      staying in

the       firm   appear to be less reliable and show small or no effects. Previous studies

which do not contain information on job mobility, therefore, probably attenuate the

effects of unions on wages.          (2) Information on mobility also permits more direct

estimates of selectivity in hiring, as shown in col. 2 of Table 6.         (3) Firlly,

the information on tenure makes possible estimates of gains from mobility as upward

shifts of the whole tenure profile of wages from the old to the new job.            Usually

observed instantaneous wage changes may be negative, as is often found, but the
                                                                                   1
longer run effects obtained in the present analysis are more likely to be positive.

          As to ninerical results, it appears that estimates of net union gains in wages,

as seen in new hires, range from 7 to 15% in the NLS and from 3 to 14% in the MID.

Since the latter is biased downward, upward adjustments would put the central tendency

of both NIS and MID a little over 10%. Selectivity accounts for almost as much in

the NLS and the young workers in MID, but not so in the over 30 group in MID.

      1
          Even though superior as measures of gains from mobility, the shifts in tenure
          wage profiles are not fully commensurate with gains in present values. It
          can be shown that in order to secure the same gain in the present value of wages,
          moves after longer tenure require a larger shift in the tenure profile on the
          new job. This was confirmed empirically by positive and significant coefficients
          on a job change x prior tenure interaction variable in the wage change estimates
           (nct included in the present study).

 3.. Turnover in   Union Employment

          If the wage received in union employment exceeds the worker's opportunity
wage in non—union employment, he is less likely to quit a union job than a non-
union   job.

     As Table 7 indicates, quit rates in the union sector are about half as large

as in the non—union sector for young workers and are about one third as large

for men over 30 (in MID), and one seventh for men over 48 (in NLS)    The differences

are smaller for separations, since layoffs are somewhat larger in the union, at

least in the NLS.

     Although one third of the white male workers are unionized (somewhat less

among the young), less than 10% of non-unionized job seekers find employment

in the union sector, while a half of the 9oung and two—thirds of the older unionized

job movers find employment in the union sector. Since these statistics apply

to "unstandardized" workers, they may reflect differences in tastes and in

geography, industry, and occupation. At face value, at any rate, the differences

are consistent with our findings: non-union workers could get a bigger wage g.n

by moving to union jobs, but are evidently prevented by fewer vacancies and non—

probabilistic rationing (stricter hiring standards, nepotism, etc.) resulting from

the wage premium in the union sector. Union workers, however, can gain from mobility

within the union sector, but face a wage loss when they leave the union sector.

(Tables 2 and 3 above). Thus they tend not to leave the firm unless there is a
                                             1
good chance of landing another union job.




    11f the existence of grievance procedures ("voice" instead of "exit") were
     the major force that ties groups of workers with similar preferences to a
     rirm, we would expect lesser quit from firms with such labor relations.
     But, in the absence of a wage remium in unionized firms, those who senarate
     rrom sucn zrms would be 1arely indifferent whether they moved to a union
     or non—union firm, It is, incidentally, not clear why grievance crocedures
     cannot exst need be or less effective in non-unionized firms, if reduction
     ln turnover reduces labor costs.

        If   unionization reduces job mobility, this rEduction should be observed

on the same individual by comparing his mobility before and after joining a

union firm. And if the wage premium gained by moving to a union firm matters,

the reduction in mobility should be greater the greater the wage gain.

        According to Table 9, young NLS men who joined unions between 1969 and 1971 iai,e

prior quit frequency (in 1967—1969) which was not smaller than the quit of other non—

unionized workers at that time.1 This is based on regressions with quit as a

dependent variable (0,1) and 1969 values of the same standardizing variables

as used in the wage level regressions. However, the frequency of quit was

lower by about 13% points in 1971-1973 after joining a union (coefficient of

U01)
        in   the interval 1969—1971, This reduction is as   large   as the unstandardized

cross—section      difference in Table 7. In 1971—1973 union stayers CU11 in 1969—71)
had    about   the same   low   quit rates as  joiners.2
                                                union

       No significant results were obtained for the older NLS men who joined
unions,      but union stayers had significantly lower quit rates than non-union

workers both in 1967—1969 and in 1971—1973.



       1For a similar finding, based on other data, see Freeman (1980)

       2Recall that union status was not reported in 1967, so many of the young
        union stayers in 1969—71 were likely to have been joiners in 1967—69.

      A comparable analysis was performed on the full D Sample (including

 movers and stayers) using all ages and changes in quit ( Q) as the dependent

 variable which assntes values (--1, 0, +1)   .   Again   the standardizing variables

 were the same as in the1n wage equations, The results are shown in col. (1)
 of Table 9.

      Union joiners experienced significant reductions in quit rates compared

 to all other groups. Larger wage gains (for all movers and stayers) also re—

duced quits in the next period. Here we do not distinguish wage gains of union

joiners from those of everyone else.

     To observe this distinction we restricted the sample to job movers (about

two—thirds   of the sample had at least one move during the 10—year panel period),
We constructed a mobility index CM), which is a count of numbers of firms
                                                                                 in
which the person worked up to the current job (i.e. number of separations + 1)

divided by the time interval over which mobility was recorded. The denominator

of the index is the interval since entry into the labor force, or since 1958,

if entry into the labor force was before this date.          Wage changes associated

with job moves were recorded separately for union joiners and for others

between 1968 and 1973, and their effects estimated on the change in M (and

in ln M) between the move and 1973, the last year of the panel.

     The   numerator   of the mobility rate includes
                                                       permanent layoffs in addition
to quits, but is dominated by quits,
                                         We could not restrict the index to quits,
since the pre-l968 mobility is reported as separations
                                                               However, as Table 8 showed,
although (permanent) layoffs are somewhat
                                              larger in the union sector in the NLS,
they are not larger in the MID sample,     But, even in the NLS   differences   in
separations are dominated by differences in quits,

         A preliminary cross-section analysis (Table AS, panel (a)) showed that the

 mobility rate (N and inN) declines with experience in a decelerating fashion, is

 reduced by education, marital status, union status, and by economy wide unemploy—

 ment.

       The dependent variable (AM, or inN) in col. 2 and 3 of Table 9 is the

difference between the index in 1978 and the first move observed between 1968

and 1973 (inclusive) for non-union people (for most of them this was not the

first move,since they moved also before 1968) or the move at which they joined

a union. The union dummy U01 distinguishes union joiners from non—union movers

and wage gains of joiners ( mW01) are distinguished from wage gain of non--

union movers •    The   standardizing variables are in the form of differences between
1978 and levels at the time of the move, Dumtijes were added to      account   for
entry into the labor force before 1968, and 1958, and      years observed in the

panel.

         The results show that union joiners reduce their mobility more     the larger
the   wage gain from joining a union. A similar,      but much smaller,   and barely

significant, effect is observed for wage gains of movers in the                 sector.
This is true whether the index or the changes in wages are logarithmic or

arithxnetjca 1.


      The weak effect of an episode of mobility among non—union jobs is not

surprising: unless the rate of return on the cost of moving is unusually high,

there are no disincentives to future job search, However, the larger the

wage premium for union joiners the greater the potential loss from future

mobility. This reasoning applies more clearly to quit behavior, but the

effects on total separations, if weaker, are similar.
                                            —28—




        Whether   mere unionization without a wage premiimi produces a reduction in

mobility is not as clear in Table 9. The union dtmuny has a strong effect on

the change in the logarithmic, but not arithmetical, mobility index. It is

also strong in Ccl. (1) where the wage gain of union joiners was not separated from

others. Undoubtedly it represents a response to other union benefits, in fringes and

in working conditions, including the more certain advantages of seniority.

Nevertheless, our findings support the inference that the union wage gain is not

merely a compensatory differential for quality of labor, or costs of mobility, or for

inferior conditions in union jobs. Union rents appear to be real, although

relatively small (closer to 10% than to 20%).

       Although cross—section union—nonunion wage differentials (gross) over-

state   the   size of the (net) union premium, it may be useful to explore their

effects on differentials     in quit rates in the cross—section, on the asstnption
that the   gross and net wage differentials are positively correlated. Again

the purpose is to find   out whether it is not       merely union—status but the size

of   the differential that affects mobility.
       The companion    analysis whose reults are shown in Table 10 exploits the
large size of the MID panel     in   another way: we explore whether union—nonunion
wage differentials affect quit rates      within ,   alternatively,   industries,

regions (states), and occupations. The analysis proceeds in two steps:              first
we added industry (or state, or occupation) ,union,and industry x union membership

dimsnies to the cross—section wage function. The coefficients of the cross-product

dummies (ftj)     are estimates of within-group union—nonunion (relative) wage

differentials (estimates shown in Table A6). In the second step we included industry

(or other groups), and a union dummy as well as its cross—product with the estimated

union-nonunion wage differentials (ft. from        the wage regressions) in quit regressions.

                                                          We ruled out groups

for which we had too few (less than 20) observations in        the   union or nonunion

sector. Thus we utilized 22 industries, 31 states, and 27 occupational

categories (Table A6).

       The intra—group union—nonunion wage differentials 3. amounted, on average,

to 15—20%. They ranged from 0 to over 40% and were most prominent (larger and

more significant) in the occupational category, less so within states, and

least within industries.



      Table 10 which reports the results of step 2, shows respectively the effects

of union status (U), and of wage differentials (2)

on differences     in quit   rates between unionized and non—unionized workers within

the   various   groups of workers. Effects of wage differentials are not significant

within industries ( at a level higher than 1-digit, for workers with the same

measiired characteristics ,     but   they are significant within regions and occupations.

Union status alone (the U dummy) is sufficient to affect the         intra—iridustry differences,
but plays no role other than via wage differentials inside occupations. Both
variables are significant within states. Note also that U is significant in all three
groups, when /3    is dropped, and conversely.

4. Fringe Benefits and Hours of Work

          If numbers employed (N) and hours per worker (H) are viewed as separate

factors of production, cost minimizing employers will determine their demand for

N and H at the point where the ratio of marginal factor costs is equal to the

ratio of marginal productivities, that is to the solpe of the optimal production

isoquant.

       Following Rosen (1968) ,   the   equilibrium marginal factor cost ratio is.:1

        (1) MCNH ÷F(r+q)
                    N
              MCH

where   F is the fixed cost of employment per worker, amortized per period by r,

the interest cost of capital and by q, the worker quit probability which depreciates

the capital sum creating a capital loss Fq per period.

       To the extent that F is positive an increase in the wage rate W reduces the

factor cost ratio shifting the relative demand away from hours toward numbers.2

In the minimum wage case it may be argued that F is significant at most in terms

of   training   expenses, but that minimum wages tend to reduce or eliminate such

expenses, so that the predicted effects on hours may be observed only in the

short run before the adjustment is coinpleted,or it may be indeterminate.



       1Let   total labor costs be C    =   NHW   + NP (r+q), Then MC =   dC =   EW   +   F (r-4-a)
                                                                          dN
        and MCH =        =
                    dH


             analysis of substitution beeen H and N ignores scale effects. The
        qualitative conclusions, however, remain valid so long as the elasticity
        of demand for numbers (N) with respect to wages (including fringes) is
        less than unitary.
                                            —32—

                                            In contrast to the minimum wage, union

pressure on wages extends to most components of the wage package.

Indeed, union push on components other       than   directly paid out wages appear to

be even stronger. Union fringe benefits exceed non-union benefits not only

in dollar value but also as a proportion of the wage package (about 30%). A

number of possible explanations have been conjectured, running from union demo—

crasy    which favors the older worker to union management of pension funds as an

instrument of power. One economic argument relies on reduced turnover, which

is a result of union wage push and of other gains. In the presence of in-

complete vesting of pensions in the worker, longer tenure of union members

means that the probability of ultimately receiving the pension is higher in
                                                                                         1
union    than in non—union jobs. Hence the incentive to push for larger pensions

(Freeman, 1978). But why increase fringe benefits by a larger percentage than

the increase in the paid out wage? One reason is the higher marginal income

tax rate, if the income elasticity of worker demand for fringes is otherwise

unitary    (Rice, 1966). But this may explain only a small part of       the   proportional
                                              2
increase    (Donsimoni and Shakotko, 1979).

       The analysis of effects of wage push on hours may provide one rationale for

union pressure on fringes: an increase in union wages W, with F unchanged, would

lower the ratio, of marginal factor costs both by raising the denominator in the

second right    hand   component of equation (1) and by reducing q in the numerator.

If   hours are reduced, weekly earnings may not increase much       even if wage rates

rise significantly. To blunt the adverse effect on hours, more specifically, to

prevent their   reduction   which would limit union gains in earnings, quasi-fixed

costs,   such as   fringes, must be increased by a larger percentage than the paid

out wage (W),   since   quits (q) decline   when both W and F are   increased.


      1For the same reasons, more vesting is less costly to union than non-union employers.

      2They found that fringe benefitswere substantially larger for union workers whose
       total compensation (wages + fringe) was the same as the total compensation of
       non—union workers.

        In   contrast to hypotheses which rely on non-wage aspects of unionism to
explain      the larger ratio of fringe benefits to paid out wages in union employ-

ment, this analysis predicts a positive link between the percent union wage

premium and the relative increase in fringe benefits (F). Moreover, the per-

cent increase in F is expected to exceed the percent increase

in the wage, since the larger the latter, the bigger is the decrease in the

quit    rate.    Thus unions which achieve the biggest gain in paid out wages would

also want the largest proportion of their total compensation in fringe benefits.

        This proposition is tested on a sample of over 4,000 firms in 70 (2.-digit)

industries. Average paid out wages in union firms were 21% higher than in non-

union firms     within     the industry (a simple average of 70 wage ratios), while

average fringe benefits were 60% higher. The first regression (t.able II, Panel A)

relates the ratios of fringes                ,   where u is union, n is nonunion, and i is
                                     Fni i
industry to ratios of money wages,standardizing for age of employees, size of

firm,    geographic   region, and union coverage of the industry.

        As predicted, the coefficient on the wage ratio in Table 11 is significantly

larger than unity (1.62). This implies that a 10% increase                in the union wage
premium would create a 16% increase in the union—nonunion ratio of fringe benefits.
This ratio was, on average, 32% in the unstandardized data.

        A second   test   was performed,   at the   firm   level   on union firms alone. First

a   wage and fringe       function was estimated on non—union firms       in   order to impute

non-union levels of wages        and frires to union        firms. Thus   the denominators of

the wage ratio and the fringe ratio. ire imputed             values   which workers in union

firms   would receive if they were not unionized. This is a more stringent test
because it relates fringes to wages in union firms only, and because                 errors in
imputation      bias the    coefficients against the hypotheses (downward) .         The results

(Table 11, Panel B) nevertheless. are once again as predicted, although the co-

efficient on the wage—ratio is, indeed, smaller than in Panel A.

       In   the data analyzed in Table 11 the value of union fringes is 80% higher than

of nonunion fringes, while wages are 30% higher. Asuxning t1 t the net union effect

is a half of this figure (i.e. 15%) , and that quit rates are half as large in the

nonunion sector (as observed in Table 7), we can calculate the required ratio of

fixed costs            which would remove employer incentives to cut hours schedules

of union workers. Given N (numbers employed), the condition is, by eg. (1)

               F(r+q)         F (r +
                  wu             w

                                                                       X
                                                                       4          53

The actual ratio of fringe benefits is larger (1.80) , presmiably because fringes

represent only a part, although a major one, of fixad labor costs.

       An important consequence of higher fixed costs (in hiring and in fringes)

imposed on union employers is greater stability of employment——reduced

fluctuations in N, when labor demand fluctuates (see Rosen, 1968). As a

result, the major means of adjustment to fuictuating demand in union employment

are the use of overtime when labor is short and the use of temporary layoffs (recall

unemployment) in slack times. Temporary layoff is favored by union workers, as it

implies lesser income loss than corresponding reductions in weekly hours, because

of unemployment compensation and other unemployment benefits (see b). For their

part, employers can expect less attrition, since temporarily laid off union

workers are less likely to look for other jobs than comparable non—union workers.

      The    evidence that average weekly hours         are not less in the union than non—union

sector,     that overtime is more prominent arid        that temporary layoffs are more frequent

and   a larger porportion of total layoffs in the union sector is available1, and con-
sistent with our hypothesis. In this light union pressure on fringe benefits is not
merely (or at all) a tradeoff for higher wages, but a policy which increases both
earnings    and job security   of union workers,
  1Irx MID, straight-time in weekly hours are about 4% shorter in union jobs, but
   total hours are rio less in union than in nonunion jobs. See also Blau and Kahn
    (1981) , and Raisian (1981) .
5. Union Wage Profiles and Job Training


            The   cross—section union-nonunion differentials in wages diminish with
age.     They are reduced from over 22% to about 15% between ages less than and more
than 30 for union stayers (U11) in MID (Table 5), and reduced further to a little
over zero for those over 48 in NLS (Table 4). The implication is that the typical
union age (experience) wage profile,           although higher in level is flatter than the

typical    non—union profile. This difference has been found in other studies and
has    been ascribed to union policy of compressing wage differentials across firms

and workers, who may differ in sex, education, race, and age.

            The policy of wage compression has been attrthuted to union pursuit of

equity, to administrative convenience in collective bargaining, and to union

efforts    to reduce competition from lower wage firms. However, a more direct
explanation of flatter wage profiles involves union emphasis on wage progression
by seniority rules: Within the firm,           the   wage structure and other rules •of collec-
tive bargaining agreements     are specified in terms of seniority, or job tenure.

Although wages grow as tenure lengthens              in non—union jobs as well
as in union jobs (Table 12) ,    the   explicit seniority rules in union

firms are a great deal     more rigid:               Seniority is the necessary condition for
promotion in most union firms.        If the higher job level requires additional training,
union    clauses often provide that    senior employees are to be trained in order
                                           1
to fill the higher level vacancies.             Such provisions limit the supply of trained

workers from the outside. At the same time they severely reduce the benefits from

transferable training. Consequently, incentives for general (transferable)

training are reduced for union workers, both because such training is not

adequately         rewarded within the union firm, and because union workers are less

likely to move in the first place.

       This helps to explain the declining with age proportion of job movers who

join union firms     (Table 1),             and the smaller coefficient of experience1

at fixed levels, in the wage function of union compared to non—union workers

(Table 12)

      Whatever training exists in union          firms, and   certainly some initial

(apprentice) training exists in crafts, and is provided for the purposes of

filling more skilled vacancies from within, almost by definition, all of it is specific

to the firm.      If wage   growth   with   tenure at fixed levels of experience reflects

the   growth of specific capital, tenure—wage profiles in union firms need not be
flatter and may     even    be steeper than in non—union firms.
      This is, indeed, found in Table 12, where the            coefficient   on tenure in
the union wage equation is no smaller than in the non-union equation. Table 12
is restricted to MID data because estimates of experience and tenure coefficients in NLS
are sensitive to truncation by        age.    The non—union tenure coefficient in the wage
level equation (left—hand panel) is smaller in col. (3),            where an attempt was

made to adjust the estimate for heterogenity bias2by introducing the (prior)
mobility rate variable. This variable (M) has a negative and significant effect in the
non-union equation, where it also reduces the tenure coefficient, but has no effect
in the     union equation. The right-hand panel of the Table shows separate wage

growth equations for union and        nonunion workers. The      comparative    results are
similar     to the results in wage levels, but all coefficients are smaller and

less significant.

          For an introduction of this approach, see Mincer and Jovanovic (1978)
                                               —39—


       The experience coefficient is much smaller in the union equation. Thus

the flatness of gross union wage profiles (by age, or experience) when tenure

is ignored, or by tenure when experience (or age) is ignored is due solely to

lesser worker investments in general training.

       The   flatter gross union profile also suggests that the total volume of train-
ing   is   smaller in union firms. In principle, this need not be the case, since the

wage profile measures returns to workers, but not returns on costs

borne by employers. The reluctance of union workers to quit should provide

incentives for union employers to invest in specific training of their workers,

since the risk of a capital loss by worker quit is smaller. Union workers have

a corresponding insurance against capital losses only to the extent that seniority

rules reduce layoffs .This is true at higher levels of seniority at the expense

of low—tenured workers. Thus, in contrast to the usual (competitive) analysis

(Becker,     1975) where   worker turnover -   both   quits   and   layoffs - are a result of
investments in specific hi.nan capital shared by workers and employers, such
investments are the result, rather than cause, of turnover patterns induced
by union pressure.
      Because    of lower quit,might expect employer investments in specific
                                  we

training of union workers to exceed the corresponding investments of non—union
employers. But the fact that permanent layoff rates of union workers are no
smaller than in the non—union sector raises doubts about such expectations.
However, higher rates of union layoffs concentrated at low tenure levels may
both reflect additional screening of new hires and may be a substitute form
of adjustment for reduced quit)        If the    volimte of specific training is not
clearly larger in union firms, total training,including the general component,
is likely to be smaller. This is apparently confirmed by the more direct
evidence on reported training, to which we proceed:



      1 Blau    and Kahn find that unionismiñreases permanent layoffs among the your,
           not among the old NLS. Our own research (not presented here) shows that while
           quits and layoffs decline with tenure at about the same rate for non—union workers,
           layoffs decline more steeply thap quits for union workers.

       In the NLS,training was reported in response to questions: Do you receive or

use additional training (other      than   school training) on your     job?   In MID,

different questions were used in different surveys; the most appropriate for

our purposes is the question asked in 1976—1978: "Are you learning skills on

the current job which could lead to a better job or to promotion?"

       In a recent paper (Mincer and Leighton, 1981) these questions were used

to explore the effects of minimum wage laws on training on the job. Training

so reported was used as a dependent variable1 in the NLS and MID equations

(the same set of independent variables was used as in the wage equations)

A union dtnmy     included   in those equations was significantly negative in all

periods in the MID and in the older NLS       sample.
      In the current study, we further classified the union status variable

as   joiners (U01),   leavers (U), and stayers (U11), and explored the incidence

of   training   before and after the change of union status.

      In the LS samDles       (Table 13,(A) ) the old union   stayers   and union joiners
show significantly less training than non—union stayers. The signs on coefficients

of the young union joiners are negative, not significant before joining and almost

significant after, Old union leavers show positive, but not significant coefficients.

      The MID results (Table 13(B) ) similarly show significantly less training

among union stayers (U11). They also show that less training is required on union

jobs, though not as a precondition for hiring (coefficient U1 is not significant

in year 1, Panel C). The coefficients of union joiners are negative and riot signi-

ficant before but significant after joining the union (year 1 and year 2 regressions).

Infereritielly, they received more training than union stayers before the start of the

union job. Conversely, union leavers appear to receive more training than before

on the non-union job to which they moved.
     lAs an independent variable, the trathirig dumnies are positve and significant
      in both wage level and wage growth equations (not reported here).

     The findings on workers who changed union status are not very sQcure, but

they suggest that selectivity in hiring msy involve prior training (in addition

to some cencentration of it at the outset of some of the union jobs, such as in

crafts). This may explain the results for the very young NLS workers where

union effects on training were not significant.

     The finding that union workers receive less training on the job than non-

union workers is also confirmed in the Michigan Time Study, as reported by

Duncan and Stafford (1980). They report that while non-union work s spend,

on average 6.1 hours per week on job training, comparable union workers spend

4.2 weekly hours on such trainirj.



Summary


      Amourig a   number of features that distinguish unionized from non-unionized
labor markets, at least four have been repeatedly observed in empirical studies:
 (1) Higher wages, (2) Larger fringes, more than in proportion to wages, (3) Lesser
turnover, reflecting lesser quit, though not less layoffs, and (4) Flatter age—
wage profiles. Although the labor monopoly hypothesis has been used (and disputed)
as an explanation of higher union wages, it does not receive much, if any,

attention in analyses of the other features.


     This study explores the existence of a net union premium and of the extent

of rationing by quality of the resulting excess supply. The net union premium

was estimated in Section 1 by relating changes in wages to changes in union status

of the saute worker in longitudinal panels (NLS and :11D) .   In   Section 2, two cross—

section wage level regressions, a "prospective" and "retrospective1' permit more

direct observation of selectivity in hiring. Over a       half of the cross—section

differitial   of over 20% for the 'same" (standardized) worker is a net union rent and
much of the rest reflects a quality adjustment in hiring, as measured by wages.

This conclusion was less reliable for        older workers.
                                            —43—




      The next step (Section 3)was to      ascertain   whether the net: union      wage premium
 is responsible, together with other advantages        secured   by   the union such as Lringes
and   seniority rules, for the lesser turnover, especially quit of union workers.

The answer is positive: the reduction in quit depends on the size of the net
wage premium in an individual analysis, and is also positively related to the
gross, cross—section wage differentials within groups of workers,alassifi.ed by
 location and occupation, though not by industry. Frfnges and seniority rules,
or-other union advantages did not explicitly enter this analysis hut they are
 likely to be embodied in the union memnk:sbip variable,
      in Section   4, it is hypothesized   thai: the jneisjt:jon of rer fixed I abor
costs (such as fringes) helps to deter employers from preferein; r ducttons Lu
hours to reductions in men, and it he)ns to stabi lie enpioyuont in the face
fluctuating demand,by a more froquant use of overtime and of teip car layoffs in the
union sector. This hypothesis links the size of fringe benefits to th' union
wage gain. An analysis of firms in 7) industries confirms this link.


      Section 5 explored the consequence: of union pressure on the tenure pro file
of wages by the rather rigid linking of u e levels to            senior i.t:y   in the lob. The
consequently reduced incentives for wwlvr in\'estrnen ir qeneua I (-ransfer-ai].')
training, even if no such reduction neSs fo apply to specifi; tr ni;, is con-
sistent with observed flatter exper:isn::n (or aqe) profile of 'ages of union workers.
In sum, total training is likely to be less frequent in union firm; an this is
confirmed by direct responses in survey r'porLs.

I. A category was excluded if the number of union observations in it was less
   than 20 in the full sample.
        The coefflicients reported below represent the percent union differential
   for each category. The dependent variable is log defalted average hourly
   earnings. No intercept was used so that levels rather than contrasts could
   be read for the group dummies (not reported here).

(1) The first set of dinmies refers to detailed industries:
