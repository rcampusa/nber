This paper is an attempt to assess the existence and magnitude of local research spillovers in France.
We rely on the model of an extended production function (Cobb-Douglas and Translog) with both
local and neighborhood R&D capital stocks. We estimate this model on 312 employment areas as
of 1999, first for the whole economy, then separately for five large manufacturing industries. The estimated
elasticities of productivity with respect to R&D capital are significant and plausible, both within own-area
and across neighboring areas as well as within own-industry, but they are weaker across different industries.

1        Introduction

          Assessing the local spillover impacts of firms’ R&D investments on the various

dimensions of economic development: productivity, employment, innovation, …, both in the

geographic area where they are located and in neighboring areas, is one the most difficult and

important challenge of recent empirical investigations in the economics of research and

innovation1. Since the seminal book of KRUGMAN [1991] and the renewal of economic

geography, these issues and the related ones of understanding the determinants and

consequences of the localization and agglomeration of firms’ activities have received

increasing attention. Firms tend to locate where the factors of production are abundant and

less expensive, or where the demand for their products is strongest. They have, however, to

balance production costs and costs of transportation. Many authors recognize that various

types of externalities play also a major role in the localization of firms, arising from particular

historical and geographical contexts, from policies of regional planning, from the

agglomeration of natural, human and other economic resources, and in particular from that of

specific knowledge assets leading to local increasing returns.



          As emphasized by GRILICHES [1992], the search for knowledge spillovers is

specially challenging. While other externalities can be assessed more or less directly, even if

not easily, knowledge spillovers are not directly observed. Economists can only strive to

measure the effects of knowledge flow and stock variables on outcome variables like numbers

of innovations or patents, and labor or total factor productivity. A related and difficult issue is

to assess the spatial extent of knowledge spillovers. Other major problems are encountered in

    See AUDRETSCH, FELDMAN [2004] for a survey, and AUTANT-BERNARD, MAIRESSE, MASSARD
[2007] for a summary account of recent empirical studies published in a special issue of Papers in Regional
Science on “Spatial Knowledge Diffusion through Collaborative Networks”.
trying to understand and analyze the underlying channels and “mechanisms” by which they

operate, and the conditions allowing firms to benefit from them2.



            In this exploratory econometric analysis, we basically try to identify local

knowledge spillovers by estimating the effects of firms’ R&D investments on productivity at

the aggregate level of some 300 French employment areas for 1999. We do so by relying on

the framework of an extended production with both local and neighborhood R&D capital

stocks, in addition to the more traditional factors of production of labor and physical capital3.

We specify this production function both as a simple Cobb-Douglas function and a more

general Translog function, and we estimate it for the French economy as a whole as well as

for five large manufacturing industries. On the basis of this framework and our data, we can

distinguish between local R&D spillovers within the range of employment areas themselves

and within the range of neighboring areas. We thus focus on estimating as our two main

parameters of interest the elasticities of productivity with respect to R&D capital, both

“within own-area” and “across neighboring areas”: first for the whole economy in Section 3,

and then separately by manufacturing industry in Section 4. In this last Section, we also try to

distinguish between local R&D spillovers “within own-industry” and “across other

industries”.



            Although our results remain exploratory, they are surprisingly encouraging, leading

to estimates of R&D capital elasticities both within own-area and across neighboring areas

which are statistically significant and seem economically plausible. Local spillovers thus

usefulness as well as many of the conceptual, measurement and econometric issues it raises, see the seminal
article of GRILICHES [1979].
extend largely beyond the average range of employment areas, but they also appear to be

limited to neighboring employment areas that does not reach farther than an average of 100

km. We also find evidence that local spillovers tend to be mostly industry specific, with

significant estimates for R&D capital elasticities within own-industry in all five

manufacturing industries, and significant ones for elasticities across other industries for two

industries out of the five: consumption goods and equipment goods industries.



          Before turning in Sections 3 and 4 to the detailed presentation of our results, we

have in Section 2 to explain briefly the construction of the data at the level of the French

employment areas in 1999, and comment on some the descriptive statistics for our main

variables, stressing in particular the extreme geographical concentration of R&D firms’

investments.




2       Data and main descriptive statistics



2.1     Construction of the necessary data at the level of French employment

areas for 1999



         Many previous studies in order to assess the importance of geographical knowledge

spillovers have been relying on regional or departmental data4. We investigate this issue here



4
    See for example CICCONE [2002], GAMBARDELLA, MARIANI, TORRISI [2002], or AUTANT-
BERNARD, LESAGE [2008].
for France at more detailed geographical level which is a priori preferable, that of the

“employment areas (“bassins d’emploi”).



            The data we use relate to the non-agricultural business sector excluding financial

activities and interim employment, for “Metropolitan” France without Corsica5. They are

constructed at the level of “employment areas” for the year 1999. Employment areas are

economic zones where local firms are likely to hire their workers. They have been precisely

defined by INSEE and the Ministry of Labor, first in 1983 and then revised in 1994, on the

basis of statistics on residence-to-work displacements6. Employment areas are much smaller

than regions and departments (which correspond respectively to the NUTS 2 and NUTS 3

levels of the European Union classification). There are 341 of them in Metropolitan France

(without Corsica), of which we retain only 312 in our analysis, after discarding 29 as

unsuitable because they had no or very small R&D investments or very low employment

levels (with an estimated R&D capital stock of less than 100 K€, or with less than 5 000

workers)7.



            Our R&D data come from the annual surveys conducted by the Ministry of Research,

which give detailed information on firms’ internal and external R&D expenditures, numbers

of R&D employees, financial sources, … These individual data are allocated to one of the

36 000 French local municipalities on the basis of the postal code (ZIP code) of the firms’

main laboratories, and then aggregated at the level of the employment areas. Finally, using


5
    Financial activities and interim employment are excluded for lack of good coverage in the administrative data
we use. Corsica is left out because of geographical distance and its insular situation (and very little R&D
investments).
6
    See INSEE [1994].
7
    10 employment areas are excluded on the basis of these two criteria, 13 only on that of very small R&D
investment, and 6 of very small employment.
here only the internal R&D expenditures obtained for the six years 1993 – 1998, and applying

the so called permanent inventory method with a 15% depreciation rate, we can construct an

R&D capital stock K at the beginning of 1999 for all employment areas. (See Appendix A for

more details.) In order to investigate the spatial range of local spillovers beyond the

employment areas, besides measuring the local R&D capital stocks K, we have also computed

so called “neighborhood R&D capital stocks” such as K100 or K200. For a given

employment area, these are simply computed as the sums of the R&D capital stocks K of all

their neighboring employment areas in a “circle” of 100 km or 200 km. (See also Appendix A

for more details.)



             The employment data come from the firms’ declarations to the Social Security (i.e.

the Déclarations Annuelles de Données Sociales or DADS). Being separately available for the

different firms’ establishments, they can be merged into an INSEE database constructed at the

establishment level which provides other economic key variables for 1999: total sales, value

added, gross earning before interests and taxes, and the book value of fixed assets8.

Establishments being localized at the municipality level, these variables are aggregated at the

level of the employment areas as in the case of R&D. The General Census of Population of

1999 is also a source of complementary information at the level of municipalities and

employment areas.9




8
    In fact this establishment database is constructed on the basis of firm level statistics. For mono-establishment
firm, this evidently raises no difficulties, but for multi-establishments firms this has been achieved by using,
various methods of imputation based on very detailed industry ratios by establishment size and localization.

9
    See JULIA [2003] for more detailed explanations on these aspects of the construction of our database.
2.2    Main descriptive statistics



         Table 1 gives the mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum, as

computed over the 312 employment areas, for the main variables in our investigation. It

shows the very large dispersion and skewness (asymmetry) of most of these variables in

absolute levels (that is before being normalized by size and being taken in logs). While the

surface (S) of the largest employment area (Toulouse) is already 140 times that of the smallest

one (Vitry-sur-Seine) and the mean surface (1600km2) is about 10% higher than the median

surface (1430km2), the employment (L) of the largest employment area (Paris) is of about 190

times that of the smallest one (Gannat), and the mean employment (40160) is about twice the

median employment (20510). These two max-to-min and mean-to-median ratios are even

larger for value-added (Y) and physical capital (C) than for employment, and even much more

so for local R&D capital (K) and our preferred measure of neighborhood R&D capital

(K100). As could be expected, however, when we normalize by employment size and

consider labor productivity (Y/L), physical capital intensity (C/L), and local and

neighborhood R&D capital intensities (K/L and K100/L), we see that their distributions

across employment areas appear much less dispersed and skewed. Going one step further and

taking logarithms which is what do when estimating the Cobb-Douglas and Translog

production functions regressions, we can also see that their log-distributions become roughly

symmetrical.




                    Table 1: Main Descriptive Statistics (ABOUT HERE)
             The distributions of the local and neighborhood Log R&D capital stocks per

employee [Log(K/L) and Log(K100/L)] remain nonetheless very dispersed across the

employment areas, as compared to Log labor productivity [Log(Y/L)] and to Log physical

capital stock per employee [Log(K/L)]. This corresponds to an extremely high concentration

of firms R&D activities in a few zones. This geographical concentration of R&D activities is

particularly striking since it much more pronounced than that of productive activities. This

appears most clearly by looking at the Lorenz curves shown in Figure 1 respectively for the

surface (S), total employment (L), value added (Y) and local and neighborhood R&D capital

(K) and (K100), and by comparing the corresponding Gini coefficients10. We can see that the

10% (i.e. the 31) largest employment areas in terms of surface, employment, value-added and

physical capital correspond to 23 %, 47 %, 53 % and again 53 % of the total surface, total

employment, total value-added and physical capital respectively, while the 10% largest

employment areas in terms of local and neighborhood R&D capital account respectively for

as much as 88 % of the total R&D capital stock and for as much as 71 % of the “total

neighborhood R&D capital stock”11.




               Figure 1: Concentration Curves and Gini Coefficients (ABOUT HERE)




10
     The Gini coefficients for physical capital (C) and value-added (Y) are nearly equal, and we cannot distinguish
their Lorenz curves (3) and (4) in Figure 1. Note also that the Lorenz curve for the neighborhood R&D capital
K100 appears less concentrated than that for local R&D capital K, because of the fact that the different
neighborhood areas are by construction greatly overlapping, and the fact that local R&D capital stocks K are
very small for most employment areas.
11
     Note that because of the high concentration of R&D capital K in few employment areas in Paris, Lyon,
Toulouse, Grenoble and their neighborhood areas, and because of the important overlap of these neighborhood
areas, the mean neighborhood R&D capital K100 appears much larger (by a factor of nearly 30!) than the mean
R&D capital stock K.
            Figure 2 shows the localization and importance of R&D activities in terms of

employment in the 312 employment zones in France. These activities are mainly concentrated

in the Paris region, and to a lesser extent in the Rhône-Alpes region with Lyon and Grenoble,

and in the Toulouse region, and they are quite modest or negligible in most other parts of

France. The huge concentration we already stressed in terms of R&D capital is of course also

true for R&D employment. About 90% of the R&D employees (researchers and technicians)

employed by firms are located in the 40 employment areas largest in terms of R&D

employment, and 70% in the 10 first of them: 7 in Paris Region and 3 in the province (i.e. by

decreasing order: Nanterre, Versailles, Boulogne-Billancourt, Paris, Toulouse, Lyon, Les

Mureaux, Grenoble, Saint-Denis, Vitry-sur-Seine).

            Finally, Table 2 gives the Moran’s coefficients of spatial autocorrelation for our

main variables (in logs) using four different contiguity matrices12. We can see that these

spatial autocorrelation coefficients are statistically significant (at the 1% confidence interval)

for all variables and for all four contiguity matrices. They also tend to be somewhat higher

when more weight is given to close proximity, that is when they are computed with the first

contiguity matrix (W1) based on the neighboring areas, or the fourth one (W4) based on the

inverse of the squared distance. We note also that they are generally close enough for all the

variables, in the range of 0.15 to 0.25, with few exceptions. This is a relatively modest order

of magnitude, which is high enough, however, to warrant the use of spatial econometric

techniques.

3      Local R&D Spillovers



         In order to assess the existence and magnitude of local and neighborhood R&D

capital intensities on local productivity, we estimate the following extended simple Cobb-

Douglas production function (1):



                               ⎛Y     ⎞                              ⎛C ⎞

and the more general extended Translog production function (2):

where i denotes the employment area i (i = 1 to 312), and where our main parameters of

interest are γ1 and η1 for the Cobb-Douglas specification, together with γ2 and η2 (and

possibly γ3 and γ4) for the Translog specification13. Note that all capital stocks (C, K and

K100) are measured at the beginning of the year 1999. Note also that all the squared and cross

product Log terms in the Translog specification are taken in deviations from the

corresponding means, which implies for example that the estimated γ1 and η1 in the Translog

specification directly measure the local and neighborhood R&D capital elasticities at the

mean values of the variables, and that they should be not too different from the constant

elasticities γ1 and η1 as estimated in the Cobb Douglas specification14. Note finally that in

order to take into account the different industry structure of the employment areas, we have

included in the two Cobb-Douglas and Translog productivity equations eleven control

variables measuring the value added shares of the different industries (at the NES16

classification level) in the employment areas.
13
     We have not included in the Translog specification the three cross-terms involving Log(K100/L), that is
Log(L)* Log(K100/L), Log(C/L) * Log(K100/L) and Log(K/L) * Log(K100/L), since these three variables are
strongly collinear.
14
     In the Translog specification, the elasticities are not constant, but are function of the variables. For example,
the elasticity of physical capital stock is :

βˆ = β + 2β
         1      2
                    ( log ( C / L) − log ( C / L) ) + β ( log ( L) − log(L) ) + γ ( log ( K / L) − log ( K / L) )
                                                         3                             4
       As we have seen in the previous section, our main variables Log(Y), log(L), log(C),

log(K) and Log(K100) are not only extremely dispersed but they also exhibit spatial

autocorrelation patterns, and we can thus expect that the error terms ε in the productivity

Cobb-Douglas and Translog equations (1) and (2) are also spatially autocorrelated. To take

account of such a spatial autocorrelation, we rely on the spatial econometrics methods as

developed in ANSELIN [1988], LESAGE [2000] or LE GALLO [2002]. After various

experimentations, we have focused on the Spatial Autoregressive Regression (SAR) estimated

by maximum likelihood. The SAR specification performs better than the usual regression as

estimated by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), that is when tested against the null hypothesis of

no spatial autocorrelation (ρ = 0). It is also performs better when tested against the Spatial

Error Model (SEM) in the framework the Spatial General Model (SGM) encompassing both

the SAR and the SEM specifications. It also does well when tested with the Spatial Durbin

Model (SDM). (See Appendix B for detailed explanations.)



         Tables 3 and 4 give the results of the estimation by maximum likelihood of the

spatial autoregressive regression (SAR) for the Cobb-Douglas and Translog equations

respectively.



      Table 3: Estimates of Cobb-Douglas production function with local R&D spillovers

and

        Table 4: Estimates of Translog production function with local R&D spillovers

                                      (ABOUT HERE)
         Making first a few general observations, we see that for all eight different

regressions that we thought useful to document in these tables, the absence of spatial

autocorrelation is rejected at 5% level, while the Spatial Autoregressive Regression (SAR) is

accepted against the Spatial General Model (SGM). The spatial autocorrelation parameter (i.e.

the coefficient of W*Log(Y/L)) is statistically significant of the order of 0.3 to 0.4 depending

on the regressions. This can be interpreted as indirect evidence of local spillovers effects,

other than the direct evidence provided by the estimates of the R&D capital stocks elasticities.



         We also observe that the general fit of the regressions are strongly improved when

we move from the Cobb-Douglas to the Translog specifications. This is mainly accounted by

the inclusion in the equations of the squared log-variables (and not by the cross-product

terms), as indicated by the likelihood ratio tests. Following the interpretation of such a result

proposed by CREPON-MAIRESSE [1993], we can view it as strong evidence of the

heterogeneity of the production function across individual units: that is for us here across

employment areas. The Translog equation takes explicitly into account such heterogeneity by

including squares and cross-product of the log-variables, contrary to the more parsimonious

Cobb-Douglas equation. Note, however, that, as could be expected, the estimates of average

elasticities (i.e., when computed at the sample means of the variables for the Translog

specification) are all practically the same for both type of equations.



         We find estimates of the average elasticity of physical capital stock β̂ A , which are

both statistically very significant and of a reasonable order of magnitude of 0.25 in all eight

regressions. The Translog estimates show, however, that the elasticity β is far from being

constant across employment areas, increasing strongly with physical capital intensity:

βˆ              (                     )
     0.23 + 0.28 log ( C L ) − log ( C L ) . We also find small but significant increasing returns to
scale ν of about 3 to 5%, which appear to be practically constant across employment areas

(contrary to β).



            Turning now to our parameters of main interest: the elasticities of local and

neighborhood R&D capital, we see first that in all eight regressions the average elasticity of

local R&D capital γ̂ A is as statistically significant as the average elasticity of physical capital

β̂ A , and about equal to 0.03. Such an order of magnitude, which may seem small, is in fact on

the high side of what could be expected. The similar cross-sectional estimates of R&D capital

elasticity performed at the firm level for samples of R&D doing firms in manufacturing

industries are in the range of 0.05 to 0.1015. Considering that only a minority of firms do

R&D, a simplistic guess would be that at the aggregate level of employment areas, the

estimated elasticity of local R&D capital would be a great deal smaller. Finding that it is

actually of about 0.03 is clear evidence for the existence of sizeable R&D spillovers within

employment areas. The Translog estimates show that the elasticity γ, like β, is not constant

across employment areas but is strongly increasing with the intensity of local R&D capital:

γˆ                 (                         )
       0.03 + 0.02 log ( K L ) − log ( K L ) .




            Looking next at the estimates of the average elasticity η̂ A of neighborhood R&D

capital in regressions (2), (4), (7) and (8) where we used our preferred measure K100, we see




15
     See for example CREPON-MAIRESSE [1993] for such cross-sectional estimates for French manufacturing
industries. See also MAIRESSE-SASSENOU [1991] for a survey of both cross-sectional and time series types of
estimates for other countries, which remains representative of the results that can be found in recent studies.
that they are statistically significant and of nearly 0.015, half of the average elasticity        γ̂ A 16.

The Translog estimates show again that the elasticity η is not constant across employment

areas but appears to increase moderately with the intensity of the neighborhood R&D capital.

In regressions (3) and (4), we present two among the different regressions we did in order to

assess approximately the spatial range of R&D spillovers beyond employment areas, using

different measures of neighborhood R&D capital stocks K80, K150, K200 and K250

constructed as the R&D capital stocks of all employment areas in circles of increasing radius

(respectively equal to 80km, 150km, 200km and 250km). We see in regression (3) that the

average elasticity η̂ A becomes not statistically different from zero if we use the broader

definition of neighborhood R&D capital K200 instead of our preferred one K100.

Equivalently, if in addition to Log(K100/L) we include in regression (4) the variable

Log(K200-K100)/L measuring the intensity of R&D capital stocks in the neighboring

employment areas centered in the 100km to 200km ring, we see that this variable is also not

statistically different from zero.




4         Industry R&D Spillovers



            In this section, we attempt both to confirm and be more specific about our findings

on local R&D spillovers by pursuing our analysis at the level of five large manufacturing

industries and by differentiating between own-industry and other-industry R&D spillovers.
16
     Taking for K and K100 their median values (in Table 1) that only differ by 20%, this implies that the
corresponding gross rate of return of neighborhood R&D capital would be about 60% of that of local R&D
capital, which is quite high, still plausible enough.
We have been able to partition our employment area database according to the French one-

digit industry classification NES 16, and we can focus on five large manufacturing industries,

leaving aside trade, transport, services, and other industries which typically invest very little

in R&D. These five broad manufacturing industries are the following: (B) Food and beverage

industries; (C) Consumption good industries; (D) Motor vehicles industries; (E) Equipment

good industries; and (F) Intermediate good industries.



             We are thus now considering a much larger sample of 1538 “industry-employment

area” observations for which we computed, as we did previously for the whole economy, both

an “own-industry” local R&D capital stock (K) and an “own-industry” neighborhood R&D

stock (K100)17. To test whether we could find evidence of R&D spillovers across different

industries, we also defined an “other-industry” local R&D capital stock (Kdif), simply

computed for all industry-employment area observations as the sum of the own-industry local

R&D capital for the four other industries18.



             Table 5 reports the estimates of the R&D capital stocks elasticities of interest for

three regressions of the Translog productivity equation. All three regressions include fixed

industry effects, and the results shown are the usual within-industry OLS estimates, since we

do not find anymore significant evidence in favor of the (SAR) specification in our larger

sample, once we control for industry effects. Regression (9) assumes that all parameters are



17
     We deleted 22 observations (out of 5x312=1560) because of zero own industry local and neighborhood R&D
capital stocks K and K100.
18
     We also computed an “other-industry” neighborhood R&D capital stock (Kdif100); however the regression
estimates of the corresponding elasticities were very small and non significant, and not worthwhile to be reported
here. The same observation applies for the estimates we obtained when we tried to include in the regressions
separately the logs of the “own-industry” local R&D capital stocks for the other industries, as four additional
separate variables instead of the log of their sum Log(Kdif).
equal across industry (except for the industry fixed effects), while regression (10) only

restricts the R&D capital elasticities to be equal across industry, and regression (11) also

allows the R&D capital elasticities to be industry specific. The within-industry OLS estimates

of regression (11) are thus the same as the OLS ones, when estimating it separately for each

five industries. The complete estimates for regression (11), including the elasticities for

physical capital, are recorded in Table C1 in Appendix C.




 Table 5: Estimates of Translog production function with local and industry R&D spillovers

                                        (ABOUT HERE)




         Looking first at the χ2 tests of equality of the R&D capital stocks elasticities in

regression (11), as well as the likelihood ratio tests of the fully pooled and semi-pooled

regressions (9) and (10) against the more general regression(11), the evidence goes in favor of

the latter specification. However, it also appears that the specification of regression (10) is

mainly rejected because of very significant industry differences in the estimated elasticities of

the local R&D capital Log(K/L). Actually, the estimates of the five other R&D capital

elasticities in the Translog equation, that is for Log(Kdif/L), Log(K100/L), Log(K/L)2,

Log(Kdif/L)2 and Log(K100/L)2 are not statistically different across industry at the 5% (or

more) confidence level.



         Focusing now on the magnitude of the estimates, we see that the average elasticity

γ̂ A of the local R&D capital, as estimated for all five industries in regressions (9) an (10), is

again statistically very significant (as when estimated for the overall French business non
agricultural economy in the previous section), but that it is of a much higher order of

magnitude of about 0.09 (as against 0.03 before). This important difference in size is largely

explained by the fact that we are now considering manufacturing industries only19. We also

see that the elasticity γ is not constant across industry and employment areas and that it is

increasing as before, but even more strongly, with the intensity of local R&D capital:

                     (                      )
γ̂ = 0.09 + 0.05 log ( K L ) − log ( K L ) . We find, however, when considering regression (11),


that the estimated average elasticity γ̂ A can be quite different across industries. It is

significantly higher, of about 0.21, in the Motor vehicles industries, but falls in the range of

0.05 to 0.10 in the other industries. It is noteworthy that the average elasticity γ̂ A remains

statistically different from zero at the 1% confidence level, except in the Food industries

where it only significant at the 10% confidence level. It is also interesting to observe that the

elasticity γ tends to be significantly increasing with local R&D capital intensity Log(K/L)

even within industry.



            The estimates of the average elasticity η̂ A of the neighborhood R&D capital in

regressions (9) and (10) remain statistically significant as before, but with the same order of

magnitude of 0.015 (or perhaps just slightly higher), contrary to the average elasticity

estimate γ̂ A . We also find a moderate tendency for the elasticity η to increase with the

intensity of neighborhood R&D capital. We observe in regression (11) that the industry

estimates of η do not statistically differ and are roughly constant across industries, again

contrary to the corresponding estimates γ for local R&D capital.

19
     It is also explained by the related fact that γ̂ A is now measured at a different sample average value

log ( K L ) of the local R&D capital intensity, which is much higher for manufacturing industries than for the

overall business economy.
             Finally, we only find weak evidence that local spillovers are not only industry

specific, but are also significant and sizeable across different industries. The estimated

elasticities of other-industry local R&D capital (Kdif) in regressions (9) and (10) are just

significant at the 5% level of confidence and of about 0.01, that is much smaller by a factor of

nearly 10 than the estimated elasticities of own-industry local R&D capital (K). In regression

(11) we see that the elasticities of other-industry local R&D capital are significant and of

about 0.02 for two industries out of the five: consumption goods and equipment goods

industries20.




5         Conclusion



             This note is a contribution to the existing literature on the effects of local R&D

spillovers on productivity in their geographic and industrial dimensions. Our estimations of

Cobb-Douglas and Translog extended production functions with local and neighborhood

R&D capital are performed at the level of some 300 employment areas for the French non

agricultural business economy as a whole in 1999. They are also generalized for five broad

manufacturing industries, using a larger sample of some 1500 observations crossing industry

and employment area data. Even though R&D investments are very highly concentrated in a

few employment areas around Paris and other large French cities, we find statistically


20
     Using data at the level of the 94 French departments for 11 manufacturing industries from 1992 to 2000,
AUTANT-BERNARD, LESAGE [2008] find evidence of stronger cross-industry effects of private R&D
activity on patenting than we do here for productivity.
significant and large but plausible spillover effects of local R&D capital on productivity. In

addition to these effects, we also find statistically significant but smaller effects for

neighborhood R&D capital in the neighboring employment areas extending on average as far

as 100km but not beyond. We also observe that these effects are not constant across

employment areas, but increase very significantly with R&D capital intensity. These findings

are strongly confirmed at the industry-employment area level, which show that local R&D

spillovers tend to be mostly industry specific, while the evidence for R&D spillovers across

different industries is much weaker.



             Although surprisingly good and robust, our results should still be considered as

exploratory in view of many shortcomings related mainly to the data, and in particular its

cross-sectional nature, and the consequences in terms of econometric modeling and

estimation. Data on comparable cross-sectional employment areas data for a few number of

years, and least one more recent year than 1999 would be very useful, but the data

construction is complex and costly. An analysis at a more detail industry classification level

might also be possible, though difficult. Investigating localized data at the establishment

level, and preferably panel data, is a priori the preferable way to go; however, it also has its

own important problems.21

Moran's coefficients of spatial autocorrelation and the z-tests of no spatial
autocorrelation are respectively shown in normal characters and in italic characters
(in parentheses). Both are distributed as the standard normal variable under the
null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. Under this hypothesis the expected
value of Moran's coefficients of spatial autocorrelation is equal to (-1/N) where N is
the number of observations (i.e. = -1/312 =-0.003), and their standard errors
depend on the contiguity matrix. They are respectively 0.034 , 0.021 , 0.023 and
0.028 for W1, W2, W3 and W4.
W1 = Contiguity Matrix based on Immediately Neighboring Employment Areas
W2 = Contiguity Matrix based on Neighboring Employment Areas in a Circle of
100 km
W3 = Contiguity Matrix based on the Inverse of Geographical Distance
W4 = Contiguity Matrix based on the Inverse of the Square of Geographical
Distance

Measurement of local and neighborhood R&D capital variables



           The R&D data we use to measure the R&D capital stocks at the employment area

level are provided by the annual surveys on firms’ R&D expenditures conducted by the

statistical office of The French Ministry of Research since the seventies. In these surveys,

since 1993, firms which have several laboratories or research centers are asked to report the

geographical decomposition of their total internal R&D expenditures and total number of

R&D workers by French “departments” (NUTS 3 level). We use this decomposition together

with the postal addresses of firms’ establishments to determine the localization of their R&D

expenditures and number of workers at the very detailed level of the some 36 000 French

“communes” or municipalities. These estimates are then summed up to the level of the 341

employment areas which are aggregates of municipalities.



           The local R&D capital stocks (K) at the beginning of year 1999 are estimated by the

permanent inventory method applied on the basis of the past internal R&D expenditures (R)

so obtained for the six years 1993 – 1998, after deflation by an overall R&D price index and

after depreciation assuming a constant depreciation rate δ of 15 %, that is using the following

formula:




                                                                                            31
                                              1998

                                              ∑ (1 − δ)
                                                       1998 − τ    Rτ
                                  K 1999 =                                                (A-1)
                                             τ =1993              PτRD



             Note that we did not try to make any adjustment for the unknown initial stock of

R&D capital in 1993, since this should not affect noticeably our cross-sectional estimates of

the R&D capital elasticities of interest here. With a rate of depreciation δ of 15 %, it is also

the case that about 38 % of the R&D capital stock at the beginning of 1992 is not depreciated

at the beginning of 1999, which will represent about 28 % of the R&D capital stock at the

beginning of year 1999, when assuming that R&D investments have been growing at an

average annual growth rate of 5 %.



             The neighborhood R&D capital stock (K100) for any given employment area is

simply computed by summing up the R&D capital stocks (K) in the employment areas which

are in a circle of 100 km around this given area. In this procedure, we assume that all the

R&D capital of an employment area is localized at its geographical center. Precisely, we have

constructed a matrix A100 which indicates if the distance between two employment areas i and

j is less then 100 km:



                                                    ⎧1 if 0 < dist (i, j ) ≤ 100km
                         [ ]
                 A100 = ai , j   such that ai , j = ⎨                                    (A-2)
                                                    ⎩0 otherwise



             Denoting by K the vector of local capital stock for all employment areas and by

K100 the corresponding vector of neighborhood capital stock, we can compute simply the

latter as:




                                                                                             32
                                    K100 = A100 K                                        (A-3)



         Note that by construction the matrix A100 is symmetric and the coefficients of its

main diagonal are zeros. Note also that this matrix is not row-standardized as a classical

spatial weight matrix since K100 is defined as the sum (not the average) of the local R&D

capital stocks K for the neighboring areas.



To assess approximately the spatial range of R&D spillovers we have also considered

different measures of neighborhood R&D capital stocks, based on alternative choices of

distance between the geographical centers of an employment area and its neighboring areas.

Besides using K100, we have thus experimented with K80, K150, K200 and K250, costructed

as the R&D capital stocks of all employment areas in circles of increasing radius (respectively

equal to 80km, 150km, 200km and 250km). See Table 3 where we report different estimates

of the Cobb-Douglas productivity equation using respectively K100 and K200 alone, and both

K100 and (K200 – K100).




                                                                                            33

             Brief overview of spatial econometric methods


         We use the classical spatial econometrics method developed by ANSELIN [1988],

LESAGE [2000] or LE GALLO [2002]. We can treat the error terms as a first-order spatial

autocorrelation process to give the Spatial Error Model (SEM), but we prefer to add the spatial

lag of the dependent variable as an additional explanatory variable and consider the Spatial

Autoregressive Regression (SAR), or spatial lag model. If we write y the vector of

observations on the dependent variable, X the matrix of the regressors, and W the contiguity

matrix, the (SAR) model can be written as:



                                   y = ρWy + Xβ + ε                                      (B-1)




This model cannot be consistently estimated by least-squares because it includes the spatially

lagged dependent variable as a regressor. We have instead to rely on the maximum likelihood

method. Assuming normality of the error term:



                                (I − ρW )y − Xβ = ε ≈ N (0, σ I )
                                                             2




the log likelihood function is the following:




                                                                                            34

                                                 N

                                                        ( )
                                       log(2π ) − log σ 2 − log I − ρW

                                   − 2 ((I − ρW )y − Xβ ) ((I − ρW )y − Xβ) ⎤

Using the transformation proposed by ORD [1975], the log of the determinant |I – ρW| can be

computed as:




                                   log I − ρW = ∑ log(1 − ρωi )
                                                 N


                                                 i =1




where ωi are the eigenvalues of the contiguity matrix W, which can be computed themselves

once for all in the iterative maximization procedure. The global solution for maximization of

log likelihood function is quite fast using a Matlab estimation program software adapted from

the routines provided by James LESAGE on the web site: http://www.spatial-

econometrics.com/.



         Following ANSELIN [1988] or ANSELIN-BERA-FLORAX-YOON [1996] and

using Lagrange multiplier tests, we perform various specification tests of the SAR

specification against other specifications. First of all, we can test the (SAR) regression for the

null of no spatial autocorrelation (ρ = 0), that is against the usual regression as estimated by

Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). We can also test the (SAR) model against a more general

model called the Spatial Generalized Model (SGM), which allows spatial autocorrelation in

the error term, and thus encompass the SEM specification as well as the SAR specification.

The SGM model can be written as:



                       y = ρWy + Xβ + u        with u = λWu + ε                             (B-2)


                                                                                               35
or also as the following second order spatial autoregressive model:



                 y = (ρ + λ )W y + ρ λ W W y + X β − W X λ β + ε                         (B-3)




with one cofactor restriction on the parameters of the spatial lagged regressors. When there is

no lagged dependent variable (ρ = 0), the spatial error model (SEM) is again obtained as:




                              y = λWy + Xβ − WXλβ + ε                                    (B-4)




         Finally without the cofactor restriction, we obtain a model proposed by Durbin,

called the Spatial Durbin Model (SDM), which can be tested against the previous SEM:



                               y = λWy + Xβ + WXγ + ε                                    (B-5)




         Figure B1 summarizes the relations between the usual (non spatial) regression (OLS)

and the four spatial regression models: SEM, SAR, SGM and SDM. We have tested that the

SAR specification was preferable to the OLS and SEM specifications and was an acceptable

restriction to the SGM and SDM specifications.




                                                                                            36
