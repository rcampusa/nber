        The   Impact of Unions on the Labor Market for White and Minority Youth


                                        ABSTRACT




        This paper presents estimates of the effects of unions on the wages of
young black and white males who are both union and nonunion workers. It also
presents      estimates of union effects on employment for these groups, as well as
their    union membership rates. While unions have a very substantial, positive

effect on the wages of young union workers, particularly for young blacks, they

have a negative effect on the wages of young blacks who are not unionized. The

effects of unions on employment are negative for both groups and especially

for blacks.

        As for the relative access to unionized employment, young blacks within

the labor force have membership rates that are roughly comparable to those of

young whites. However, rates for young blacks appear to be somewhat lower

after accounting for differences in rates of labor force participation

between young blacks and whites. Young blacks also continue to be under—

represented in the crafts and construction industries, which are heavily

unionized,     while being overrepresented in the relatively nonunionized,
low—wage service sector. These results suggest that increasing the access of
young blacks to unionized employment would improve their positions in the
labor   market.

          To analyze the impact of unions on the youth labor market in general,

 and on the minority youth market in particular, three distinct groups must

 be considered: employed workers who are union members, employed workers
                                          1/
 who are nonunion, and the unemployed.         The impact of unions will then de-

 pend on their effects on the wages of both union and nonunion workers, their

 effects on overall employment, and the numbers of young blacks and whites who
                            2/
 obtain union membership.        When all of these factors are considered together,

 unions might either mitigate or exacerbate differentials between young blacks

and whites in wages and employment that would exist in their absence because

of discrimination and/or differences in abilities and skills.

         The purpose of this paper is to estimate the wage and employment ef-

fects of unions for young black and white males, comparing them to each other
                                                             3/
and to older cohorts in the black and white populations.          To do this, I

present a theoretical framework that considers the effects of unionism

on the supply of and demand for labor, and consequently on wages and employment.

I then estimate wage equations that contain independent variables for union

membership of individuals, as well as separate equations for union and nonunion

workers which consider the proportions of individual's SMSA (Standard Metropoli-

tan Statistical Area) that are unionized.4' The proportion unionized variable,

when used in a sample that includes only nonunion workers, provide estimates of

the   impact   of unions on the nonunion sector. The SMSA variable is also included

in the employment equations that are estimated.

         All of these equations contain controls for the personal characteristics

of these individuals, and some contain controls for other characteristics of

SMSAs that are correlated with the proportion unionized. The equations are es-

timated separately for black and white males, ages 16 through 24, as well as for
                                       —2—



older white and black males. Most of the wage equations are estimated only for

blue—collar workers, and consider only the proportion unionized among produc-

tion workers; the employment equations, on the other hand, are estimated for

the entire population of each group and consider proportion unionized for all

workers.

       I also compare the abilities of young blacks and whites to obtain

union membership by analyzing the percentage unionized of different age groups

across regions, occupations, and educational groups. Finally, I use some of

these estimates to compute the aggregate effects of unions on the wages and

employment of the young white and black populations as a whole.

        The main results of this analysis can be surimiarized as follows:

        1.   The union—nonunion wage differential is larger for young workers

       than for older ones, and it is somewhat larger for young blacks than

       for young whites.

       2. The proportion of unionization in an SMSA raises wages for young

       black and white union members and also for white nonunion workers;

       but wages of young nonunion blacks fall in heavily unionized SMSAs.

       3. Employment falls for white youth and especially for black youth

       as the proportion of unionization in an SMSA rises.

       4. The rates of union membership in the labor force as a whole, and

       within most educational, occupational, and regional subgroups, are

       quite similar for young blacks and whites. However, the rates for

       blacks appear to be lower after accounting for differences in rate of

       labor force participation between young blacks and whites. Further-

       more, young blacks continue to be underrepresented in the heavily

       unionized crafts and in the construction industry, while being over—

       represented in the relatively nonunionized, low—wage service sector.

         5. Changes in economy—wide rates of union organization would raise

         the overall wages and lower employment for both young blacks and

         whites.

         In the first section of the paper, the theoretical implications of

 unions for wages and employment of young blacks and whites are discussed. The

 second section presents the results of the various wage and employment equa—

 tions that are computed. The third section contains union membership figures

 for various groups in the young black and white populations. In the fourth

 section, results from the previous two sections are used to compute the net

effects of unions on wages and employment for these populations. The fifth

section contains a summary and some conclusions.



I.   Theoretical Implications of Unions

        In its simplest version, neoclassical theory predicts that unions

raise wages and lower employment along an aggregate demand curve for labor.

Youth employment would be especially reduced, since unions would eliminate

the low—wage jobs that would otherwise be available to young people.

       When the union and nonunion sectors are considered separately, the

situation becomes more complex. Johnson and Mieszkowski were the first to

use a general equilibrium model to determine the impact of unions on wages
                          5/
in the nonunion sector.        In their model, the restricted demand for labor

in the union sector produces an excess supply of labor in the nonunion sector

which, in a general equilibrium model, depresses wages there.6' There are, how-

ever, other effects which may counteract the excess supply of labor. These

include: (1) a higher demand for the products of nonunion firms and therefore

a higher demand for labor there; (2) a possible net movement o capital to the

nonunion sector; and (3) a threat effect" whereby nonunion employers raise
                                             —4—



 wages to preclude the possibility of union organization within       their   own   firms.
 The first effect occurs because unions raise the costs of production and there-

 fore the prices of goods in the union sector above those in the nonunion sector,

 which shifts product demand from the former to the latter. The second effect

 occurs only if: a) the union sector is relatively more capital—intensive than

 the nonunion sector, and b) the elasticity of substitution in the production

 process of the union sector is low. If both of these conditions are met, the

movement of capital to the union sector as a substitute for labor in the pro-

duction process (i.e., the "substitution effect") may be dominated by the move-

ment of both labor and capital to the nonunion sector because of the shifting

demand to that sector (i.e., the "scale effect"). But even when these condi-

tions are not met, the "threat effect" may still raise nonunion wages above

what they would be in the absence of unions.

        These effects can be better illustrated through the formula for the

elasticity of labor demand in an industry that faces an infinitely elastic

supply of capital:

        (1)         =
                        afl   + (1 —

where         is the elasticity of the demand for labor with respect to the wage

rate in industry j; c. is the proportion of total production costs accruing

to labor; ii. is the price elasticity of demand for the products of industry j;

and o. is the elasticity of substitution in production for that industry. For

a given proportional wage increase            in the union sector, employment there


declines by the proportion             .   The direct shift in demand to the nonunion


sector will raise employment by               <         ; thus, this effect above


cannot fully offset the shift in labor supply.7' But for o. sufficiently low,
                                        —5---




 capital will be diverted to the nonunion firms of industry j, and the wages

of workers in these firms will be higher in the presence of unionism in this

 industry than in its absence. A "threat effect" might further reinforce this

result.

          But this analysis is simplistic because it assumes that the union and

nonunion sectors are both parts of the same ndustry. It is more likely that

the excess supply of labor falls in industries other than j which happen to be

located in the same geographical area as the unionized firms of industry j; and

the demand effect will then be less useful in counteracting it. For the shift

in demand now depends on the cross—price elasticity xjk rather than fl., i.e.,
                                                   dw.
demand will rise in the nonunion sector by      xik— rather than by dw.
                                                                     a1
                                                    w.                    w.
                                                     J                     J
It is quite likely that ik    < i'.; for   many industries (e.g., the trade and

service industries), the cross—price elasticity of their products with respect

to those of heavily unionized industries are likely to be quite low. Therefore,

the level of unionism in the geographical unit which constitutes the local labor

market is highly relevant for the nonunion worker there, independently of the level

of unionism in his industry. It is the former through which unions affect labor

supply in the nonunion sector, and the latter through which they affect labor

demand. Thus, when controlling for the level of unionism in the area, the impact

of the level of unionism in an industry on the wages of a nonunion worker there

should be positive, reflecting only demand and threat effects, while the impact

of unionism in the area will depend on the relative strengths of the negative

supply effect and positive threat effect.8" It should be noted that threat

effects can exist for both the industry and the area; the use of industry and

area wage surveys by large firms in determining their wages lends support to

this view. It should also be noted that area unionism is much more likely to

affect blue—collar than white collar workers since unionism is more prevalent
                                           —6—




 among the former and since the local labor market is generally more relevant

 for supply of the former than the latter.

        By focusing on unionism within areas instead of industries, this anal-

 ysis can be extended to a disequilibrium context; i.e., one in which wage

 rigidities prevent the excess supply of labor from being fully employed at

 a lower wage in the nonunion sector. This possibility is illustrated in

Figure 1 below.

                                                                                L



       [n   the absence of unions, wages are W0 and employment is L0 in

each sector. But unions raise wages in the union sector to       and restrict

employment to L. With the rightward shift in the supply of nonunion

labor, employment there would have to rise to L to keep the overall level

of employment at its preunion level; this would occur only if the supply

of labor were perfectly inelastic and if wages fell to W3. With an elas-

tic supply of labor, wages would fall to W2 and employment would rise to

L2 in this sector; there would be no observed unemployment, but a lower over-

all labor force participation rate and therefore a lower employment/popula-

tion ratio would result.
                                       —7—



        The introduction of wage rigidities causes unemployment in the labor

 force as well as lower overall employment. If wages fall only to W1, un-

 employment will be L — L1.   In this case, nonunion wages will be lower and

 unemployment will be higher than in the absence of unions. It i also pos-

 sible that wages will remain at W0 in the nonunion sector, causing unemploy-

 ment to rise to L — L0; or that wages will fise to W because of the threat

 effect, causing unemployment to rise to L —   L.
         Finally, it is likely that wage and employment effects will be stronger

 in some groups than for others. In particular, young workers, and especially

young blacks should be among the most seriously affected by the excess supply

of labor in the nonunion sector. With a shortage of jobs there, young people

will be absorbed into the labor force more slowly than might otherwise be

the case, and the large number of labor force entrants and reentrants would

raise unemployment significantly. Young union members might also have   hiher
unemployment, since seniority provisions favor older members and therefore

raise the likelihood of layoff for younger members.

       As for young blacks, their problems may be compounded by lower skills

and/or discrimination. Affirmative Action programs may be less effective

in the nonunion sector, wnere establishment size is generally smaller and

compliance more difficult to enforce than in the union sector. Therefore,

young blacks may be less likely to find employment in this sector than young

whites, and only at lower wages when it is found.



II. Estimation of Wage and Employment Equations

       The first issue to be addressed by empirical analysis is the degree

to which unions do, in fact, raise the wages of young black and white union-

ists above those of nonunionfsts.    Table 1 presents means and standard
                                                —8—



 deviations of wages in the union and nonunion sectors as well as the re—

 suits of wage equations that were estimated using the data on individuals from

 the Current Population Survey (CPS) of May, 1978. The equations are of

 the usual semilog form:

        (2)   2,nW. =       aX.1 + bUN.
                                      1 + e
                 1


 Where W is the individual's hourly wage, X1'iis a vector of the ith indivi-

 dual's characteristics, UN is a dummy variable representing union member-

 ship, and e is the error. The coefficient b can be interpreted as

 2n(W
    U
      /W) =   2nW
                    u
                        —   2nflu ;   i.e., as the proportional union/nonunion wage

differential. Both the means and the equations are estimated separately

for whites and blacks aged 16 through 24 and for those who are older;

there are also separte equations for all workers and for blue—collar work-

ers.

        Part B of Table 1 shows that union wage differentials are larger for

young workers than for older workers. They are also larger for blacks than

for whites in both the younger and older cohorts, although the difference

for the younger is just marginally significant.1 The larger differential

for blacks does not, of course, imply that blacks earn wages within unions

that are higher or even equivalent to those of whites; it may only mean that

there is less racial inequality in the union sector than in the nonunion

one. The latter notion is tested explicitly with the estimation of wage

equations that include a dummy variable for being black rather than for

union membership:

       "             = aX       + cR + U1


Equation (3) is estimated separately for the union and nonunion sectors as

well as for the different age groups and occupational groups, but blacks and
                                           —9—



 whites are included together in the sample.

          Part C of Table 1 shows that racial
                                                   wage differentials among young

 blue—collar workers persist in both the union and nonunion sectors, and that

 the differential appears to be somewhat larger among nonunion workers. For

 older workers in both the union and nonunion sectors racial differentials

 also exist, with larger differentials once again evident among nonunion workers.

         The effects of proportion unionized on wages are estimated separately

 for white and black union and nonunion workers, ages 16 through 24 and 25 through

 64 in the blue—collar sector. The impact of proportion unionized on wages is

 first estimated without controlling for other labor supply and demand shift

 factors in the following equation:

         (4)   thW.
                  ik   aX. + fP + e.
                         ik     k     ik
where Wik is the wage of the ithinclividual in the kth SMSA. k is the proportion

of production workers unionized in an individual's SMSA.11'         The equations are

estimated only for workers who reside in the largest 98 SMSAs since these are

the only ones for which estimates of proportion unionized are available.

        This limiting of the sample also creates a need for more observations,

particularly among young blacks. Therefore, the equations are estimated from

the merged CPS files of May 1973—75 and also of May 1976—78 for young workers..

Results from both data sets are presented here because of differences between
                                                 1"!
the two sets of estimates for young blacks.            The results, as well as means

and standard deviations on wages, are presented in Table 2.

        The proportion unionized in an SMSA has a significant, positive effect

on the wages of union members for all race and age groups. But for nonunion

workers, the impact of proportion unionized in an SISA is generally less posi—

tive than for union workers; and for young, nonunion blacks the impact on wages

is strongly negative. This is true even for the coefficient in the 1976—78

  sample, which is not significant because of the small sample size for young

  blacks.

            In order to look more closely at the relationship of union and non-

  union wages to proportion of an SMSA unionized
                                                      for young workers; the SMSAs
 are divided into four discrete
                                   categories of proportion organized among pro-

 duction workers. Mean wages of young, blue—collar whites and blacks in

 these categories are shown in Table 3. The wages of black union members

 show some upward movement, Particularly in the earlier sample. But for
                                                                        non-
 union blacks a fairly strong downward trend is evident in both samples.

        These results do not change substantially when controlling for some

 other labor supply and demand shift factors for an SMSA. The results of the

 following equation are shown in Table 4 for young black and white nonunion

 workers:

        (5) 2nW.k         aXIk + fDk ÷   gS   + eik

where Dk and Sk are vectors of labor demand and supply shift factors for

the kth SMSA, respectively. The demand shift factors include the overall

unemployemnt rate; and index of industry structure that weights the propor-

tion of each industry's national employment that is accounted for by young

people by the proportion of each SMSA's employment that the industry accounts

for; and the average annual rate of growthQf per capita income for the SMSA

between 1960 and 1970. Supply shift factors other than proportion unionized

are the proportions of blacks and teenagers in the population.        The propor-
tion of female—headed households is also included to control for potential
                                                       13/
"neighborhood effects" on labor supply and demand.           All of these factors

are considered exogenous with respect to the individual's wages.

       In order to deal with the differences in estimates between the two

samples, Parts A and B in Table 4 present estimates of
                                                             equation (5) that are

 then presents averages of the two esimtaes based on the following formulae:

                         1         2                  1    2


 where f is the coefficient on proportion unionized, SE is its standard error,

 and the subscripts refer to the different samples. The formulae are based on

 a Bayesian procedure that weights each individual coefficient by the standard

error of the other in producing an average of the two.

       Table 4 shows that the effect of proportion unionized in an SHSA on

the wages of young, nonunion blacks remains substantially negative even after

controlling for the other supply and demand characteristics of SMSAs. The

second column in the table presents results from an equation in which the

continuous proportion unionized variable is replaced by dummies for the dis--

Crete categories used in the previous table. The results for blacks are

fairly consistent with those of Table 3; the drop in wages is clearly seen

here for the third and fourth categories. For young, nonunion whites, on

the other hand, there appears to be a significant positive effect of propor-

tion unionized on wages when controlling for supply and demand shift factors.

       Turning now to the effects of unionization on employment, Table 5

shows the results of employment equations which take the following form:

       (7)    E.
               ik
                  =Y.
                    ik
                       +hPk +e.ik

where Eik is a dummy for employment of the ith individual in the kth SNSA;

ik is a vector of personal characteristics which omits those characteristics

of Xik that are only defined for the employed (e.g., occupation and industry);

and k is the proportion of all workers in an SMSA who are unionized)'

Equation (7) is therefore a linear probability model for the employment of

an individual.1' It is estimated separately for older white and black males

 using    the CPS tapes of May 1976 and March 1978; while for younger males the

 Survey of Income and Employment (SIE) from March 1976 and the CPS of March

 1978 are used. The STE is basically a larger version of the March CPS of that

 year; it is used once again because of the sample size problems for young

 males.

          Table 5 shows that the proportion of'n SMSA that is unionized has

 a negative effect on employment for everyone except older black males, The

effects on the young are stronger than those on the older groups for either

race, and the strongest effect appears to be that for young blacks, especially

in the 1978 sample.

          Table 6 shows the employment/population ratios for young white and

black males in each of the four categories of proportion unionized. It

shows a decline in employment for both whites and blacks in each data set

as unionism rises. The decline is sharper for blacks than for whites, par-

ticularly in the fourth category. It is also interesting to note that em-

ployment increases between 1976 and 1978 in all categories for whites, but

it decreases for blacks in all categories except the first one, This ex-

plains the sharp rise in the magnitude of the negative coefficient on unionism

for blacks between 1976 and 1978; it also suggests a secular worsening of the

employment situation for young blacks in the heavily unionized areas,

          The linear probability models for employment of young whites and

blacks    are also estimated in equations of the following form:
          (8)   Eik     aY.k +   jDk
                                       +   +   efk

where Dk and S.       use   the vectors of labor demand and supply shift factors as
before.    Among the personal characteristics controlled for here are a family

income variable, a dummy variable for not living with parents, and interaction

between the two, and a dummy for being part of a family that receives welfare.

        The results are shown in Table 7. As before, Part C shows a weighted

 average of the results presented from the tapes in Parts A and B. The first

 column shows large and significant negative effects on employment for young

 whites in both samples. The black coefficient from the 1976 samples is of

 approximately the same magnitude as the coefficient for whites, although the

 smaller black sample causes a standard error which is larger on the former.

 From the 1978 sample the black coefficient remains more highly negative than

 that for whites, as does the weighted average in Part C. The second column

 shows results from an equation which contains dummies for porportion organized

 categories rather than a continuous variable. The results from each sample

 show a definite drop in employment in the fourth category which is sharper

 for blacks than for whites.

       To summarize, high rates of unionization in SMSAs appear to raise

wages for white and black unionists and also for nonunion whites, but its

effect on the wages of nonunion blacks appears to be quite negative. The

unionization of an SMSA also has a strong negative effect on the employment

of young whites and especially young blacks. These effects persist even

when controlling for various other characteristics of labor supply arid demand

in an SMSA. Of course, the controls may be incomplete; but the evidence

strongly suggests that unions lower both the wages and employment of young,

nonunion blacks, especially relative to their white counterparts.

       There are two potential explanations Of this relative decline in

both wages and employment for nonunion blacks; each explanation is consistent

with the supply shift theory presented above. The first would imply a greater

shift in the supply of labor for blacks and for whites; the second would imply

a queue of unemployed in which whites obtain employment more quickly and at

higher wages than blacks because of better skills and/or discrimination. The

 two explanations are certainly not mutually exclusive and there is evi—

dence in support of both. The first explanation is consistent with the

evidence of higher union wage effects for blacks presented here and by
               16 /
Ashenfelter;          but it is unlikely that the differential favorihg young

blacks in Table 1 is great enough to fully explain the large relative de-

cline in both wages and employment for nonu'nion young blacks. The first

explanation is also consistent with the evidence presented below of lower

access to unionized jobs for young blacks than for young whites in heavily

unionized areas, thereby creating a greater supply of nonunion blacks. The

second explanation is consistent with evidence of a longer duration of non—

employment for young blacks than for young whites. 17/



III. Union Membership Rates for Young Blacks and Whites

         Until now, the impact of unions on wages of young blacks and whites

in both the union and nonunion sectors have been considered. It is also

important to consider the distribution of young blacks and whites between

these sectors, as well as the implications of the distribution for the

access of blacks to unionized employment. There is a rather extensive

literature that describes the history of blacks in unions; it focuses on

the exclusion of blacks from many craft unions in      the    early years of the

AFL, and the inclusion of blacks in the mass—production industrial unions

of the ClO during the 1930s and 1940s. This literature also describes

the demise of "formal exclusion" in the l950s and 1960s, and the persis-

tence of "informal exclusion" of blacks, particularly from the construc—
                       18/
tion craft unions.           More recently there has been discussion of "re—

cruitment" and "screening" barriers faced by young blacks which limit
                                                             19 /

their   employment in both craft and industrial unions.             There has also
                                          —22—




 been a growing literature on the effects of various legal and institution—

 al remedies for informal exclusion, such as the proliferation of court

 imposed timetables for integration of construction craft locals across
              20/
 the country.     But this literature has largely been from a leal rather

 than an empirical perspective. It is therefore important to consider

 rates of union membership for younger and order blacks and whites across

 various occupational, regional, and demographic groups.

        Union membership rates were computed for blacks and whites between

 the ages of 16 and 24 as well as for three older cohorts from the CPS for

May 1978. The results appear in Table 8. Membership is lowest in the

youngest cohort for both races; this is especially true for blacks, who

have experienced rapid growth of educational attainment and white—collar

employment relative to older cohorts. Within the youngest cohort, blacks

have slightly higher overall union membership rates than whites, but the

difference is not statistically significant. For young blue—collar workers,

only black service employees have significantly higher membership rates.

Union membership is also higher for young blacks among white—collar work-

ers; high school and college graduates; residents of the Northeast and

North Central regions; as well as residents of central cities. Of course,

some part of the rather large regional and urban membership differential

is probably due to higher concentration of blacks in blue—collar occupa-

tions and higher rates of unionism within the white—collar and service

sectors. It is important to note that higher rates of unionism for whites

in construction and among blue—collar workers in general characterize

older cohorts but not the younger ones.

       However, these results must be qualified in two ways. For one

thing, membership rates computed only for those in the labor force ig-

nore the higher rates of nonparticipation among young blacks than among

  young whites. When membership is calculated for the entire population

  rather than   just the labor force, the total rate for   young whites becomes
 l2.l7   while that for young blacks becomes 10.8%. It is also likely that,

 if such adjustments were made for specific demographic groups, large and

 significant differentials favoring whites would emerge. For instance,

 the membership differential favoring young whites without high school

 diplomas over their black counterparts would probably become quite sig-

 nificant if rates within educational groups were adjusted for differences

 in participation.

         The second problem that needs to be noted here is that, although

 membership rates within occupational groups are comparable for young whites

 and blacks, their distributions between these occupations remain quite

dissimilar. Calculations performed on data for the CPS of May 1978 show

 that 19.7% of young whites who are employed in the private sector are

craftsmen and 11.7% work in construction. The corresponding figures for

young blacks are 10.5% and 8.5%, respectively. The differentials favor-

ing whites in these well—paying, heavily unionized sectors therefore persist

despite the major efforts made by courts in the past decade to impose

timetables for black entry into construction craft union locals. The

data also show that only 13.9% of young whites in the private sector

are employed in service occupations, which are often low—paying and less

heavily unionized; the figure for young blacks is 21.8%. Thus the ab-

sence of membership differentials within most blue—collar occupations does

not imply equal access to the occupations themselves for young blacks.

         The continued low concentration of young blacks in construction

and the crafts is particularly puzzling in light of the relatively high
                                                21/
enrollment in craft apprenticeship programs.          It is clear, then, that
                                         —25—




 many black apprentices do not ultimately achieve journeymen status or em-

 ployment in the skill crafts. There appear to be two closely related ex-

 planations for this result: (1) unionized construction has been depressed

 in the North throughout the 1970s, thereby decreasing the number of open-

 ings available for young craftsmen of either race, and (2) the monitoring

 and enforcing of federally designed or court imposed timetables for craft

 locals and contractors has been weak and realtively unsuccessful.    Thus,

 when openings become available they are more often filled by young whites

 entering through informal channels than by blacks who travel the formal
                         22/
 apprenticeship route.

            Finally, the relative ability of young blacks to obtain union

 membership as overall union membership rises in an SMSA is analyzed in

 Table 9.    This table shows that the proportion of employed workers that is

 unionized is higher for blacks than for whites in each of the categories

 of proportion unionized. However, the proportion of the overall population

 that is unionized is lower for blacks in all but one category, and is sub-

 stantially lower in the category with the highest overall leval of unionism.

It therefore seems as though black access may not be keeping pace with over-

all rates of unionism in the heavily unionized SMSAs.



IV. The Overall Effects of Union Organization for Young Blacks and Whites

       Given the effects of unions on wages in the union and nonunion sectors

and an employment for young blacks and whites; and given their respective

rates of union membership; the overall effects of union organization on wages

and employment for these groups can be calculated. The wage of employed young

blacks can be written as a geometrically weighted average of their union and

nonunion wages:

       The calculations were performed for the sample of young white and

black, blue—collar workers in the largest 98 SMSAs. The effects of

changes in unionism on nonunion wages can be obtained from Table 4; the

coefficients from the first column we used here. The effects on union

wages we obtained from the first column of Table 2. The union—nonunion

wage differential in logs is obtained from the coefficients presented in

Table 1. Changes in union membership for young blacks and whites that occur

with changes in overall rates of unions were obtained from a simple regres-

sion of union membership for individuals on rates of unions in their respec-

tive SMSAs among blue—collar workers.

       The results of these calculations appear in Part A of Table 10.

These results show that a 10% rise in rates of unionis among all blue—

collar workers would raise overall wages of young whites by about 5% and

those of young blacks by about 8%. Part B of Table 10 presents the employ—

ment coefficients from column 1 of Table 7; they imply that a 10% rise in

rates of unionism in the labor force would lower young white employment

by about 2% and lower young black employment by about 5%.   Of course, the

estimates from the different samples show that there is considerable un-

certainty over the exact magnitude of the effect in each case.

       It should be noted that union membership among young blacks can be

improved without raising overall rates of unionism by improving their access

to areas of the economy that are currently unionized. This would not only

raise the wages of those who become unionized, but it would also lower the

supply of young black nonunion workers, thereby raising their wages and/or

employment. Furthermore, new organizing activity could take place in sectors

which are currently nonunion and where blacks are heavily concentrated,

such as the service sctor. This would strongly raise the number of low

wage blacks who benefit from a given increase in overall organization, but

this latter policy is more likely to produce lower employment among those

who remain nonunion.



V. Summary and Conclusion

       This paper presents estimates of the effects of unions on the

wages of young blacks and whites, both union and nonunion, as well as their

effects on employment for these groups. The estimates suggest that unions

raise the wages of their young blue—collar workers substantially, but that

they also reduce the wages of young, nonunion blacks. Employment is also

reduced for young whites and especially for young blacks. These results

seem to be consistent with a theory which claims that unions cause an excess

supply of nonunion labor, particularly for blacks.

       The ability of young blacks to obtain union membership has also
                                    —30—



 discussed. It was shown that within the labor force membership rates for

 young whites and blacks are roughly comparable. But higher rates of

unemployment and nonparticipation for young blacks imply lower rates of

unionism within the population. Moreover, blacks remain underrèpresented

in such heavily unionized occupations as the construction crafts and over—

represented in the service sector where unibnism is far less prevalent.

       Using the above results to calculate the overall effects of unions

for young, blue—collar labor, it was shown that changes in the economy—

wide rates of union organization would raise overall wages and lower employ-

ment for both blacks and whites. However, young blacks should strongly

benefit in terms of both wages and employment from improved access to sectors

which are already unionized. Many young blacks would also benefit from

greater unionization of the sectors where they are heavily concentrated,

although the employment effects for those who would remain nonunion must

be considered.

1/
        Union and nonunion workers need not be distinguished among the

unemployed, since union membership is often conditional on employment

or labor force participation. Union membership for many young workers

only comes after they have entered unionized crafts. Furthermore, many

laid—off unionists who are seeking other work do not report: their union

membership status, thus making it very difficult to estimate employment

of union and nonunion workers separately.

2/
        Although I use the words "minority" and "black" interchangeably

in the paper, the sample always includes all nonwhite minorities.

3/
        The analysis has been performed only for males, because racial

differences among females take a very different form and it is difficult

to come to general conclusions that apply to both sexes.

4/
        Both the theoretical framework and the estimation techniques used

in this paper rely on, to some extent, approaches used in several earlier

papers. Orley Ashenfelter has estimated union/nonunion wage differentials

for blacks and whites and weighted them by union membership rates in

"Racial Discrimination and Trade Unionism," Journal of Political Economy,

Vol. 80, No. 3, Part I (May/June 1972), pp. 435—465. Lawrence M. Kahn has

estimated the effects of unionism in SMSAs on nonunion wages for clerical

and service workers in "Union Spillover Effects on Unorganized Labor

Markets," Journal of Human Resources, Vol. 15, No. 1, (Winter 1980),

pp. 87—98; lie has also estimated the effects of unionism in SMSAs on weeks

worked in "Unions and the Employment Status of Nonunion Workers,"

Industrial Relations, Vol. 17, No. 2 (May 1978), pp. 238—244. Finally,

  Richard B. Freeman and James L. Medoff have considered the effects of the

  proportion of industries that are unionized on wages of both union and non-

  union workers in those industries in "Percent

 This paper integrates and extends the approaches used in these earlier pa-

 pers, and applies them specifically to the problems of white and black youth

 in the labor market.

         The condition under which labor moves from the union to the nonun-

 ion sector is that the vacancy rate be lower than the elasticity of demand

in the union sector; this is derived by Jacob Mincer in "Unemployment

Effects of Minimum Wages," Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 84, No. 4,

Part 2 (August 1976), pp. 587—5104. Since turnover and vacancy rates in the

union sector generally are quite low, I assume that this condition is met

throughout the analysis.

       Freeman and Medoff estimate separate wage equations for union and

nonunion workers which contain an independent variable for the proportion

of production workers in an individual's industry who are unionized, They

find a strong positive effect for wages of union workers but smaller and

insignificant positive effects for nonunion workers. The proportion unionized

figures are nationwide averages for three—digit industries; therefore, they

are appropriate only when used for industries with nationwide product mar-

kets, such as manufacturing. But in this paper the sample of young black

workers is too small to be limited in this fashion. Therefore, the only
                                    —33—



estimates presented in this paper are those for proportions of SMSAs

that are unionized.

9/
       These equations seek only to estimate the union/nonunion wage dif-

ferentials and abstract from such problems as the endogeneit:y of union

membership and the issue of union and nonunion worker quality. See H.

12/    The two data sets each cover adjacent periods of three years. Both

periods are affected about equally by the mid—1970s recession, since the

years of greatest slack were 1975 and 1976. The samples have similar num-

bers of young blacks and union members. One must therefore conclude that

the differences in estimates of wage effects between the two data sets

reflect random influences in these two relatively small samples of young

blacks. The problem may be complicated by one of multicollinearity because

of the strong correlation between proportion of SMSA unionized and region.

         Although the effects of unionism on labor force participation
 and umeployment are as important as those on employment, I focus on the

 latter because of problems in the definition and measurement of labor

 force participation. See Kim B. Clark and Lawrence H. Summers, "Labor

Market Dynamics and Unemployment: A Reconsideration," Brookings Papers on

         Because of the problems of heteroscedasticity and predictions which

lie outside the 0.1 range in the linear probability model, I also used

maximum likelihood techniques to estimate equation (14) in its logistic

probability form:

                    P. =        1/ 1 + e(jk + hPk)

where ik is the probability of employment for the ith individual in the

kth SMSA. The partial deviations of this probability with respect to

SMSA unionism, ik/k        ,   were   then estimated at the mean of the   dependent
variable by computing P(l—P)h. When this was done for young white and black

males in both samples, the results were virtually identical to those pre-

sented for the linear probability model in Table 5.
