When Does Education Matter? The Protective Effect of Education for Cohorts Graduating
in Bad Times

                                            ABSTRACT

Using Eurobarometer data, we document large variation across European countries in education gradients
in income, self-reported health, life satisfaction, obesity, smoking and drinking. While this variation
has been documented previously, the reasons why the effect of education on income, health and health
behaviors varies is not well understood. We build on previous literature documenting that cohorts
graduating in bad times have lower wages and poorer health for many years after graduation, compared
to those graduating in good times. We investigate whether more educated individuals suffer smaller
income and health losses as a result of poor labor market conditions upon labor market entry. We confirm
that a higher unemployment rate at graduation is associated with lower income, lower life satisfaction,
greater obesity, more smoking and drinking later in life. Further, education plays a protective role for
these outcomes, especially when unemployment rates are high: the losses associated with poor labor
market outcomes are substantially lower for more educated individuals. Variation in unemployment
rates upon graduation can potentially explain a large fraction of the variance in gradients across
different countries.

I.     Introduction
A long line of literature has examined the impact of education on health and health behaviors
(Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2010a, 2010b). Almost all observational studies find that education is
positively associated with health, but two points are worth noting. First, there is substantial
variation across countries and cohorts in the extent to which education predicts better health. For
example Kunst and Mackenbach (1994) document that education has a small effect on mortality
in the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway but its effect is about two times as large in
the United States, France, or Italy. And this association is larger for more recent cohorts:
education is a larger predictor of mortality today than in the past (Meara, Richards and Cutler
2008). Education gradients in health behaviors also vary substantially: for instance Cutler and
Lleras-Muney (2013) document that the effect of a year of education on smoking for women
ranges from 0.02 to -0.06 depending on the country. Second not all studies find that education is
protective.   Most notably, recent attempts to estimate causal impacts of education using
compulsory schooling legislation find different results across countries. For instance, compulsory
schooling reduced mortality in the United States (Lleras-Muney 2005) but not in England (Clark
and Royer 2013), or France (Albouy and Lequien 2009), and the effects for Sweden are
ambiguous (Meghir et al. 2013, Fischer et al. 2013). A recent study that looked at the impact of
compulsory school on mortality for several European countries confirms this variability, finding
large effects of the reforms on mortality for example in Belgium but not in Spain (Gathmann,
Jurges and Reinhold 2012).
        In this paper, we explore one explanation for this variability: that the effect of education
is larger for cohorts who started their career in bad economic times. Previous literature has
documented that individuals graduating in recessions have worse labor market outcomes and
health outcomes for many years thereafter (Oreopoulos, Heinz and von Watcher 2012, Genda et
al. 2010, Kahn 2010, Kondo 2007, Kwon et al. 2010, Oyer 2006, 2008, Schoar and Zuo 2011,
MacLean 2013). Because education is thought to affect health in part through its effect on
income and resources, we hypothesize that the health benefits of education will be lower for
individuals for whom education has a smaller return in the labor market. If lifetime incomes
increase the demand for health (Grossman 1972), and recessions increase the gap in lifetime
incomes across education groups, then recessions will also increase health gaps across education
groups. Whether recessions have larger or smaller effects on the lifetime incomes of low



	                                               1	  
educated is not clear: in Canada, Oreopoulos, Heinz, and von Watcher (2012) find larger effects
of recessions on incomes for those with lower quality of education (college and mayor) but they
only study college graduates. Genda et al. (2010) find larger effects on employment for the
uneducated in both Japan and the US, but larger effects on income for highly educated in the US.
       Education has been hypothesized to increase one’s ability to cope with negative shocks
and uncertainty. This provides a different reason why economic downturns may have deleterious
health effects that differ across education groups. During recessions individuals are more likely
to suffer from depression and stress (Cooper 2011) and suicides are higher (Stuckler et al. 2011,
Reeves et al. 2012). Unhealthy behaviors also appear to respond to recessions in the short run:
both smoking and excessive alcohol consumption fall with unemployment (e.g. Ettner 1997,
Rhum 1995, 2003, Rhum and Black 2002, Gerdtham and Rhum 2006 for the US; Montgomery et
al. 1998 for the United Kingdom), as does BMI (Ruhm 2004 but see Jónsdóttir and Ásgeirsdóttir,
2013). Education is associated with overall better mental health and higher rates of health-
promoting behaviors (Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2010b): we hypothesize this association is larger
for those graduating in bad times.
       We investigate this theory by examining how education affects the income and health
returns to early life labor market conditions. Our analysis is based on Eurobarometer data for 31
countries over the past 50 years. We document that the deleterious effect of recessions is
substantially smaller for those with high education. In other words, individuals who graduated in
a bad economy are more likely to smoke and drink later in life, but this is less true among the
better educated. We observe that education is protective for all of the outcomes we study,
although the estimates are not always statistically significant. Our results suggest that a sizeable
portion of the cross-country variation in the education gradient can be attributed to differences in
unemployment rates.
       The variability in the return to schooling in the labor market is also large. Psacharopolous
and Patrinos (2004) document that the wage returns to education vary significantly across
countries, ranging from 3% to more than 20% per year of school. Similar to the findings for
health, studies investigating the effects of compulsory schooling on wages document a large
range of estimates (Card 2001). Economics has emphasized the same theoretical and
econometric explanation for these findings: they strongly suggest that the returns to schooling
are heterogeneous. However the specific sources of heterogeneity are not well-understood. Our



	                                               2	  
findings suggest that the labor market conditions under which individuals graduate can explain a
substantial amount of the observed heterogeneity in returns to education in the labor market and
also contribute to lifetime gaps in income and wellbeing by education. Although we cannot
estimate causal effects of education – we only document associations, these results suggest that
the returns to education vary depending on economic conditions over the lifetime.
          Our paper is also part of a larger literature documenting the unequal impacts of recessions
across demographic groups (Engemann and Wall 2010, Cynthia et al. 2012, Borges-Mendez,
Denhardt and Michelle, 2013). The Great Recession’s impact on youth in the United States and
Europe has been particularly large, with unemployment rates among individuals aged 16-25
reaching a peak of about 20% in the US and rising even higher in Europe. Not only are these
rates historically high, they are much higher than the unemployment rates among older adults
(Bell and Blachflower 2011). Our findings suggest that the impact of the Great Recession on
current cohorts is likely to be large and will generate relatively large disparities by education in
both health and income as these cohorts age.


II.    Methods
a. Data
       We use the Standard and Special Topic Eurobarometer Series, the longest running regular
cross-national and cross-temporal opinion poll program in Europe. Starting in 1997 and up to
2012, 31 countries in Europe conducted face-to-face interviews in spring and autumn
(http://zacat.gesis.org/webview/). We restrict all analyses to individuals aged between 25 and 55
to minimize measurement error in education due to recall, and to minimize the effect of selective
mortality by education, most of which will occur after age 55. Our outcomes of interest are not
collected consistently every year – for each outcome we include all possible observations to
maximize sample size. Details of the years covered for each outcome are in Table 1.
                                             [Table 1 about here]
Measures of Income and Health
          We investigate six outcomes. The first is income. The respondents are asked country-
specific questions about their household income and the answers are categorized into eleven
categories in different currency unit. The Eurobarometer principal investigators recode these into




	                                                 3	  
four income quartiles so that comparisons can be made consistently across the European
countries. The variable we use ranges between 1 (top quartile) and 4 (bottom quartile).
       Our second and third measures capture overall well-being. Life dissatisfaction is equal to
one if the respondent feels unsatisfied or very unsatisfied with his/her life and zero if they report
being satisfied or very satisfied. Self-rated satisfaction scores have been shown to be valid and
reliable proxies for utility (Lepper 1998, Sandvik et al. 1993). Our measure of self-reported
health is based on the question “How is your health in general?,” for which the answers are 1 for
very good, 2 for good, 3 for not bad and not good, 4 for bad and 5 for very bad. We construct an
indicator for poor health, equal to one if the answer is 4 or 5, and zero otherwise. This subjective
measure of health has been shown to be highly predictive of mortality and other objective
measures of health (Idler and Benjamini 1997, Martinez et al. 2010, Latham and Peek 2013).
       Finally, we have three measures of health behaviors. We use self-reported height and
weight to calculate BMI. We define obesity equal to one for those with a BMI greater than 30
(excluding outliers with BMI above 60, about 0.1 percent of the sample). Although self-reported
measures of height and weight suffer from well-known biases, there is no evidence that theis bias
is systematically correlated with education (Burkhauser and Cawley 2008).
       We construct an indicator of current smoking and an indicator for whether the individual
drinks every day. The latter is an imperfect measure of excessive alcohol consumption, but it is
the only measure of alcohol consumption available. The relationship between alcohol and
mortality is depicted as a J-shaped curve, attributed to a combination of beneficial and harmful
effects (White et al. 2002, Gmel et al. 2003, Bagnardi et al. 2004). Since daily but moderate
drinking is associated with lower mortality (Castelnuovo et al. 2006) and higher incomes (Cook
and Moore 2002), changes in this measure are more difficult to interpret as detrimental.


Education
The Eurobarometer does not ask years of schooling directly. Instead, the survey asks individuals
their age at graduation from their highest degree. We compute years of schooling as the age at
graduation minus seven. We drop those whose years of education is over 25 (1.5 percent of the
sample) because people who finished schooling at later ages likely took some break in their
education.




	                                               4	  
       The benefit of this imputation is that we can measure years of schooling across all
countries consistently. But this measure ignores the variation in age when people starting going
to school. More importantly if individuals delay graduation in bad times, this behavior will bias
our results. To assess the quality of our measure, we compare our measure of years of school to
reports of years of education from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe
(SHARE). Figure A1a reports the mean years of schooling against graduation cohorts, for both
SHARE and the Eurobarometer, and shows that average education trends are almost identical in
both data sets, although the Eurobarometer slightly overestimates average education for the older
cohorts, and underestimates it for the very youngest. Figure A1b plots average years of education
by gender, country and graduation year in the SHARE data against average imputed years in the
Eurobarometer. The points are distributed almost symmetrically along the 45-degree line,
suggesting no systematic bias in our education measure. The correlation between the two
measures is 0.90. We nevertheless conduct several robustness checks to assess how measurement
error in education biases our results. Lastly note that the variation of education in these data is
large: 27 percent of the population has fewer than 9 years of education, while 37 percent have
more than 12 years of education.


Unemployment Rates
       The earliest year at which a person finished their education in our sample was 1948 (a
person aged 55 in 1997 who finished their education at age 7 – that is they had no schooling).
Thus, we need to measure country-specific unemployment from 1948 on. There is no single
source of unemployment data covering that period for all countries. We combine data from four
sources. The more recent unemployment rate data are from World Development Indicators
(WDI) published by the World Bank. These data are supplemented by historical unemployment
rates from the OECD. The unemployment rates in earlier times are supplemented by Mitchell
(1998) and Layard (1991), where we use Layard (1991) as a priority. Only total unemployment
rates are available for early years—consistent series unemployment rates broken down by gender
or smaller geographic regions do not exist. Table A1 reports the availability of the
unemployment rates for different periods in specific countries. Using the overlapping years
across sources we compute that the correlation coefficient between WDI and OECD is 0.99, and
that between Mitchell’s and Layard’s series is 0.95, indicating a high degree of consistency in



	                                              5	  
unemployment rates across different sources. To capture the systematic differences across
different sources, dummy variables for different data sources are applied throughout the analysis.
Figure A2 plots the unemployment rate for each country annually, showing a large variation
across different countries and time periods.
       Unemployment rates are not available for all countries and all years covered by the
Eurobarometer. For example, many countries in the former Soviet Union only have
unemployment data from the 1990s. In addition recall that not all waves collect all outcomes of
interest. We are able to match individuals to unemployment rates at graduation for 94, 77, 76, 81,
78 and 74 percent of the samples with income, health, life satisfaction, obesity, smoking, and
drinking respectively. Table A2 reports the country availability for different outcome variables,
as well as the weighted mean values for the whole and matched samples. The means in the
matched and unmatched samples are very similar.
       The matching process assumes that the country of current residence is the same as the
country where the respondent was living in at the time of graduation. Unfortunately, there is no
information in all the Eurobarometer data on migration. Based on the limited information in the
data, we find that 93.1 percent of people were born in the same country as they are surveyed.
Since the 5-year cross-state migration rate is 8.9 percent and the lifetime cross-state migration
rate is 32 percent in the United States in 2000 (Molloy et al. 2011), one relative advantage of
using European data is that the migration rate across countries is lower. To alleviate concerns
over the timing of graduation and remove some measurement error in the unemployment rate, we
use the three-year average moving unemployment rate in our primary analysis - the average of
unemployment rates in the year of graduation, one year before and one year after.
       To document the variation in unemployment rates that we use, Table 1 reports summary
statistics for the unemployment rate and the residual unemployment rate, net of controls. The
mean unemployment rate ranges from 6 to 8 percent across our different samples, with a
standard deviation of 4.2-5 percent. If we regress unemployment rates on all controls, then we
obtain the residual variation that identifies the effect of unemployment in our study. By
construction these residuals have a mean of zero, but importantly, there is a lot of variation in
unemployment rates net of country-specific trends and cohort effects: the standard deviation in
these residuals is about 4 percent.




	                                              6	  
b. Empirical approach
       Following Oreopoulos et al. (2012), our main estimation strategy relates outcomes to
personal characteristics, including education, unemployment rate at the time of finishing school,
and the interaction between education and finishing school unemployment rates. It is this
interaction term that indicates how education affects the return to a good or bad economy.
       Clearly, estimating such a model needs controls for other factors that influence outcomes.
Our first controls are for differences in cohorts over time. Graduation cohort effects (δg) and
experience effects (δe) pick up differences across cohorts dated by when they entered the labor
market and labor market experience. Because the graduation cohort effects may vary over time
and space, we allow for country-specific linear graduation time trends (Tc). We also control for
education, the interaction between education and experience, and the impact of education and
experience squared.     This set of variables traces out average differences in outcomes by
education over the lifecycle.
       To control for current unemployment or other conditions across countries that may
influence outcomes, we include country-survey year fixed effects (δct).           Effectively, our
identification is based on periods where unemployment is higher or lower than is typical for that
country, controlling for the fact that cohorts differ on average and over time. The estimating
equation is:


       𝑌! = 𝛽! + 𝛽! 𝑈𝑅!" + 𝛽! 𝐸𝑑𝑢! + 𝛽! 𝑈𝑅!" ∗ (𝐸𝑑𝑢! − 9) + 𝛽! 𝐸𝑑𝑢! ∗ 𝐸𝑥𝑝! + 𝛽! 𝐸𝑑𝑢! ∗
𝐸𝑥𝑝!! + 𝑋! 𝛼 + 𝑇! + 𝛿! + 𝛿! + 𝛿!" + 𝛿! + 𝜖!                                                  (1)


where Yi is the outcome for individual i, URcg is the (three-year average) unemployment rate of
graduation cohort g in country c, Edui is years of education, and Expi is years since graduation. Xi
is a set of control variables, including gender and marital status. δs is a set of dummies for
different source of unemployment data. Since unemployment rates are at the country-year level,
we report standard errors clustered two ways, at the country-graduation cohort level, and at the
country level.
       In this model, 𝛽! shows how unemployment for a cohort with 9 years of education affects
outcomes, and 𝛽! shows the differential response for the better educated. Recall that all of our
outcomes are defined so that worse outcomes are a higher numerical value; thus, we expect 𝛽! >0


	                                                 7	  
(unemployment worsens outcomes) and 𝛽! <0 (a smaller effect for the better educated). That
said, the specific value of 𝛽! – the effect of unemployment on the less educated – is dependent
on the value we choose for less educated (9 years, in this case). To illustrate the full range of
effects, we plot the impact of unemployment on outcomes at different levels of education.
       Although several outcomes of interest are dichotomous, we report OLS results for
simplicity – results from probit or logit specifications are very similar when converted to
marginal effects (Appendix Table A4). We estimate non-parametric models also.


III.   Empirical Results
a. Sample description and gradients in education
       Panels A and B of Table 1 show summary statistics across countries for each estimation
sample. On average, 18 percent of the respondents reported poor health and 21 percent were
dissatisfied with their lives. Eleven percent of the population is obese. Smoking is also popular,
with 38 percent of respondent reporting smoking currently. Across the samples, the average
years of education are stable, ranging from 12.1 to 12.6. There is also large variation in both
education and outcome variables across countries. For example, the interquartile range across
countries is 0.12 (67 percent of the mean value) for poor health, and about one sixth relative to
the mean for education.
       To document the variation in the effect of education across settings, we estimate the
education gradient for each country by regressing the outcome of interest on education
controlling for gender, marital status, age, and age-squared. Figure 1 plots these country-specific
education gradients against the logarithm of GDP per capita. For example, Figure 1b plots
education-health gradients and shows negative coefficients, indicating that higher education is
associated with better health. The average gradients for all the other outcomes are also as
expected. Education is positively associated with income (recall that higher income is a lower
value), and negatively associated with life dissatisfaction.
                                            [Table 1 about here]
                                           [Figure 1 about here]
       Even with these means, there is significant variation across countries. For example, the
mean education gradient in smoking is -0.018, but the interquartile range is 0.017, almost the
same magnitude. This variation is not particularly related to average current income, with the



	                                                8	  
exception of income quartile (higher income countries have steeper gradients) and daily drinking
(higher income countries have smaller gradients).


b. Impact of Unemployment Rates in Early Adulthood
Table 2 reports the OLS estimates of equation (1). We report the coefficients on unemployment
at graduation (𝛽! ) and its interaction with education (𝛽! ) in the first two rows. The standard
errors in parentheses are clustered at country-graduation cohort year level and those in brackets
are clustered at country level. Panel A shows the results using three-year average unemployment
rates around the time of graduation (the entire set of coefficients is displayed in the Appendix
Table A3). Panel B shows results using the unemployment rate in the year of graduation.
                                         [Table 2 about here]
        The coefficients in the first row indicate that higher unemployment when graduating is
associated with lower socio-economic status and worse heath behaviors, consistent with the
literature and findings in Bell and Blanchflower (2011) and Maclean (2013). The coefficients are
large; for those with exactly 9-years of education, a 5 percentage point increase in
unemployment is associated with a 3 percent greater likelihood of being unsatisfied with life
relative to the mean (0.05 * 0.122 / 0.21), 5 percent greater likelihood of smoking (0.05 * 0.411 /
0.38), and a 12 percent greater likelihood of daily drinking (0.05 * 0.203 / 0.08). The two
exceptions to this pattern are general poor health status and obesity. In each case, unemployment
is also associated with worse outcomes, though the estimates are not statistically significantly.
Panel B reports the same results using unemployment rates in the exact year of graduation—the
coefficients are similar but somewhat smaller, consistent with greater measurement error. In
general unemployment and its interactions are jointly significant at the 10 percent level or higher
(p-values for joint test at bottom of table).
        The sign on the interaction between schooling and unemployment rates is opposite to that
on the unemployment rate: education plays a protective role when unemployment is high. For
most outcomes, the coefficients are significant at 5 percent level. To see the heterogeneous
effects more directly, Figure 2 plots the relationship between education and outcomes when
unemployment is 4.6 and 9.6 percent, roughly corresponding to the annual unemployment rates
in US before and during the Great Recession, or to the 30th and 70th percentile of the
unemployment rates distribution. Higher unemployment is associated with lower SES and worse



	                                                9	  
health and health behaviors, especially for those with less education. For example, in figure 2e,
we see that for those without formal schooling, a 4.6 percent unemployment rate is associated
with a 2.5 percent probability of smoking, while a 9.6 percent unemployment rate is associated
with 5.5 percent probability of smoking. For those with 15 years of education, the effect of
greater unemployment is very small, less than 1 percent. Overall, the relationship between
education and health is much steeper in bad times.
                                           [Figures 2 about here]
       Importantly, high unemployment raises the share of the less educated who are in poor
health. Table 2 showed a non-significant impact of unemployment on self-reported poor health
of those with 9 years of education. At education levels below that (about one-quarter of the
sample), the impact of unemployment is markedly higher.
       Previous literature documents important gender differences in the effects of recessions.
For instance Hershbein (2012) finds no effects of graduating from high school in a recession for
women’s wages. However, Novo et al. (2000, 2001) find that women’s heath decreases more
than that of men during recessions in Sweden. Table 3 reports results separately for men and
women. These are consistent with full sample results: the effect of unemployment is larger for
lower education groups, though some of the coefficients are statistically insignificant. The
bottom of the table tests the joint differences for the coefficients between men and women.
Except for life dissatisfaction, we cannot reject equality of the coefficients across genders.
                                            [Table 3 about here]
       To investigate the relative short- and long-term impact of early life unemployment rates,
we include the unemployment rate and its interaction with education with age group dummies
(“younger” is a dummy for being aged 40 or less, and “older” is greater than 40). Table 4 shows
that the “scarring” effect of high unemployment when graduating (and the protective effects of
education) is driven primarily by younger cohorts, consistent with Oreopoulos et al. (2012).
However the effects of unemployment on drinking and smoking are very similar across ages,
consistent with high addictiveness.
       The findings from Table 4 do not suggest a protective effect of early life unemployment
at older ages. Hessel and Avendano (2013) find that economic recessions at the time of leaving
school are associated with better health status in the later life using the SHARE data. We suspect




	                                               10	  
that our findings differ from theirs because we focus on working age individuals (up to age 55)
whereas they look at those 50 and older.
                                           [Table 4 about here]


c. Functional form
       In Appendix table A8 we use education categories instead of linear years of schooling.
Panel A reproduces our main results for reference. In panel B we show that the results are very
similar if we use dummies for education categories rather than continuous years of education.
       To further investigate non-linearities we estimate a non-parametric model. We do this in
several steps. First, we estimate the education gradient in outcomes for each graduation cohort
and country, with basic controls including marital status, gender and survey year dummies. We
then regress the resulting gradients on linear and square terms of graduation years; the residuals
are the gradient in education adjusted for a general time trend.
       Figure 3 plots these adjusted residuals against unemployment residuals (from regressing
unemployment rates when graduating on linear and square terms of graduation year). We
estimate the relationship between the two using a kernel-weighted local polynomial. Generally,
the patterns are consistent with our conclusions, but suggest the protective effects of education
are largest when unemployment rates are high.
                                           [Figure 3 about here]


d. Endogenous Education
       If many people choose to remain in school or leave school because of business-cycle
associated job prospects then our estimates might be biased. Oreopoulos et al. (2012) argue that
the bias this behavior induces is small because the effect of unemployment on graduation timing
is empirically small. We also find no statistically significant relationship between years of
schooling and unemployment rates in our data (See the first column of Appendix Table A6).
       To further assess this extent of this bias, we follow the intuition in Kahn (2010) and
Maclean (2013) and use unemployment around age 18 (median age at school completion) as a
proxy for labor market conditions at time of graduation—if this unemployment rate precedes the
decision on when to graduate it is independent of individual education’s choices. Table 5
presents estimates using this alternative unemployment rate. Again we find a large effect of



	                                               11	  
unemployment at age 18 on outcomes that is smaller among the more educated (Panel A), and
attenuated if we do not average over three years (Panel B).
                                           [Table 5 about here]
       Alternatively we relate outcomes to the unemployment rates prevailing the first year
individuals were allowed to drop out of school according to compulsory schooling laws—this is
the last unemployment rate individuals observe before they can alter their education choices.
The data on compulsory schooling laws across several (but not all) European countries and years
can be found in the Appendix Table of Gathmann et al. (2012).
       Panel A of Table 6 first reports baseline results for the subset of country and cohorts for
whom compulsory schooling laws are available. The coefficients on unemployment and its
interaction with education are very similar to those in Table 2, although a bit larger in magnitude.
Panel B uses the unemployment rate at the “school-leaving age” instead. The magnitude and
significance of the coefficients is very similar in both panels, although again slightly larger when
we use the compulsory school law unemployment rates. Overall the results in Tables 5 and 6
suggest that the bias resulting from endogenous changes in the timing of graduation is negligible.
                                           [Table 6 about here]


e. The effect of contemporary recessions and recessions at the time of graduation
Next we investigate how recessions at graduation differ from current recessions. We drop
country-year survey dummies and instead control for the current unemployment rate and its
interaction with education. Table 7 shows the results. Overall the direction and magnitude of the
effects of graduating in a recession for low and high education groups remain the same
(comparing these results to those in Panel A of Table 2)—the only important exception is life
satisfaction, for which the effects of graduating in a recession become insignificant. Instead
current unemployment rates lower satisfaction for all and more so for the uneducated.
                                           [Table 7 about here]
       The other coefficients generally confirm the literature that recessions are good for
(current) health. Current unemployment is associated with better general health, less smoking,
and less drinking. Thus we can replicate previous results showing that self-reported health and
health behaviors improve in bad times, though the interactions with education suggest this
improvement is smaller among the more educated. However we add to the story by showing that



	                                              12	  
self-reported health and risky behaviors are worse for those graduating in recessions, so the
pattern reverses over time. These findings suggest that individuals, particularly the low educated,
cut down on “luxury expenses” (smoking, alcohol, deserts) in the short run, but this short term
deprivation leads to long-term increases in consumption of these goods.
        Although this result may seem puzzling at first, there are known mechanisms by which
this happens, at least in the case of nutrition. Experimental evidence with rats shows that food
deprivation lowers body weight in the short run but results in obesity in the long run (McCance
1962). In humans this has also been observed among the survivors of famines, for instance see
Painter et al. (2005). The current understanding of these effects is that the body responds to lack
of nutrition by adapting to more efficiently extract calories and store fat thereafter, a
phenomenon known as “metabolic syndrome”. This mechanism is optimal if the deprivation
continues, but results in obesity otherwise. Similarly alcohol and cigarette consumption might
increase over the long run because individuals who cut down in bad times overcompensate in
good times. Without panel data, we cannot investigate the dynamics of consumption from the
time of graduation onwards. But clearly the short and long term effects of recessions are
substantially different.


f. The Overall Impact of Early Life Labor Markets
        To understand how much of the variation in the education gradients across countries
could result from this early life heterogeneity, we perform a simulation. We start by estimating
the impact of a year of education on each outcome. To do this, we predict the average outcome
                                                         !
using the actual X’s for each individual (which we term Y!"# ), and again after increasing each
                                            !
individual’s education by one year (termed Y!"#!! ). The difference between these predictions,
ΔY! = Y!"#!!
       !        !
             - Y!"# , is the education gradient, holding constant demographics. We average this
gradient at the country level to form a country-specific gradient.
        We then see how unemployment at the end of formal education affects this average. To
do this, we set the unemployment rate for each cohort and country to the average across all
cohorts and countries. We then predict again the average outcome for each individual using their
                                                                            !        !
actual education and after increasing education by one year. We term these Y!"# and Y!"#!! .
The difference between these, ΔY ! =    Y!"#!!
                                         !        !
                                               − Y!"# , is the education gradient that would have
obtained in the country if the unemployment rate were not different from the average.


	                                               13	  
       Table 8 reports the differences of gradients across countries under the above two settings
for each outcome. Column 1 shows the difference between the 90th percentile of the gradient
distribution across countries and the 10th percentile under actual unemployment rates. Column 2
reports that difference under mean unemployment rates. Column 3 shows the ratio, which is
consistently smaller than one, ranging from 0.59 to 0.92. The smaller the ratio is, the larger
portion can be explained by unemployment rates.
       The results indicate that a sizeable portion of the cross-country variation in the education
gradient can be attributed to differences in unemployment rates. This effect is largest for life
satisfaction and income, with the ratio being 0.31 and 0.59, but it is also large for drinking and
smoking with the ratios being 0.77 and 0.72, respectively. The overall effects on health and
obesity are more modest, with ratios around 0.85. Since we cannot estimate causal effects of
education, these results are only suggestive, but they point to differences in labor market
conditions as a potentially important explanation for the heterogeneity in the returns to school.
                                           [Table 8 about here]


IV.    Discussion
       Using consistent measures across a large set of countries and cohorts, we document that
education gradients in income, health, life satisfaction, obesity, smoking, and drinking vary
substantially across countries. In this paper we explore one explanation for this variation in the
returns to school. Both economic and epidemiology literatures show that early labor market
conditions have a persistent effect on labor market outcomes. Individuals graduating in bad
economic conditions earn substantially lower wages for several years compared to those
graduating in good times. We examine whether differences in unemployment at the time
individuals first enter the labor market explain some of the variation in the education gradient in
income, self-reported health status, life satisfaction, obesity, smoking and drinking.
       We find that higher unemployment at graduation is associated with lower household
income, poorer general health, lower life satisfaction, and higher probability of obesity, smoking
and everyday drinking later in life. Furthermore these negative effects are substantially smaller
for those with more education. Our estimates suggest that 15 to 70 percent of the cross-country
variation in the gradient is explained by economic conditions at the time of graduation that differ
on average across countries, though the magnitude varies with the outcome.



	                                               14	  
       There are some limitations in our analysis. First, the relationship of education with
outcomes is an association. Although compulsory schooling laws are available to us, there is not
enough variation in these laws in our sample to estimate causal effects. We document that the
effect of unemployment on outcomes varies significantly by education—whether education itself
“causes” individuals to respond differently to unemployment rates remains an open question.
       These results suggest that education levels can be used for targeting programs aimed at
helping those most affected by adverse economic conditions. They do not however explain why
recessions have a differential impact by education. We show unemployment at the time of
graduation differentially influences incomes of the less educated—this translates into higher
health and life satisfaction. Unemployment might differentially affects the probability of being
married—we find this not to be the case however (the second column of Appendix Table A6.
Our results in Table 2 are very similar if we exclude marital status Appendix Table A7).
Alternatively unemployment influences outcomes by increasing stress.             Unfortunately, the
Eurobarometer does not ask about stress. Understanding why recessions have larger effects on
the less education is an important avenue for future research.
       We investigate a possible reason why education gradients vary across time and place—
one that explains a substantial but not all the variation in the education gradient. Of course, there
are other possible reasons to expect heterogeneity in the impact of education. Differential
adoption of health innovations over time by the more educated is another potential explanation
for the variation we observe across cohorts. This was the case, for instance, with smoking
cessation: the Surgeon General’s report in 1964 (Bayne-Jones et al. 1964) resulted in larger
effects of maternal education on infant health (Aizer and Stroud 2010). Individual and family
differences might also play an important role: the return to education could be higher or lower
for those from wealthy backgrounds or with lower cognitive ability (Kane 1994). Finally as
argued in Genda et al. (2010), differences across countries such as labor market institutions
might mediate the impact of recessions by education.
       Nevertheless our findings have some interesting implications. We find that labor market
conditions early in life have a long-lasting effect on health as well as economic outcomes, and
these effects cumulate. This finding is in line with Case et al. (2005), who document that family
income gradients among children get larger as they age, and with Cunha and Heckman (2007)
who theoretically and empirically investigate “dynamic complementarities” in investments in



	                                               15	  
health and education. Our findings also suggest that dynamic life-cycle considerations are
important in understanding socioeconomic differences in health status: the effects of
contemporary shocks not only differ by education but emerge fully only after a few years. For
instance we find that although recessions improve self-reported health, obesity, smoking and
drinking in the short run, they are deleterious in the long run for these same outcomes,
particularly for those with low education.
       Our results suggest that policies that target youth unemployment might have particularly
large payoffs over the long term in reducing health and income disparities. An interesting avenue
for future research would determine if policies targeted to the young can attenuate the negative
long term effects of recessions. The extent to which job training and other programs improve the
labor market success of young uneducated individuals is hotly debated but it appears to be
modest (Card et al. 2011); our results suggest that evaluations of these programs should include
health and health behaviors as outcomes. They also suggest that non-labor market programs
could help disadvantaged youth in bad economic times by, for instance, improving mental health
and preventing the development of poor health habits.
       Future research should replicate our results using objective measures of health such as
mortality, and use these findings to quantify the overall impacts of recessions on health and
health disparities over the life course. Subsequent research should also document the specific
mechanisms by which the more educated are able to buffer themselves from recessions, and the
extent to which policy can improve the outcomes of uneducated youth. This agenda is
particularly important today, given that the Great Recession has had a very large and
disproportionate impact on youth, and that our results suggest the impact of recessions of this
magnitude is substantial.
