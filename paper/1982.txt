   Endogenous Drinking Age Laws and Highway Mortality Rates of Young Drivers




                                   ABSTRACT


      This paper presents estimates of the effects of the drinking age and

  beer taxes on youth motor vehicle mortality. The data set employed is a

  time series, from 1975 to 1981, of cross sections of the 48 contiguous sta-

  tes. Separate regressions for 15 to 11 year olds, 18 to 20 year olds and

  21 to 24 year olds are presented. A simultaneous estimation model is used

  to account for the endogeneity .of the drinking age. The results show that

  during the sample period an increase in the drinking age to 21, which is

  approximately 8 percent, would have reduced mortality in the 18 to 20 year

  old group by approximately 14 percent. Also a 100 percent increase in the

  real beer tax, which is approximately $1.50 per case, would reduce highway

  mortality of 18 to 20 year olds by about 19 percent. This increase in the

  beer tax would also reduce mortality by about 8 percent for 15 to 17 year

  olds and by about 18 percent for the 21 to 24 year olds.

 I. Introduction

      In the past few years, there has been an increased public awareness of

the potentially adverse effects of alcohol consumption. A major area of

concern is alcohol related motor vehicle accidents.    In an effort to control

alcohol abuse, each state has enacted a variety of regulations governing

the sale of alcoholic beverages. Recently, particular attention has been

focused on the minimum legal age for purchase and consumption of alcohol.

In the early 1970's, these age minimums were lowered in many states. Young

drivers, however, tend to be more accident prone than the general popula-

tion. Concern that the increased availability of alcohol might be exacer-

bating the already high accident rate amoung young drivers led to the

Federal Uniform Drinking Age Act of 1984.    The Act denies a certain percen-

tage of Federal highway construction funds to states that fall to raise

their minimum drinking age to 21.

     While raising the legal drinking age is an option to deal with alcohol

abuse amoung young drivers, increased taxation of alcohol is another policy

that might achieve the same results. This policy tool, however has not been

employed. Instead, Federal excise taxes on beer and wine have been fixed,

in nominal terms since November 1, 1951. The Federal excise tax on

distilled spirits was raised on October 1, 1985. State and local excise

taxes have been increased on occasion, but always to raise revenue rather

than to discourage consumption.

    The purpose of this paper is to estimate the responsiveness of youth
                                    —2—

motor vehicle fatality rates to increases in the legal drinking age and to

variations in the cost of beer. The focus on young adults is Important

because motor vehicle accident mortality is the leading cause of death of

persons under the age of 35, and the National Highway Traffic Safety

Administration (1983) estimates that alcohol is involved in over half of

these fatal accidents.

     Research on the responsiveness of youth motor vehicle deaths to the to

the cost of beer is important because of proposals to increase Federal

excise tax rates on all forms of alcoholic beverages.1 The tax rate on the

alcohol in beer is only one third the tax rate of the alcohol in liquor.

This has led to proposals to equalize tax rates by increasing beer taxes.

Given the popularity of beer among young people and their poor driving

records, it is important to obtain estimates of what effect higher beer

taxes would have on motor vehicle fatality rates of young drivers.2

     Estimates of the effect of increased legal drinking ages on motor

vehicle fatality rates of young drivers is also important because the

Federal Uniform Minimum Drinking Age Act will expire at the end of fiscal

1988. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (1985) reports that Texas

and Kansas have already adopted laws that will lower the.legal drinking age

as soon as the Federal penalties end.

     There have been a variety of prior studies of the effects of alcohol

regulation on motor vehicle accident rates of young drivers. Douglas (1983)

provides an extensive review of this literature. There have been few prior

studies which estimate the effects of alcohol taxes or prices on highway

fatalities. Cook (1981), however, estimates that states that raised their
                                      —3—                      -




 liquor   tax rates had lower motor vehicle.deaths of persons of all ages.

 Most studies of the legal drinking age conclude that increasing the legal

 drinking age would lower motor vehicle fatality rates of young drivers. For

 example, Wagenaar (1981), using time series data for the state of Michigan,

 finds a significant relationship between the drinking age and motor vehicle

 crashes. Wagenaar's methodology is ideal for estimating short run effects

 in Michigan. Long run changes and changes in other states, however, cannot

be inferred from his study. A somewhat different conclusion is reached by

Male8(1986). Males concludes that increasing the drinking age only

redistributes fatalities to older drivers. Most prior studies of the

drinking age employ a univariate methodology. While the simplicity of a

univariate methodology has certain advantages, the effect of variations in

alcohol taxes and other variables is not controlled.

     Three recent studies (Mc.Cornac 1982, Cook and Tauchen 1984, Saffer and

Grossman 1986) of alcohol regulation and fatality rates of young drivers

use multivariate estimation techniques. All three studies also use pooled

time series of cross sections for the 48 contiguous states of the U.S. The

study by McCornac uses data from 1970 through 1975 and focuses on the death

rate of males aged 15 through 24. Data on highway conditions and liquor

prices are also included with the drinking age. The study by Cook and

Tauchen uses data from 1970 through 1977 and focuses on the death rate of

youths aged 18 through 20. Cook and Tauchen employ a set of time and state

variables to control other factors influencing highway fatalities. The

study by the present authors uses data from 1975 through 1981 and estimates

separate fatality regressions for youths 15 to 17, 18 to 20 and 21 to 24.
                                    —4—

 Data on beer taxes and highway conditions are included with the drinking

 age. Each study finds a negative relationship between fatalities and the

 drinking age. The latter study also finds a negative relationship between

 fatalities and beer taxes.

      The research reported here differs from these three prior studies in a

 variety of ways. McCornac and Cook and Tauchen analyzed a period during

 which there was a downward trend in the legal drinking •age. Between 1970

and 1975, 29 states lowered their drinking ages. Both studies concluded

 that changes in the drinking age were exogenous to highway fatality rates

of young drivers. Exogeneity of, the drinking age is not surprising since

conformity with the voting age of 18 was the reason given for lowering the

drinking age. This study employs a sample period in which 15 states raised

their drinking ages. The reason cited for these increases is often concern

over motor vehicle fatalities of young drivers. The drinking age should thus

be treated as endogenous. This study differs from the earlier study by the

present authors in that it employs a two equation simultaneous model to

control for endogeneity of the drinking age.


II. Analytical Framework

     The empirical model is derived from a theoretical model consisting of

a probability of fatality equation and a demand for alcohol equation. The

probability of fatality is determined by alcohol consumption and a set of

variables measuring highway conditions and vehicle quality. It is assumed

that, on average, alcohol consumption and driving under the influence of

alcohol are positively correlated. The demand for alcohol is a function of

prices,inconje and taste. The legal drinking age imposes difficulties or
                                          —5—

 costs on underaged individuals who try to purchase alcohol. Therefore, as a

measure of price, the legal drinking age is included in the demand for

alcohol equation. In the probability of fatality equation, alcohol consump-

tion is replaced by its determinants. This results in an equation with pri-

ces, the drinking age, income tastes, highway conditions and vehicle quality

as determinants. This probability equation is aggregated over age groups in

each state and is interpreted as a mortality rate equation.

       Estimation of the mortality rate equation is hampered by potential

endogeneity of the drinking age. This study uses data from 1975 to 1981, a

period when drinking ages were generally increasing. If these increases

were motivated by mortality rates associated with the lowered drinking ages

of the early 1970's, then the drinking age is endogenous. Endogeneity of

the drinking age can be controlled with an econometric framework developed

by Maddala (1983). Define the following variables: S       an unobserved

variable measuring sentiment against alcohol; 5* = an unobserved variable

measuring pressure to pass a 21 year old minimum legal drinking age law; D =

the   drinking age; H = highway mortality rates for youths; 14* = highway mor-

tality rates for youths when D is not equal to 21; X1 = a matrix of exoge-

nous variables affecting H; X2 = a matrix of exogenous variables affecting

S. The model can be written as:


               (1) 14 =
                          X1S1
                                 + f1D + g13 ÷


               (2) S =
                          X262 + p2


where '        f1, g, are coefficients and -' and      are error terms.

Equation (1) assumes that mortality is a consequence of exogenous
                                     —6—

regressors (X1), the drinking age (D), and sentiment against alcohol

(5). The sentiment variable (5), in equation (1), is necessary because such

sentiment can have an independent effect on highway mortality rates. In

states where sentiment is strongly against alcohol, youths may drink less

and thus the state mortality rate may be lower than in states where alcohol

is more acceptable. The effect of sentiment on mortality is independent of

the drinking age.   If states where sentiment is strongly against alcohol

have higher drinking ages then exclusion of the sentiment variable will

result in an overstatement of the effect of the drinking age. Sentiment is

assumed to be a function of exogenous variables such as religion. This

relationship is expressed by equation (2).

     While sentiment against alcohol may be exogenous, pressure to pass a

21 year old drinking age, S*, is not independent of youth mortality.

Clearly, increased youth highway fatalities, which are believed to be asso-

ciated with alcohol, increase pressure to pass a 21 year old drinking age.

Exogenous sentiment, 3, can also affect pressure to pass the 21 year old

drinking age. These relationships are expressed as:


                (3) S =   S ÷ 814*



The drinking age, D, acts as an indicator of the unobserved variable 3*•

The relationship between 3* and D is defined as:


                if D =   21 then       3* > c3

               if D = 20 then c3> S) c2

               if D =    19   then c2> S> c1       and

               if D= 18 then c1> 8*
                                       —7—

 the c1 are unknown constants with c3>c2>c1. The variable M* is the youth

highway mortality rate when the drinking age is not 21. The parameter 0 is

a weight. The variable S has no weight because as an unobserved variable its

measurement scale is unknown.

     To estimate the model, substitute equation (2) into equation (1) which

results in:


               (4) M =          + X262g1 + f1D + v1


and substitute equation (1) and (2) into equation (3) to get


               (5) S'I' =
                            x1610 ÷ X2S2(1+g10) + v2

The dummy variable, D, does not appear in equation (5) because pressure to

pass a 21 year old drinking age exists only if the drinking age is not 21.

     The model can be estimated using a two stage procedure.3 The first

step is the estimation of equation (5) by ordered probit with D replacing

5*. Four predicted probabilities result from this procedure. They are,

respectively, the probabilities of an 18, 19, 20 and 21 year old drinking

age. A new variable 5** is defined as the sum of the four drinking ages

weighted by their predicted probabilites. The variable 5** is the expected

drinking age and is continuous with upper and lower values of 21 and 18

respectively. The second step is the estimation of equation (4) with 5**

replacing D. Since the mortality rate has a restricted range a logistic

specification will conform to the data more closely than a linear specifi-

cation. The logistic specification is most easily achieved by transforming

the mortality rate to ln(M/1—M), where ln is the natural logarithm. Maddala
                                    —8—

 (1983) shows that weighted least squares should be used with this logistic

 transformation. The weight is: [nM/(1_M)]'"2, where n is the age specific

population of the state.

     The structural model defined by equation (4) and (5) has three impor-

tant features. First, the exogenous variables are the same in equation (4)

and (5). second, the error terms      and v2 are correlated. Finally, the

variable D in equation (4) is endogenous.

     Equation (4) and (5) are both identified even though identical exoge-

nous variables are used in the two equations and     and v2 are correlated.

Identification results from the use of D in equation (4) and S* in equation

(5). Under these conditions equation (4) can be distinguished from any

linear combination of equations (4) and (5). Empirically estimation is

possible because equation (5) is a nonlinear, specification.


III. Data

     The data set is a time series of state cross sections. The time period

is 1975 through 1981 and the cross sections include the 48 contiguous sta-

tes of the U.S.4 The values and summary definitions of all the

variables are show in'table 1.

     The mortality rate was computed as motor vehicle deaths, by age and

state, divided by population, by age and state. Motor vehicle deaths by age

and state were provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety

Administration and come from unpublished data in the Fatal Accident

Reporting System.5 Deaths pertain to state of occurrence rather than state

of residence. Population data by age and state for 1980 were taken from

the 1980 Census of Population (Bureau of the Census 1983) and for 1975
                                      —9--


 from the Area Resource File (Applied Management Sciences 1980). Population

 data for the remaining years was derived from a logarithmic trend using the

 1975 and 1980 data.6 The mortality rate was computed for all 15 to 17

 year old victims, 18 to 20 year old victims and 21 to 24 year old victims.7

      The legal drinking age variable is the minimum age for the purchase of

 beer with alcohol content of 3.2 percent or more. These data come from

 Wagenaar's (1981/1982) compilation of drinking age data.8 If a state

 raised its legal drinking age during the year, the drinking age is defined

 as the age in effect on January 1 of that year.

      The beer tax is the sum of the Federal and state excise tax rates on a

 case of 12 ounce containers of beer divided by the annual national Consumer

 Price Index (CPI). Deflation by the CPI is required to take account of

 trends in the prices of other goods between 1975 and 1981. Each regression

is estimated with time dummy variables to control trend in theprice data

and other data. The real beer tax is thus an accurate indicator of the

relative price of beer provided the non—tax component of the relative price

is not state dependent.

     The Federal excise tax on a case of beer was fixed in nominal terms at

64 cents during the sample period. State excise tax rates were obtained

from the U.S. Brewers Association (1984). If a state raised its tax during

the year rather than on January 1, its tax for the year is computed as a

weighted average of the higher and lower rates. The weights are the frac-

tion of the year that each rate was in effect.

     The exogenous variables in the    matrix include a border age dummy

variable. This variable is equal to one if a state has any bordering state
                                    — 10 —



with   a lower drinking age. The border age variable is included because high-

way mortality for 18 to 20 year olds may increase as a consequence of

interstate travel to purchase and consume beer.9

       Real per capita personal income is also included in the X1 matrix.

This variable should be positively related to the demand for beer, to the

quality and condition of motor vehicles, and to safe driving practices. The

last relationship emerges because income and schooling levels are positi-

vely related. In turn, more educated persons and their offspring are

likely to be safer drivers.    It follows that the predicted effect of income

on the death rate is ambiguous. The income data was published by the Bureau

of Economic Analysis.

       Three highway measures are included in the regressions. They are the

number of vehicle miles traveled in 100,000's of miles per licensed driver,

the number of licensed drivers aged 24 years or less as a fraction of the

population aged 15 to 24, and a dichotomous variable that identifies sta-

tes that require compulsory Inspection of motor vehicles every year.'0

Similar variables have been used in interstate studies of the determinants

of motor vehicle death rates of all age groups by Fuchs and Leveson (1967)

and Peltzman (1975). The number of vehicle miles traveled per driver

obviously reflects motor vehicle use and it is expected to have a positive

regression coefficient. In addition highway driving density probably rises

as the number of vehicle miles traveled per driver rises.   In general young

drivers are more accident prone than older drivers, possibly because the

former group has a higher demand for risky driving (Peltzman 1975). Thus,

an increase in the per capita number of young drivers should cause the
                                     — 11 —



 death rate to increase. States with compulsory motor vehicle inspection

 programs are expected to have a lower death rate than other states because

 these programs should result in safer vehicles being operated by the

 driving public.

       The number of licensed drivers of all ages, the number of licensed

 drivers aged 24 years or less, and the number of vehicle miles traveled

 were taken from the Federal Highway Administration. The Administration

 estimates vehicle miles of travel from data on gasoline consumption and

motor vehicle registration by state. The compulsory inspection variable was

 obtained from the Council of State Governments.

       The variables in the    matrix are determinants of unobserved exoge-

nous alcohol sentiment. For example, antialcohol sentiment should be rela-

tively widespread in states in which religious groups that oppose the use

of alcohol are prevalent. Antialcohol sentiment may also be high in states

which a higher than average percentage of the population reside in dry

counties. A dry county is one that prohibits the sale of alcoholic bevera-

ges.

       The variables included in the X2 matrix are the percentage of the

population who are Mormons, Southern Baptists, Catholics and Protestants

(excluding Southern Baptists and Mormons). These variables for the years

1971 and 1980 were taken from surveys conducted by the National Council of

Churches of Christ and the Glenmary Research Center." Estimates for

other years were computed by logarithmic trend. Also included in the
                                                                        X2
matrix is the percentage of state population that reside in dry counties.

These data were obtained from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United

States.

 IV.   Results
       Column 1 of 2 contains the results for a single equation mortality

model for 18 to 20 year olds. Column 2 and 3 of table 2 contain the

results for a simultaneous equation mortality model for 18 to 20 year olds.

The single equation mortality model assumes that the drinking age is exoge-

nous. This model provides an alternative to the simultaneous model and, by

comparison, illustrates the endogeneity bias. The single equation model is

estimated using weighted least squares and a logistic transformation of the

dependent variable.

       The estimation results for the single equation mortality model

generally conform to the a priori expectations. The real beer tax and the

drinking age are negative and significant as expected. The border age dummy

is positive and significant. This suggests that for contiguous states, dif-

ferences in drinking ages increase youth mortality rates. The income effect

is negative suggesting that higher income individuals, or their offspring,

are safer drivers and operate motor vehicles that are in better physical

condition. M increase in vehicle miles traveled per licensed driver is

found to raise mortality. States that require inspection of motor vehicles

are found to have lower mortality than other states. Finally the alcohol

sentiment variables all have the expected sign and all are significant with

the exception of the Southern Baptist variable.

       The estimation results for the simultaneous equation models are also

presented in table 2.   Column (2) contains the results for the mortality

equation and column (3) contains the results for the drinking age

equation. The two equation model is necessary to control reverse causality
                                     — 13 —



 in   the drinking age. The empirical verification of this causality assump-

 tion is found in the coefficient 0, which was described above. The value of

 0 cannot be directly estimated as a regression coefficent but can be esti-

mated by the ratio of the real beer tax coefficent from the drinking age

equation divided by the same coefficient from the mortality equation. The

value of 0 is estimated as 8.636. The variance of 0 was estimated using the

change of variable technique and the t value is 6.18.12 The empirical

evidence thus supports the endogeneity assumption and the need for a two

equation econometric model.'3

       The coefficients in the single equation model are biased because of

correlation of the drinking age with the error term. A comparison of

column (1) and column (2) in table (2) illustrates the effect of endoge—

neity bias. The drinking age coefficient remains negative and significant

in the simultaneous model, but the coefficients increase in absolute value.

The endogeneity problem also results in bias in the exogenous variable

coefficients. Column 2 of table (2) shows that the beer tax remains nega-

tive and significant but increases in absolute value. The border age

variable and Catholic variables become insignificant when simultaneity is

controlled. The Southern Baptist variable is insignificant in both the

single equation and simultaneous equation specifications. The coefficients

of the highway variables, income, and the exogenous alcohol sentiment

variables are somewhat larger in the simultaneous model than in the single

equation model.

      The results for the drinking age equation are presented in column (3)

of table 2. This equation can be interpreted as measuring the pressure to
                                   — 14 —



 pass a 21 year old drinking age. The tax, border age, income and highway

variables ard all included in this equation as indirect measures of mor-

 tality. These variables should have the same sign in the drinking age

equation as they have in the mortality equation because mortality has a

positive causal influence on the pressure to increase the drinking age.

The tax, border age and income variable are all significant and, as

expected, have the same sign in the drinking age equation as they have in

the mortality equation. None of the highway variables is significant. The

Catholic and Protestant variables are the only exogenous sentiment

variables that are significant. The sign of the Catholic and Protestant

variables would be positive if these groups exert political pressure to

increase the drinking age. The sign of these variables would be negative if

these groups exert pressure on young people not to drink and drive. Since

the Catholic and Protestant variables are negative the latter effect must

dominate.

     Column 4 and 5 of table 2 contain, respectively, the results for

simultaneous mortality models for 15 to 17 year olds and 21 to 24 year

olds. Both models are specified exactly as the 18 to 20 year old mortality

model, with the exception of the dependent variable. The drinking age

could affect mortality of 15 to 17 year olds. The probability that an

underaged individual can purchase alcohol may increase as the individual

approaches the legal drinking age. If underaged individuals who have

purchased alcohol, then drive drunk, the drinking age would affect mor-

tality of the 15 to 17 year olds. Since the drinking age is insignificant

in the 15 to 17 year old mortality equation, there is no support for this
                                     — 15 —




 hypothesis.   The drinking age could effect the mortality of 21 to 24 year

 olds if, as argued by Males (1986), higher drinking ages redistribute fata-

 lities to older age groups. Again the drinking age is insignificant and

 thus offers no support for this hypothesis. The border age variable is

 insignificant in both the younger and older age group equations. This

 result is not surprising since no state allows those under 18 years old to

 purchase alcohol nor prohibits those over 21 years old from purchasing

 alcohol. The real beer tax is negative and significant for both age

groups. For the younger group, this result may be the consequence of ille-

gal purchases or that members of this group may be with older friends in

fatal car accidents. The results for the remaining variables are similar

to the results in the 18 to 20 year old mortality equation.


V. Conclusions

     The purpose of this paper was to estimate the effects of the drinking

age and beer taxes on youth motor vehicle mortality. The drinking age is

assumed to be endogenous in the methodology used to compute these estima-

tes. The econometric results show that mortality has a significant causal

effect on the drinking age and that ignoring the problem of endogeneity

results in underestimation of the effects of this policy variable.

     The final problem to be considered is estimating the effects that exo-

genous shifts in the two policy variables, the drinking age and the beer

tax, will have on youth motor vehicle mortality. The coefficients and means

values from the 18 to 20 year old mortality equation can be used to compute

elasticities. The elasticity is defined as: E = $(1—M).    The elasticity

of mortality with respect to the drinking age is 1.78 and the elasticity
                                    — 16 —



with   respect to the real beer tax is .19. An increase in the drinking age

to 21, which is approximately 8 percent on average, would reduce mortality

in the 18 to 20 year old group by approximately 14 percent. Also a 100 per-

cent increase in the real beer tax (approximately $1.50 per 24 unit case)

would reduce highway mortality of 18 to 20 year olds by about 19 percent.

This increase in the beer tax would reduce mortality by about 8 percent for

the 15 to 17 year olds and by about 18 percent for the 21 to 24 year olds.

In summary, the econometric results show that the drinking age and beer tax

both have a significant influence on youth motor vehicle mortality.

Harris (1984), Becker (1985) and Jacobson and Albion (1985).

       2Grossman, Coate and Arluck (1986) provide data which indicate that beer

is the drink of choice amoung youths who drink alcoholic beverages. This

study also finds no evidence that youths substitute one alcoholic beverage

for another in response to price changes. This finding is consistent with

those of other studies of the demand for alcoholic beverages. These studies

are summerized by Ornstein (1980).

   3The ordered probit estimation of equation (5) is consistent and effi-

cient. However, in equation (4), since 5** replaces U the two step proce-

dure is consistent but not efficient. Amemiya (1979) provides a method for

computation of the correct covariance matrix. For notational convenience,

let:

        X =    [ X1   X2 J       (unweighted    data)

        L = [ X1 X2 S** )        (weighted     data)

        A2 =   [i     82(1+gO)

Estimation      of equation (4) and (5) provides a consistent estimates of f and

data to compute 3,
                        ci,     and

   4Alaska and Hawaii were omitted from the data set because several impor—

tant variables were missing for these two states. The District of Columbia

was omitted because it is likely that many of its motor vehicle accidents

involve nonresidents.

   5The Fatal Accident Reporting System is described in detail in NHTSA

(1983). Note that NHTSA tabulates alcohol related motor vehicle fatalities.

These data were not used because the identification of alcohol related

crashes is made by the police based on methods that vary from state to

state.

   6Population estimates for years other than 1980 were adjusted so that

the age specific sum for every year coincided with the U.S. total reported

by the Bureau of the Census (1982).

   7prior studies of the effect of changes in the drinking age have used a

variety of mortality measures.         These include: (1) nighttime fatal accidents

involving youthful drivers; (2) nighttime single vehicle fatal accidents

involving youthful drivers; (3) nighttime single vehicle fatal accidents
                                         — 21 —




 involving   youthful male drivers. Cook and Tauchen point out that these

 measures are only remotely indicative of total social costs. For this

 reason the mortality measure chosen includes all fatalities regardless of

 time of day or number of vehicles.

    8The legal age for the purchase of beer is very highly correlated with

 legal age for the purchase of liquor or wine. It is, therefore, not

 possible to use more than one drinking age variable in the same regression.

    9since fatalities are recorded by state of occurrence, this variable

 will have a positive correlation with mortality if border crossing youths

 are killed in their own state.

   '°The number of licensed drivers for the years 1976, 1978, and 1980 was

 obtained by averaging the number of drivers in the preceding and following

years.

   Jews are included with non—church members in the omitted category

because the size of the Jewish population was not reported in the 1971 sur-

vey and was significantly underestimated in the 1980 survey.

  '2The value of 0 can be estimated using any pair of         coefficients from

eiiuations (4) and (5). However the only X1 coefficients that are signifi-

cant in both equations (4) and (5) are for the tax and income. The income

coefficients also resulted in positive and significant estimates of 0. To

compute the variance of 0 let h1 =      the real beer tax coefficent in the
drinking age equation and h2 =      the real beer tax coefficient in the mor-

tality equation. The variable 0 is then h1/h2. The variance of 0 is

defined by a Taylor series expansion and is equal to
                                                          var(h1)* 1/h2 +
var(h2)*                .   The covariance of h1 and h2 is assumed to be zero.

  13Endogeneity of the real beer tax is also possible. However, several
variations of a three equation model failed to generate any meaningful evi-

dence of tax endogeneity. The main problem with these models was cross sec-

tional identification of the tax equation.
