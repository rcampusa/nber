The Relative Stability of Money and Credit "Velocities" in the United States:

                       Evidence and Some Speculations



                                 ABSTRACT


        Is credit as closely related to income as is money? Results present-
 ed in the first half of this paper, based on a variety of methodological
 approaches, consistently indicate that the aggregate of outstanding credit
 liabilities of all nonfinancial borrowers in the United States bears as
 close a relationship to U.S. nonfinancial activity as do the more familiar
 asset aggregates like the money stock (however measured) or the monetary
 base. In contrast to the asset aggregates, however, which exhibit little
 overall difference among themselves in this context, total nonfinancial
 indebtedness appears to be unique among credit aggregates in bearing this
 close relationship to income.   Moreover, additional evidence of offsetting
 movements of the public and private components of total nonfinancial
 indebtedness further substantiates the case for stability in the aggregate.

        The second half of the paper suggests three hypotheses that provide
 internally consistent potential explanations for this phenomenon:   (1) an
 "ultrarationality" hypothesis which emphasizes acute perceptions and
 offsetting actions on the part of the private sector, (2) a "capital
 leveraging" hypothesis which emphasizes borrowing limitations and the
 need for tangible collateral, and (3) an "asset demand" hypothesis which
 emphasizes the private sector's role as a net lender. Initial efforts to
 match these hypotheses against data for the U.S. household and corporate
 business sectors yield only mixed results, however. The stability of the
 credit—to—income relationship remains for the present a major puzzle,
 therefore, although these three hypotheses do look sufficiently promising
 to warrant a much closer investigation.

 THE RELATIVE STABILITY OF MONEY AND CREDIT "VELOCITIES" IN THE UNITED STATES:

                         EVIDENCE AND SOME SPECULATIONS



                              Benjamin M. Friedxnan*

        It is curious that economic analysis has traditionally placed so much

more emphasis on money than on credit.

        In the simplest abstraction to an economy with no privately issued

financial instruments, there is no such thing as credit, and money exists

only in the form of government—issued base money. The relevance of such an

abstraction is questionable, however, in a context in which there exist not

only privately issued financial instruments but also a large quantity and

rich variety of institutions whose business consists almost exclusively of

issuing and holding such instruments. In an actual economy like that of the

United States, most money is in fact not base money but bank money, and

privately issued financial instruments constitute the great majority of all

financial instruments held. Of course it is always possible to proceed on

the assumption that privately issued financial instruments exist but do not

matter much, so that the economy's privately issued liabilities simply offset

the remainder of its financial assets, and base money is once again all that

matters for economic activity beyond some level of disaggregated detail.

Although there have been some proponents of such a view,' it is nonetheless

inconsistent with the emphasis more typically placed on bank money as well

as base money in most analysis.

        Once the analysis moves beyond an exclusive focus on base money,

however — thereby acknowledging that financial intermediation not only
                                     —2—



 exists but also matters — economic theory provides no a priori reason

 whatever to suspect a role for the nonbank public's money holdings but not

 its credit liabilities. For given growth in base money, the behavior of the

 banking system as well as of the nonbank public determines the growth of

 both bank money and bank credit, and does so jointly with the determination

 of the growth of nonbank financial instruments and of nonfinancial economic

 activity. In theoretical analysis there is no justification for paying

 attention •to the "money" side of this process while disregarding the "credit"

side. In applied analysis the most familiar argument for emphasizing money

while disregarding credit usually rests on some kind of implicit empirical

judgment that, especially for the United States, the arbitrariness associated

with defining "credit" measures is significantly more troublesome than the

arbitrariness associated with defining "money" measures. In a standard

example, whether a particular credit extension goes through the banking

system or the commercial paper market (or even the long—term bond market) is

presumably at most a second—order matter. Recent developments have done much

to vitiate this familiar empirical judgment, however, and there now exist

substantial and rapidly growing anomalies on the "money" side that are fully

comparable to those that have long been familiar on the "credit" side.

Surely it is also a second—order matter whether the public holds bank—issued

money market certificates (enabling banks to make direct loans), in which

case "money" increases, or holds commercial paper via money market fund shares

that may be checkable but are excluded from "money" nonetheless. More broadly,

the conventional inclusion in "money" of non—deposit claims against deposit—

issuing institutions (for example, seven—year saving certificates) contrasts

oddly with the exclusion of fully liquid claims against everyone else.

        This paper's point of departure is the simple observation that, in
                                        —3—



  the United States during the post World War II period, the total amount of

  debt claims issued in the credit markets by all nonfinancial participants in

  the economy has born a remarkably stable
                                               relationship to nonfinancial
  economic activity as measured by gross national product        arguably, a more
  stable relationship than that shown by the monetary base or by any of the

  familiar "M" measures that include bank money. This observed stability of

  the economy's aggregate nonfinancial debt ratio, taken by itself, is not

 necessarily surprising. That makes it surprising, however, is that the

 economy-wide total has been so stable despite wide variation in the debt

 issuing activity of the different sectors of whose claims the total consists.

 In particular, households and nonfinancial corporations have paced their

 issuance of debt, in both the secular and the cyclical time frames, so as

 almost exactly to offset the secular decline and cyclical variation in the

 indebtedness of the federal government.

         The paper's object is to make a beginning (for it is only that) toward

 understanding the role that debt plays in the economic system and hence the

behavior underlying the observed stability of the debt-to—income relationship

in the United States. This line of research appears, at least at the outset,

to be of potential value in several regards in addition to the light it may

shed on more basic questions of economic
                                              behavior. For example, some of the
hypotheses that may possibly explain the existence of a stable debt ratio

have fairly direct implications for whether fiscal policy either can provide

an effective economic stimulus or will merely "crowd out" private activity.

Similarly, some of these hypotheses bear implications
                                                          for leverage structures,
in the sense of the mix of debt and
                                      equity by which individuals and businesses
in the private economy will finance their asset holdings. The results of

such research also have potential implications for the choice of target
                                      —4—.



variables for monetary policy, especially under   the   currently prevalent

approach that employs some endogenous variable (like money) as an inter-

mediate policy target. Finally, a major objective of this line of inquiry

is to call into question — and, if appropriate, to redirect        the peculiar

balance—sheet asymmetry of current economic research that almost always

emphasizes money over credit, bank liabilities over bank assets, and public

assets over public liabilities.

        Section I presents data for the U.S. economy's total nonfinancial

debt ratio and for its components by sector, and documents the ratio's

strong stability through comparisons based on several different methodologies.

Section II sketches the simple outlines of three alternative approaches to

explaining this phenomenon: specifically, an "ultrarationality" hypothesis,

a "capital leveraging" hypothesis, and an "asset demand" hypothesis.

Section III briefly inspects some evidence, based on U.S. household and

corporate sector balance sheet data, that may bear on the adequacy of these

possible explanations; it is important to emphasize at the outset, however,

that this paper stops well short of rigorously developing and testing any

specific hypothesis. Section IV briefly summarizes the paper's principal

findings, re—emphasizes some important caveats, and goes on to assess the

prospects for unravelling the underlying relationships among money, credit

and nonfinancial economic activity.

 I. The Stability of the Total Debt Relationship

        The Basic Data. Table 1 presents data showing the yearend indebt-

edness of U.S. nonfinancial borrowers, as a ratio to fourth—quarter gross

national product (and multiplied by 100), for each of the twenty—six years

in the standard sample period beginning after the Treasury-Federal Reserve

Accord freed monetary policy from the wartime constraint of supporting

government bond prices. The first column of the table shows the total

credit market indebtedness of all U.S. nonfinancial borrowers. The next

five columns present comparable data dividing this total into the respective

indebtedness of each of five specific borrowing sectors. The table's final

column shows, as a memorandum item, comparable data (not included in the

total in the first column) for the debt issued in U.S. markets by foreign

borrowers.2 Figure 1 plots the total nonfinancial debt ratio and its five

components by sector.

        These data are "net" in the sense that they net out financial inter-

mediation. In other words, the data include such items as a household's

mortgage issued to a bank, or a corporation's bonds sold to an insurance

company, but they exclude any liability issued in turn by the bank or the

insurance company in order to finance that lending activity. The data also

exclude debt issued by separate financial subsidiaries of nonfinancial

corporations, as well as by federally sporsored credit agencies and mortgage

pools. The data are "gross," however, in the sense that they include all

of an individual household or firm's outstanding credit market liabilities,

not just any excess of liabilities over either financial or total assets,

and also in the sense that they include one household's borrowing from

another or one firm's borrowing from another.
                                    —6—



        The strong stability of the total nonfinancial debt ratio, shown in

the top line in Figure 1 and the first column of Table 1, stands out in stark

contrast to the variation of the individual sector components. The non-

financial economy's reliance on debt, scaled in relation to economic activity,

has shown almost no trend and but little variation during the past quarter

century. During this period the total nonfinancial debt ratio has trended

slightly upward, with a low of 133.4 in 1956 and a high of 145.9 in 1964.

Not surprisingly, the ratio has also exhibited a slight cyclicality, typically

rising a point or two in recession years (when gross national product, in the

denominator, is weak). At 143.3, the most recent observation is nearly back

at the 1964 high.

        The individual components of this total, however, have varied in

sharply different directions both secularly and cyclically. In brief, the

secular postwar rise in private debt has largely mirrored a substantial

decline, relative to economic activity, in public debt, while cyclical

bulges in public debt issuance have mostly had their counterpart in the

abatement of private borrowing. Households have almost continually increased

their reliance on debt in relation to their nonfinancial activity throughout

this period. Both corporations and unincorporated businesses have also

issued steadily more debt, on a relative basis, except for temporary

retrenchments during recession years. State and local governments steadily

increased their relative debt issuing activity during the l950s and 1960s,

but have just as steadily reduced it during the 1970s. Except only for 1975

and 1976, the federal government has reduced its debt ratio in every year

throughout the postwar period, although more slowly in years when recession

has temporarily inflated its deficit (and, again, depressed gross national

product in the denominator). These data on debt issuing activity by the

 federal government are especially enlightening in the context of the recent

widespread expressions of concern over the magnitude and import of the federal

 deficit. During the post World War II period, the federal debt ratio has in

 fact declined not just from 63.0 in 1953 but from 103.5 in 1946. Moreover,

at 28.0 as of yearend 1978, the ratio of federal indebtedness to gross

national product stands once again at almost precisely its value in 1918.

At the same time, it is also true that the past half decade has marked a

departure from prior experience in an important way. The years 1975 and 1976

were the first in the postwar period in which the federal government's debt

ratio actually rose, and the renewed decline in 1977 and 1978 has not yet

reduced the ratio to its prerecession low.

        Although the principal focus of this paper is on the post-Accord

experience shown in Figure 1, it is also useful to consider briefly the

history of the debt ratio in a longer time frame.3 Figure 2 shows the size

and composition of the U.S. nonfinancial debt ratio (with corporations and

unincorporated businesses aggregated) for 1918—78. Apart from a one-time

adjustment associated with the fall of prices after World War I, the U.S.

nonfinancial economy's reliance on debt relative to economic activity has

shown essentially no trend over these sixty years. At 143 as of yearend 1978,

the debt ratio was virtually unchanged from 142 in 1921. Nonfinancial

borrowers' outstanding debt rose significantly in relation to gross national

product only during the depression years 1930—33, when gross national product

itself not only was well below trend but also was falling too rapidly for the

pay—down of debt to keep pace.4 Otherwise the economy's total nonfinancial

debt ratio has remained roughly steady throughout this period, and the post—

Accord stability appears to be in large part a continuation of a pattern that

dates back at least to the l920s.

           Comparison to Other Financial Ratios. Just how stable is the U.S.
 economy's aggregate debt ratio? The question that immediately arises is,

 stable in comparison to what? Given the traditional emphasis that economic

analysis has placed on the relationship between money and economic activity,

the usual money—income "velocities" provide a standard for comparison that

is sufficiently familiar to be a good place to begin.

          Table 2 summarizes the stability of the ratios to gross national

product of ten financial aggregates by showing the coefficient of variation

 (standard deviation normalized by mean) for each ratio computed from both

annual and quarterly U.S. data over the 1953-78 sample period (except for

the M3 money stock, for which data begin only in 1959). In each case the

table shows the coefficient of variation computed from raw data, and also

computed from detrended data. Among the debt measures included in Table 2,

"total net liabilities" is the total credit market indebtedness 'of non-

financial U.S. borrowers, as shown in column 1 of Table 1; "total liabilities"

is a broader measure that includes total net liabilities plus the credit

market indebtedness of U.S. financial institutions;5 "net non-federal

liabilities" is a narrower measure that only includes the net liabilities

of U.S. nonfinancial borrowers other than the federal government; net private

liabilities" is the analogous measure that excludes not only federal but also

state and local governments; and "bank credit" is the total of commercial

bank   loans and investments in the flow—of—funds accounts. Among the asset
measures, the monetary base (currency plus bank reserves adjusted for changes
in   reserve requirements), Ml (currency plus demand deposits), M2 (Ml plus

coinmerical bank time and saving deposits other than large negotiable

certificates), and M3 (M2 plus time and saving deposits at thrift institutions)

all follow standard definitions.6 "Net financial assets" is a generally

 broader measure that includes total holdings of currency, deposits, and

 credit market debt instruments by all U.S. nonfinancial holders (specifically,

 thefive sectors broken out in Table 1); it is "net" in the analogous sense
 that it excludes assets held by financial institutions, and therefore nets
 out   financial intermediation.

          For both annual and quarterly data, the coefficients of variation

 reported in Table 2 show an immediate contrast between those financial

 aggregates that exhibit time trends in their respective gross national

 product "reciprocal valocities" — including the monetary base, the Ml money

 stock, net non-federal liabilities, and net private liabilities — and those

 that apparently have little or no trend. Judged on the basis of the

coefficients of variation computed from ratios of the raw data, the total

net liabilities measure (from the first column of Table 1) displays the

second steadiest relationship to gross national product out of the ten

aggregates included in Table 2. The only one that is superior is the

corresponding net aggregate on the asset side. None of the subtotals on

either the money or the credit side, including the much heralded M2 money

stock, exhibits the stability of the two economy—wide net totals.

         The coefficients of variation computed from the detrended ratios are

more closely clustered, but again the net financial assets measure shows the

greatest stability, and total net liabilities follows closely behind. After

detrending, however, the total liabilities measure including the credit

market debt of intermediaries shows marginally more stability than the

corresponding net measure excluding them. Detrending improves the stability

of the ratios based on the other measures also, but in no case other than

the M3 money stock (for which the sample period is shorter) by enough even

to come close to the range of the three economy—wide aggregates. In light of
                                   —10--




the increased attention recently paid by many economists to the monetary

base, it is interesting to note that the stability of the base ranks tenth

out of ten among the detrended series, in both the annual and the quarterly

data.

        The Covariance of Public and Private Debt Ratios. An argument for

the stability of an aggregate inevitably relies on some notion of negative

covariance among that aggregate's components. In the case of the economy's

total nonfinancial debt ratio, as shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, what makes

the stability of the ratio so interesting is in part the lack of stability

among the respective debt ratios of the several individual nonfinancial

sectors. Stability of the total debt ratio requires that movements in any

one sector's debt relative to economic activity typically be offset by

movements in the opposite direction in at least some other sector's debt.

Although casual inspection of Figure 1 and Table 1 suggests the appearance

of such a negative covariance relationship, the question is sufficiently

important to warrant more careful investigation.

        A useful approach to analyzing interrelationships among economic time

series in this context is the vector autoregression.7 In brief, the vector

autoregression methodology first expresses each of a system of variables as

a function of lagged values of itself, lagged values of the other variables,

and a disturbance term; then solves this representation to express each

variable as a function of the entire history of the disturbances associated

with it and the other variables; and, finally, investigates the direction and

magnitude of the response of each variable to given independent shocks, or

"innovations," to any or all variables in the system. The vector auto-

regression is straightforward to estimate empirically, and simulation of the

solved-out system can then show whether innovations in particular variables
                                           —11—



 result in system—wide responses consistent with specific hypotheses under

 investigation.

         Although in principle it would be possible to apply this vector auto-

 regression methodology to as full a disaggregation of the total nonfinancial

 debt ratio as could be estimated with the available data — for example, the

 five—sector breakdown used in Table 1 —          the   resulting profusion of partial

 relationships would shed little light on the basic question of whether a

 negative covariance between some nonfinancial sector's debt ratio and some

 other's acts to preserve stability over time in the total. A simpler

approach, which not only renders the results more easily understandable but

also provides potentially useful insights for the discussion of behavioral

hypotheses in Sections II and III below, is to disaggregate only so far as

to distinguish the federal government's debt ratio and that of the private

nonfinancial   sector (here including state and local governments). The
resulting vector autoregression is

 so that     is "the LG/y disturbance" and 2 "the L/Y disturbance" in the

 usual sense, in general the 111 and 112 series generated in the estimation of

 and L/Y resulting from specific movements of P and 2 would contain all the

 information that the vector autoregression system can provide, but it is

 easier to think intuitively about the implications of such a simulation when

 it is possible to identify as its driving force an independent innovation in

 either LG/Y or L/Y. Hence it is useful either to subtract out of                that

 part of its variation that is correlated with 2 so as to leave the residual

 to represent the independent innovation in LG/Y or, alternatively, to subtract

 out of 2 that part of its variation that is correlated with 1J so as to

 leave the residual to represent the independent innovation in L/Y. The

orthogonalization of (2) that extracts the independent LG/Y innovation (say,

      for example, is simply

L/Y remains unaffected contemporaneously, so that in the initial year the

economy's total nonfinancial debt ratio (LG + L)/Y also rises by 1%. Within

the next several years, however, a gradual decay in LC/Y and an offsetting

downward move in L/Y combine to eliminate virtually all of the initial bulge

in the total nonfinancial debt ratio caused by a positive shock to the

government component. This pattern appears to be consistent with an under-

lying model in which the innovation in the government debt ratio due to

 deficit spending subsequently stimulates income, thereby lowering the private

 debt ratio unless private borrowing increases in pace, but it may be consistent

with other models too. The important feature of these results here is simply

that they document a negative dynamic covariance in the two major components

of the economy's aggregate nonfinancial debt ratio.

        The bottom half of Table 3 presents the results of analogous simulations

based on the alternative orthogonalization that extracts €2 as the independent

innovation in L/Y. In this case the positive innovation in L/Y exhibits

some momentum effect in the second year (although the relevant standard error

does not permit rejecting at any reasonable confidence level the null hypothesis

that the second—year L/Y value is 1.00 instead of 1.12), but thereafter the

decay is fairly rapid. Moreover, the offsetting negative movement in LG/Y

appears immediately (that is, immediately after the one-period delay imposed

by construction) and in substantial magnitude. Hence the total nonfinancial

debt ratio achieves its original value again fairly quickly after a shock to

private borrowing also. In sum, both sets of results presented in Table 3

document the existence of offsetting movements within the aggregate debt ratio

and hence both quantify and reinforce the casual impression of negative

covariance given by Figure 1 and Table 1.

        Comparison of Nominal Income Regressions. Simple ratios of precisely

contemporaneous observations may well fail to capture the relevant concept of

"stability" in the relationship among variables that move over time with some

general lead or lag pattern between them. Table 4 presents summary statistics

for single equations, estimated using U.S. quarterly data for 1953-78 (except

for M3), relating the growth of nominal gross national product to a moving

average of the growth of each of the ten financial aggregates listed in Table

federal government expenditures measured on a full employment basis; a, the

.   and the y. are estimated scalar coefficients; and the . and y. are both

constrained to lie along fourth-degree polynomials with the implied

    =    =    = 0.
        The implications of the results shown in Table 4 for the stability of

the different aggregates are, with few exceptions, roughly comparable to the

results of the simple ratio tests shown in Table 2. Net financial assets

again appears to have the most stable relation to gross national product,

with total liabilities, total net liabilities, and the M2 and M3 money stocks

ranking nearly as before.8 The most noticeable changes from the rankings

shown in Table 2 are the strong performance of the Ml money stock, which

ranks second on this criterion, and the poor performance of bank credit,

which here ranks last.

        It would be interesting to know to what extent the rankings shown in

Table 4 represent a consistent stability or lack thereof over the entire

1953—78 sample, as opposed to one or more significant shifts in otherwise

fairly stable relationships. The Durbin—Watson statistic for bank credit,

for example —   the   measure ranking tenth — shows significant evidence of

positive serial correlation of the equation's residuals. Similarly, the

Durbin—Watson statistic for the monetary base —       the   measure ranking ninth —

shows possible evidence of serial correlation. A recent accumulation of

evidence has shown that the Federal Reserve System's change in 1970, to a
                                   -16—



policy strategy placing greater emphasis on monetary aggregates, was more than

merely rhetorical as some critics have alleged.9 This change may well have

altered some of the relationships under consideration here. In addition, it

is possible that the Federal Reserve's removal of Regulation Q interest

ceilings from most large negotiable certificates of deposit in 1970 may also

have had an effect on some of these relationships.10 Hence 1970 is a

plausible time to expect a break on a priori grounds.

        The first column of Table 5 presents F—statistics for a test of the

null hypothesis of no break at the beginning of 1970 in the regression

equations reported in Table 4. The only three measures for which it is not

possible to reject this null hypothesis at the .05 level are the two overall

net asset and liability totals (for which the margin of non—rejection is

minimal) and M3 (which has a much shorter pre-1970 sample period). For all

seven other measures the data provide significant evidence of a break at 1970.

        The remaining columns of Table 5 present summary statistics for the

analogous regressions run over the shorter 1970—78 sample period. It is

interesting that the standard errors reported here are typically of about the

same magnitude as those shown in Table 4, but the fraction of the variation

of gross national product growth explained is much lower. These results

again confirm the strong stability of net financial assets and total liabilities,

and the only slightly less strong stability of the other credit measures (this

time including bank credit). On the money side, only the Ml money stock

performs comparably. For this short sample period the M2 money stock and the

monetary base rank respectively ninth and tenth among the ten measures examined.

        In part because of the extent to which regressions of the form (7)

have been discredited by a variety of criticisms,U researchers examining the

money—income (or, here, debt—income) relationship have increasingly turned to

 methods that relate the variation of income not to the entirety of the

 variation of money but to that part of it which cannot already be deduced

estimated using the same quarterly data for the same ten U.S. financial

aggregates as in Tables 4 and 5, with eight quarters of lags on each variable

F and Y separately and then for the "reciprocal velocity" ratio F/y, which

would be analogous to the procedure followed in Table 3 since ln(F/Y) =

ln   F —   in Y,     for convenience the table reports only the response of F/Y.

Moreover, instead of presenting the complete time path, the table presents

values only for the initial quarter and then for the final quarter in each

of the first five years.

ten financial aggregate ratios in response to a 1% innovation in the respective

aggregate. By construction, Y remains unaffected contemporaneously, so that

in the initial quarter each F/Y ratio also rises by 1%. After several quarters,

however, the bulge disappears from most of the ratios as Y rises or F declines,

or both. In the absence of a largely arbitrary judgment of the exact time

horizon that is relevant to the analysis, it is impossible to interpret these

results in other than a descriptive way. Even so, 'the comparisons are quite

suggestive. Among the five asset ratios, those for the Ml and M2 money stocks

and for the net asset total all decline rapidly albeit irregularly, while the

ratio for the M3 rrcney stock continues to rise through the first year before

then declining. The monetary base ratio over-corrects (although not signifi-

cantly so at usual confidence levels) and then remains persistently negative.

In sum, except perhaps for the over-correction of the monetary base ratio,

there is little to distinguish the respective simulation patterns shown by

these five financial asset ratios.

        The same is not true for the five debt ratios, however. Here only

the total net liabilities ratio — again, the series documented in Table 1

and Figure 1 — and the bank credit ratio (though to a lesser extent) return

rapidly and monotonically to their initial values after a shock to the

relevant aggregate. What is especially interesting in these results is the

contrast between the performance of the ratio for total net liabilities and

the ratios for net non—federal liabilities and net private liabilities (both

of which are just components of total net liabilities) as well as the total

liabilities measure consisting of total net liabilities plus the liabilities

of financial intermediaries. Both the net private liabilities ratio and the

slightly broader net non-federal liabilities ratio continue to move further

away from their initial values for two years in response to an innovation in
                                      —19—



 the relevant aggregate, and neither shows any significant return to its

 initial value within five years —    hardly   a demonstration of "stability."

 Once net federal liabilities are included as well, however, the total net

 liabilities ratio exhibits just as much stability in this context as does any

 of the five asset ratios. Moreover, proceeding to broaden the liability

 measure further by including intermediaries' debt only results in lessened

 apparent stability.

         Among the various liability measures considered, therefore,

 these results suggest that there is indeed something unique about total net

 (that is, nonfinancial sector) liabilities. It is as if the Ml money stock

 ratio were sharply unstable, but adding commercial bank time and saving

 deposits to form the M2 money stock ratio yielded stability, and further

adding thrift institution deposits to form the 143 money stock ratio destroyed

that stability — none of which appears to happen. Hence not only does the

total net liabilities ratio exhibit just as much stability as any of the five

asset ratios in these vector autoregression tests, it does so uniquely among

the various debt aggregates tested.

        The lower half of Table 6 presents the results of analogous simulations

based on the alternative orthogonalizaiton of (9) that extracts c2 as the

independent innovation in Y. In this case, by construction, it is F that

remains unaffected contemporaneously, so that in the initial quarter a 1%

innovation in Y generates a 1% decline in Fly. Subsequently, however, F/Y

rises as the innovation in Y decays or F rises, or both. The paths traced by

the ten asset or liability ratios are sufficiently similar, however, that

there appears to be little ground for distinguishing among them here.

        Evidence from More Complete Vector Autoregression Systems. One

element in the tendency of recent research to eschew reliance on simple

nominal income regressions of the form (7) has been an increasing reluctance
                                           —20—



to focus on the relationship between money (or, here, debt) and nominal

income without distinguishing between the real and price components in nominal

income variation. Table 7 presents simulation results that are analogous to

those shown in Table 6 but based on the trivariate system

where P is the gross national product price deflator (1972=100), X is real

income (Y/P), and all other symbols are exactly analogous to their counterparts

in (8) and (9). Like Table 6, Table 7 again shows simulation results only

for the various asset or liability ratios, in each case solved simply as

ln[F/(X.P)] =   lnF   -   lnX   -   lnP.   The estimation and sample period are again

the same as for (8).

        The three panels of Table 7 successively present results for the

simulation of (ii) orthogonalized to extract           as the independent innovation

in F, to extract C2 as the independent innovation in X, and to extract C3 as

the independent innovation in P. The responses of the asset or liability

ratios to an innovation in the relevant aggregate, shown in panel A, resemble

those shown in Table 6 for the analogous bivariate system. Considering the

roles of real income and prices separately does little to alter the earlier

impression of stability of the ratios for most of the asset aggregates and for

total   net liabilities (and, to a lesser extent, bank credit), in contrast to

instability of the ratios for liabilities measures that are components of the

total net liabilities aggregate. The responses to an innovation in real income,

shown in panel B, also largely resemble the responses shown in Table 6 resulting

from an innovation in nominal income. Again there is little to distinguish

the stability of one ratio from that of another in this context. The responses

to an innovation in prices, shown in panel C, bear some resemblence (with

appropriate sign changes) to the responses to innovations in the respective

aggregates from panel A, although some interesting differences emerge. Once

again the total net liabilities ratio appears to be quite stable despite

strong instability in its two components. In addition, the net financial

assets and monetary base ratios again appear stable, although with somewhat

more (temporary) over—correction than before in the latter. The notable

contrasts to the panel A results are the appearance of greater stability in

the ratio for the M3 money stock and less stability in the ratios for the Ml

money stock and for bank credit.

          Finally, Table 8 presents simulation results for a four—variable

system including the Ml money stock, total net liabilities (LF), real

income and prices, estimated and solved analogously to (10) and (11) for the

vector [in Mt in            in X, in P1'. The four panels of the table show

simulation results for the system orthogonalized successively to extract the

independent innovations in M, LT', X and P. In each case the table shows

the time paths of the individual responses of the four variables in the

system,   together with the "reciprocal velocity" ratios for the money and debt
variables.

the money stock remains enlarged throughout the five years, debt exhibits a

mostly temporary positive response in the first year only, real income is

sharply higher in the first year but lower thereafter, and prices rise to a

new higher level within three years. The money ratio therefore at first over—

corrects (because of the strong real income response) and then stabilizes

with some small (and insignificant) oscillations. The debt ratio first

declines sharply but then returns essentially to its initial value. Here the

money and debt ratios appear to be of comparable stability. In response to

an analogous innovation in nonfinancial debt (panel B), the debt variable

remains enlarged throughout the five years, both the money stock and prices

are temporarily higher, and real income, after a small dip in the first year,

is irregularly higher throughout. The debt ratio therefore continues to

rise through the first year, but then declines fairly regularly toward its

initial value. The money ratio is first higher, and then persistently lower.

Here the debt ratio appears to be, if anything, more stable than the money

ratio. Finally, the responses to innovations in real income (panel C) and in

prices (panel D) provide little basis for judging the relative stability of the

money and debt ratios.

        Overview. What conclusion does this battery of descriptive statistics

and assorted tests suggest for the stability of the relationship between the

U.S. economyts total nonfinancial indebtedness and its underlying nonfinancial

activity? At the very least, this collection of results indicates that the

stability of this relationship is just as strong as the stability of comparable

but more familiar relationships involving various definitions of the money

stock or the monetary base. Beyond that, the data repeatedly suggest that

the relationship for the total nonfinancial debt measure is more stable than

that for any of its underlying components.

II. Three Possible Explanations of the Stability of the Debt Ratio


        Some   Familiar   Basics. A fairly standard element of many simple models

of economic steady states is a fixed proportional relationship between the

flow of income and the stock of wealth.13 Moreover, under assumptions

involving such matters as the production process and the population age

structure, a fixed proportional wealth—to—income relation may also be charac-

teristic of models of steady—state growth)4 In either case the rationale

stems from the familiar view that the chief motive for holding wealth is to

derive the stream of services (broadly defined) that flow from various forms

of wealth, and that the demand for such services by individual maximizers is

(like the demand for nondurable consumption) proportional to income.

        In the absence of claims issued by either the government or private

participants in the economy, the "wealth" that is (or may be) proportional to

income in such models consists entirely of tangible assets. In the presence

of financial claims, however, the wealth concept that is most plausible to

relate to income flows in this manner is presumably net worth, and exactly

how to define net worth becomes a potentially important issue. In a basic

model with financial claims but no financial intermediaries, the net worth

relation is either again simply

           NW       TA                                                      (12)

if the private sector "sees through the shell" of government and treats the

government's liabilities as if they were its own, or else

           NW =     TA+LG                                                   (13)

where NW is net worth, TA is tangible assets, and LG is again the government's

liabilities. An alternative way of stating (13), when the government's

holdings of financial assets are approximately zero, is

           NW =     TA+FA-L                                                 (14)
                                      —24—



where FA is total financial asset holdings and       is again the private sector's

financial liabilities. Since all financial claims must be held,15

            LG +   L=   FA.                                                    (15)

Finally, an alternative form of (15) that is relevant in the presence of

financial intermediaries is
                                P
            LG +LP +LI =       FA   +FAI                                       (16)


where FA now distinguishes financial assets held by the private nonfinancial

sector, and L' and FA' are respectively the liabilities owed and assets held

by intermediaries.'6 Nothing in (12)-(16) changes if all variables are

measured as ratios to income        a convention that is to be understood whenever

it is relevant in what follows.

        In terms of these relationships, the basic phenomenon documented in

Section I is the strong stability of the sum L + LG (again, as ratios to

gross national product) for the U.S. economy. The stability of this stock—

flow relationship raises issues that are in part reminiscent of those involved

in the flow-flow relationship associated primarily with Denison [41 and

subsequently studied by others. In addition, as was noted at the outset, its

stability in comparison with financial measures more commonly used as a basis

for monetary policy discussions raises issues about the use of the money

stock (however defined) as the intermediate target variable, or more generally

as the most important information variable, for the conduct of monetary

policy.17 Even as a matter of purely basic research into economic behavior,

however, the results assembled in Section I naturally lead to the question of

why — in the scientific sense meaning "how" — the       economy's total non-

financial debt ratio turns out to be so stable.

        An Ultraratioriality Hypothesis. In their analysis of the stability of

U.S. gross private saving in relation to gross national product typically
                                   —25—



known as "Denison's Law," David and Scadding [2] introduced an hypothesis of

"ultrarationality" which, after appropriate transformation from a flow—flow

context to a stock—flow context, also represents a possible explanation for

the stability of U.S. nonfinancial indebtedness in relation to gross national

product. Specifically, David and Scadding argued that individuals "see

through the shell" of both government and the corporation, so that personal

saving and corporate saving are close substitutes, as are personal consumption

and taxes. Hence, as Denison had noted earlier, total gross private saving

(the sum of personal saving plus corporate saving plus capital consumption)

not only is more stable than its individual components but also is apparently

unaffected by variations in the share of income absorbed by the government

sector. Moreover, David and Scadding concluded that the apparent invariance

of the gross private saving rate with respect to variations in the surplus or

deficit position of the government sector, also noted by Denison, implies a

close substitutability of private debt and public debt in private portfolios.

        This same concept of "seeing through the shell" represented by

government and corporations also constitutes one possible explanation for the

stability of the economy's total nonfinancial debt ratio. If the private

sector regards the debt of government as equivalent to its own debt, then its

net worth statement in the form (14) should instead be

            NW =   TA+FA_(I?+LG)                                         (14')

or, given (15), simply (12) again. Moreover, if households regard the debt

of corporations as equivalent to their own debt, then they will not

distinguish between direct and corporate liabilities within LiD. Under this

hypothesis, then, households would have viewed the decline of LG (here

including both federal and state-local obligations) from 72.7% of the gross

national product in 1953 to only 40.6% in 1978 as a decline in their own
                                    -26—



indebtedness, which they then slightly more than made up by increasing their

direct indebtedness (including obligations of unincorporated businesses) from

36.8% to 64.8% and by having corporations increase the indirect component of

L from 25.1% to 37.8%.

        The essential point in this perspective is the existence of a stable

ratio to income not just for some undefined "wealth" concept, as is usually

assumed, or even for the more precise concept of net worth, but, in addition,

for the total assets and total liabilities components of net worth separately.18

Following the "services flow" rationale noted above, the main idea here is

that assets and liabilities each separately yield streams of services

(presumably negative for the liabilities), and that individual maximizers will

seek a quantity of each that is proportional to income. Hence, given any

variation in the government share of the overall liabilities total, for what-

ever purposes indicated by public policy objectives, the private sector

consisting of households and the corporations that the households own will

simply adjust by issuing enough debt to offset the government's action. Yet

a further elaboration of the same basic idea that changes nothing fundamental

would be to view corporations as also responding to independent objectives or

influences (for example, tax laws), and households as then adjusting their

debt positions to offset the given actions of both the government and the

corporations. In either case, the nonfinancial economy will seek (and achieve)

a, stable ratio of its aggregate liabilities to income regardless of the

composition of that aggregate.

        The "ultrarationality" hypothesis is interesting for a number of

reasons. From a purely behavioral standpoint, for example, it carries strong

implications about individuals' perceptions and about the motivating forces

underlying   familiar aspects of portfolio behavior. Moreover, as David and
                                   —27—



Scadding pointed out, it also implies that "ex ante crowding out" renders

fiscal policy impotent in both the short and long run.

        A Capital Leveraging Hypothesis. In addition to the extreme view

that it embodies of individuals' ability to "see through the shell" of both

government and corporations, the ultrarationality hypothesis described above

rests importantly on two strong assumptions. First, it relies on the

presumption of a general absence of effective credit market constraints.

People are implicitly assumed not only to want to substitute their own (and

their corporations') indebtedness for government debt but also to be able to

do so. Second, it assumes not only that people want to hold their net worth,

total assets and total liabilities stable in relation to income but also,

because financial liabilities owed equal financial assets held, that they

hold their tangible assets and financial assets separately in stable

respective relations to income.

        An alternative route to explaining the observed stability of the U.S.

economy's nonfinancial debt ratio is to abandon these two assumptions, as

well as that of "seeing through the shell," and instead to assume, first,

that the private sector does face credit market constraints and, second, that

it does not necessarily hold its asset ratio stable. If the private sector does

not view government debt as equivalent to its own, then it is clear from (13)

that, if LG declines (as has happened in the United States during the 1953—78

sample period examined in Section I), either NW must also decline or TA must

rise, or both. If the more standard assumption of a stable ratio of net

worth to income is approximately correct, then under this alternative view

the counterpart to the relative decline in government liabilities documented

in Table 1 and Figure 1 would have been a relative rise in the private sector's

holdings of tangible assets — presumably including not only corporate assets
                                   —28—



in the form of productive plant and equipment but also private holdings of

residential real estate and consumer durables. Moreover, it is clear from

 (14) that, if TA rises while NW remains unchanged, then either FA must decline

or L must also rise.

        The potential importance of credit market constraints under this view

is most readily apparent in the household sector's debt arrangements. In

fact, borrowing against tangible assets in the form of home mortgage and

consumer installment credit has constituted the overwhelming majority of the

household sector's credit market indebtedness at least since World War II

(89% as of yearend 1978). Similarly, the borrowing of many corporations

consists primarily of explicitly secured long-term market debt, in the form

of mortgages or "first mortgage" bonds, and implicitly secured short—term

bank debt matched by inventory holdings.

        Under the "capital leveraging" hypothesis to explain the stability of

the total nonfinancial debt ratio, credit market constraints effectively

prohibit the private sector from freely substituting its own liabilities in

place of the government's declining liabilities. Instead, the private sector

can increase its own liabilities only to the extent that it is also accumu-

lating more tangible assets with which to back them. The stability of the

U.S. nonfinancial debt ratio therefore reflects in the first instance an

increase in tangible assets in approximately the proportion necessary to hold

net worth fixed in relation to income as ownership of government liabilities

declines relative to income. By shifting outward the effective credit market

constraints, this relative increase in tangible assets then facilitates the

increase in private financial liabilities. From (14) once again, if private

liabilities increase fully in step with tangible asset holdings, then not

only net worth but also private financial asset holdings will remain stable
                                       —29—




in   relation to income.

          This capital leveraging hypothesis also bears a number of interesting

implications that extend beyond questions of portfolio behavior and the

importance of borrowing constraints per se. Like the tiultrarationalityll

hypothesis, for example, it implies that the government deficit is a major

determinant of the economy's physical investment. Unlike that hypothesis,

however, it does not require that consumption move to offset tax payments.

Hence fiscal policy can affect not just the composition of income but also

its total.

          An Asset Demand Hypothesis. Finally, a third approach to explaining

the debt stability phenomenon combines some elements of both of the two

hypotheses developed above.

          According to the ultrarationality hypothesis, the private sector not

only acts so as to maintain a stable ratio of net worth to income but also

maintains separately stable ratios for both total assets and total liabilities.

A variant of that hypothesis would be to assume in addition the existence of

behavior enforcing stable ratios to income not just for total assets but, in

addition, for the specific components of that asset total —      tangible   and

financial. In other words, the streams of services yielded by tangible and

financial assets are sufficiently weak substitutes that individual maximizers

exhibit   stable demands for each separately in proportion to income. If
people   seek   to maintain a stable relationship between financial asset holdings

and income, then the market-clearing constraint (15) immediately indicates

that any relative decline in the given supply of the government's liabilities

will be matched by an increase in the demand for private liabilities. If

this demand is insensitive to such factors as yield (which is what a stable

ratio implies in this context), then a yield-sensitive supply of private
                                      —30—



 liabilities will adjust so as to clear the market for financial claims at a

quantity that represents a stable ratio to income for total financial assets

held, and a ratio for private liabilities owed that rises so as to offset the

decline in government liabilities.

        An alternative route to the same result is to combine with the capital

leveraging hypothesis the assumption of a stable demand for financial assets.

As the discussion above has already noted, it is clear from (14) that, if NW

is stable and TA rising (to offset the decline in LG), then either FA must

decline or    must rise (or both). If, in addition, the demand for financial

assets bears a stable relation to income, then necessarily private liabilities

will rise.

        In either case —   that   is, under ultrarationality with a stable ratio

of tangible assets to income, or under capital leveraging with a rising

tangible asset ratio —   the   distinguishing characteristic of the "asset demand"

hypothesis is the assumption of a stable, interest insensitive demand for

financial assets in relation to income. The supply of private liabilities

then adjusts, either just to clear the financial claims market or, alterna-

tively, to facilitate the holding of more tangible assets while holding no

less financial assets. Either way, a decline in government liabilities leads

to a rise in private liabilities.

 III. Some Evidence from Household and Corporate Sector Balance Sheets


        The U.S. Aggregate Net Balance Sheet. As of yearend 1978 the consol-

 idated balance sheet of the private domestic U.S. economy showed a combined

net worth of $7.3 trillion, consisting of $5.1 trillion of reproducible

tangible assets (valued at reproduction cost),19 $1.5 trillion of land (at

market value), $535 billion of net claims against the federal government

 (excluding Social Security claims), $100 billion of net claims against state

and local governments, and $106 billion of SDRs, gold (valued at the official

price) and net claims against foreigners. The largest two holders of these

assets were households ($3.8 trillion, net of pension reserves and equity

claims on corporations and unincorporated businesses) and nonfinancial non—

farm corporations ($1.6 trillion).20

        In order to avoid missing phenomena that may be lost in aggregation,

in examining the data to look for patterns that may shed light one way or the

other on the hypotheses outlined in Section II it is useful to focus at first

on the holdings of specific sectors rather than on fully consolidated totals.

Since households and nonfInancial corporations not only hold the great

majority of the economy's net worth but also account for most of the non—

federal liabilities shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, the object of this section

is to seek some perspective on the alternative hypotheses suggested in Section

II by examining movements in the balance sheets of these two sectors during

the post World War II period.

       Households. Figure 3 plots the four chief components of the household

sector's balance sheet (with equity claims and pension reserves not netted

out) grouped as in (14), measured again as ratios of yearend stocks to

seasonally adjusted fourth—quarter gross national product. On balance the

 net worth ratio — assumed to be steady in all three of the hypotheses

 advanced in Section II —   exhibited    substantial variation but little overall

 trend through the early 1970s, first rising in the 1950s and then declining

 in the 1960s. The continuation of the decline into the 1970s, however, has

 resulted in a slight downward trend for the postwar period as a whole.

 Within the net worth total, tangible asset holdings have risen irregularly

 throughout this period, while the much larger financial asset holdings

 (dominated by equity claims) have shown the rising and then falling pattern

also exhibited by net worth. As is already familiar from Table 1 and Figure 1,

households' liabilities have risen throughout, although the pace of the

increase was significantly slower during 1964—75 than either before or since.21

        Although the large variation in the value of households' financial

asset holdings due to equity price movements makes it difficult to generalize

from these data, it does not appear that households have held their balance

sheet proportions fixed — as the asset demand hypothesis put forth in Section

II would imply    over this period. This variation is even more apparent in

Figure 4, which shows the almost continuously rising ratio of households'

total assets (tangible plus financial) to their net worth. Moreover, Figure

5 shows that the ratio of households' liabilities to their tangible assets —

which the capital leveraging hypothesis put forth in Section II suggests

should be stable — also rose steadily until the early 1960s, although on

balance it has displayed little trend movement subsequently. Finally,

Figure 6 plots net worth and financial asset ratios for the household sector

that are analogous to those in Figure 3 but with equity claims and pension

reserves subtracted out. Here it is clear that, apart from changes in equity

holdings and pension reserves, the 1965—78 decline in financial asset holdings

relative to gross national product has been insufficient to offset the 1953—64

rise. Hence on this netted basis households have actually been increasing

their financial asset holdings just as they have been increasing their

tangible asset holdings, so that the ratio of their net worth to gross

national product has on balance shown a very slight increase over the entire

1953-78 period    in contrast to the decline shown in Figure 3.

        Simple inspection of these data for households alone yields conclusions

that are, on the whole, unsympathetic to all three hypotheses suggested in

Section II. Household net worth, including equity claims valued at market,

has not been steady but has declined in relation to income; netting out

claims against the government, as under the ultrarationality hypothesis,

would only make it show an even greater decline. Similarly, although house-

hold net worth with equity claims subtracted out has shown a very slight

upward trend, netting out claims against the government would still change

that to a pronounced downward trend. In addition, households have not

increased their outstanding indebtedness only in pace with their tangible

asset holdings, as would be the case under the capital leveraging hypothesis.

Instead, households have steadily borrowed more against these assets, thereby

substantially increasing their overall leverage. Finally, the ratio of

financial assets to income has not remained fixed either, as would be the

case under the asset demand hypothesis.

        Nevertheless, a more careful examination of these data using vector

autoregression methods does suggest a response of households' liability

behavior to government borrowing, as is consistent with all three hypotheses

from Section II, as well as at least some response of households' tangible

asset holdings as would be implied by the capital leveraging hypothesis.

liabilities, household tangible assets (TAH) and household liabil3.ties (L'),

estimated using annual data and solved analogously to (10) and (11) for the

vector [ln(LG/Y), ln(TA'/Y)t, ln(LH/Y)t]1, and orthogonalized to extract

the independent innovation in LG/Y. Beginning in the second year, the house-

hold tangible assets ratio declines sharply in response to an innovation in

the government debt ratio. In addition, after a somewhat puzzling delay of

four years, the household debt ratio declines as well. While the tangible

assets ratio eventually returns to (actually above, though not significantly

so) its original value, as is consistent with proportional demands for the

stream of housing and other durable goods services in relation to income,

the debt ratio remains depressed through the tenth year. Although the

specific magnitudes and time patterns of these responses clearly require

further explanation, and further investigation using the underlying variables

rather than just ratios is necessary to distinguish portfolio responses from

income responses, these results do suggest at least some role for households'

behavior in accounting for the observed stability of the U.S. aggregate non-

financial debt ratio in ways consistent with the ideas advanced in Section II.

        Nonfinancial Corporations. Figure 7 plots ratios for the same four

components shown in Figure 3, from the aggregate balance sheet of nonfarrn

nonfinancial business corporations. These data appear, if anything, even

more puzzling from the perspective of the hypotheses advanced in Section II.

The ratio of corporate net worth to income has moved more in step with than

against the household net worth ratio, so that there has been no observable

tendency for variations of the two to offset one another as the ultraration—

ality hypothesis might suggest. Corporate tangible asset holdings relative

to gross national product have shown an upward trend overall, as would be

the case under the capital leveraging hypothesis, but with a steep decline

in the late 1950s and early 1960s.22 Corporate financial asset holdings

relative to gross national product rose irregularly through 1973 and have

subsequently declined, rather than remaining steady as the asset demand

hypothesis would require. Finally, corporate liabilities have followed much

the same pattern as corporate financial assets, although with more amplitude

and somewhat more smoothness.23 As Figures 8 and 9 show, corporations have,

like households, increased their overall leverage either by borrowing more

against their physical assets or by borrowing against their holdings of

financial as well as physical assets.

        Once again, however, closer inspection of these data using vector

autoregression methods suggests conclusions more sympathetic to the hypotheses

in Section II, and in particular to the capital leveraging hypothesis. Table

10 presents simulation results analogous to those in Table 9, for a three—

variable vector autoregression system including the ratios to gross national

product of federal government liabilities, corporate tangible assets (TAC)

and corporate liabilities (LC), estimated using annual data and solved

analogously to (10) and (11) for the vector [1n(LG/Y), 1n(TA1/Y), ln(LC/Y)jI,

and orthogonalized to extract the independent innovation in LG/Y. Here the

innovation in the government debt ratio immediately results in a large decline

in the corporate tangible assets ratio as well as the corporate debt ratio.

The effect of the original innovation on all three variables in the system

essentially disappears by the fourth year. Even more so than the results for

the household sector shown in Table 9, these response patterns appear approx-

imately consistent with what the hypotheses of Section II — and especially

the capital leveraging hypothesis — would lead one to expect.

IV. Concluding Comments

          The analysis in this paper suggests several conclusions.

          First, results based on a variety of methodological approaches —

ranging   from simple inspection of ratios, to nominal income regressions, to

bivariate and more complex vector autoregression systems — consistently

indicate that the aggregate debt of all nonfinancial borrowers in the United

States bears as close a relationship to U.S. nonfinancial economic activity

as do the more familiar asset aggregates like the money stock (however

measured) or the monetary base. In contrast to the asset aggregates, however,

which exhibit little overall difference among themselves in this context,

total nonfinancial indebtedness appears to be unique among liability aggregates

in the stability of this relationship. Moreover, the data show evidence of

a negative covariance between the public and private components of total

nonfinancial indebtedness, thereby further substantiating the case for

stability in the aggregate.

          Second, three hypotheses (that is, at least three) provide internally

consistent potential explanations for this phenomenon an "ultrarationality"

hypothesis which emphasizes acute perceptions and offsetting actions on the

part of the private sector, a "capital leveraging" hypothesis which emphasizes

credit market constraints, and an "asset demand" hypothesis which emphasizes

market clearing and the private sector's role as a net lender.

          Third, initial efforts to match these three hypotheses against the

data for the household and corporate business sectors yield mixed results.

Simple inspection of the data leads to impressions largely inconsistent with

any of the three, but the results of vector autoregression experiments are

more supportive, especially of the "capital leveraging" hypothesis.
                                  —37—



        It is important to re—emphasize, however, that — as was noted at

the outset — these simple experiments stop well short of rigorously

formulating and testing any of the three hypotheses at hand. One immediate

reason for caution, of course, is merely the usual important distinction

between descriptive statistics and test statistics, but other problems are

present too. Although the basic phenomenon documented in the first part of

this paper concerns the joint behavior of all nonfinancial borrowers in the

economy, the "tests" assembled in the latter part focus separately on

household and corporate behavior patterns. The relevant concept of non-

financial economic activity for this purpose is problematical as well.

Nominal gross national product is not necessarily the best measure even for

aggregate-level investigations, despite its conventional acceptance in

analogous contexts, and it is even more questionable for issues focused

specifically on household or corporate sector activity. Allowing in some

way a role for equity claims, along with the debt claims, would broaden but

no doubt also further complicate the analysis.

        Nevertheless, even on the basis of the results reported in this

paper, the case for some redirection of "monetary" economics research toward

the nonbank public's liabilities as well as its assets appears warranted.

          The othogonalization procedure outlined in (3)—(6) in Section I

 constructs the independent innovation         as that part of the underlying vector

 autoregression disturbance         which excludes all contemporaneous covariation

between       and j2, and constructs the analogous independent innovation €2

as that part of p2 which excludes any contemporaneous covariation between

   and        This concept of what constitutes an "independent innovation" is

equivalent to ranking the variable in question last in a chain of causal

ordering. By contrast, the terminology employed by Sims [15] defines an

independent innovation €.     in   such a system to include all contemporaneous

covariation among the underlying p. and any p., j         i; this concept is

equivalent to ranking the i-th variable first. Presumably some but not all

of the variation common to all variables actually is specific to the one in

question, so that the "truth" lies somewhere between these two extremes.

          Tests indicate that the choice of ordering for purposes of the

orthogonalization —    that   is, the choice of whether to include or exclude

contemporaneous covariation with other variables         makes no substantive

difference in the simulation results shown in Tables 3 and 6-10 above. For

each of the ten bivariate systems examined in Table 6, for example, Table A—i

shows the respective variances, covariance and correlation of the underlying

   and ji   disturbances,   and Table A—2 shows simulation results analogous to

those in Table 6 except that here the system is orthogonalized so that the

innovation labeled "independent" includes all of the contemporaneous
                                                                               ' P2)
covariation. Although some of the correlations shown in Table A—i are hardly

small, the simulation results in Table A—2 are essentially unchanged from those

in Table 6.

*   This paper is a part of the National Bureau of Economic Research project
    on "The Changing Roles of Debt and Equity in Financing U.S. Capital Forma—
    tion", sponsored by the lunerican Council of Life Insurance. I am grateful
    to Angelo Melino and Chris Piros for research assistance; to them as well
    as Richard Davis, James Duesenberry, Michael Hamburger, John Scadding,
    Christopher Sims and Stephen Taylor for helpful discussions; and to the
    National Bureau and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for research support.


1. Among models familiar in the current literature, that of Brunner and
    Meltzer [1] — in which money and credit are both determined as the
    product of their respective endogenous "multipliers" and the exogenous
    monetary base    probably comes closest to representing this view. Even
    so, Brunner and Meltzer have stopped well short of denying any signifi-
    cance to the money and credit totals thus determined.

2. In part because of the capital export controls that were in force during
    1964—74, foreign obligors accounted for only a small fraction of
    borrowing in the U.S. markets throughout this period.

3. See Friedman [8] for a discussion of the postwar versus prewar periods.
    Figure 2 below is from [8].

4. The debt ratio peak during 1918-78 occurred in 1933, the trough year
    of the depression. In addition, much of the household and business debt
    nominally outstanding during the depression was of questionable value.

5. The difference between the two is small, consistingforthemost part of

     and mortgage pools. Most liabilities of financial intermediaries (for
     example, deposits and life insurance and pension reserves) are not
     classified as credit market liabilities in the Federal Reserve's flow—
     of—funds accounts.

6. Because these four series are measured weekly or monthly, rather than at
    the end of each quarter, it is necessary to determine how to construct
    the ratios. The quarterly data use quarterly averages in the numerator.
     The annual data use December averages in the numerator because this
     method made the respective coefficients of variation smaller in every
     case except the detrended M2 ratio; in that one case the value computed
     using the quarterly average in the numerator is .027.

7. See Sims [15] for a discussion of the methodology and rationale underlying
    the vector autoregression approach.

8. The effect of the shortened sample period for M3 is immediately apparent
    from the contrast between the small standard error and the large (but
     not all thatlarge) R2.
 9. For leading examples of this evidence, see De Rosa and Stern [3],
     Diggins [5], Feige and McGee [6], and Lombra and Moran [11].

10. Lindsey [10] has argued along these lines for the case of bank credit.


11. See,for example, Colcifeld and Blinder [9], Sargent [14], and Modigliafli
     and Ando [13].


12. The use of levels of logarithms in (8) instead of differences of
     logarithms as in (7) has essentially no effect as long as the lag
     lengths of the Bjj are sufficient to provide roots near the unit circle.
     (If no roots near the unit circle are needed, then the differencing in
     (7) is incorrect in the first place.)


13. See, for example, Tobin and Buiter [16].


14. See, for example, Modigliani [12].

15. Some analyses distinguish between outside money and government debt, so
     that (15) need not hold if the outside money is excluded from LG. The
     data for LG used in this paper exclude currency but include the Federal
     Reserve System's holdings of other government debt, so that only the
     difference between the two would be at issue here. As of yearend 1978
     currency outside banks was $99.1 billion and member banks' reserves
     were $46.7 billion, against $118.6 billion of Federal Reserve holdings
     of U.S. Government securities.

16. Just as (14) ignores the government's holdings of financial assets, (16)
     ignores the equity (capital) position of intermediaries.

17. See Friedman [7] for an analysis distinguishing intermediate target
     variables and information variables.

18. Alternatively, one could express the same concept as a stable ratio of
     net worth to income plus a stable leverage ratio — defined, for
     example, as the ratio of total assets to net worth.

19. The composition of the tangible assets included $1.9 trillion of
     residential structures, $1.8 trillion of nonresidential plant and
     equipment, $793 billion of business inventories, and $574 billion of
     consumer durables.

20. The other holdings by sector were $805 billion for unincorporated non—
     farm businesses, $629 billion for farms, and $490 billion for private
     financial institutions (net of corporate equity claims, but including
     pension reserves credited to households). These figures, as well as
     the sector detail used throughout this section, are from unpublished
     Federal Reserve Board data.
21. In contrast to the data in Table 1 and Figure 1, which include only
     credit market liabilities, the data shown here include all liabilities.
     Most household liabilities are in fact credit market liabilities; the
     difference, consisting of security credit, trade credit, and deferred
     or unpaid life insurance premiums, was less than 4% of total liabilities
     as of yearend 1978.


22. It would be useful in future research to divide the sharp post-1972
     rise into quantity versus relative price components.

23. The liabilities data in Figure 7 also differ from those in Figure 1 and
     Table 1 by including all liabilities.  (See again footnote 21.) Of the
     $l.179 trillion of nonfarm nonfinancial corporations' liabilities
     outstanding as of yearend 1978, only $835 billion (just over 70%) were
     credit market liabilities; the remainder included $282 billion of trade
     debt, $22 billion of unpaid profit taxes, and $39 billion of other
     miscellaneous liabilities.
