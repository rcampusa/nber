                                            ABSTRACT

We implemented five strategies gleaned from practices in achievement-increasing charter schools
– increased instructional time, a more rigorous approach to building human capital of teachers and
administrators, high-dosage tutoring, frequent use of data to inform instruction, and a culture of high
expectations – in twenty of the lowest performing schools in Houston, Texas. We show that the average
impact of these changes on student achievement is 0.206 standard deviations in math and 0.043 standard
deviations in reading, per year, which is comparable to reported impacts of attending high-performing
charter schools. This suggests that the best practices of charter schools may be general lessons about
the education production function.

         Data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) – a set of assessments
administered every two years to a nationally representative group of fourth, eighth, and twelfth
graders – reveal that 33 percent of eighth graders are proficient in reading and 34 percent are
proficient in math. Data for fourth and twelfth graders are similar. In 2010, roughly one in five high
school graduates did not score high enough on the United States Army’s Armed Services Vocational
Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) to meet the minimum standard necessary to enlist in the Army (Theokas
2010). According to a Center for Education Policy report, 48 percent of American schools did not
meet the standards set out by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Five percent of all public
elementary and secondary schools have been characterized as “chronically low performing.”1
         There has been no paucity of effort aimed at increasing achievement and closing racial
achievement gaps in the past few decades: lowering class size, increasing spending, and providing
incentives for teachers are only a few of the dozens of ambitious policy prescriptions in education
reform.2 Despite these reforms to increase student achievement, measures of academic success have
been largely constant over the past 30 years (Fryer 2011a). Moreover, school districts have taken a
variety of targeted approaches to cope with “chronically low performing” schools. Between 2001
and 2006, Chicago closed 44 schools and reassigned students to other schools. In New York City,
the city closed 91 public schools between 2002 and 2010 – converting most of them to charter
schools. In November 2005, 102 of the lowest performing public schools in New Orleans were
turned over to the Recovery School District (RSD), which is operated at the state level; some of
these schools are currently run directly by the RSD while others are run by charter school operators.
Tennessee created the Tennessee Achievement School District, which takes control of the lowest-
performing schools across the state from the home districts and centralizes the governance for these
schools under this school turn-around entity. The data on the impact of school closings on student
achievement is, at best, mixed and there is no credible evidence on the impact of the initiatives in
New Orleans or Tennessee (De La Torre and Gwynne 2009, Engberg et al. 2012). This lack of
progress has caused some to argue that schools alone cannot increase achievement among the poor
(Coleman 1966, Ravitch 2010).



1 A school is designated “chronically low performing” if it fails to make “adequate yearly progress” for three consecutive
years. High schools can also be deemed chronically low performing if their graduation rate is lower than 60 percent for
three consecutive years.
2 There have been many other attempts to close the achievement gap, none of which significantly or systematically

reduce racial disparities in educational achievement (see Fryer 2011a, Jacob and Ludwig 2008).


                                                            1
        Yet, due to new evidence on the efficacy of certain charter schools which demonstrates that
some combination of school inputs can significantly increase achievement among poor black and
Hispanic students, there may be room for optimism. Using data from the Promise Academy in the
Harlem Children’s Zone – a 97-block area in central Harlem that provides myriad social programs
along with achievement-driven charter schools – Dobbie and Fryer (2011) show that middle school
students gain 0.229 standard deviations (hereafter σ) in math per year and 0.047σ in reading on state
standardized tests. Thus, after four years, students in these schools have erased the achievement gap
in math (relative to the average white student in NYC) and halved it in reading. Perhaps more
important, Dobbie and Fryer (2013b) demonstrate that students in the same sample are significantly
more likely to attend college, less likely to become pregnant (girls) and less likely to be incarcerated
(boys). Dobbie and Fryer (2011, 2013b) provide evidence that it is the school policies – not social
programs – that are responsible for the achievement gains, though one cannot rule out important
interactions between the two. Consistent with these findings, others have shown similar results with
larger and more diverse samples of charter schools that are not coupled with community programs
(Abdulkadiroglu et al. 2011, Angrist et al. 2010, Angrist et al. 2013).
        A strategy to increase achievement and combat the racial achievement gap, yet to be tested,
is to infuse the best practices exemplified in the most successful charter schools into traditional
public schools with their standard hierarchies and bureaucracy, local politics, school boards, and
collective bargaining agreements. Theoretically, introducing best practices typified by successful
charter schools into traditional public schools could have one of three effects. If the policies most
correlated with charter school effectiveness are general lessons about the education production
function, then exporting these best practices may yield significant increases in student achievement.
If, however, a large part of the success of the achievement-increasing charter schools can be
attributed to selective attrition of unmotivated students out of these schools, the tendency of highly
involved parents to enroll their children in charter school lotteries, or school policies that cannot be
easily replicated in a traditional public school, then an attempt to create public schools in this image
is likely futile. Third, some argue that major reform efforts are often more disruptive than helpful,
can lower teacher morale, or might be viewed by students as punishment for past performance, any
of which may have a negative impact on student achievement (Campbell, Harvey, and Hill 2000).
Which one of the above effects will dominate is unknown. The estimates in this paper may combine
elements from these and other channels.



                                                    2
         Starting in the 2010-2011 school year, we3 implemented five best practices of charter schools
described in Dobbie and Fryer (2013a) – increased time, better human capital, more student-level
differentiation, frequent use of data to alter the scope and sequence of classroom instruction, and a
culture of high expectations – in twenty of the lowest performing schools (containing more than
12,000 students) in Houston, Texas.4 To increase time on task, the school day was lengthened one
hour and the school year was lengthened ten days in the nine secondary schools. This was 21
percent more time in school than students in these schools obtained in the year pre-treatment and
roughly the same as achievement-increasing charter schools in New York City.5 In addition, students
were strongly encouraged and even incentivized to attend classes on Saturday. In the eleven
elementary schools, the length of the day and the year were not changed, but non-instructional
activities (e.g. twenty minute bathroom breaks) were reduced.
         In an effort to improve the human capital, nineteen out of twenty principals were removed
and 46 percent of teachers left or were removed before the experiment began. To enhance student-
level differentiation, all fourth, sixth and ninth graders were supplied with a math tutor and extra
reading or math instruction was provided to students in other grades who had previously performed
below grade level. The tutoring model was adapted from the MATCH school in Boston – a charter
school that largely adheres to the methods described in Dobbie and Fryer (2013a). In order to help
teachers use interim data on student performance to guide and inform instructional practice, we
required schools to administer interim assessments every three to four weeks and provided schools
with three cumulative benchmarks assessments, as well as assistance in analyzing and presenting
student performance data on these assessments. Finally, to instill a culture of high expectations and
college access, we started by setting clear expectations for school leadership. Schools were provided
with a rubric for the school and classroom environment and were expected to implement school-
parent-student contracts. Specific student performance goals were set for each school and the
principal was held accountable and provided with financial incentives based on these goals.
         Such invasive changes were possible, in part, because eleven of the twenty schools (nine
secondary and two elementary) were either “chronically low performing” or on the verge of being


3 Throughout the text, I depart from custom by using the terms “we,” “our,” and so on. Although this is a sole-authored
work, it took a large team of people to implement the experiments. Using “I” seems disingenuous.
4 These five practices were also implemented in Denver, Colorado starting in the 2011-2012 school year. The Denver

intervention is discussed in Section V.
5 Using the data set constructed by Dobbie and Fryer (2013a), we label a charter school “achievement-increasing” if its

treatment effect on combined math and reading achievement is above the median in the sample, according to their non-
experimental estimates.

                                                          3
labeled as such and taken over by the state of Texas. Thus, despite our best efforts, random
assignment was not a feasible option for these schools. To round out our sample of twenty schools
and provide a way to choose between alternative non-experimental specifications, we randomly
selected (via matched pairs) nine additional elementary schools from eighteen low – but not
chronically low – performing schools.
         In the sample of eighteen elementary schools in which treatment and control were chosen by
random assignment, providing estimates of the impact of injecting charter school best practices in
traditional public schools is straightforward. In the remaining set of schools, we use four separate
statistical approaches to adjust for pre-intervention differences between treatment and comparison
school attendees. Treatment is defined as being zoned to attend a treatment school for entering grade
levels (e.g. 6th and 9th) or having attended a treatment school in the pre-treatment year for returning
grade levels. “Comparison school” attendees are all other students in Houston.
         We begin by using district administrative data on student characteristics, most importantly
previous year achievement, to fit least squares models. This approach may not account for important
student level unobservables, potential mean reversion, or measurement error in previous year test
score, so we also estimate a difference-in-differences specification that can partially account for
these concerns.
         Houston has a widely used open enrollment policy that allows students to attend any public
school they want, subject to capacity constraints, which introduces the potential for selection into
(or out of) treatment. Following Cullen et al. (2005), our final two empirical models instrument for a
student’s attendance in a treatment school with an indicator for whether or not they are zoned to
attend a treatment school for entry grades or attended a treatment school in the previous year for
non-entry grades using a lagged dependent variable and difference-in-differences specification.6
         All statistical approaches lead to the same basic conclusions. Injecting best practices from
charter schools into low performing traditional public schools can significantly increase student
achievement. Students in treatment elementary schools gain around 0.27σ in math per year, relative
to comparison samples. Taken at face value, this is enough to eliminate the racial achievement gap in
math in Houston elementary schools in less than three years. Students in treatment secondary
schools gain 0.148σ per year in math, decreasing the gap by one-half over the length of the



6 An earlier version of this paper – Fryer (2011c) – also calculated nearest-neighbor matching estimates, which yielded
similar results.

demonstration project. The impacts on reading for both elementary and secondary schools are small
and statistically zero.
        In the grade/subject areas in which we implemented all five policies described in Dobbie
and Fryer (2013a) – fourth, sixth, and ninth grade math – the increase in student achievement is
substantially larger. Relative to students who attended comparison schools, fourth graders in
treatment schools scored 0.360σ (0.126) higher in math, per year. Similarly, sixth and ninth grade
math scores increased 0.438σ (0.069), per year, relative to students in comparison schools.
        Interestingly, both the increase in math and the muted effect for reading are consistent with
the results of achievement-increasing charter schools. Again, taking the combined treatment effects
at face value, treatment schools in Houston would rank fifth out of forty in math and twentieth out
of forty in reading among NYC charter schools in the sample analyzed in Dobbie and Fryer (2013a).
        We conclude our main statistical analysis by estimating heterogeneous treatment effects on
test scores across a variety of pre-determined subsamples, and investigating the impact of treatment
on student attendance. Surprisingly, the treatment was most effective in high school and elementary
school, and only marginally significant in middle schools. Most other subsamples of the data yield
consistent impacts, though there is evidence that Hispanic students gain significantly more than
black students and students with economic disadvantage gain more than students who are not
economically disadvantaged. In secondary schools, the impact of treatment on black students is
0.088σ (0.040) and 0.175σ (0.037) for Hispanic students – the p-value on the difference is 0.031. In
elementary schools, economically disadvantaged students benefit significantly more than non-
economically disadvantaged students.
        Treatment effects on attendance in elementary school were small and statistically
insignificant, potentially due to the high baseline attendance rate (97 percent). The impact of the
treatment on attendance in the secondary schools was approximately three-fourths of a percentage
point, per year, and statistically significant.
        The above results are robust across identification strategies, model specification,
construction of comparison schools, alternative student assessments, sample attrition, and sample
re-weighting to account for potential negative selection into treatment. Moreover, an almost
identical (non-random assignment) demonstration project in Denver, Colorado, and data from the
Academy of Urban School Leadership (AUSL) – which uses four out of the five best practices
described above as a core strategy to turn around chronically low performing schools in Chicago –



                                                  5
yield similar results. Taken together, these data suggest that the best practices in charter schools may
be general lessons about the educational production function.

Houston Independent School District and schools in our sample, as well as details of the program
and implementation. Section II describes our data and research design. Section III presents

I. Background and Program Details


A. Houston Independent School District
       Houston Independent School District (HISD) is the seventh largest school district in the
nation with 203,354 students and 276 schools. Eighty-eight percent of HISD students are black or
Hispanic. Roughly 80 percent of all students are eligible for free or reduced price lunch and roughly
30 percent of students have limited English proficiency.
       Like the vast majority of school districts, Houston is governed by a school board that has
the authority to set a district-wide budget and monitor the district’s finances; adopt a personnel
policy for the district (including decisions relating to the termination of employment); enter into
contracts for the district; and establish district-wide policies and annual goals to accomplish the
district’s long-range educational plan, among many other powers and responsibilities. The Board of
Education is comprised of nine trustees elected from separate districts who serve staggered four-
year terms.


B. Experimental Sample
       In Winter 2011, we ranked all elementary schools in Houston based on their combined
reading and math state test scores in grades three through five and Stanford 10 scores in
Kindergarten through second grade. The two lowest performing elementary schools – Frost
Elementary and Kelso Elementary – were deemed “unacceptable” by the state of Texas. The

                                                   6
Houston school district insisted that these schools be treated. We then took the next eighteen
schools (from the bottom) and used a matched-pair randomization procedure similar to those
recommended by Imai et al. (2009) and Greevy et al. (2004) to partition schools into treatment and
control.7
         First, we ordered the full set of eighteen schools by the sum of their mean reading and math
test scores in the previous year. Then we designated every two schools from this ordered list as a
“matched pair” and randomly drew one member of the matched pair into the treatment group and
one into the control group. In the summer of 2011, one of the treatment schools was closed because
of low enrollment. We replaced it with its matched-pair.
         Thus, our final experimental sample consists of eight schools who received treatment (2,596
students) and eight who received control (2,410 students). In our non-experimental specifications,
we also include the two elementary schools that were “academically unacceptable” and the matched-
pair for the school that was closed prior to treatment.


C. Non-Experimental Sample
         In 2010, four Houston high schools (Sharpstown, Lee, Kashmere, and Jones) labeled
“failing” under Texas Accountability Ratings were declared Texas Title I Priority Schools, the state-
specific categorization for its “chronically low-performing” schools, which meant that these schools
were eligible for federal School Improvement Grant (SIG) funding.8 In addition, four middle
schools were labeled “academically unacceptable” under the Texas Accountability Ratings in 2009,
with a fifth middle school added based on a rating of “academically unacceptable” in 2010.
Unacceptable schools were schools that had proficiency levels below 70 percent in reading/ELA, 70
percent in social studies, 70 percent in writing, 55 percent in mathematics, and 50 percent in science;
high schools that had less than a 75 percent completion rate; or middle schools that had a drop-out


7 There is an active debate on which randomization procedures have the best properties. Imbens (2011) summarizes a
series of claims made in the literature and shows that both stratified randomization and matched-pairs can increase
power in small samples. Simulation evidence presented in Bruhn and McKenzie (2009) supports these findings, though
for large samples there is little gain from different methods of randomization over a pure single draw. Imai et al. (2009)
derive properties of matched-pair cluster randomization estimators and demonstrate large efficiency gains relative to
pure simple cluster randomization.
8 These SIG funds could be awarded to any Title I school in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring that was

among the lowest five percent of Title I schools in the state or was a high school with a graduation rate below 60 percent
over several years; these are referred to as Tier I schools. Additionally, secondary schools could qualify for SIG funds if
they were eligible for but did not receive Title I, Part A funding and they met the criteria mentioned above for Tier I
schools or if they were in the state's bottom quintile of schools or had not made required Annual Yearly Progress for two
years; these are referred to as Tier II schools.

                                                            7
rate above two percent.9 Relative to average performance in HISD, students in these schools pre-
treatment scored 0.414σ lower in math, scored 0.413σ lower in reading, and were 22 percentage
points less likely to graduate.
         The difficulty with any non-experimental design is constructing valid comparison schools. In
the main analysis, we use the entire HISD sample as a comparison. To check the robustness of this
assumption, Table 7 investigates treatment effects using alternative sets of comparison schools: large
cities across the state of Texas, the Texas Education Agency’s set of comparison schools, schools
deemed academically “acceptable” or worse by the Texas state accountability system, and a
“matched” set of schools provided by HISD before the experiment began. All comparison samples
yield similar results.


D. Program Details
         Table 1 provides a bird’s eye view of the experiment. Appendix A, an implementation guide,
provides further details. Fusing the best practices described in Dobbie and Fryer (2013a) with the
political realities of Houston, its school board, and other local considerations, we developed the
following five-pronged intervention designed to inject best practices from charter schools into low
performing public schools.


                                          Tenet 1: Extended Learning Time
         In elementary schools, we extended the school year by roughly 35 days by “strongly
encouraging” students to attend Saturday classes tailored to each student’s needs. Moreover, within
the school day, we reduced the time spent on non-instructional activities (e.g. eliminating twenty
minute breaks between class periods). In secondary schools, the school year was extended ten days –
from 175 in the pre-treatment years to 185 for the treatment years. Similar to the elementary
schools, students in secondary schools were strongly encouraged to attend classes on Saturday. The
school day was extended by one hour each Monday through Thursday. In total, treatment students
were in school 1537.5 hours for the year compared to an average of 1272.3 hours in the previous
year – an increase of 21 percent. For comparison, the average charter school in NYC has 1402.2
hours in a school year and the average achievement-increasing charter school has 1546.0 hours

9Additionally, schools could obtain a rating of “academically acceptable” by meeting required improvement, even if they
did not reach the listed percentage cut-offs or by reaching the required cut-offs according to the Texas Projection
Measure (TPM). The TPM is based on estimates of how a student or group of students is likely to perform in the next
high-stakes assessment.

                                                           8
(Dobbie and Fryer 2013a). Importantly, because of data limitations, this does not include
instructional time on Saturday. The prevalence of Saturday school in comparison schools is
unknown. The per-pupil marginal cost of the extended day was approximately $550.


                                       Tenet 2: Human Capital
          Leadership Changes:
       Nineteen out of twenty principals were replaced in treatment schools; compared to
approximately one-third of those in control and comparison schools. To find principals for each
campus, applicants were initially screened based on their past record of achievement in former
positions. Those with a record of increasing student achievement were also given the STAR
Principal Selection Model™ from The Haberman Foundation to assess their values and beliefs in
regards to student achievement. Individuals who passed these initial two screens were interviewed by
the author and the Superintendent of schools to ensure the leaders possessed characteristics
consistent with leaders interviewed in achievement-increasing charter schools.


          Initial Staff Departure:
       Two pieces of data were used to make decisions on which elementary school staff would
remain in treatment schools: value-added data and classroom observations. Value-added data were
available for 137 teachers (roughly 33 percent of all teachers). The HISD employee charged with
managing the principals of treatment schools conducted classroom observations of all teachers in
the Winter and Spring of 2011. In total, 38 percent of teachers left or were removed from the eleven
elementary schools.
       We used a different approach to remove staff in secondary schools – due solely to the time
available for in-person observations. In 2010, we began with nine secondary schools in late Spring
and the experiment commenced in August – there were three and a half months of planning, but
only one month in which teachers were present in schools. It was not feasible to observe 562
teachers in their classrooms in twenty days. For the elementary schools, we began observing teachers
in their classrooms almost a year before the experiment started.
       Thus given the time constraints, in the nine treatment secondary schools, we collected four
pieces of data on each teacher. The data included principal evaluations of all teachers from the
previous principal of each campus (rating them from low performing to highly effective), an
interview to assess whether each teacher’s values and beliefs were consistent with those of teachers

                                                  9
in achievement-increasing charter schools, a peer-rating index, and value-added data, as measured by
SAS EVAAS®, wherever available.10 Value-added data are available for just over 50 percent of
middle school teachers in our sample. For high schools, value-added data are only available at the
grade-department level in core subjects.
         Appendix A provides details on how these data were aggregated to make decisions on who
would be offered the opportunity to remain in treatment schools. In total, 46 percent (or 453) of
teachers did not return to treatment schools.11 It is important to note: these teachers were not simply
reallocated to other district schools; HISD spent over $5 million buying out teacher contracts.12
Panel A of Figure 1 compares teacher departure rates in treatment and comparison schools.
         Between the 2005-2006 and 2008-2009 school years, teacher departure rates declined from
28 percent to 18 percent in secondary treatment schools and 22 percent to 12 percent in secondary
comparison schools. In the summer preceding the treatment year (2010-2011), teacher departure
rates increased slightly at comparison secondary schools to 17 percent, while 52 percent of teachers
in treatment secondary schools did not return. To get a sense of how large this is, consider that this
is more turnover than these same schools had experienced cumulatively in the preceding two years.
Elementary schools experienced a similar trend with declining departure rates until the summer
before the treatment year (2011-2012), when there was a very small increase in departure rates at
control schools and a much larger spike in treatment elementary schools.
         Panels B and C of Figure 1 show differences in value-added of teachers on student
achievement for those who remained at treatment elementary and secondary schools, respectively,
versus those who left for teachers with valid data. Two observations are worth noting. First, in all
cases, teachers who remained in treatment schools had higher average value-added than those who
left. However, aggregately, the teachers who remained still had negative average value-added across
all subject areas in elementary schools and two out of five subject areas in secondary schools. Thus,
the treatment effects described here are not likely due to reallocation of talented teachers. Taking the
increase in value-added from the initial staff turnover at face value and assigning all new teachers to
the mean, the expected increase in test scores is between 0.016σ and 0.025σ in math and 0.008σ and

10 Within the teacher interview, each teacher was asked to name other teachers within the school who they thought to be
necessary to a school turnaround effort. From this, we were able to construct an index of a teacher’s value as perceived
by her peers.
11 If one restricts attention to reading and math teachers, teacher departure rates are 60 percent
12 One might worry that these teachers simply transferred to comparison schools and that our results are therefore an

artifact of teacher sorting. Two facts argue against this hypothesis. First, only 1.2 percent of teachers in comparison
schools worked in treatment schools in the pre-treatment year. Second, our results are robust to alternative
constructions of comparison schools, including using the entire district or state.

0.012σ in reading in secondary schools. In elementary schools, the anticipated increase in student
achievement is between 0.043σ and 0.068σ in math and 0.038σ and .061σ in reading.


             Staff Evaluation, Development, and Feedback


A. Evaluation and Feedback
         One of the most important components of achievement-increasing charter schools is the
feedback given to teachers by supervisors on the quality of their instruction (Dobbie and Fryer
2013a). In a typical Houston school, teachers are observed in their classroom three times a year and
provided written feedback and face-to-face conferences. These observations are an important part
of their yearly evaluation, as part of the Appraisal and Development Cycle, which also includes
standards on teacher professionalism and multiple measures of student performance. In treatment
schools, teachers received approximately ten times more observations and feedback. This feedback
came in the form of follow-up emails, written notes, and informal meetings in addition to the formal
observations protocol required by the district.13




B. Training
         Each summer, principals coordinated to deliver training to all teachers around the
instructional strategies developed by Doug Lemov of Uncommon Schools, author of Teach Like a
Champion, and Dr. Robert Marzano, a highly regarded expert on curriculum and instruction.
Moreover, a series of sessions were held on Saturdays throughout the school year designed to
increase the rigor of classroom instruction and address specific topics such as classroom
management, lesson planning, differentiation, and student engagement.




                                          Tenet 3: High-Dosage Tutoring
         Many achievement-increasing charter schools provide their students with differentiation in a
variety of ways – some use technology, some reduce class size, while others provide for a structured

13Our approach to evaluation and feedback – modeled after achievement-increasing charter schools – is also similar to
the model used in Cincinnati Public Schools (Taylor and Tyler 2011). An important difference is that the Teacher
Evaluation System (TES) implemented in Cincinnati is designed to provide intense evaluation every five years. In our
demonstration project, intense evaluation is done yearly.

                                                         11
system of in-school tutorials. In an ideal world, we would have lengthened the school day by two
hours and used the additional time to provide tutoring in both math and reading for students in
every grade level. This is the model developed by Michael Goldstein at the MATCH school in
Boston.
         Due to budget constraints, we were only able to tutor in one grade and one subject per
school. We chose fourth, sixth and ninth grades given the research suggesting these are critical
growth years (Anderson 2011, Allensworth and Easton 2005, Kurdek and Rodgon 1975), and we
chose math over reading because of the availability of curriculum and knowledge maps that are more
easily communicated to first time tutors.14
          Fourth grade students identified as high-need received daily three-on-one tutoring in math
in all treatment elementary schools. Since the school day was not extended in elementary schools,
tutors had to be accommodated within the normal school day. Schools utilized a “pull-out” model in
which identified students were pulled from regular classroom math instruction to attend tutorials in
separate classrooms. Math blocks were extended for tutored grades so that tutoring did not entirely
supplant regular instruction. As a result, non-tutored students worked in smaller ratios with their
regular instructor. Some campuses additionally used tutors as “push-in” support during regular
classroom math instruction.
         For all sixth and ninth grade students, one class period was devoted to receiving two-on-one
tutoring in math. The total number of hours a student was tutored was approximately 189 hours for
ninth graders and 215 hours for sixth graders. All sixth and ninth grade students received a class
period of math tutoring every day, regardless of their previous math performance. The tutorials
were a part of the regular class schedule for students, and students attended these tutorials in
separate classrooms laid out intentionally to support the tutorial program.
         There were two important assumptions behind the tutoring model: first, we assumed that all
students in low performing schools could benefit from high-dosage tutoring, either to remediate
deficiencies in students’ math skills or to provide acceleration for students already performing at or
above grade level; second, including all students in a grade in the tutorial program was thought to
reduce potential negative stigma often attached to tutoring programs that are exclusively used for
remediation.

14Another motivation for this design is that the elementary schools that entered during the second year of
implementation (2011-2012) are not in the feeder patterns of the middle schools. Thus it was important to tutor
students in sixth and ninth grades – school entry grades – in order to ensure that entering students all eventually received
the same complete set of baseline skills and knowledge.

                                                            12
           In non-tutored secondary grades – seven, eight, ten, eleven, and twelve – students who
tested below grade level received a “double dose” of math or reading in the subject in which they
were the furthest behind. The curriculum for the extra math class was based on the Carnegie Math
program (2010-2011), I Can Learn (2011-2013 middle schools) and ALEKS (2011-2013 high
schools).15 Each software program is a full-curriculum, mastery-based platform that allows students
to work at an individualized pace and teachers to be facilitators of learning. Moreover, each program
assesses students frequently and provides reports to principals and teachers on a weekly basis.
           The curriculum for the extra reading class utilized the READ 180 program. The READ 180
model relies on a very specific classroom instructional model: twenty minutes of whole-group
instruction, an hour of small-group rotations among three stations (instructional software, small-
group instruction, and modeled/independent reading) for twenty minutes each, and ten minutes of
whole-group wrap-up. The program provides specific supports for special education students and
English Language Learners. The books used by students in the modeled/independent reading
station are leveled readers that allow students to read age-appropriate subject matter at their tested
lexile level. As with the math curricula, students are frequently assessed in order to adapt instruction
to fit individual needs.


                                           Tenet 4: Data-Driven Instruction
           Schools individually set their plans for the use of data to drive student achievement. Some
schools joined a consortium of local high schools and worked within that group to create,
administer, and analyze regular interim assessments that were aligned to the state standards. Other
schools used the interim assessments available through HISD for most grades and subjects that were
to be administered every three weeks.
           Additionally, the program team assisted the schools in administering three benchmark
assessments in December, February, and March. These benchmark assessments used released
questions and formats from previous state exams.                   The program team assisted schools with
collecting the data from these assessments and created reports for the schools designed to identify
the necessary interventions for students and student groups. Based on these assessment results,
teachers were responsible for meeting with students one-on-one to set individual performance goals
for the subsequent benchmark assessments and ultimately for the end-of-year state exam.

                                  Tenet 5: Culture of High Expectations
        Of the five policies and procedures changed in treatment schools, the tenet of high
expectations and an achievement-driven culture is the most difficult to quantify. Beyond hallways
festooned with college pennants and decked with the words “No Excuses,” “Whatever it takes,” and
“There are no short-cuts,” there are several indicators that suggest that a change in culture may have
taken place. First, all treatment schools had a clear set of goals and expectations set by the
Superintendent. All teachers in treatment schools were expected to adhere to a professional dress
code. Schools and parents signed “contracts” – similar to those employed by many charter schools
– indicating their mutual agreement to honor the policies and expectations of treatment schools in
order to ensure that students succeed. As in high-performing charters, the contracts were not meant
to be enforced – only to set clear expectations.
        Many argue that expectations for student performance and student culture are set, in large
part, by the adults in the school building (Thernstrom and Thernstrom 2003). Recall, all principals
and more than half of teachers were replaced with individuals who we thought possessed values and
beliefs consistent with an achievement-driven philosophy. Teachers in treatment schools were
interviewed as to their beliefs and attitudes about student achievement and the role of schools;
answers received relatively higher scores if they placed responsibility for student achievement more
on the school and indicated a belief that all students could perform at high levels.
        Panel D of Figure 1 provides some suggestive evidence that a change in culture may have
taken place in treatment schools. Relative to comparison schools, treatment schools are more likely
to employ group work, less likely to be engaged in non-instructional activities, more likely to have
rules, trackers, and goals posted, and more likely to have students adhering to uniform policies.
These data were gleaned by half-day in-person site visits to all treatment and comparison schools.




II. Data and Research Design
        We use administrative data provided by the Houston Independent School District (HISD).
The main HISD data file contains student-level administrative data on approximately 200,000
students across the Houston metropolitan area. The data include information on student race,
gender, free and reduced-price lunch status, behavior, attendance, and matriculation with course
grades for all students; state math and ELA test scores for students in third through eleventh grades;



                                                   14
and Stanford 10 subject scores in math and reading for students in Kindergarten through tenth
grade.16 We have HISD data spanning the 2003-2004 to 2012-2013 school years.
         The state math and ELA tests, developed by the Texas Education Agency (TEA), are
statewide high-stakes exams conducted in the spring for students in third through eleventh grade.17
Students in fifth and eighth grades must score proficient or above on both tests to advance to the
next grade, and eleventh graders must achieve proficiency to graduate. Because of this, students in
these grades who do not pass the tests are allowed to retake it approximately one month after the
first administration. We use a student’s first score unless it is missing.18
         The content of the state math assessment is divided among six objectives for students in
grades three through eight and ten objectives for students in grades nine through eleven. Material in
the state reading assessment is divided among four objectives in grades three through eight and three
objectives in grade nine. The ninth grade reading test also includes open-ended written responses.
The state ELA assessment covers six objectives for tenth and eleventh grade students. The state
ELA assessment also includes open-ended questions as well as a written composition section.19
         All public school students are required to take the math and ELA tests unless they are
medically excused or have a severe disability. Students with moderate disabilities or limited English
proficiency must take both tests, but may be granted special accommodations (additional time,
translation services, alternative assessments, and so on) at the discretion of school or state
administrators. In our analysis the test scores are normalized (across the school district) to have a
mean of zero and a standard deviation of one for each grade and year.20
         We use a parsimonious set of controls to help correct for pre-treatment differences between
students in treatment and comparison schools. The most important controls are reading and math
achievement test scores from the previous three years, which we include in all regressions (unless
otherwise noted). Previous year test scores are available for most students who were in the district in

16 HISD did not administer Stanford 10 assessments to high school students after the 2010-2011 school year.

18 Using their retake scores, when the retake is higher than their first score, does not significantly alter the results. Results

http://www.tea.state.tx.us/student.assessment/staar/
20 Among students who take a state math or ELA test, several different test versions are administered to accommodate

specific needs. These tests are designed for students receiving special education services who would not be able to meet
proficiency on a similar test as their peers. Similarly, TAKS/STAAR L is a linguistically accommodated version of the
state mathematics, science and social studies test that provides more linguistic accommodations than the Spanish
versions of these tests. According to TEA, TAKS/STAAR--Modified and TAKS/STAAR--L are not comparable to the
standard version of the test and thus, we did not use them for our main analysis. We did, however, investigate whether
treatment influenced whether or not a student takes a standard or non-standard test (see Appendix Table 1).

                                                              15
the previous years (see Table 2 for exact percentages of treatment and comparison students who
have valid test scores from the previous year). We also include an indicator variable that takes on the
value of one if a student is missing a test score from the previous year and takes on the value of zero
otherwise.
         Other individual-level controls include gender; a mutually exclusive and collectively
exhaustive set of race dummies; and indicators for whether a student is eligible for free or reduced-
price lunch or other forms of federal assistance, whether a student receives accommodations for
limited English proficiency, whether a student receives special education accommodations, or
whether a student is enrolled in the district’s gifted and talented program. 21
         Following the logic in Rothstein (2009), we also include a series of school-level controls in all
non-experimental specifications. These include the percentage of the school that is female, the
percentage of the school that is black, the percentage of the school that is Hispanic, the percentage
of the school that is white, the percentage of the school that is eligible for free or reduced price
lunch, the percentage of the school that receives accommodations for limited English proficiency,
the percentage of the school that receives special education accommodations, the percentage of the
school that is enrolled in the gifted and talented program, and the mean math and reading scores on
the state test in the three years prior to treatment. The demographic controls are constructed by
taking the mean of each control in each school existing in HISD in 2010. The math and reading
scores for 2008, 2009, and 2010 are constructed by taking the mean math and reading scores in each
school in the year of interest. If students are enrolled in a school in 2011, 2012, or 2013 that does
not exist in either 2008, 2009, or 2010, they are not included in the calculation of school averages.
         Columns (1) through (6) of Table 2 display descriptive statistics on individual student
characteristics for both our experimental and non-experimental samples in elementary schools. Of
the fifteen variables, four are statistically significant in our experimental sample – 0.9 percent of
students in control schools are Asian compared with 0.5 percent in treatment schools, 9.1 percent of
students in control schools are enrolled in a Gifted and Talented program compared to 12.2 percent


21A student is income-eligible for free lunch if her family income is below 130 percent of the federal poverty guidelines,
or categorically eligible if (1) the student’s household receives assistance under the Food Stamp Program, the Food
Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR), or the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program
(TANF); (2) the student was enrolled in Head Start on the basis of meeting that program’s low-income criteria; (3) the
student is homeless; (4) the student is a migrant child; or (5) the student is identified by the local education liaison as a
runaway child receiving assistance from a program under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. Determination of
special education or ELL status is done by HISD Special Education Services and the HISD Language Proficiency
Assessment Committee.

                                                             16
in treatment schools, and in both reading and math, students in control schools were more likely to
take the Modified version of the TAKS than students in treatment schools.
        Columns (7) through (12) report descriptive statistics for secondary schools as well as the
combined sample of all treatment schools, using the rest of the school district as a comparison. In
stark contrast to our elementary school sample, there are marked differences between treatment and
comparison schools. Students in treatment secondary schools are more likely to be black, more likely
to be economically disadvantaged, less likely to be gifted and talented and have significantly lower
baseline scores. This is consistent with treatment secondary schools being chosen because they were
the lowest performing in the district.




                                                     Research Design
A. Experimental Specifications
        For the sixteen elementary schools for which treatment and control were determined by
random assignment, inference is straightforward. Let Zi indicate whether student i was enrolled in a
school selected for treatment during the pre-treatment year, let Xi denote a vector of control
variables consisting of the demographic variables in Table 2, and let ( ) represent a polynomial
including three years of prior individual test scores and their squares. All of these variables are
measured pre-treatment. γg is a grade-level fixed effect, ηt is a time fixed effect, and Ψm is a matched-
pair fixed effect.


        We can then estimate the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) effect τITT using the eight treatment and eight
control schools in our experimental sample via the following regression model:


        (1) Yi, s, m, g, t = α + τITT ∙ Zi + f (Yi, t-1 , Yi, t-2 , Yi, t-3) + βXi + γg + ηt + Ψm + εi, s, m, g, t


        Equation (1) identifies the impact of being offered a chance to attend a treatment school,
τITT, where students in the matched-pair schools correspond to the counterfactual state that would
have occurred for the students in treatment schools had their school not been randomly selected.
We focus on a fixed population of students. A student is considered treated (resp. control) if they
were in a treatment (resp. control) school in the pre-treatment year and not in an exit grade (e.g. 5th
grade). All student mobility after treatment assignment is ignored. Note: because Equation (1) is

                                                                 17
estimated on third, fourth, and fifth graders and treatment assignment was determined in the year
pre-treatment, we eliminate the concern of students selecting into an entry grade (e.g. Kindergarten).
        Under several assumptions (e.g. that treatment assignment is random, control schools are
not allowed to participate in the program and treatment assignment only affects outcomes through
program participation), we can also estimate the causal impact of attending a treatment school. This
parameter, commonly known as the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE), measures the average
effect of attending a treatment school on students who attend as a result of their school being
randomly selected (Angrist and Imbens 1994). The LATE parameter can be estimated through a
two-stage least squares regression of student achievement on the intensity of treatment, using
random assignment as an instrumental variable for the first stage regression. More precisely, we
define TREATEDi, s, m, g, t as the number of days in which a student is present at a treatment school,
divided by number of days in a school year. The second stage equation for the two-stage least
squares estimate therefore take the form:


        Yi s, m, g, t = α + δTREATEDi, s, m, g, t + f (Yi, t-1 , Yi, t-2 , Yi, t-3) + βXi + γg + ηt + Ψm + εi, s, m, g, t


and the first stage equation is:


        (2) TREATEDi, s, m, g, t = α + λZi + f (Yi, t-1 , Yi, t-2 , Yi, t-3) + βXi + γg + ηt + Ψm + εi, s, m, g, t


B. Non-Experimental Specifications
        In the absence of a randomized experiment in secondary schools, we implement four non-
experimental statistical approaches to adjust for pre-intervention differences between treatment and
comparison students. The first and simplest model we estimate is a linear, lagged dependent variable
specification of the form:


        (3) Yi, s, g, t = α + τOLS ∙ Zi + f(Yi, t-1 , Yi, t-2 , Yi, t-3) + βXi + ρXs + ωg + Φt + εi, s, g, t


where, as before, i indexes students, s schools, g grades, and t years. This specification also includes a
vector of school level controls, Xs, analogous to the individual level demographics listed in Table 2




                                                              18
as well as three years of mean school level test scores.22 To mimic our ITT specification, Zi takes on
the value of 1 if a student was enrolled in a treatment school in the pre-treatment year and was not
in an exit grade. This is not applicable to students in entry grades (e.g. 6th and 9th). In this scenario,
we define a student as treated if they are zoned to attend a treatment school. All student mobility after
treatment assignment is ignored. Thus, our secondary sample includes sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth,
tenth, and eleventh graders in 2010-2011, seventh, eighth, tenth and eleventh graders in 2011-2012,
and eighth and eleventh graders in 2012-2013.23
         Equation (3) is a simple and easily interpretable way to obtain non-experimental estimates of
the effect of treatment on student outcomes. The identification argument is similar to Dehejia and
Wahba (1999). Yet, these estimates will be biased in the presence of unobserved confounding
variables or significant measurement error in previous year test scores. For instance, if students in
comparison schools have more motivated parents or better facilities, then our estimates will be
biased. Moreover, our ability to control for potentially important school-level inputs such as teacher
quality, class disruptions, and so on, is severely limited.
         One potential way to account for these and other unobservables is to focus on the
achievement gains between the pre-treatment and treatment years for treatment and comparison
students. For our second non-experimental specification we calculate a difference-in-differences
(DD) estimator of the form:


                  (4) ∆Yi, s, g, t = α + τDD ∙ Zi + βXi + ρXs + ωg + Φt + εi, s, g, t


where ∆Yi, s, g, t denotes change in score for student i relative to the pre-treatment year and treatment
is defined as above.
         An important potential limitation of the two empirical models described thus far is potential
selection into (or out of) treatment zones. Although the design of our experiment occurred at the
tail end of the 2009-2010 school year for secondary schools, it is plausible that removing teachers
and administrators or altering the length of the school day and school year caused enough
commotion that some parents decided to move their children to different schools or move to other




22 The one exception is that Xs does not have a control for the percentage of students in a school with “other” race
since there were so few of these students in the schools.
23 Results that use all cohorts in treatment schools (not a fixed sample) are displayed in Appendix Table 2.



                                                           19
attendance zones all together (though this is not necessary to attend a different school, given
Houston’s open enrollment policy). Theoretically, even the direction of the potential bias is unclear.
            We do two things to limit this potential concern. First, it is important to re-emphasize that
treatment is defined as being all students who are either in a treatment school in the pre-treatment
year (who were not in an exit grade) or, for entry grades, zoned to attend a treatment school. This
minimizes selection into or out of the sample unless a family physically moves out of an attendance
zone and has a student in an entry grade.
            Second, to account for potential selection, we instrument for attending a treatment school
with whether a student is in the treatment group. While students are free to choose the school they
attend, their previous year attendance (for non-entry grades) and the zoning system (for entry
grades) creates a “default option” that may influence students’ schooling decisions. Cullen et al.
(2005) use a similar instrument to estimate the impact of school choice on student outcomes.
            The first stage equation expresses enrollment in a treatment school as a function of an
indicator, Zi, for whether a student is in the treatment group (i.e. enrolled in a treatment school in
the pre-treatment year if in a non-entry grade or zoned to attend a treatment school in the first year
of treatment if in an entry grade) and our parsimonious set of controls.24 In symbols:


            (5) TREATEDi, s, g, t = α + θZi + f (Yi, t-1 , Yi, t-2 , Yi, t-3) + βXi + ρXs + ωg + Φt + εi, s, g, t


The residual of this equation captures other factors that are correlated with enrollment in a
treatment school and may be related to student outcomes.
            The key identifying assumptions of our approach are that (1) living in a treatment school’s
enrollment zone or attending a treatment school in the pre-treatment year is correlated with
attending a treatment school and (2) the instrument affects student achievement through its effect
on the probability of attending a treatment school, not through any other factor or unobserved
characteristics.
            The first assumption is testable. Appendix Table 3 summarizes our first stage results. In
each specification, living in a treatment zone or previously attending a treatment school before the
announcement of the program strongly predicts attendance in a treatment school. In the non-
experimental samples, the F-statistic is almost 396 in elementary schools and 37 in secondary
schools, which suggests that our instrument is strong enough to allow for valid inference.

24   We exclude f() from the first-stage when estimating two-stage-least-squares difference-in-differences models.

                                                              20
         The validity of our second assumption – that the instrument only affects student outcomes
through the probability of attendance – is more difficult to assess. To be violated, the student’s
treatment status must be correlated with outcomes after controlling for the student’s background
characteristics. This assumes, for instance, that parents of children in entry grades do not selectively
move into different zones upon learning of the treatment. For children in non-entry grades, the
assumption is that parents did not have knowledge of the intervention at the beginning of the
previous school year so their school choice decisions could not affect a student’s inclusion in the
treatment group. Motivated parents can enroll their children in a treatment school no matter where
they live; the relationship between a treatment zone and enrollment comes about primarily through
the cost of attending, not eligibility. We also assume that any shocks – for instance, easier tests in the
treatment year – affect everyone in treatment and comparison schools, regardless of address. If there
is something that increases achievement test scores for students in treatment                        – twenty new
community centers with a rigorous after school program, for example – our second identifying
assumption is violated.
         We estimate two separate 2SLS specifications, analogous to the OLS and DD estimators
represented by Equations (3) and (4). Consistent with prior literature (e.g. Abdulkadiroglu et al.
2011), we assume that test score gains are a linear function of school attendance. Accordingly, τ can
be interpreted as the causal effect of attending a treated school for one year.25
         In what follows, we show the main results across all four empirical specifications. For clarity
of exposition, however, in the text we concentrate on our 2SLS-DD specification unless otherwise
noted.


III. Results
         Table 3 presents a series of estimates of the impact of the overall treatment described in
Section I on math and reading achievement state test scores, using the specifications described in
Section II. The rows specify how the results are pooled within the sample for a given set of
regressions and each column coincides with a different empirical model that is being estimated. All
results are yearly impacts and are presented in standard deviation units. Thus, to get the total effect of
our intervention, one multiplies the elementary school estimates by two and the secondary school


25If this assumption proves false, our estimates recover a weighted average derivative of the true function. The
expression for the weights is quite complicated without further assumptions, however; see Angrist and Pischke (2009)
for a brief discussion.

                                                          21
estimates by three. Standard errors, clustered at the school level, are in parentheses below each
estimate along with the number of observations.
         Columns (1) and (2) of Table 3 show results from the experimental sample. Column (1)
reports the ITT estimate and the LATE is displayed in column (2). The impact of being offered the
chance to participate in treatment is 0.122σ (0.055) in math and 0.030σ (0.035) in reading, per year.
The LATE estimate, which captures the impact of actually attending, is 0.103σ (0.047) and 0.026σ
(0.030) in math and reading, respectively. Both math estimates are statistically significant.
         Columns (3) through (6) in Table 3 present non-experimental estimates for both elementary
and secondary schools. Panel A provides non-experimental estimates for our set of experimental
schools, which allows one to compare the experimental and non-experimental estimates on a
common sample. Recall, in the OLS specification, treatment is defined as enrollment in a treatment
school in the pre-treatment year or being zoned to attend a treatment school for 6th and 9th graders.
Of the 12,106 students in the treatment group, 7,995 students actually ever attend a treatment
school. The 2SLS estimates use a student’s treatment assignment as an instrument for school
attended. Both of these regressions control for previous years’ test scores. The non-experimental
estimates in columns (5) and (6) are similar, but constrain the coefficient on previous year test score
to be one. This is an appropriate specification if one worries that our results are driven by
measurement error or mean reversion in test scores.
         Across our set of experimental elementary schools, the non-experimental estimates range
from 0.128σ (0.080) to 0.183σ (0.086) in math. These estimates are similar in magnitude to the
experimental estimates, but the standard errors are approximately twice as large.
         Panel B uses identical non-experimental specifications on all elementary schools (the eight
that were randomly selected along with the additional three that were treated) and secondary
schools. When we include all eleven treated elementary schools, the estimated treatment effect
increases substantially – ranging from 0.188σ (0.074) to 0.269σ (0.115), per year, across non-
experimental specifications.26 The reading results remain virtually unchanged – none are statistically
significant. Taken at face value, this implies that the treatment can close the achievement gap in
math among blacks and Hispanics – relative to whites – in less than three years.



26 A few of the elementary school principals were hired in the Spring of the pre-treatment year, potentially
contaminating the baseline test scores. Online Appendix Table 1 attempts to account for this by defining the pre-
treatment year as two years prior to treatment. With this adjustment, the estimated impact of treatment is very similar,
though slightly higher.

                                                            22
        Results from the nine secondary schools are similar, though smaller in magnitude. Treatment
effects in math range from 0.103σ (0.035) to 0.150σ (0.033), per year. Thus, after the three year
experiment, students in treatment schools gained between 0.309σ and 0.450σ in math. The
achievement gap in math in Houston, in the pre-treatment year, was 0.8σ . Again, results in reading
are small and insignificant.
        Another, perhaps simpler, way to look at the data is to graph the distribution of average test
score gains for each school-grade cell, which is depicted in Figure 2. We control for demographic
observables by estimating Equation (4) – our difference-in-differences estimator – but omitting the
treatment indicator. We then collect the residuals from this equation and average them at the
school-grade level. The results echo those found in Table 3. In elementary school math, 14 out of 22
school-grade level cells had positive gains. In secondary math, seven out of nine had positive gains.
        Relatedly, a quite conservative form of inference is to run school-level regressions of the
impact of treatment on school-level average test scores. Estimates for this specification are displayed
in Online Appendix Table 2. The point estimates are strikingly consistent in math [0.172σ (0.046)]
and approximately twice as large in reading [0.088σ (0.039)]. Both estimates are statistically
significant.


High-Dosage Tutoring
        Due to budget constraints, all five tenets described in Dobbie and Fryer (2013a) were only
implemented in three grade/subject areas: fourth grade math, sixth grade math, and ninth grade
math. In the other grade/subject areas, computerized curriculum was used to individualize
instruction. This provides an opportunity to estimate the marginal impact of the most expensive
element of treatment. If small-group, high-dosage tutoring yields significantly larger increases in
student achievement, then perhaps the costs are justified. If, on the other hand, the correlates in
Dobbie and Fryer (2013a) were proxies for individualization that can be imitated with technology,
then the potential for scale is greater, due to lower marginal costs.
        Table 4 estimates the impact of treatment with tutoring relative to comparison school
attendees. Students in secondary schools who received tutoring performed significantly better than
their non-tutored peers in treatment schools. In secondary schools, students who received tutoring
had math gains in the range of 0.154σ (0.046) to 0.477σ (0.067). Compared to other students in
treatment schools, this is a difference of around 0.20σ. All differences have p-values less than 0.05.
In other words, students who received tutoring in secondary schools outperformed their peers by

                                                   23
over 100 percent. The differences between tutored and non-tutored students in elementary schools
were less pronounced. This could be due to the fact that we are tutoring in higher ratios in
elementary versus secondary school or that elementary students are not sufficiently behind to take
advantage of intense tutoring. Arguing for the latter, the tutoring model was most effective among
high school students.
        Let us put the magnitude of these estimates in perspective. Jacob and Ludwig (2008), in a
survey of programs and policies designed to increase achievement among poor children, report that
only three reforms pass a simple cost-benefit analysis: lowering class size, teacher bonuses for
teaching in hard-to-staff schools, and early childhood programs. The effect of lowering class size
from 24 to 16 students per teacher is approximately 0.073σ per year (i.e. 0.22σ over three years) on
combined math and reading scores (Krueger 1999). The effect of Teach for America, one attempt to
bring more skilled teachers into poor performing schools, is 0.15σ in math and 0.03σ in reading
(Decker et al. 2004). The effect of Head Start is 0.147σ (0.103) in applied problems and 0.319σ
(0.147) in letter identification on the Woodcock-Johnson exam, but the effects on test scores fade in
elementary school (Currie and Thomas 1995, Ludwig and Phillips 2008).
        All these effect sizes are a fraction of the impact of the treatment that includes tutoring. The
effects closest to the ones reported here are from a series of papers on achievement-increasing
charter schools in which the impacts range from 0.229σ to 0.364σ in math and 0.120σ to 0.265σ in
reading (Abdulkadiroglu et al. 2011, Angrist et al. 2010, Curto and Fryer 2012).
        Indeed, taking the combined treatment effects at face value, treatment schools in Houston
would rank fifth out of forty in math and twentieth out of forty in reading among NYC charter
schools in the sample analyzed in Dobbie and Fryer (2013a).


Heterogeneous Treatment Effects
        Table 5 explores the heterogeneity of our treatment effects across a variety of subsamples of
the data and reports p-values on the difference in reported treatment effects. The coefficient
estimates are from the 2SLS-DD specification.
        Surprisingly, the treatment was most effective in high schools and elementary schools, and
only marginally significant in middle schools [not shown in tabular form]. Most other subsamples of
the data yield consistent impacts, though there is evidence that Hispanic students gained significantly
more than black students and students with economic disadvantage gained more than students who
were not economically disadvantaged. In secondary schools, the impact of treatment on black

                                                  24
students is 0.088σ (0.040), and is 0.175σ (0.037) for Hispanic students – the p-value on the
difference is 0.031.        Similarly, the impact on treatment for students who are economically
disadvantaged in elementary schools is 0.280σ (0.120) compared to 0.032σ (0.110) for students
without economic disadvantage – the p-value on the difference is 0.005.


Attendance
         We next consider the effects of treatment on attendance rates. Table 6 demonstrates that all
elementary specifications yield small and insignificant impacts on attendance. This is potentially due
to the high baseline attendance rate in Houston elementary schools (97 percent). In secondary
schools, however, the treatment effect is 0.778 (0.253) percentage points per year – over two
percentage points in total over the length of the demonstration project.


IV. Robustness Checks
         In this section, we explore the extent to which the test score results are robust to a simple
falsification test, alternative specifications, alternative constructions of comparison schools,
alternative achievement scores, and sample attrition.27 In all cases, our main results are qualitatively
unchanged.


Falsification Tests
         Following the logic of Rothstein (2010), we perform a partial falsification test by estimating
the impact of attending our treatment schools in the pre-treatment year. We estimate our non-
experimental specifications during the 2008-09 school year – two years before the intervention
began. If our identification assumptions are valid, we would expect these estimates to be statistically
zero. Unfortunately, the reverse is not necessarily true. If the estimates are statistically zero, our
research design may still be invalid.
         Appendix Table 4 presents the results of this exercise. The 2SLS difference-in-differences
estimate for secondary schools is 0.008σ (0.041) in math and -0.017σ (0.028) in reading. Of the eight
estimates presented in the table, one is statistically differentiable from zero at a 90 percent
confidence level.



27In an earlier version of the paper, we also implemented four statistical tests of cheating gleaned from Jacob and Levitt
(2003). For details, see Fryer (2011c).

                                                           25
         We also conduct a similar exercise to explore whether mean reversion might explain our
secondary school results. Since the nine treatment secondary schools were chosen based on several
years of poor performance, one might expect some reversion to the mean. We therefore selected
the nine lowest-performing schools based on 2007-08 state tests and calculated their treatment
effects in 2008-09.        The results in Appendix Table 5 show no evidence of significant mean
reversion.28 Appendix Figures 1 present these results graphically for three additional cohorts of data.




Alternative Comparison Groups
         The second robustness check estimates the impact of treatment using four additional
definitions of comparison schools: (1) all schools from large cities across the state of Texas (Austin,
Dallas, Houston and San Antonio); (2) comparison schools selected – pre-treatment – by the Texas
Education Agency; (3) all HISD schools rated “Academically Acceptable” or “Unacceptable” (the
two lowest accountability levels); and (4) nine schools that HISD officials considered to be the best
matches for treatment schools, pre-treatment (deemed “HISD Suggested Matched Schools”). 29
         Table 7 presents estimates of the treatment effect on state test scores across these four
comparison samples. For both math and reading, our estimates are similar across all comparison
samples. In the pooled estimates, the maximum differences between any two coefficients is 0.005σ
in math and 0.026σ in reading.


Alternative “Low Stakes” Test Scores
         Some argue that improvements on state exams may be driven by test-specific preparatory
activities at the expense of more general learning. Jacob (2005), for example, finds evidence that the

28 Moreover, given the non-random selection into 6th and 9th grades, one might worry that the changing demographics

might affect our estimates of average treatment effects. With this in mind, we weighted the 6th and 9th grade classes to
resemble the 7th and 10th grade classes on observable characteristics and re-ran our main regressions. The results,
detailed in Online Appendix Table 3, are unchanged.
29 As a part of its Academic Excellence Indicator System, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) selects a 40-school

comparison group for every public school in Texas. The reports are designed to facilitate comparisons between schools
with similar student bodies on a diverse set of outcomes, including: standardized testing participation and results; school-
wide attendance rates; four-year completion rates; drop-out rates; a measure of progress made by English Language
Learners; and several indicators of college readiness. When constructing comparison groups for each school, TEA
selects the 40 Texas schools that bear the closest resemblance in the racial composition of their students, the percentage
of students receiving financial assistance, the percentage of students with limited English proficiency, and the percentage
of “mobile” students based on the previous year’s attendance. These groupings form the basis of our comparison
sample. We identify 15 Houston high schools and 19 Houston middle schools that are included in the TEA comparison
group for one or more treatment schools. Of these 34 schools, 13 were deemed “academically acceptable”, 15
“recognized” and 6 “exemplary” based on results from the 2009-2010 school year.

                                                            26
introduction of accountability programs increases high-stakes test scores without increasing scores
on low-stakes tests, most likely through increases in test-specific skills and student effort. It is
important to know whether the results presented above are being driven by actual gains in general
knowledge or whether the improvements are only relevant to the high-stakes state exams.
         To provide some evidence on this question, we present data from the Stanford 10. Houston
is one of a handful of cities that voluntary administers a nationally normed test for which teachers
and principals are not held accountable – decreasing the incentive to teach to the test or engage in
other forms of manipulation. The math and reading tests are aligned with standards set by the
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the National Council of Teachers of Reading,
respectively.30
         Table 8 presents estimates of treatment on Stanford 10 math and reading scores. As in our
state test results, there are large and statistically significant effects in math and insignificant results in
reading. Panel A displays results for the experimental sample. The ITT estimate in math is 0.100σ
(0.050) and the estimate in reading is 0.049σ (0.034); both are similar to the equivalent estimate on
state test scores though a bit smaller. Panel B provides treatment effects for our non-experimental
sample. Estimates range from 0.091σ (0.029) to 0.135σ (0.044) in math and 0.030σ (0.023) to 0.042σ
(0.030) in reading. Again, these estimates are similar to the estimates in Table 3.


Attrition and Selection into Advanced Tests
         The estimates thus far use students who are in the treatment or comparison sample, and for
whom we have pre-treatment year test scores. If treatment and comparison schools have different
rates of selection into this sample, our results may be biased. Removing teachers and nineteen
principals was not a process that went unnoticed on local news or in print media. It is plausible that
parents were aware of the major changes and opted to move their families to another attendance
zone within HISD, a private school, or a well-known charter school like KIPP or YES. In the latter
two cases, the student’s test scores will be missing. Our IV strategy does not account for that type of
selective attrition.
         As mentioned earlier, not all students took the standard ELA and math tests. Some students
took the linguistically accommodated versions (TAKS/STAAR L), some took tests with other

30Mathtests include content testing number sense, pattern recognition, algebra, geometry, and probability and statistics,
depending on the grade level. Reading tests include age-appropriate questions measuring reading ability, vocabulary, and
comprehension. More information can be found at http://www.pearsonassessments.com/HAIWEB/Cultures/en-
us/Productdetail.htm?Pid=SAT10C.

                                                           27
accommodations (Modified) and some took tests that were above their grade level. It is also possible
that our program pushed students into taking non-standard versions of the state test and that this is
biasing our estimates.
       A simple test for this is to investigate the impact of treatment on the probability of entering
our analysis sample and on taking non-standard tests. As Appendix Table 1 shows, students in our
experimental elementary sample are 1.5 percent more likely to be missing a test score, equally likely
to take an advanced or modified test, and 0.9 percent less likely to have taken the linguistically
accommodated (L) version of the test. These patterns persist when one includes all elementary
schools. However, trimming the experimental sample by dropping the 1.5 percent of the treatment
group with the highest gains over previous year test scores does systematically alter the results (see
Lee 2009). Among secondary schools, students in treatment are less likely to be missing a test score
and equally likely to have taken an advanced or modified test.




V. Further Evidence
A. Denver Public Schools
       Denver Public Schools (DPS) is the largest school district in Colorado and the thirty-ninth
largest district in the country with 84,424 students and 172 schools. Seventy-two percent of DPS
students are black or Hispanic and approximately 72 percent of all students are eligible for free or
reduced price lunch. Denver, like Houston, is governed by a Board of Education comprised of
seven members elected from separate districts who serve staggered four-year terms, but in contrast
to Houston, has a particularly strong teacher’s union.
       In 2011-2012, seven schools in the Far Northeast Region of Denver were selected to
participate in a five-pronged intervention modeled after the intervention in Houston. In these
schools, new principals were selected and approximately 95 percent of teachers were replaced, 260
instructional hours were added to the school year – over 30 more days – through more minutes in
each day and more days per year, interim assessments were administered every six to eight weeks
and a “no-excuses” culture was introduced within the first week of the year. Additionally, fourth,
sixth and ninth graders received math tutoring in 1:3 ratios in elementary schools and 1:2 ratios in
secondary schools.
       There are four potentially important differences between the Houston and Denver
treatments. First, Denver schools are in a feeder pattern in close geographic proximity to each other.

                                                  28
Some argue that this is important for sustainability. Second, all teachers (tenured and untenured)
were required to reapply for their jobs if they wanted to continue teaching in the school. This
resulted in the high turnover rates reported above. Third, because of a law in Colorado that provides
schools with the opportunity to seek autonomy from district policies (including union contracts) and
to bring more decision making to the campus level – labeled the Innovation Schools Act – all
treatment schools have increased autonomy that provides flexibility in school scheduling, hiring
decisions, rewarding excellence in instruction, and removing ineffective teachers. Fourth, the Denver
intervention used a combination of strategies, including: phasing out and restarting traditional
schools, turning around traditional schools (the strategy used in Houston), and replacing schools
with charter schools (a strategy widely implemented in places like New York). We only analyze the
seven schools that were traditional district schools.
        The Far Northeast Region, where all treatment schools are located, has a significantly higher
proportion of black and free or reduced-price lunch students when compared with the rest of DPS.
Online Appendix Table 4 shows summary statistics for the seven schools in the intervention, as well
as the other schools in the Far Northeast Region and all other schools in Denver. The seven
treatment schools enrolled 1,347 students in third, fourth, sixth and ninth grades (the tested grades
in the sample). Compared to students in other Denver schools, students in treatment schools are
significantly more likely to be black, free lunch eligible, and have lower baseline scores.
        We use the two non-experimental specifications described in Equation (3) and Equation (4)
to estimate treatment effects shown in Online Appendix Table 5, with a few exceptions. Treatment
is defined as being enrolled in an intervention school at the beginning of the school year.
Additionally, specifications for Denver include two prior years of test scores instead of three due to
data limitations and do not include school-level controls.
        Using the OLS specification in Equation (3), the effect of attending a treatment school is
0.226σ (0.058) in math. Using the DD specification, the treatment effect of the intervention is
0.256σ (0.058). The treatment effect on reading scores is 0.102σ (0.058) using the OLS specification
and 0.073σ (0.042) using the DD specification. These numbers are remarkably similar to the results
we see in Houston, although the reading effects are slightly larger and significant.


B. Academy for Urban School Leadership
        The Academy for Urban School Leadership (AUSL) is a non-profit organization whose
mission is to turn around failing schools within the Chicago Public School (CPS) district. It currently

                                                   29
manages twenty-nine Chicago Public Schools. AUSL schools feature many of the same practices
implemented in the Houston intervention. Human capital is improved by selecting new principals
and replacing teachers with new AUSL-trained teachers before the start of the school year.
Throughout the year, the school staff continuously analyzes student achievement data from frequent
assessments to ensure individualized instruction. Starting from the first day of school, a new culture
of high expectations and success is established as the norm. The only aspect of the Houston
intervention that is not present in AUSL schools is increased time.
       For the purposes of our analysis, we looked at all students enrolled in an AUSL school at
any time between the 2006-2007 and 2010-2011 school years. AUSL students are significantly more
likely to be black, less likely to be Hispanic and more likely to be economically disadvantaged relative
to the district mean. Treatment is defined as being enrolled in a school in the year before it was
transitioned to AUSL, enrolling in an AUSL school when the student first enters the district or
transitioning into a treatment high school from any middle school. We defined our comparison
sample by looking for students in CPS who matched a student in the treatment group with respect
to demographics. We restricted the comparison group to students who matched at least one
treatment student. As a result, all of our estimates are non-experimental. In secondary schools,
students in the treatment group had between 0.051σ (0.028) and 0.097σ (0.020) higher scores on
math state tests and between 0.022σ (0.023) and 0.027σ (0.011) higher scores in reading using DD
specifications [not shown in tabular form].




VI. Discussion and Speculation
       This paper examines the impact of injecting best practices from charter schools into twenty
traditional public schools in Houston starting in the 2010-2011 school year.           The five tenets
implemented in the treatment schools were an increase in instructional time, a change in the human
capital in the school, high-dosage differentiation through tutoring or computerized instruction, data-
driven instruction, and a school culture of high expectations for all students regardless of
background or past performance. We have shown that this particular set of interventions can
generate gains in math in both elementary and secondary schools but that it generated small to no
effects in reading. The treatment with tutoring is particularly effective.             Moreover, our
demonstration project had a larger impact on Hispanic students and students who are economically
disadvantaged.

                                                  30
         We conclude with a speculative discussion about the stark differences between treatment
effects on reading and math test scores and scalability of our experiment along four dimensions:
local politics, financial resources, fidelity of implementation, and labor supply of human capital.
Unfortunately, our discussion offers few, if any, definitive answers.


Math versus Reading
         The difference in achievement effects between math and reading, while striking, is consistent
with previous work on the efficacy of charter schools and other educational interventions.
Abdulkadiroglu et al. (2011) and Angrist et al. (2010) find that the treatment effect of attending an
oversubscribed charter school is four times as large for math as ELA. Dobbie and Fryer (2011)
demonstrate effects that are almost 5 times as large in middle school and 1.6 times as large in
elementary school, in favor of math. In larger samples, Hoxby and Murarka (2009) report an effect
size 2.5 times as large in New York City charters, and Gleason et al. (2010) show that an average
urban charter school increases math scores by 0.16σ with statistically zero effect on reading.
         There are many theories that may explain the disparity in treatment effects by subject
area.31 Research in developmental psychology has suggested that the critical period for language
development occurs early in life, while the critical period for developing higher cognitive functions
extends into adolescence (Hopkins and Bracht 1975, Newport 1990, Pinker 1994, Nelson 2000,
Knudsen et al. 2006). This theory seems inconsistent with the fact that the elementary school
reading estimates are similar in magnitude to the secondary school estimates.
         Another leading theory posits that reading scores are influenced by the language spoken
when students are outside of the classroom (Charity et al. 2004, Rickford 1999). Charity et al. (2004)
argue that if students speak non-standard English at home and in their communities, increasing
reading scores might be especially difficult. This theory is consistent with our findings and could
explain why students at an urban boarding school make similar progress on ELA and math (Curto
and Fryer 2012).


Scalability
         We begin with local politics. It is possible that Houston is an exception and the experiment
is not scalable because Texas is one of only twenty-four “right to work” states and has been on the

 It is important to remember that our largest treatment effects were in grades with two-on-one tutoring in math – it is
31

worth considering whether similar interventions for reading could have a sizeable impact on reading outcomes.

                                                          31
cutting edge of many education reforms including early forms of accountability, standardized testing,
and the charter school movement. Houston has a remarkably innovative and research-driven
Superintendent at the twilight of his career who is keen on trying bold initiatives and a supportive
school board who voted 8-0 (one board member abstained) to begin the initiative in middle and high
schools and voted 5-4 to expand it to elementary schools. Arguing against the uniqueness of
Houston, however, are the results from Denver, Colorado – a city with a stronger teacher’s union.
            The financial resources needed for our experiment are another potential limiting factor to
scalability, though the elementary school intervention was implemented with no extra costs. The
marginal costs for the secondary school interventions are $1,837 per student, which is similar to the
marginal costs of high-performing charter schools. While this may seem to be an important barrier,
a back of the envelope cost-benefit exercise reveals that the rate of return on this investment is
roughly 13 percent (see Appendix C for details).32 On the other hand, marshaling these types of
resources for already cash-strapped districts may be an important limiting factor, regardless of the
return on investment. However, there are likely lower-cost ways to conduct our experiment. For
instance, tutoring cost over $2,500 per student. Future experiments can inform whether five-on-one
(reducing costs significantly) or even online tutoring may yield similar effects.
            Fidelity of implementation was a constant challenge. For instance, rather than having every
tutor applicant pass a math test and complete a mock tutorial, one can save a lot of time (and
potentially compromise quality) by selecting by other means (e.g. recommendation letters). Many
programs that have shown significant initial impacts have struggled to scale because of breakdowns
in site-based implementation (Schochet et al. 2008).
            Perhaps the most worrisome hurdle of implementation is the labor supply of talent available
to teach in inner-city schools. Most all of our principals were successful leaders at previous schools.
It took over three hundred principal interviews to find nineteen individuals who possessed the
values and beliefs consistent with the leaders in successful charter schools and a demonstrated
record of achievement. Successful charter schools report similar difficulties, often arguing that talent
is the limiting factor of growth (Tucker and Codding 2002). All of the principals and many of the
teachers were recruited from other schools. If the education production function has strong
diminishing returns in human capital, then reallocating teachers and principals can increase total
production. If, however, the production function has weakly increasing returns, then reallocating
talent may decrease total production of achievement. In this case, developing ways to increase the

human capital available to teach students through changes in pay, the use of technology, reimagining
the role of schools of education, or lowering the barriers to entry into the teaching profession may
be a necessary component of scalability.
                                                       ***
These results provide the first proof point that charter school best practices can be used
systematically in previously low-performing traditional public schools to significantly increase
student achievement in ways similar to the most achievement-increasing charter schools. Many
questions remain. Perhaps the most important open question is the extent to which these efforts
might eventually be scalable. Can we develop a model to increase reading achievement? Is there an
equally effective, but less expensive, way of tutoring students? Are all the tenets necessary or can we
simply provide tutoring as a supplement to the current stock of human capital? Moving forward, it is
important to experiment with variations on the five tenets – and others – to further develop a
school reform model that may, eventually, increase achievement and close the racial achievement
gap in education.

Appendix A: Implementation Guide


School Selection
                                            A. Secondary Schools
         During the 2010-2011 school year, four “failing” Houston Independent School District
(HISD) high schools and five “unacceptable” middle schools were chosen to participate in the first
phase of treatment. To be a Texas Title I Priority School for 2010 (i.e., “failing” school), a school
had to be a Title I school in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring that was among the
lowest achieving five percent of Title I Schools in Texas or any high school that had a graduation
rate below 60 percent. When a school is labeled as “failing,” a school district has one of four
options: closure, school restart, turn-around, or transformation. The four “failing” high schools that
qualified for participation in the treatment program in 2010-2011 were Jesse H. Jones High School,
Kashmere High School, Robert E. Lee High School, and Sharpstown High School.
         “Unacceptable” schools were defined by the Texas Education Agency as schools that failed
to meet the TAKS standards in one or more subjects or failed to meet the graduation rate(in high
schools) or the dropout rate(in middle schools) standard. The five “unacceptable” middle schools in
HISD were: Crispus Attucks Middle School, Richard Dowling Middle School, Walter Fondren




                                                   37
Middle School, Francis Scott Key Middle School, and James Ryan Middle School.33 “Failing” and
“unacceptable” schools were treated with the same comprehensive turnaround model.


                                                    B. Elementary Schools
         In Spring 2011, we ranked all elementary schools in HISD based on their combined reading
and math state test scores in grades three through five and Stanford 10 scores in Kindergarten
through second grade. The two lowest performing elementary schools – Robert L. Frost Elementary
and Anna B. Kelso Elementary – were deemed “unacceptable” by the state of Texas. The Houston
school district insisted that these schools be treated. We then took the next eighteen schools (from
the bottom) and used a matched-pair randomization procedure similar to those recommended by
Imai et al. (2009) and Greevy et al. (2004) to partition schools into treatment and control.34
         To increase the likelihood that our control and treatment groups were balanced on a variable
that was correlated with our outcomes of interest, we used past standardized test scores to construct
our matched pairs. First, we ordered the full set of eighteen schools by the sum of their mean
reading and math test scores in the previous year. Then we designated every two schools from this
ordered list as a “matched pair” and randomly drew one member of the matched pair into the
treatment group and one into the control group. In the summer of 2011, one of the treatment
schools was closed because of low enrollment. We replaced it with its matched-pair. The eleven
treatment elementary schools were Blackshear Elementary, Jaime Davila Elementary, Robert L.
Frost Elementary, Highland Heights Elementary, Rollin Isaacs Elementary, Anna B. Kelso
Elementary, Judson W. Robinson Jr. Elementary, Walter Scarborough Elementary, Eleanor Tinsley
Elementary, Walnut Bend Elementary, and Ethel M. Young Elementary.


Human Capital
                                                 A. Organizational Structure



33 Key Middle School was not officially labeled as an “unacceptable” school in 2008-2009. However, a significant
cheating scandal was discovered at Key after that year’s test scores were reported. Their preliminary “unacceptable”
rating for 2009-2010 suggests that without the cheating in 2008-2009, they would have been rated similarly that year.
34 There is an active debate on which randomization procedures have the best properties. Imbens (2011) summarizes a

series of claims made in the literature and shows that both stratified randomization and matched-pairs can increase
power in small samples. Simulation evidence presented in Bruhn and McKenzie (2009) supports these findings, though
for large samples there is little gain from different methods of randomization over a pure single draw. Imai et al. (2009)
derive properties of matched-pair cluster randomization estimators and demonstrate large efficiency gains relative to
pure simple cluster randomization.

                                                            38
         Many successful charter schools employ large central teams to handle the set of
administrative and support tasks necessary to run a school so that the teachers and school leadership
team can focus on instructional quality. For our demonstration project, HISD hired three “School
Improvement Officers” (SIOs): one to work with the four high schools, one to work with the five
middle schools, and a third to work with the eleven elementary schools. The SIOs were jointly
supported by a team of three academic program managers; additionally, each SIO had a team of
Teacher Development Specialists (TDS) who worked exclusively with the treatment schools.35 The
SIOs were the direct supervisors of the twenty principals of treatment schools and provided them
with support around all aspects of the program’s implementation in their schools. The academic
program managers provided support for the schools around certain aspects of the five strategies,
particularly high-dosage tutoring. The TDS teams, which averaged between four and six specialists,
provided targeted professional development for teachers at the principals’ discretion, as well as data
analysis for the SIOs. Together, the team was tasked with ensuring that the school principals had the
resources and support necessary to implement the five school turnaround strategies with fidelity.


                                           B. Principal Selection and Training
         The principals at nineteen of the twenty treatment schools were replaced through a
thorough, national search. More than 300 school leaders were initially screened for the positions;
100 qualified for a final interview with HISD Superintendent Terry Grier and the author. Nineteen
individuals were selected from this pool to lead the treatment schools. Of the nineteen principals
selected, fourteen came from within HISD, two came from schools elsewhere in Texas, and three
came from other states. Fifteen of the nineteen principals were experienced principals with records
of increasing student performance in previously low-performing schools; the others had been
successful assistant principals or deans of instruction.
         Each cohort of principals met regularly with their SIO, both individually and as a group.
Group meetings were focused on reviewing assessment data and sharing best practices. Individual
meetings were longer (the high school and middle school SIOs typically spent a full day at each
school per week, while the elementary SIO visited each school at least biweekly) and focused on




35Teacher Development Specialists were part of a new district initiative for increasing teacher observations and
improving instruction. A typical district TDS was responsible for overseeing (observing and coaching) about 120
teachers; TDS within treatment schools were responsible for overseeing about 50 teachers.

instructional observations and administrative concerns such as student enrollment, budgets, and
compliance to program or district initiatives.


                             C. Teacher Departure, Selection, and Development
Secondary Schools
        In partnership with The New Teacher Project, HISD conducted interviews with teachers in
all nine of the treatment schools before the end of the 2009-2010 school year to gather information
on each individual teacher’s attitudes toward student achievement and the turnaround initiative. In
conjunction with data on teachers’ past performance, this information was used to determine which
teachers would be asked to continue teaching at the treatment schools. In addition to normal
teacher attrition due to resignations and retirement, 162 teachers were transferred out of the
treatment schools based on the analysis of their past performance and their attitudes towards
teaching. In all, according to administrative records, 295 teachers left the nine secondary schools
between the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years.
        To replace these teachers, 100 new Teach for America corps members were hired by the
nine treatment schools. Additionally, sixty experienced teachers with a history of producing student
achievement gains transferred into these nine schools. A bonus was offered to high-performing
experienced teachers who transferred to the nine treatment schools through the district’s Effective
Teacher Pipeline. Teachers qualified for this program based on their calculated value-added in
previous years and all teachers who qualified were invited to apply for positions in the five middle
and four high schools. Those teachers who ultimately transferred to a treatment school through this
program earned a $10,000 annual stipend for the first two years.


Elementary Schools
        The elementary school principals were able to begin work at the new schools at the end of
the 2010-11 school year. Following the model set by the secondary schools before the end of the
2009-10 school year, principals conducted interviews with sitting teachers in all eleven of the
treatment schools before the end of the 2010-2011 school year to gather information on each
individual teacher’s attitudes toward student achievement and the turnaround initiative. In
conjunction with data on teachers’ past performance, this information was used to determine which
teachers would be asked to continue teaching at the treatment schools. In addition to normal
teacher attrition due to resignations and retirement, 120 teachers were taken to file review based on

                                                  40
interviews and analysis of their past performance. In all, according to administrative records, 158
teachers left the eleven elementary schools between the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 school years.
        Principals were responsible for replacing these teachers over the summer. Approximately 50
experienced teachers transferred into these eleven schools from other HISD schools. As was the
case in the treatment secondary schools, high-performing experienced teachers were also
incentivized to transfer into one of the eleven elementary schools through the district’s Effective
Teacher Pipeline. As seven of the ten new elementary principals had transferred from schools
elsewhere in HISD, many recruited high-performing teachers from their previous schools to work in
the turnaround initiative.


        Principals at all twenty treatment schools were given greater control over how to develop the
skills of the recruited and retained staff. Most principals followed the same three-pronged
professional development plan that was implemented during the 2010-2011 school year, and which
is detailed below. During the summer of 2011, we gathered the twenty turnaround principals and
three SIOs for a leadership development conference in New York, during which time principals
visited high-performing charter schools, developed detailed school improvement plans, and shared
best practices along the contours of the five school turnaround strategies. During the summer of
2012, a leadership development conference for Apollo principals was held in Houston and leveraged
the strengths of the leaders themselves. All twenty principals were broken into teams based on
demonstrated strengths and each team was responsible for presenting the rest of the group with
implementation strategies and best practices for one of the five tenets.


Teacher Development
        The first prong involved training all teachers around the effective instructional strategies
developed by Doug Lemov of Uncommon Schools, author of Teach Like a Champion, and Dr. Robert
Marzano. This training was broken down into ten distinct modules around instructional strategies -
from “Creating a Strong Classroom Culture” to “Improving Instructional Pacing” - delivered in
small groups by the principals over the course of the full week before the first day of school. In
addition to these instructional strategy sessions, teachers also received grade-level and subject-matter
specific training around curriculum and assessment.
        The second prong of the professional development model was a series of sessions held on
Saturdays throughout the fall of 2010. These sessions were designed to increase the rigor of

                                                   41
classroom instruction and covered specific topics such as lesson planning and differentiation. These
sessions were intended for all teachers, regardless of experience or content area.
        The third component was intended specifically for inexperienced teachers. Throughout the
winter, new teachers were expected to attend Saturday professional development sessions geared
toward issues that are in many cases unique to novice teachers, particularly around developing a
teacher’s “toolbox” for classroom management and student engagement.
        In response to teacher feedback and low growth in student reaching achievement, HISD
provided the secondary schools with professional development from the Neuhaus Education Center
in how to improve literacy achievement through the use of detailed diagnostics, regular “Mastery
Check” assessments, and small group interventions. The elementary school principals also received
training from Debbie Diller in how to set up and teach in math and literacy workstations, in order to
better differentiate instruction for students at their schools. Elementary school teachers received
program-wide training in the double-dosing programs (enVision and READ 180, see below),
assessment development, and school climate and culture.
        Beyond these system-wide professional development strategies, each school developed its
own professional development plan for all teachers for the entire school year, based on the specific
needs of the teachers and students in that school. In addition to relying on the new TDS position
for targeted teacher development, schools could seek professional development support from
HISD, Texas Region IV, or other external organizations. Finally, most schools utilized a
Professional Learning Community (PLC) model to maximize the sharing of best practices and
professional expertise within their buildings.


Increased Time on Task
        In the summer of 2010, HISD obtained a waiver from the Texas state legislature to allow for
the extension of the 2010-2011 school year in the nine treatment schools by five days. For these
schools, the school year began on August 16, 2010. Additionally, the school day was lengthened at
each of the nine treatment schools. The school day at these schools ran from 7:45am - 4:15pm
Monday through Thursday and 7:45am - 3:15pm on Friday. Although school day schedules varied
by school in the 2009-2010 school year, the school week for the treatment schools were extended by
over five hours on average, which was an increase of slightly over an hour per day. Within this
schedule, treatment middle schools operated a six-period school day, while the high school
schedules consisted of seven periods per day.

                                                  42
        In 2011-12 and 2012-13, instructional time throughout the school year remained basically
unchanged overall for the nine secondary schools. However, changes were made to the actual
schedules. Most middle and high schools shortened the school day by fifteen minutes four days each
week to allow for an hour of teacher common planning time. To offset this change, schools began
holding Saturday school and after-school tutorials during the first semester of the 2011-12 school
year. These changes allowed for a more efficient use of instructional time.
        As in 2010-11, in 2011-12 and 2012-13 the extra time was structured to allow for high-
dosage differentiation in the form of tutoring and double-dosing courses. More details on the
implementation of high-dosage tutoring and double-dosing courses can be found in the following
sections.
        The eleven elementary schools did not extend their school day schedule and had the same
school year as the rest of HISD elementary schools. Their master schedules were reviewed and
changed to maximize instructional time and strategically target areas for student growth.


High-Dosage Tutoring
        In order to deploy high-dosage tutoring for sixth and ninth graders in the treatment schools
from the beginning of the 2010-2011 school year, HISD partnered with the MATCH School of
Boston, which had been implementing an in-school two-on-one tutoring model at their schools
since 2004. A team of MATCH consultants helped to recruit, screen, hire, and train tutors from June
to August 2010. Branded as “Give a Year, Save a Life,” the experience was advertised throughout
the Houston area and posted on over 200 college job boards across the country. A year later, in
recruiting for tutors for fourth, sixth, and ninth graders, Apollo program personnel were able to take
ownership over the process.
        Tutors were required to have a minimum of a bachelor’s degree, display a strong math
aptitude, and needed to be willing to make a full-time, ten-month commitment to the program. A
rigorous screening process was put into place in order to select tutors from thousands of applicants
for the position. Applicants’ resumes and cover letters were first screened to determine if they
would qualify for the next round. This screen focused on several key pieces of information – a
candidate’s educational background, including degrees obtained, area(s) of study, and college GPA; a
candidate’s math skills, as observed by SAT or ACT math score, where available; and a candidate’s
understanding of and dedication to the mission of the program, as displayed through the required
cover letter. Approximately 70 percent of applicants progressed to the second stage. For local

                                                 43
candidates, the second stage consisted of a full-day onsite screening session. In the morning,
candidates were asked questions about their attitudes, motivation to take the position, and
experience, and then took a math aptitude assessment. The math assessment consisted of twenty
questions covering middle and high school math concepts aligned to the Texas Essential Knowledge
and Skills (TEKS). In the afternoon, candidates participated in a mock tutorial with actual students
and then were interviewed by representatives from the individual schools. Each stage of the onsite
screening event was a decision point; that is, a candidate could be invited to continue or could be
dismissed after each round. Additionally, before qualifying for a school interview, a candidate’s
entire file was considered and candidates who had weakly passed several prior portions were not
invited to participate in a school interview.
        For non-local applicants, those who progressed past the resume screen then participated in a
phone screen based on the same set of questions used in the onsite screening event initial screen.
Those who passed this phase took the same math aptitude assessment as local candidates and then
participated in a video conference interview with school-based representatives. Non-local candidates
were unable to participate in the mock tutorial portion of the screening process.
        In order to manage the 304 tutors who worked at the twenty treatment schools during the
school year, nine full-time site coordinators were hired to oversee the daily operations of the
tutoring program at each secondary school; at the eleven elementary schools, site coordinator
responsibilities were performed by a single dedicated program manager who was supported in these
efforts by identified tutor supervisors on each campus. These site directors were personally
identified by the principals of the schools as individuals who could effectively manage the tutors
staffed to their school, as well as contribute their expertise to the daily implementation of the
tutoring curriculum.
        Tutors completed a two-week training program prior to the first day of school that was
designed by the MATCH consulting team in conjunction with district representatives. During the
first week of the training all tutors were together and topics focused on program- and district-level
information and training that was relevant to all tutors. For the second week of training, all tutors
were located on their campuses and training was led by school site coordinators according to the
scope and sequence designed by the MATCH team. During the second week, tutors were given the
opportunity to participate in whole-school staff professional development and learn the routines and
procedures specific to their assigned schools.



                                                   44
        The tutoring position was a full-time position with a base salary of $20,000 per year. Tutors
also received district benefits and were eligible for a bonus based on their own attendance and
student performance. The student performance bonus was based on a combination of student math
achievement (from state tests) and student math improvement. Tutor incentive payments ranged
from zero to just over $8,000. After the 2010-2011 school year, 178 tutors qualified for a student
performance bonus and the average payment to these individuals was $3,493. After the 2011-2012
school year, 172 tutors qualified for a student performance bonus and the average payment was
$4,350. Finally, after the 2012-2013 school year, 183 tutors qualified for a bonus and the average
payment was $3,886.
        At the eleven elementary schools, students identified as high-need received three-on-one
tutoring in math Monday through Friday. Because the school day was not extended in the
elementary schools, tutoring had to be accommodated within the normal school day. All campuses
utilized a pull-out model in which identified students were pulled from regular classroom math
instruction to attend tutorials in separate classrooms. Math blocks were extended for tutored grades
so that tutoring did not entirely supplant regular instruction. As a result, non-tutored students
worked in smaller ratios with their regular instructor. Some campuses additionally deployed tutors as
push-in support during regular classroom math instruction. All schools were required to tutor high-
need fourth grade students, and several campuses also tutored third and fifth grade students both
during and after school as scheduling allowed.
        In the 2010-2011 school year, all sixth and ninth grade students received a class period of
math tutoring every day, regardless of their previous math performance. The following year, because
results from the previous year suggested that high-dosage tutoring is even more effective for certain
at-risk students, principals and school leadership teams were given latitude to alter the tutoring
program to target this population. Six secondary schools expanded the tutoring program to seventh
and eighth or tenth and eleventh grade students who performed below grade-level in math the
previous year. Three schools maintained the original tutoring model and provided math tutoring for
all sixth and ninth grade students only. Where staffing allowed, the secondary tutoring model held to
a ratio of two-on-one.
        The tutorials were a part of the regular class schedule for students, and students attended
these tutorials in separate classrooms laid out intentionally to support the tutorial program. The all-
student pull-out model for the tutorial component was strongly recommended by the MATCH
consultants and supported by evidence from other high-performing charter schools. The

                                                   45
justification for the model was twofold: first, all students could benefit from high-dosage tutoring,
either to remediate deficiencies in students’ math skills or to provide acceleration for students
already performing at or above grade level; second, including all students in a grade in the tutorial
program was thought to remove the negative stigma often attached to pull-out tutoring programs.
         During the first week of the school year, students from strategically targeted grades and/or
groups took a diagnostic assessment based on the important math concepts for their respective
grade level. From there, site coordinators were able to appropriately pair students of similar ability
levels with similar strengths and weaknesses in order to maximize the effectiveness of the tutorials.
The tutorial curriculum was designed to accomplish two goals: to improve students’ basic skills and
automaticity; and to provide supplemental instruction and practice around key concepts for the
grade-level curriculum. To support these goals, the curriculum was split into two pieces for each
daily tutorial. The first half of all tutorial sessions focused on basic skills instruction and practice.
The second half of each tutorial addressed specific concepts tested on the state standardized test
(TAKS or STAAR). The TAKS/STAAR concepts portion of the curriculum was split into units
built around each TAKS/STAAR objective and its associated state standards. Each unit lasted
fifteen days; the first twelve days were dedicated to new instruction, students took a unit assessment
on the thirteenth day, and the last two days were devoted to re-teaching concepts that students had
not yet mastered.
         Student performance on each unit assessment was analyzed by concept for each student.
Student performance on the unit assessment was compared to performance on the diagnostic
assessment for each concept to determine student growth on each concept from the beginning of
the school year. Student growth reports were disaggregated by tutor and were shared with tutors, site
coordinators, and school leadership.


Double-Dosing Courses
         At the secondary schools, all students in non-tutored grades who were below grade level in
math or reading entering the school year took a supplemental course in the subject in which they
were below grade level.36 Supplemental curriculum packages were purchased for implementation in
these double-dosing classes. In the 2010-2011 school year, secondary schools used the Carnegie
Math program for math double-dosing and the READ 180 program for reading double-dosing. In

36Students who were below grade level in both subjects received a double-dose course in whichever subject they were
further behind.

                                                         46
response to feedback from the secondary principals, the math double-dose course was changed from
the Carnegie Math program in 2010-11to the I CAN Learn program in the middle schools and
ALEKS in the high schools, while READ 180 was once again used for the reading/language arts
double-dosing courses. At the elementary schools, READ 180 was used within the normal school
day as a supplement to regular reading instruction, particularly for high-need students. For math
double-dosing, the elementary schools used enVision, which was the district curriculum modified
for students needing intervention. Individual schools had discretion to purchase and implement
other supplemental programs as well, including Accelerated Math and Everyday Mathematics.
        The I CAN Learn program is a full-curriculum, mastery-based software platform that allows
students to work at an individualized pace and allows teachers to act as facilitators of learning. The
program assesses students frequently and provides reports to principals and teachers on a weekly
basis. Similarly, ALEKS is an online-based assessment and learning system that uses frequent
adaptive questioning to build fundamental skills and determine student knowledge and retention.
        For reading double-dosing, the READ 180 model relies on a very specific classroom
instructional model: 20 minutes of whole-group instruction, an hour of small-group rotations among
three stations (instructional software, small-group instruction, and modeled/independent reading)
for 20 minutes each, and 10 minutes of whole-group wrap-up. The program provides specific
supports for special education students and English Language Learners. The books used by students
in the modeled/independent reading station are leveled readers that allow students to read age-
appropriate subject matter at their tested Lexile level. As with I CAN Learn, students are frequently
assessed to determine their Lexile level in order to adapt instruction to fit individual needs.
        In 2010-11, delays in the contracting for the two computer software programs used in the
double-dosing courses lead to the late implementation of this part of the intervention, ranging from
October to December across the nine campuses. In 2011-12, I CAN Learn and READ 180 were
ordered and operational at the start of the school year in the secondary schools. READ 180 was not
fully implemented in the elementary schools until November, due to similar delays in procurement.
Teachers received ongoing training around the use of the programs and were provided with support
around the implementation of the program from both the external vendor and the treatment
program managers.


Data-Driven Instruction



                                                   47
        Schools individually set plans for the use of data to drive student achievement. Successful
plans were focused on two things: first, aligning the master schedule, staff development, and
summer programs to properly prepare for the upcoming school year; and second, regularly
collecting student data through common assessments and responding with intervention plans.
Principals would review student assessment data with school faculty and staff during staff
development days in August, as well as set the expectation that PLC time is dedicated to developing,
reviewing, and adjusting interventions, and to setting student goals and monitoring student progress.
Common assessments would take place every four to six weeks.
        After each assessment, principals would work with their teachers to analyze the data during
PLCs. Data analysis typically includes: performance reports disaggregated by objectives and classes;
student self-analysis, in which students use stickers or markers to document their progress on
individual objectives; item analysis to categorize strong and weak objective mastery by content area
and grade; intervention adjustments based on individual students by tier; review of student progress
towards goals; development of lessons for re-teaching during school (in small-group interventions),
after school, and during Saturday tutorials; and development of computerized lessons using double-
dosing and other instructional software programs.
        The process of data analysis was dynamic and ongoing. Exemplary school plans underscored
the importance of students being a part of the process by having them analyze their own assessment
results with a question-by-question rubric to both identify their strong and weak areas as well as to
afford them the opportunity to have input in selecting the interventions they felt were needed to
help them improve.
        Individual principals created and implemented effective plans for using student data, but the
program as a whole struggled in using data to drive student achievement through the end of the
2011-2012 school year. Only two district benchmarks were executed during each of the first two
years and principals reported that they were not well aligned with the end-of-year standards. In place
of frequent and aligned benchmark assessments, school leaders, led by their SIO, collaborated on
plans and calendars for interim assessments, but the use of these was inconsistent. The four high
schools originally established a “collaborative” to jointly create formative assessments, but it was
disbanded so that schools could make decisions better suited to their distinct student populations.
The five middle schools intended to implement the district-wide interim and benchmark
assessments, but the principals found them to be misaligned and therefore created their own
formative assessment plans. The eleven elementary schools administered Apollo benchmark

                                                  48
assessments created by the academic program team, but there was wide variance in how that data
was used to strategically regroup students.
        All schools were equipped with scanning technology to quickly enter student test data (from
benchmark and interim assessments) into Campus Online, a central database administered by HISD.
From there, teachers, instructional leaders, and principals had access to student data on each interim
assessment. The data were available in a variety of formats and could provide information on the
performance of chosen sub-populations, as well as student performance by content strand and
standard.
        The program team assisted schools with collecting the data from whichever assessments they
ultimately administered and created reports for the schools designed to identify the necessary
interventions for students and student groups. Based on these assessment results, teachers were
responsible for meeting with students one-on-one to set individual performance goals for the
subsequent benchmark and ultimately for the end-of-year TAKS and STAAR exams. School-level
group assessment results were reviewed during regular meetings with the SIOs, as well as with the
author via videoconference once the schools went on winter break in December.


Culture and Expectations
        The principal of each school played the pivotal role in setting the culture and expectations of
the school, which is why the principal selection process needed to be as rigorous as it was. In order
to best create and continue the turnaround culture of the twenty Apollo schools, however, certain
practices were implemented from the top-down for all schools.
        In meetings with their SIOs, principals set goals for their school around expectations, a no-
excuses culture, and specific targets for student achievement (e.g., percent at grade level and percent
achieving mastery status for each grade and subject). During training and professional development
before students returned to school, teachers were trained around these expectations. The first week
of school at all treatment schools was dubbed “culture camp” and was focused on establishing the
behaviors, expectations, systems, and routines necessary to ensure success in the schools. There
were certain classroom non-negotiables communicated as well, including: every classroom must have
goals posted, every student must know what her individual goals are for the year and how she is
going to achieve these goals, and every school must have visual evidence of a college-going culture.


Implementation Monitoring

                                                  49
         In order to monitor the implementation of the five strategies in the treatment program,
teams of researchers from EdLabs visited each of the twenty treatment schools four to six times
throughout the school year, with visits spaced approximately six to eight weeks apart.37 Three teams
of two visited each school, either in the morning or the afternoon; teams visited two schools per
day. Each visit consisted of classroom and tutorial observations; student, teacher, and tutor focus
groups; and a meeting to debrief with the school leadership team. Observation teams visited 10-15
classrooms on average in each half-day school visit, and spent an average of four-and-a-half-hours in
each school.
         A rubric was developed for use in classroom observations during the 2010-11 school year
and was modified for use in 2011-12 and 2012-13. This rubric was used consistently in all
observations. The data was summarized at the school level for all classrooms and was reported back
to principals and SIOs following the visit. The team conducted three separate focus groups: one
with students, one with math tutors, and one with teachers. Each focus group contained five to eight
participants and researchers used a pre-set script for these focus groups, designed to gather
information that was not easily observable in classrooms. At the end of the visit, the team met with
school leadership in order to debrief around the observations from that day’s visit. Within a week,
the principal received a brief executive summary that described the school’s strengths and areas for
improvement, as well as a dashboard containing the school summary data from all of the classroom
observations.




37In the2010-11 school year, six site visits were conducted, in October, November, December, February, March, and
April. In the 2011-12 and 2012-13 school years, five site visits were conducted, in October, November, January, March,
and April/May.

Appendix B: Variable Construction

Houston:
Attendance Rates
Recall that treatment schools opened a week earlier than other district schools, but that attendance
was not fully enforced during this week. We observe student attendance in each of six reporting
periods – three per semester. To minimize bias stemming from the early start, we restrict our
attention to absences and presences that occur after the first reporting period of the year when
calculating attendance rates for 2010-2011. Including the entire year’s attendance does not
qualitatively affect our results.


When calculating school-level attendance rates, we consider all the presences and absences for
students when they are enrolled at each school.


Economically Disadvantaged
We consider a student economically disadvantaged if he is eligible for free or reduced price lunch, or
if he satisfies one or more of the following criteria:
       Family income at or below the official federal poverty line,
       Eligible for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) or other public assistance
       Received a Pell Grant or comparable state program of need-based financial assistance
       Eligible for programs assisted under Title II of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA)
       Eligible for benefits under the Food Stamp Act of 1977.


Gifted and Talented
HISD offers two Gifted and Talented initiatives: Vanguard Magnet, which allows advanced students
to attend schools with peers of similar ability, and Vanguard Neighborhood, which provides
programming for gifted students in their local school. We consider a student gifted if he is involved
in either of these programs.


Special Education and Limited English Proficiency




                                                    51
These statuses are determined by a student’s designation in the official Houston Enrollment file;
they enter into our regressions as dummy variables. We do not consider students who have recently
transitioned out of LEP status to be of limited English proficiency.


Race/Ethnicity
We code the race variables such that the five categories – white, black, Hispanic, Asian and other –
are complete and mutually exclusive. Hispanic ethnicity is an absorbing state. Hence “white”
implies non-Hispanic white, “black” non-Hispanic black, and so on.


School-Level Controls
School-level demographics are constructed by taking the mean of all students enrolled in the school
in HISD in 2010. School-level math and reading scores are constructed by taking the mean math
and reading scores for each of the previous pre-treatment years (2008, 2009, and 2010). If students
are enrolled in a school in 2011, 2012, or 2013 that does not exist in either 2008, 2009, or 2010, they
receive a value of one on an indicator for missing that school-level control and a value of zero for
the value of the school-level control.


Teacher Value-Added
HISD officials provided us with 2009-10 and 2010-11 value-added data for 3,883 middle and
elementary school teachers. In Panel B and Panel C of Figure 1, we present calculations based on
the district-calculated Cumulative Gain Indices for five subjects: math, reading, science, social
studies, and language. We normalize these indices such that the average teacher in each subject has
score zero and the sample standard deviation is one.


Test Scores
We observe results from the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS), State of Texas
Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) and the Stanford 10. For ease of interpretation, we
normalize all scores to have mean zero and standard deviation one by grade, subject, and year.


Fifth and eighth graders must meet certain standards on their state tests to advance to the next
grade, and those who fail on their first attempt are allowed to take a retest approximately one month
later. When selecting a score for students who take the retest, we select the first score where it exists

                                                   52
and only take the retest score where the first is missing, though our results do not change if we
instead choose the retest score, the mean of the two scores, or the higher score.


Treatment
Treatment is defined as being enrolled in a treatment school in the pre-treatment year for students in
non-entry grades. For students in entry grades(6th and 9th), treatment is defined as being zoned to
attend a treatment school in the treatment year, regardless of whether or not the student actually
attended the treatment school.


Denver:
Free Lunch
We consider a dummy for whether or not the student is eligible to receive free or reduced lunch at
school. This status is designated in the official Denver enrollment file.


Limited English Proficiency
This status is determined by a student’s designation in the official Denver enrollment file; it enters
into our regression as a dummy variable. We do not consider students who have recently
transitioned out of LEP status to be of limited English proficiency. We consider the LEP status as
missing for students whose parents opt out of the program.


Race/Ethnicity
We code the race variables such that the five categories – white, black, Hispanic, Asian and other –
are complete and mutually exclusive. Hispanic ethnicity is an absorbing state. Hence “white”
implies non-Hispanic white, “black” non-Hispanic black, and so on.


Test Scores
We observe test scores from the Colorado Student Assessment Program. We normalize all test
scores to have a mean zero and standard deviation one by grade, subject, and year.


Treatment
Treatment is defined as being enrolled in a treatment school on the first day of school of the 2011-
2012 school year.

                                                   53
AUSL:
Free Lunch
We consider a dummy for whether or not the student is eligible to receive free or reduced lunch at
school. This status is designated in the Chicago enrollment file.


Race/Ethnicity
We code the race variables such that the six categories – white, black, Hispanic, Asian, multi-racial,
and other – are complete and mutually exclusive. Hispanic ethnicity is an absorbing state. Hence
“white” implies non-Hispanic white, “black” non-Hispanic black, and so on.

Special Education
 A student is considered to receive special education if he/she has any of the following disabilities:
autism, deafness, blindness, developmental delay, behavior/emotional disorder, mental handicap,
learning disability, hearing impairment, health impairment, physical handicap, speech and language
impairment, traumatic brain injury, or visual impairment. Additionally, any student deemed
handicapped under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act is also considered handicapped.


Test Scores
We observe test scores from the Illinois State Achievement Test for students in grades 3 – 8. We
use Explore, a test administered by ACT for 9th grade test scores and PLAN, a test administered by
ACT for 10th grade test scores. We normalize all test scores to have mean zero and standard
deviation one by grade, year, and subject.

Treatment
Treatment is defined as being enrolled in a school in the year before it was transitioned to AUSL,
enrolling in an AUSL school when the student first enters the district, or transitioning into a AUSL
high school from any middle school.




                                                   54
Appendix C: Return on Investment Calculations

        When considering whether to expand our intervention into other districts, it is worthwhile to
balance the benefits against the cost of the intervention. We therefore calculate a back-of-the-
envelope Internal Rate of Return (IRR) calculation based on the expected income benefits
associated with increased student achievement.
        For simplicity, we calculate the rate of return using the pooled treatment effects for math
and reading for a 14-year-old student who receives one year of treatment, enters the labor market at
age 18, and retires at age 65. Following Krueger (2003), let Et denote her real annual earnings at
time t and     denote the percentage increase in earnings resulting from a one standard deviation
increase in math or reading achievement. The IRR is the discount rate r* that sets costs equal to the
discounted stream of future benefits:

                                        ∑        (        ) (         )

where        and   denote the treatment effects for math and reading and g is the annual
rate of real wage growth.
        Krueger (2003) summarizes the literature on the relationship between test scores and income
and concludes that     lies somewhere between 8 percent and 12 percent. He also notes that real
earnings and productivity have historically grown at rates between 1 percent and 2 percent, so these
are plausible rates for g. Recall that the incremental cost of our intervention is roughly $1,837 per
student. We can approximate Et using data from the Current Population Survey. Setting = 0.08
and letting g vary between 0.01 and 0.02, we find that the IRR for our treatment in secondary
schools is between 13.04 percent and 13.54 percent.
        As tutoring is the most expensive component of the treatment, we might also consider the
return on an intervention that relied solely on the other components. Without tutoring, the cost of
treatment in secondary schools falls to $1100 per student. Using the average math treatment effect
for non-tutoring grades, we find that the IRR falls between 16.50 percent and 17.10 percent,
depending on one’s preferred value for g. The cost of the intervention for elementary schools was
considerably lower at $355 per student, and yields an IRR between 28.00 percent and 29.13 percent.


        For comparison, Curto and Fryer (2012) estimate that the IRR in “No Excuses” charter
schools is 18.50 percent assuming a growth rate of 1 percent. Similar calculations suggest that the

                                                     55
return on investment is between 7 and 10 percent for an early childhood education program
(Heckman et al. 2010) and 6.20 percent for reductions in class size (Krueger 2003).

                               in either math or reading take a supplemental computer-driven course
                               in that subject
                               -Middle school students received roughly 215 hours of
                               tutoring/double-dosing, compared to 189 hours for high school
                               students
                               -In elementary schools, tutoring was accommodated within the
                               normal school day
                               -Elementary math blocks were extended for tutored grades so that
                               tutoring did not entirely supplant regular instruction

Culture of High Expectations   -First week of school devoted to “culture camp” to foster
                               behaviors/attitudes conducive to academic success
                               -Every classroom required to post goals for the year
                               -Every student must know individual goals for the year and plan for
                               achieving them
                               -Every school required to display visual evidence of a college-going
                               culture
                               -100 percent of high school seniors are expected to gain admission to
                               at least one two- or four-year college

Data-Driven Instruction        -In addition to district benchmark assessments, treatment schools
                               created and administered comprehensive formative assessments every
                               six to eight weeks
                               -After each assessment, teachers received student-level performance
                               data and used the information to guide one-on-one goal-setting
                               conversations with students
                               -Principals also held weekly professional learning communities to
                               discuss data and make intervention plans accordingly

Notes: This table displays student-level summary statistics for various subgroups of our sample. The reported means are from the pre-treatment year
in each subsample. Columns (1) and (2) report means for students enrolled in Treatment and Control elementary schools in grades three through
five during the pre-treatment year (2010 - 2011). Column (3) contains p-values on the null hypothesis of equal means, obtained by regressing each
variable on a treatment dummy and a matched-pair fixed effect and clustering standard errors within schools. Column (4) includes all students in the
treatment sample for elementary schools in grades three through five during the 2011-12 school year. Column (5) includes students in these grades
who were not in the treatment sample. Column (6) contains p-values on the null hypothesis of equal means, obtained by regressing each variable on
a treatment dummy and a matched-pair fixed effect and clustering standard errors within schools. Column (7) includes all students in the treatment
sample for secondary schools during the 2009-2010 school year. Column (8) includes all students in these grades who were not in the treatment
sample. Column (9) reports a p-value from a test of equal means, with standard errors clustered by school. Column (10) includes all students in
columns (4) and (7). Column (11) includes students in these grades who were not in the treatment sample. Column (12) reports a p-value from a
test of equal means, with standard errors clustered by school. Test scores are standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation one by grade
and year. See the text and Appendix B for more detailed variable definitions.

Notes: This table presents estimates of the effects of attending a treatment school on state test scores: Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills
(TAKS) in 2011 and State of Texas Assesment of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in 2012 and 2013. The sample in Panel A, columns (1) and (2),
includes all students enrolled in 1 of the 16 schools that were eligible to be randomized into treatment during the pre-treatment year (2010 - 11).
In Panel A, columns (3)-(6), the sample is expanded to all HISD students enrolled in grades 2 - 5, save for students attending any of the three
non-experimentally selected treatment elementary schools in 2010-11. Panel B includes all students eligible for treatment and enrolled in grades
2 - 5 in a HISD elementary school during the 2011-12 school year and all students eligible for treatment and enrolled in a HISD middle or high
school during the 2010-11 school year. All samples are restricted to students with valid math and reading scores (valid scores only exist in grades
3 - 11) and valid baseline scores. Students are included in the sample for each year of the 2010-11, 2011-12, and 2012-13 school years for which
they have valid scores and are in a grade where they could attend the same school they attended in the first year of treatment i.e. 6th, 7th, and 8th
graders in 2010-11 will remain in the sample for all years they are still in one of those grades. Columns (1) and (2) report treatment effects using the
random assignment of treatment for inference. Column (1) reports Intent-to-Treat (ITT) estimates, with treatment assigned based on pre-treatment
enrollment. Column (2) instruments for attendance using treatment assignment. Attendance is measured as the number of years a student attended a
treatment school (maximum of 2 for elementary schools and 3 for secondary schools). Both columns (1) and (2) include a matched-pair fixed effect,
as well as the controls described below. Columns (3) through (6) estimate the four non-experimental specifications described in the text: controlled
OLS regression, two-stage least squares (2SLS), difference-in-differences (DD), and two-stage least squares difference-in-differences (2SLS-DD).
The dependent variable in the OLS and 2SLS specifications are test scores, standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation one by grade
and year. In the DD and 2SLS-DD specifications, the dependent variable is the change in scores from the pre-treatment year. All specifications
adjust for the student-level demographic variables summarized in Table 2, as well as the student’s grade. All specifications also adjust for these
demographic variables at the school level as well as mean test scores at the school level. All specifications have year fixed effects. Columns (3) and
(4) also include three prior years of test scores and their squares. Standard errors (reported in parentheses) are clustered at the school level. *, **,
and *** denote significance at the 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels, respectively.

Notes: This table presents estimates of the effects of attending a treatment school and receiving high-dosage tutoring on state test scores: Texas
Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) in 2011 and State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in 2012 and 2013. The
difference shown is the treatment effect for the tutoring group minus the treatment effect for the non tutoring group. P-values result from a test
of equal coefficients between the tutoring and non-tutoring groups. The tutoring elementary school group includes students enrolled in the fourth
grade during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 school year. The tutoring secondary school group includes students enrolled in the sixth and ninth
grades during the 2010-2011 and 2012-2013 school year. The non-tutoring group includes students enrolled in the fifth grade during the 2011-2012
and 2012-2013 school year for the elementary school sample. In the secondary school sample, the non-tutoring group includes students enrolled in
the seventh and tenth grades during the 2010-2011 and 2012-2013 school years. All specifications are described in the notes of Table 3. Standard
errors (reported in parentheses) are clustered at the school level. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels,

Notes: This table presents estimates of the effects of attending a treatment school on state test scores (Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) in 2011 and State of Texas Assessment of
Academic Readiness (STAAR) in 2012 and 2013) for various subgroups in the data. All estimates use the 2SLS-DD estimator described in the notes of Table 3. Columns (4), (7), (10), (13), (16), (20)
report p-values resulting from a test of equal coefficients between the gender, race, economic, special education, ELL, and previous year test score subgroups, respectively. The elementary school sample
and the secondary school sample are identical to the elementary school and secondary school sample in Panel B of Table 3. Standard errors (clustered at the school level) are reported in parentheses. *, **,
and *** denote significance at the 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels, respectively.

Notes: This table presents estimates of the effects of attending a treatment school on state test scores: Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills
(TAKS) in 2011 and State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in 2012 and 2013. Each column uses a different comparison
group. Column (1) includes all students in HISD. Column (2) includes all students in HISD, Dallas Independent School District, San Antonio
Independent School District, and Austin Independent School District. Columns (3) through (5) use different comparison groups that are defined
based on the school attended in the pre treatment year. For students in an entry grade (6th or 9th) at the start of treatment, the comparison groups are
assigned based on the school that the student was zoned to attend. The comparison groups are as follows: 34 comparison schools identified by the
Texas Education in column (3), schools rated Unacceptable or Acceptable based on their performance during the 2009-10 school year in column (4),
and the nine schools that HISD officials conisder the best match for each treatment secondary school in column (5). Unacceptable and Acceptable
are the two lowest ratings in the accountability campus rating system. The sample is restricted to students with valid math and reading scores and
with valid baseline scores. The samples are as the samples in Panel B of Table 3. All estimates follow the 2SLS-DD specification described in the
text and the notes of Table 3. The dependent variable is a test score, standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation one by grade and year.
Standard errors (reported in parentheses) are clustered at the school level. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence
levels, respectively.

Notes: This table presents estimates of the effects of attending a treatment school on Stanford 10 scores. The sample in Panel A, columns (1) and
(2), includes all students enrolled in 1 of the 16 elementary schools that were eligible to be randomized into treatment during the pre-treatment year.
In Panel A, columns (3)-(6), the sample is expanded to all HISD students enrolled in grades 2 - 5 in 2011-2012, save for students zoned for any of
the three non-experimentally selected elementary schools. Panel B includes all students eligible for treatment enrolled in a HISD elementary school
during the 2011-2012 school year and all students eligible for treatment enrolled in a HISD secondary school during the 2010-2011 school year. All
samples are restricted to students with valid math and reading scores (valid scores only exist in grades 3 - 11) and valid baseline scores. Students are
included in the sample for each year of the 2010-11, 2011-12, and 2012-13 school years for which they have valid scores and are in a grade where
they could attend the same school they attended in the first year of treatment i.e. 6th, 7th, and 8th graders in 2010-11 will remain in the sample for all
years they are still in one of those grades. Stanford 10 test scores are only available for high schoolers during the 2010-2011 school year. Columns
(1) and (2) report treatment effects using the random assignment of treatment for inference. Column (1) reports Intent-to-Treat (ITT) estimates,
with treatment assigned based on pre-treatment enrollment. Column (2) instruments for attendance using treatment assignment. Attendance is
measured as the number of school years in a treatment school (maximum of 2 for elementary schools and 3 for secondary schools). Both columns
(1) and (2) include a matched-pair fixed effect, as well as the controls described below. Columns (3) through (6) estimate the four non-experimental
specifications described in the text: controlled OLS regression, two-stage least squares (2SLS), difference-in-differences (DD), and two-stage least
squares difference-in-differences (2SLS-DD). The dependent variable in the OLS and 2SLS specifications are test score, standardized to have mean
zero and standard deviation one by grade and year. In the DD and 2SLS-DD specifications, the dependent variable is the change in scores from
the pre-treatment year. All specifications adjust for the student-level demographic variables summarized in Table 2, as well as the student’s grade.
All specifications adjust for these demographic variables and mean test scores at the school level. Columns (3) and (4) also include three prior
years of test scores and their squares as controls. Standard errors (reported in parentheses) are clustered at the school level. *, **, and *** denote
significance at the 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels, respectively.

            Notes: This table presents estimates of the effects of attending a treatment school on four measures of attrition. The samples are described in the
            notes of Table 3 as are the specifications and their respective controls. In Houston, students can exit our sample in one of five ways: taking a remedial
            test not on the student’s grade level, taking an advanced test not on the student’s grade level, taking the Modified TAKS or STAAR exam offered
            to students with Individualized Education Programs, taking the STAAR L exam offered to students with Limited English Proficiency or by missing
            the exam entirely. There are only 15 students in our sample who took a remedial test instead of their on grade level test, thus they are not included
            in this table. We report results for each of these outcomes separately. Columns (1), (3), (5) and (7) report the means of the pertinent comparison
            group. The treatment effects estimates in Columns (2), (4), (6) and (8) follow the ITT specification for Experimental Elementary Schools and the
            2SLS specification for the rest of the schools. Standard errors (reported in parentheses) are clustered at the school level. *, **, and *** denote
            significance at the 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels, respectively.

Notes: This table presents estimates of the effects of attending a treatment school on state test scores: Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills
(TAKS) in 2011 and State of Texas Assesment of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in 2012 and 2013. The sample in Panel A, columns (1) and (2),
includes all students enrolled in 1 of the 16 schools that were eligible to be randomized into treatment during the pre-treatment year (2010 - 11).
In Panel A, columns (3)-(6), the sample is expanded to all HISD students enrolled in grades 2 - 5, save for students attending any of the three
non-experimentally selected treatment elementary schools in 2010-11. Panel B includes all students eligible for treatment and enrolled in grades
2 - 5 in a HISD elementary school during the 2011-12 school year and all students eligible for treatment and enrolled in a HISD middle or high
school during the 2010-11 school year. All samples are restricted to students with valid math and reading scores (valid scores only exist in grades
3 - 11) and valid baseline scores. Students are included in the sample for each year of the 2010-11, 2011-12, and 2012-13 school years for which
they have valid scores and are in a grade where they could attend the same school they attended in the first year of treatment i.e. 6th, 7th, and 8th
graders in 2010-11 will remain in the sample for all years they are still in one of those grades. Notably, entering cohorts of 6th and 9th graders in
2011-12 and 2012-13 are also included in this sample. Columns (1) and (2) report treatment effects using the random assignment of treatment for
inference. Column (1) reports Intent-to-Treat (ITT) estimates, with treatment assigned based on pre-treatment enrollment. Column (2) instruments
for attendance using treatment assignment. Attendance is measured as the number of years a student attended a treatment school (maximum of 2
for elementary schools and 3 for secondary schools). Both columns (1) and (2) include a matched-pair fixed effect, as well as the controls described
below. Columns (3) through (6) estimate the four non-experimental specifications described in the text: controlled OLS regression, two-stage
least squares (2SLS), difference-in-differences (DD), and two-stage least squares difference-in-differences (2SLS-DD). The dependent variable in
the OLS and 2SLS specifications are test scores, standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation one by grade and year. In the DD and
2SLS-DD specifications, the dependent variable is the change in scores from the pre-treatment year. All specifications adjust for the student-level
demographic variables summarized in Table 2, as well as the student’s grade. All specifications also adjust for these demographic variables at the
school level as well as mean test scores at the school level. Columns (3) and (4) also include three prior years of test scores and their squares.
Standard errors (reported in parentheses) are clustered at the school level. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence
levels, respectively.

Notes: This table summarizes the results of the first stage of our instrumental variable specification. Columns (1) and (2) report the mean treatment
duration for various subsamples. In Panel A the sample is split into students enrolled in treatment and control schools in the pre-treatment year. In
Panel B the sample is split into treatment and comparison schools where treatment is defined as enrollment in a treatment shcool in the pre-treatment
year. For 6th and 9th graders in 2010-11, treatment is defined as those zoned for a treatment school. The sample in Panel A includes all students
enrolled in grades two through five during the 2011-12 school year. The sample in Panel B includes all students enrolled in grades six through
eleven during the 2010-11 school year. Throughout, averages are restricted to students for whom we observe a valid math and reading score and
valid baseline score in math and reading. The samples are as described in the footnotes of Table 3. Column (3) reports the F-statistic from regressing
treatment duration on a dummy for treatment. and a full set of covariates. The associated p-value is reported in parenthesis. *, **, and *** denote
significance at the 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels, respectively.

Notes: This table reproduces treatment effects for an alternate set of treatment schools in the 2008-09 school year (during which no schools received
treatment). More specifically, we consider as treatment schools the 5 lowest-performing middle schools and the 4 lowest-performing high schools
in 2007-08 with at least 300 students. The sample includes all students enrolled in sixth through eleventh grades during the 2008 - 2009 school year.
All specifications adjust for the student-level demographic variables summarized in Table 2, as well as the student’s grade. These specifications also
adjust for demographic variables at the school level. OLS and 2SLS estimates also include three years of previous test scores and their squares as
covariates. Standard errors (reported in parentheses) are clustered at the school level. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 90%, 95%, and 99%

Notes: This table presents estimates of the effects of attending a treatment school on state test scores: Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills
(TAKS) in 2011 and State of Texas Assesment of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in 2012 and 2013. The sample in Panel A, columns (1) and (2),
includes all students enrolled in 1 of the 16 schools that were eligible to be randomized into treatment during the pre-treatment year (2010 - 11).
In Panel A, columns (3)-(6), the sample is expanded to all HISD students enrolled in grades 2 - 5, save for students attending any of the three non-
experimentally selected treatment elementary schools in 2010-11. Panel B includes all students eligible for treatment and enrolled in grades 2 - 5 in
a HISD elementary school during the 2011-12 school year. All samples are restricted to students with valid math and reading scores (valid scores
only exist in grades 3 - 11) and valid baseline scores. Students are included in the sample for each year of the 2011-12, and 2012-13 school years
for which they have valid scores and are in a grade where they could attend the same school they attended in the first year of treatment. Columns (1)
and (2) report treatment effects using the random assignment of treatment for inference. Column (1) reports Intent-to-Treat (ITT) estimates, with
treatment assigned based on pre-treatment enrollment. Column (2) instruments for attendance using treatment assignment. Attendance is measured
as the number of years a student attended a treatment school (maximum of 2 for elementary schools and 3 for secondary schools). Both columns
(1) and (2) include a matched-pair fixed effect, as well as the controls described below. Columns (3) through (6) estimate the four non-experimental
specifications described in the text: controlled OLS regression, two-stage least squares (2SLS), difference-in-differences (DD), and two-stage least
squares difference-in-differences (2SLS-DD). The dependent variable in the OLS and 2SLS specifications are test scores, standardized to have mean
zero and standard deviation one by grade and year. In the DD and 2SLS-DD specifications, the dependent variable is the change in scores from the
pre-treatment year. All specifications adjust for the student-level demographic variables summarized in Table 2, as well as the student’s grade. All
specifications also adjust for these demographic variables at the school level as well as mean test scores at the school level. Columns (3) and (4)
also include three prior years of test scores and their squares. Standard errors (reported in parentheses) are clustered at the school level. *, **, and
*** denote significance at the 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels, respectively.

Notes: This table presents the estimates of being a treatment school on the school-level average test score on the state standardized test for that year:
Texas Asssment of Knowledge and Skills in 2011 or State of Texas Assesment of Academic Readiness in 2012 and 2013. The specifications in
this table are OLS regression and difference-in-differences regression. These specifications are described in the text. The dependent variable is the
school level average test scores in OLS and the difference in school level average test score from the previous year in DD. All specifications adjust
for school-level demographics. The OLS regression also controls for three years of previous test score school averages. Standard errors (reported
in parentheses) are clustered at the school level. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels, repsectively.

Notes: This table presents estimates of the effects of attending a treatment school on state test scores: Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills
(TAKS) in 2011 and State of Texas Assesment of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in 2012 and 2013. The sample includes all HISD students who
were enrolled in sixth or ninth grade during the 2010-11 school year. All specifications are described in the notes of Table 3. To account for possible
non-random selection into sixth and ninth grades, the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth rows weight sixth and ninth grade students so that these
classes resemble the grade above on observable characteristics. Weights are estimated via probit on the sample of students who begin the 2010-11
school year enrolled in a treatment school, using our full set of student level demographics and test scores as predictors. The weights are calculated
as the inverse of the resulting predicted probabilities. Standard errors (reported in parentheses) are clustered at the school level. *, **, and ***
denote significance at the 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels, respectively.

Notes: This table displays student-level summary statistics for various subgroups of our Denver sample. Column (1) reports means for students
enrolled in a treatment school at the beginning of the 2011-12 school year. Column (2) reports means for all other students in the Far Northeast
Region who are enrolled in third, fourth, fifth, sixth or ninth grade (the only non-empty tested grades in the treatment sample). Column (4) includes
all students in the same grades enrolled in any non-treatment school. Columns (3) and (5) contains p-values on the null hypothesis of equal means,
obtained by regressing each variable on a treatment dummy and clustering standard errors within schools. Test scores are standardized to have mean
zero and standard deviation one by grade and year. See the text and variable appendix for more detailed variable definitions.
