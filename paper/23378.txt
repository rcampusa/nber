                                         ABSTRACT


Developing countries made considerable gains during the first decade of the 21st century. Their
economies grew at unprecedented rates, resulting in large reductions in extreme poverty and a
significant expansion of the middle class. But more recently that progress has slowed with an
economic environment of lackluster global trade, not enough jobs coupled with skills
mismatches, continued globalization and technological change, greater income inequality,
unprecedented population aging in richer countries, and youth bulges in the poorer ones. This
essay examines how seven key countries fared from 1990-2010 in their development quest. The
sample includes seven developing countries—Botswana, Ghana, Nigeria, Zambia, India, Vietnam
and Brazil —all of which experienced rapid growth in recent years, but for different reasons. The
patterns of growth are analyzed in each of these countries using a unifying framework which
draws a distinction between the “structural transformation” and “fundamentals” challenge in
growth. Out of these seven countries, the traditional path to rapid growth of export oriented
industrialization only played a significant role in Vietnam.

Introduction
   The first decade of the 21st century was extraordinarily good for developing countries and
their mostly poor citizens. Their economies expanded at unprecedented rates, resulting in both a
large reduction in extreme poverty and a significant expansion of the middle class. In fact, their
growth rates were an average 4 percentage points faster than those of the advanced countries—
versus only 1.3 percentage points in the 1990s (Figure O.1a). This growth was led by the efforts
of China, India, and a small number of other Asian countries, and assisted by the weaker
economic performance of the rich countries. Latin America and Africa resumed growth as well,
catching up with—and often surpassing—the growth rates they experienced during the 1950s
and 1960s. As a result, the developing countries moved more quickly to close the income gap
with the advanced countries (Figure O.1b), a process known as economic convergence. More
recently, however, that process has slowed down—reflecting a narrowing of the advanced and
developing country growth rate differentials since 2010—making it unlikely that poorer
countries will be able to close the development gap with richer countries any- time soon.

   What are the growth prospects for developing countries? Two traditions for examining and
explaining growth exist side by side within economics. The first has its roots in development
economics and is based on the dual-economy approach (initially formalized by Lewis 1954 and
expanded upon by Ranis and Fei 1961). It draws a sharp distinction between the traditional (agri
culture) and modern (industry) sectors of the economy, and it assumes that different economic
logics are at work within them—and therefore the two sectors cannot be lumped together.
Accumulation, innovation, and productivity growth all take place in the modern sector—often in
unexplained ways— while the traditional sector remains technologically backward and stagnant.
Thus, economywide growth depends largely on the rate at which resources— principally labor—
can migrate from the traditional to the modern sector.

    The second tradition has its roots in macroeconomics, and derives from the neoclassical
growth model of Solow (1956). It eschews such distinctions and presumes different types of
economic activity are structurally similar enough to be aggregated into a single representative
sector. In neoclassical models, growth depends on the incentives to save, accumulate physical
and human capital, and (in subsequent variants that endogenize technological change) innovate
by developing new products and processes (Grossman and Helpman 1991; Aghion and Howitt
1992).

    These traditions offer complementary perspectives on economic growth. One way to combine
their insights is to think of the neoclassical model as essentially focusing on the growth process
within modern sectors, while the dual-economy model focuses on relationships and flows among
sectors. As such, each perspective provides a distinct reason why growth in the lagging countries
should be not just feasible, but also easy and rapid. In the dual- economy world, growth is just a
matter of moving traditional farmers into modern industries in urban areas where productivity is
on a positive trajectory. In the neoclassical world, physical and human capital levels in
developing countries are low, and thus returns to accumulation should be high. Either way,
economic convergence with rich nations should be the norm rather than the exception.

    As it turns out, however, those predictions have not been borne out.

    Nevertheless, their failure informs us about the obstacles that need to be over- come if
economic development is to happen. Using these two sets of models to guide us, we can identify
two broad development challenges:

•        The “structural transformation” challenge: How to ensure that resources flow rapidly to
the modern economic activities that operate at higher levels of economic productivity.

•        The “ fundamentals” challenge: How to accumulate the skills and broad institutional
capabilities needed to generate sustained productivity growth, not just in a few modern
industrial sectors but also across the entire range of services and other nontradable activities.
There is considerable debate about whether it is primarily the quality of institutions (governance,
rules of law, and the business environment) or the level of human capital (education, skills, and
training) that drives long-run levels of income (see Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2001



                                                  4
versus Glaeser et al. 2004). But for our purposes, we can just lump them under the rubric of
“fundamentals.”

   The critical question is the relationship between these two challenges, especially in Africa,
which, until recently, has been largely absent from any work on structural change (Box O.1). A
major reason for this absence has been largely unreliable or nonexistent economic data for most
African countries. A deeper reason is poverty itself. Until recently, few African countries have
enjoyed the sustained economic growth needed to trace the patterns of structural transformation
achieved in earlier decades elsewhere. However, since the beginning of this century, African
countries have grown at an unprecedented pace and in unusual ways, making them especially
interesting for such research.

   This book speaks directly to our lack of information about structural change and growth in
developing countries. It includes four African countries—

   Botswana, Ghana, Nigeria, and Zambia—all of which have experienced rapid growth in
recent years, but for different reasons. They are also interesting because it does not appear that
the process of structural change in any of these countries is following the standard patterns that
we are familiar with from the historical literature or from widely used models of structural

   change. These case studies may thus shed light on both the processes that are unfolding at
present and some of the barriers that remain. We also include two fast-growing Asian countries
that appear to be following different paths: India and Vietnam. Finally, we include Brazil
because of its position as a “postindustrial” developing country.

   The authors of these chapters try to answer how much of the growth in labor productivity
during given time periods can be attributed to the “within- sector” versus the “structural change”
component, paying particular attention to the structural transformation challenge (drawing on the
methodology in McMillan and Rodrik 2011). While the starting year for each country differs
depending on data availability, all of the studies cover the period 1990–2010. Moreover, the
authors painstakingly piece together data to paint a detailed account of structural change for
subperiods and sectors.




                                                  5
   From these chapters, we learn that the experience with structural change has been quite
diverse around the world. In particular:

   •     Structural change played only a tiny role in the recent growth performance of the middle-
income countries of Brazil and Botswana, although it did play an important role in launching
them into middle-income status.

   •     Structural change contributed significantly to growth in Vietnam and Ghana over the past
two decades, although their experiences have been quite different—with Vietnam undergoing
much more industrialization than Ghana, where the formal manufacturing sector is still relatively
small.

   •     Structural change contributed to growth in India, Nigeria, and Zambia, but it is not the
kind of structural change that China and Vietnam enjoyed. Rather, the three countries have seen
a less rapid decline in the employment share of low-productivity agriculture, exacerbated by the
lack of a boom in labor-intensive manufacturing for export.

   In short, the policy requirements of rapid structural change do not seem to align neatly with
conventional recommendations of the “fundamentals” type. Despite significant improvements in
policy regimes in Africa—macroeconomic stabilization, external opening, democratization—the
rate and direction of structural transformation have been disappointing in this region. And in
Latin America, although privatization and liberalization may have contributed to within-sector
productivity growth, they seem to have done so at the expense of economywide productivity. In
countries with significant unexploited potential for structural change, there are large payoffs for
taking imaginative shortcuts (such as investment zones or competitive currencies) that target the
development of new industries directly. In other cases, policies must remain focused on long-run
fundamentals—institutions and human capital.




                                                  6
Box O.1 An eclectic spin on the two traditions
From a theoretical perspective, within-sector productivity growth and structural change go
hand in hand, but there is disagreement as to where the process of growth originates. For
example, Schultz (1953) argued that in a closed-economy setting, advances in agricultural
productivity are a pre- condition for growth. This view featured prominently in several later
pieces, including work by Johnston and Mellor (1961), Johnston and Kilby (1975), and Timmer
(1988). More recently, the role of agriculture has featured prominently in work by
noneconomists, such as Jared Diamond (1997).

   In stark contrast to Schultz (1953), Sir Arthur Lewis (1954) argued that the low marginal
productivity of farm labor would persist until nonfarm employment expanded enough to
absorb rural population growth. Moreover, industrialization could mechanically raise
agricultural productivity by reducing the size of the labor force in agriculture without
affecting output. Subsequent work also challenged the link between agricultural productivity
growth and structural change by using open- rather than closed-economy models (for
example, Mokyr 1976; Field 1978; Wright 1979; Matsuyama 1992). Rather than focusing on
international trade, a third strand of the literature began to emphasize the “special” properties
of industry—such as increasing returns, learning by doing, and coordination failures—and
called for a “big push” type of industrial policy (for example, Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny
1989).

   More recent work on structural change has typically focused on documenting the stylized
facts of structural change, estimating the contribution of structural change to economywide
productivity growth, and developing multi- sector growth models consistent with the stylized
facts of structural change. This work was recently reviewed in an excellent and extensive piece
on growth and structural change by Herrendorf, Rogerson, and Valentinyi (2013).

   From the perspective of our book, the most important conclusion they reach is probably the
fact that economists have a substantial amount of data regarding the process of structural
transformation in today’s advanced economies, but we know little about this process in today’s
developing economies. To what extent are they following different paths from today’s developed
economies? And if so, what factors give rise to these differences? Specifically, Herrendorf,
Rogerson, and Valentinyi (2013) call for more quantitative studies on structural transformation in
today’s poor economies—a topic that our book tries to shed light on. They also emphasize the
importance of two issues that they did not examine in their review piece. The first is human capital
and its role in determining both within- and across-sector productivity growth. The second is
market failures and the role for government—notably, the extent to which externalities, public
goods, market power, or other factors associated with inefficient equilibrium outcomes—shape
the process of structural change.

  A Unifying Framework

  To place these results in perspective, we begin this overview with an overall unifying
framework for thinking about growth (drawing on Rodrik 2013a). We drew above a distinction
between the “structural transformation” and “fundamentals” challenges in growth—the first
focusing on moving resources into modern industries, and the second on developing broad
capabilities. At first sight, these two challenges may seem one and the same, too closely linked to
be separable. Much of the development literature operates on the assumption that policy that is
good on one front is also good on the other. For example, investing in human capital and
improving the legal regime should be good for boosting overall productivity, as well as
promoting industrial expansion.

  Deregulating industrial restrictions and international trade should be good for developing the
economy as a whole, as well as fostering entry into new economic activities. What is desirable
policy for growth need not differ based on whether we look at growth from the perspective of
facilitating structural transformation or building fundamentals.

  While there is substantial overlap between the two sets of policies, it is also clear that the two
challenges have somewhat different strategic implications. In practice, it may be far easier to
promote industrialization directly, by subsidizing industry in diverse ways or removing specific
obstacles to it, than to promote it indirectly by making broad investments in human capital and
institutions and hoping that these will trickle down to investment incentives in industry. It is
possible to have rapid structural transformation (in other words, industrialization) without
significant improvements in fundamentals. East Asia is the premier example of this strategy. In
China, governance and human capital have lagged significantly behind the country’s
manufacturing prowess. Vietnam is a similar case, following on China’s footsteps with some lag.

  It is also possible to invest significantly in fundamentals without reaping much reward in
terms of structural transformation. Since the early 1990s, Latin America has considerably
improved its governance and macroeconomic fundamentals, yet structural change in the region
has been, if anything, growth reducing. Manufacturing and some other modern sectors have lost
employment to lower-productivity services and informal activities (McMillan and Rodrik 2011).




                                                  8
   We can visualize these possibilities in Figure O.2, which depicts a typology of growth
patterns and outcomes. It shows that structural transformation can fuel rapid growth on its own,
but if it is not backed up by fundamentals, growth peters out and remains episodic (quadrant 2).
On the other hand, the accumulation of fundamentals, which requires costly, time-consuming,
and complementary investments across the entire economy, only produces steady but slow
growth if it is not backed up by structural change (quadrant 3). The bottom line is that,
ultimately, sustained growth and convergence require both processes (quadrant 4). Even in the
best of all worlds, structural transformation will eventually run its course and industrialization
will reach its limits.

   From that point on, growth must depend on the steady accumulation of fundamentals
emphasized by neoclassical growth theory. Long-term successes, such as Britain, Germany, and
the United States, have all gone through these phases, as have more recent examples, such as
Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, China. If doubts remain about China’s economic future, it is
because so much of the country’s institutional transformation, particularly with respect to
political institutions, still remains ahead of it.

   This typology helps clarify one of the puzzling aspects of cross-national data: institutional
quality and human capital are both highly correlated with income levels, yet improvements in
institutions and human capital are not a reliable predictor of economic growth. It suggests that
this empirical finding is not a contradiction. Only countries that steadily enhance their
fundamental capabilities eventually become rich. But investment in fundamentals is not the
quickest or easiest way of getting there, at least during the early stages of development. Early on,
it is rapid industrialization that fuels growth, and this requires policies that may differ
considerably from conventional fundamentals. Countries that rely exclusively on building up
broad-based capabilities are rewarded with modest growth, and may in fact be diverted from
those policies as a result (Rodrik 2013a).

   We will use this typology to interpret the experiences of our country examples. None of them
can be said to have made it definitively to the nirvana of quadrant (4). Botswana has high
fundamentals but limited structural change, while Vietnam has relatively rapid structural change
but relatively low fundamentals. Our other African examples (Ghana, Nigeria, and Zambia)
typically have had episodic growth-promoting structural change at best, moving back and forth
between quadrants (1) and (2), although Ghana has recently moved into quadrant (3). Brazil has
moved from quadrant (2) to quadrant (3), with greatly improved fundamentals but much weaker
growth underpinned by slow structural change. India meanwhile has not experienced the kind of
structural change that import-substituting countries (such as Brazil in the 1950s–1970s) or the
East Asian exporters (such as Vietnam) have gone through, so its growth prospects remain
brittle.




                                                     10
  Country Studies: Methodology

  In an effort to retain consistency across country studies, all of the country chapters use the
same methodology as McMillan and Rodrik (2011). This approach is not intended to resolve
questions about causality; rather, it is intended to lay out a set of facts that we hope will help
policy makers better understand their economies and allow future researchers to develop better
theories of growth and structural change.

  The decomposition used in our paper follows Haltiwanger (1997) and Foster, Haltiwanger,
and Krizan (2001), who used this decomposition to explore the contributions of the reallocation
of activity across plants and plant productivity growth to overall productivity growth in the US
manufacturing sector. Instead, we use this decomposition to establish the contributions of the
reallocation of activity across broad sectors of the economy and sectoral productivity growth to
economywide productivity growth.

  There is no doubt that studying productivity at the sector level necessarily masks the
underlying heterogeneity of productivity within sectors. However, focusing solely on
heterogeneity within one particular sector ignores the economywide implications of sector-
specific changes in productivity. For example, numerous studies have shown that intensified
import competition has forced manufacturing industries across the globe to become more
efficient by rationalizing their operations. Typically, the least productive firms have exited
manufacturing, while the remaining firms have shed “excess labor.” It is evident that the top tier
of firms has closed the gap with the technology frontier in Latin America and Africa, no less than
in East Asia.

  However, the question left unanswered by these studies concerns what happens to the workers
who are thereby displaced. In economies that do not exhibit large intersectoral productivity gaps
or high and persistent unemployment, labor displacement would not have important implications
for economywide productivity. In developing economies, on the other hand, the prospect that the
displaced workers would end up in even lower-productivity activities (services, informality)
cannot be ruled out. That is, indeed, what seems to have typically happened in Latin America.
An important advantage of the broad, economywide approach taken in this volume is that the




                                                  11
authors are able to capture changes in intersectoral allocative efficiency, as well as improvements
in within-industry productivity.

   In this framework, total labor productivity is given by:

                             𝑛𝑛

                    𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 = � 𝜃𝜃 i,t 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡                                              (1)
                            𝑖𝑖=1



where Pt is total labor productivity in year t, θi,t denotes the proportion of total labor employed in
sector i at time t, and pi,t denotes labor productivity in sector i at time t; where i = 1, …, 9. Then, the
change in total labor productivity between t and t– k (ΔPt) can be written as:

                              𝑛𝑛                    𝑛𝑛                𝑛𝑛

                   ∆𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 = � 𝜃𝜃 i,t-k ∆ 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 + � ∆𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + � ∆ 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 ∆𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡   (2)
                             𝑖𝑖=1                  𝑖𝑖=1             𝑖𝑖=1



   Whereas the first term on the right-hand side (RHS) captures within-sector productivity
changes, the second term on the RHS captures between-sector productivity changes, and the
third term on the RHS captures cross-sector productivity changes. In essence, the cross term is a
covariance term that captures the effects on overall productivity of simultaneous changes in
sectoral employment and productivity. For the purposes of this book, we combine the second and
third terms into what we call the “structural change” term. Some authors, such as de Vries,
Timmer, and de Vries (2015), estimate these terms separately, calling them the static and
dynamic components of structural change. We find this confusing for two reasons. First,
structural change by definition is a dynamic concept. And second, the third term alone is difficult
to interpret when, for example, reductions in the employment share are accompanied by
increases in productivity. This is because the term becomes negative, seemingly acting as a drag
on productivity, when in fact it could be viewed as a positive development in such sectors as
agriculture.




                                                          12
  By combining the second and third terms in equation (2), we arrive at the equation used by
McMillan and Rodrik (2011) and by all of the country authors of this book:

                ∆𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 = ∑𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖=1 𝜃𝜃 i,t-k ∆ 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 + ∑𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖=1 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡   (3)


where Pt and pi,t refer to economywide and sectoral labor productivity levels, respectively, and
θi,t is the share of employment in sector i at time t. The Δ operator denotes the change in
productivity or employment shares between t – k and t. The implication of this decomposition is
that economywide labor productivity growth can be achieved in one of two ways.

  The first term—the “within-sector” component—captures how much of overall labor
productivity growth can be attributed to changes within sec- tors. It is the weighted sum of
productivity growth within individual sectors, where the weights are the employment share of
each sector at the beginning of the time period. The second term—the “structural change”
component— captures how much of overall labor productivity growth can be attributed to
movements of workers across sectors. It is essentially the inner product of productivity levels (at
the end of the time period) with the change in employment shares across sectors. When changes
in employment shares are positively correlated with productivity levels, this term will be
positive, and structural change will increase economywide productivity growth.

  This decomposition clarifies how partial analyses of productivity performance within
individual sectors (such as manufacturing or agriculture) can be misleading when there are large
differences in labor productivities (pi,t) across economic activities. In particular, a high rate of
productivity growth within an industry can have quite ambiguous implications for overall
economic performance if the industry’s share of employment shrinks rather than expands. For
example, if the displaced labor ends up in activities with lower productivity, economywide
growth will suffer and may even turn negative.

  Armed with the results of the decomposition, the authors of each of the chapters then use a
variety of strategies to gain a deeper understanding of the country-specific factors that played a
role in facilitating (or impeding) structural change. For example, in Chapter 1 of this book, Mitra
and Ahsan use state-level data on employment shares by industry, tariffs, education, and labor
regulations to explore the correlates of structural change across states in India.


                                                                13
   Country Studies: Data and Measurement Issues

   Here, too, in an effort to maintain consistency, all of the country studies use national accounts
data and labor force statistics to compute measures of sectoral employment and value-added for
nine broad sectors of the economy.

   The authors also draw on several complementary datasets to conduct more detailed analyses
of the underlying correlates of structural change and within- sector productivity growth.
Country-specific data appendixes appear at the end of each of the country chapters. These
appendixes document the sources of data, as well as any inconsistencies in the data and how
these were handled. Nevertheless, several measurement issues common to all of the studies war-
rant clarification.

   Informality. A big question with national output and employment data in developing
countries is how well they account for the informal sector. The coverage of the informal sector in
national accounts data varies from country to country (Timmer and de Vries 2009). While all
countries make an effort to track the informal sector, obviously the quality of the data can vary
greatly. In contrast, employment shares are more likely to include the informal sector, because
they are typically obtained from nationally representative household surveys (labor force surveys
or population censuses). A failure to account for activity in the informal sector will lead to an
underestimate of value-added in activities that are heavily dominated by informality, such as
agriculture.

   Multiple jobs. In labor force surveys, workers are typically classified by their primary sector
of employment. A potential concern with this classification is for individuals classified as
“agricultural” but who work a substantial fraction of their hours in nonagricultural activities
(Haggblade, Hazell, and Reardon 2007), as this would lead to an underestimate of labor
productivity in agriculture. Gollin, Lagakos, and Waugh (2014) use Living Standards
Measurement Study data for several developing countries to estimate labor productivity using
hours worked; Adeyinka, Salau, and Vollrath do the same in Chapter 6 of this book on Nigeria.
They find that the overwhelming majority of individuals classified as working in agriculture do
in fact allocate almost all of their time to agriculture. Gollin, Lagakos, and Waugh (2014) also


                                                 14
find that a significant portion of individuals in rural households is classified as working in
nonagricultural activities.

  Accounting for human capital. If human capital differs significantly across sectors, using
the number of workers unadjusted for differences in human capital can be misleading. For
example, if most of the labor in agriculture is unskilled and most of the labor in services is
skilled, simple measures of productivity will understate labor productivity in agriculture and
overstate labor productivity in services. One way to account for this is to adjust employment
numbers for educational attainment, which is what Gollin, Lagakos, and Waugh (2014) do for
their sample of countries (in the poorest countries, human capital is on average 1.4 times higher
in the nonagriculture sector than in the agriculture sector). However, even after making this
adjustment, they still arrive at the conclusion that average labor productivity in agriculture is
significantly lower than average labor productivity in other economic sectors.

  Average versus marginal productivity. The country authors of this book compare gaps in
sectoral productivities using measures of average labor productivity, as is done in McMillan and
Rodrik (2011) and Gollin, Lagakos, and Waugh (2014). It is well known that efficiency in well-
functioning markets is characterized by an equalization of productivities at the margin. Under a
Cobb-Douglas production function specification, the marginal productivity of labor is the
average productivity of labor multiplied by the labor share. Thus, if labor shares differ greatly
across sectors, comparing average labor productivities can be misleading. However, the existing
evidence suggests that labor shares do not vary widely across sectors, except in a few activities
(like public utilities) that typically do not absorb lots of labor (Mundlak, Butzer, and Larson
2012; Gollin, Lagakos, and Waugh 2014).

  Quality of African statistics. Recently, concerns about the quality of Africa’s national
accounts data have been raised by a number of researchers, including Devarajan (2013) and
Jerven and Johnston (2015). Like them, we think that the quality of national accounts data is
intimately linked to Africa’s growth and prosperity. Over the past decade or so, as growth in
gross domestic product (GDP) has picked up in Africa, there has been a renewed focus on the
quality of data—even leading to a rebasing of national accounts data for some countries. This is
important, because of the rapid growth in small business activity that had previously been
unrecorded. As a result, economies that did rebase saw significant gains in GDP per capita. In


                                                 15
view of these issues, the authors of this book’s African chapters have tried to collect data from a
wide range of sources and to account for inconsistencies. For example, in the case of Botswana,
the authors consider two scenarios for structural change in recent years, depending on
assumptions about the share of the labor force in agriculture.

   Failure to distinguish location. Most agriculture takes place in rural areas, and most
manufacturing and services take place in urban areas. Given the higher costs of living in urban
areas (particularly high cash rents), urban wages must typically exceed rural wages simply
because of higher living costs. Thus, comparing nominal urban service and industrial wages with
nominal rural farm wage rates inevitably leads to higher urban prices and wages. A more
appropriate and purely sectoral comparison would involve comparing farm with rural nonfarm
earnings or urban agriculture with urban unskilled manufacturing and service sector wage rates.
We would guess that rental costs alone would require a 20 percent higher wage in urban areas,
simply to maintain a standard of living comparable with rural areas.

   In summary, while all of the measurement issues discussed above are important, we think that
there is adequate evidence to support the approach taken by the authors of the country studies in
this book. Adjusting average productivities for measurement error may diminish the labor
productivity gaps uncovered, but it is highly unlikely that it would overturn any of the results.

   Country Studies: Findings

   Significant Structural Changes, Different Outcomes: Vietnam and Ghana

   On the surface, Ghana and Vietnam appear to have much in common: big pools of labor in
agriculture that over time move primarily into services, rather than manufacturing. But a closer
look reveals how different their paths have been and, thus, why Vietnam is further along in its
economic convergence.

   In the late 1990s, Vietnam still had 70 percent of its workforce in agriculture, producing a
third of the country’s GDP. This discrepancy between agriculture’s claim on the economy’s
resources and its contribution to out- put reflected the large differential in labor productivity
across activities.




                                                  16
   The typical worker in manufacturing produced four times more output than the typical worker
in agriculture. The typical worker in services such as construction or wholesale and retail trade
produced even a bigger multiple than this. But over the next two decades, workers moved from
lower- to higher-productivity activities (Figure O.3). In Chapter 2 of this book, McCaig and
Pavcnik tell us that agriculture’s employment share declined to 54 percent, while services’ share
rose from 18 percent to 32 percent, and manufacturing’s share rose from 8 percent to 14 percent.
During the 2000s, jobs in manufacturing grew at an annual rate greater than 10 percent, with the
rate exceeding 15 percent in garments and reaching 30 percent in office and computing
machines. The growth was particularly rapid in the




Southeast and Red River Delta, which entered the world economy on the back of export-oriented
industrialization.

   Vietnam’s structural transformation came alongside two other import- ant shifts that were
closely linked: (1) a transition from state-owned firms to private employment; and (2) a
transition from family farms and businesses to formal, registered firms (particularly in


                                                17
manufacturing). These shifts contributed directly to productivity growth within sectors, but also
enabled reallocation of factors of production across sectors. As a result, GDP per capita tripled in
real terms over two decades, and poverty fell sharply, although McCaig and Pavcnik caution that
large productivity gaps still exist both among and within sectors. Between 1990 and 2008, the
growth in aggregate labor productivity was 5.1 percent per year, with structural change
accounting for 38 percent of this increase and within-sector growth accounting for the rest.

  In examining a case like Vietnam’s—a clear-cut development success enabled greatly by
structural transformation—ex post explanations are easy to come by. The country started with a
large pool of “excess” labor in the country- side. The unexploited productivity gains from
moving people from the farm to urban employment were huge. Relaxing the grip of state
regulations and state- owned enterprises could unleash these hidden sources of productivity. In
Vietnam this meant abolishing collective farms and replacing them with house- hold farms,
titling land, liberalizing internal and external trade, and introducing competition and private
businesses. Opening the country up to the world economy—through special economic zones and
liberalization of investment rules— brought in foreign investment and technology, rendering
modern sectors even more competitive. Encouraging exports enabled the expansion of
manufacturing enterprises without running into market-size constraints.

  Now consider Ghana, a country that has also done reasonably well in the 1990s and 2000s,
certainly by African standards. In Chapter 4 of this book, Osei and Jedwab tell us that following
a sharp decline in the 1970s, Ghana’s real GDP per capita picked up from the mid-1980s on,
with labor productivity registering annual growth of 3 percent between 1992 and 2010. Keep in
mind this is only 60 percent of Vietnam’s growth rate over the same period. While structural
change appears to have contributed roughly half of the increase over this period—after
contributing close to zero before then—a closer look indicates that the impact was highly uneven
across subperiods (in fact, it was negative during 2000–2006).

  While agricultural employment did decrease—dropping from 60 percent in 1980 to about 40
percent in 2010—the labor that was released was absorbed mostly by low-productivity services,
with limited impact on economywide productivity (Figure O.4). Moreover, the bulk of
manufacturing took place in the informal sector, where productivity is more than 20 times lower
than in the formal sector. Despite the apparent potential, industrialization has so far played a


                                                 18
much more modest role in Ghana than in Vietnam. But to the extent it has played a role, Osei
and Jedwab contend that “it has occurred without a green revolution, industrial revolution, or
service revolution of the types seen, for example, in Asia.” In our eyes, this assessment is rather
troubling, in that a lack of these types of revolutions would inhibit the potential for progress on
the structural change front. Keep in mind, as the authors point out, “there are still enormous
hurdles on the socioeconomic front, with troubling levels of poverty, unemployment, and
underemployment—especially for youths, and income inequality.”

  Why the difference between the two countries? It is tempting to ascribe Vietnam’s superior
performance to its government’s liberalization policies




and other efforts to remove obstacles facing private business. For example, in Chapter 2 McCaig
and Pavcnik note that Vietnam was ranked 99th out of 185 countries in 2013 in the World
Bank’s “Doing Business” indicators, “slightly behind China, ranked 91st, and ahead of such
countries as Indonesia and Bangladesh.” Yet Ghana ranks 27 countries ahead of Vietnam, in 64th
place. According to the indicators, it was considerably easier to get credit in Ghana than in
Vietnam, paying taxes was less of a hassle, insolvency was much more quickly resolved, and


                                                 19
access to electricity was less problematic. In terms of how well investors are protected, there is a
whop- ping 40-point difference between the two countries, in favor of Ghana.

  Other cross-national indexes tell a similar story. The Cato Institute’s Index of Economic
Freedom, which attempts to quantify the extent to which economies are free of government
encumbrance, ranks Vietnam in 96th place, compared with 71st place for Ghana (Gwartney,
Lawson, and Hall 2012). (This is for 2010, which is the latest year for which data are available.)
A reasonable objection to these comparisons would be that what matters is more the change than
the level of an index. Economic progress may be more a function of how much policies have
“improved” than where they stand at the end of the relevant period. But here too, it is hard to
make the case that Vietnam looks better than Ghana. Both countries have undertaken significant
reforms since the 1980s, opening up their economies to trade, reducing the role of the
government, and deregulating. Ghana’s summary rating on the Cato Index steadily rose (on a
scale from 0 to 10) from 3.05 in 1980, to 5.53 in 1995, to 7.09 in 2010. Unfortunately, Cato does
not provide a comparable series for Vietnam over the full period, so a direct comparison is not
possible. But in light of the scale of improvement in Ghana’s rating, it is difficult to imagine that
Vietnam could have done much better. (To get a relative sense of these ratings, note that the
United States had a rating of 7.70 in 2010.)

  None of this is to deny the possibility that Vietnam’s government does indeed provide a more
hospitable environment than Ghana for private business, both by nurturing new economic
activities and by removing obstacles that existing ones face. The point is that the way such an
environment is constructed is subtler than what is captured by standard indexes and conventional
types of policy advice. Although economic liberalization and removal of red tape may foster
private investment, the comparison with Ghana suggests it would be a mistake to describe
Vietnam’s strategy in those terms—or those terms alone. Of course, a similar argument could be
made for many other East Asian success stories as well.

  Vietnam’s spectacular growth is also likely to be partly driven by a strong commitment to
improving the fundamentals. Vietnam outshines Ghana on all standard measures of education
and infrastructure. Its investment rate is 35 percent, while Ghana’s is only 25 percent. Industrial
policy in Vietnam appears to be focused on increasing exports in all sectors. At the start of the
reforms in the late 1980s, Vietnam was a net importer of rice, and agricultural exports were


                                                 20
paltry. Today, it is the second-largest exporter of rice, and the country has become a major player
in the international coffee market. In fact, Vietnam runs a sizable trade deficit in manufactured
goods, which is covered by agricultural and oil exports. Thus, while it is true that productivity
growth has been the highest in export-oriented manufacturing, it would be incorrect to attribute
all or even most of Vietnam’s success to its success in manufacturing. Rather, the deeper reason
for Vietnam’s success in manufacturing is likely to be the same reason for its success in other
export- oriented sectors.

     Typology placement: Vietnam seems to have reaped the growth benefits of
     rapid structural change, even though its institutional indicators are comparatively
     poor and have not improved as much. In other words, Vietnam has been in quadrant
     (2) of Figure O.2 since the early 1990s. Ghana, on the other hand, has seen
     significant improvements in governance, and yet its comparatively poor record with
     structural change has kept it in quadrant (3) with lower growth. By the same token,
     Vietnam’s continued growth and migration into quadrant (4) are by no means
     ensured, given the weakness of many of its fundamentals.


Limited Structural Change, Enormous Potential: India, Nigeria, and Zambia

  India, Nigeria, and Zambia provide an interesting contrast. On paper, these countries have the
makings of industrial success stories, with their large endowments of relatively unskilled labor
still in rural areas and their enormous domestic markets. Yet all three have underperformed
remarkably on this dimension, and it is clear that all of them would benefit greatly from greater
attention to the fundamentals.

  Over the past 50 years, as we learn from Ahsan and Mitra in Chapter 1, agriculture’s share of
employment in India has fallen by roughly 20 percentage points—from about 70 percent in 1960,
to 60 percent in 2004, to 50 percent in 2011—with the sector now contributing about 15 percent
of GDP, sharply down from around 40 percent in 1960. However, manufacturing’s labor share
has barely changed over this time period, from 10 percent in 1960 to 12 percent today, with the
GDP share unchanged at 13 percent. To put these numbers in perspective, Vietnam was able to
achieve more than double this rate of industrialization in less than half the time. For India, the
biggest labor movement has been into services (up from 18 percent in 1960 to 28 percent in
2011), with the GDP share rising to nearly 60 percent (up sharply from just below 40 percent in
1960).


                                                    21
  Structural change did make a positive contribution to growth in India after the 1990s,
especially during the first decade after the 1991 reforms. But the biggest part of that came from
the expansion of finance, insurance, and other business services, with manufacturing actually
shrinking and making a negative contribution during 2000–2004 (Figure O.5a). Information
technology and business process outsourcing services, on which India’s recent growth has relied,
are no doubt high-productivity activities with convergence dynamics that may be even stronger
than in manufacturing. But they are also highly skill-intensive sectors, unable to absorb the vast
majority of the Indian workforce that remains poorly educated. As a consequence, India’s
underlying growth trend is suppressed by the necessarily slow accumulation of fundamental
capabilities—education, infrastructure, and governance—in the economy as a whole.

  Moreover, Ahsan and Mitra report that while manufacturing was the leading contributor to
within-sector productivity growth in 2000–2004 (Figure O.5b), it fell in terms of its employment
share during these years (even though its labor productivity was higher than the economywide
aver- age). Thus, they stress the need for overhauling restrictive labor regulations, “especially
because the future potential of agriculture and services in generating overall growth is limited
(beyond a point) at India’s stage in the development process.”

  At the state level, the authors find that two of the fastest-growing states between 1998 and
2004 followed strikingly different growth paths. For Gujarat, all of the growth came from within-
sector change; in fact, structural change was slightly negative, unlike the rest of the states, which
enjoyed some positive structural change (Figure O.6). In contrast, in Maharashtra, the within-
sector and structural change components were about the same. The only state that experienced
negative within-sector change was Assam.

  The story in Nigeria is not that different. In Chapter 5, Adeyinka, Salau, and Vollrath show
that between 1996 and 2009 (not including petroleum), the share of employment in agriculture
fell only slightly, from 66 percent




                                                 22
23
  to a little more than 60 percent (still the dominant sector at 40 percent of GDP), while the
share of employment in manufacturing increased by a meager 2.2 percentage points to 4.1
percent (accounting for only about 10 percent of GDP). Over this same period, average annual
productivity growth was 4.5 percent for the nonpetroleum economy, but the lion’s share of this
growth (3.5 percent) was accounted for by within-sector productivity improvements. If
petroleum (oil and gas)—which employs less than 1 percent of the labor force but accounts for
20–30 percent of GDP—is included, productivity rose less but structural change played a bigger
role (Table O.1). The authors suggest that productivity gains could have been as much as 54
percent greater had structural change been greater. They see the key levers for this to occur as (1)
stimulating agricultural production, (2) liberalizing trade policies, (3) upgrading infrastructure,
and (4) improving human capital.

  A worrying feature of the Nigerian economy is that productivity growth in manufacturing
between 1996 and 2009 was actually negative relative to agriculture. The reasons for this are




                                                 24
unclear. One explanation may be that people entering the manufacturing workforce are in the
informal sector, as in Ghana and several other African countries. Another explanation

   may have to do with Nigeria’s low levels of fundamentals (such as infrastructure and human
capital). However, to explain negative productivity growth, these conditions would have had to
deteriorate. In addition, large productivity gains were made in wholesale and retail trade,
transportation and communications, agriculture, and general services. This is puzzling, because it
is not obvious why fundamentals would matter more for manufacturing than for other sectors.
That said, Nigeria’s record on this front is inexcusable.

   In 2010, only half of Nigeria’s population was literate, life expectancy was 51 years, only 15
percent of the roads were paved, electric power consumption was only 135 kilowatt-hours per
capita, and investment stood at only 17 percent of GDP.

   As for Zambia—a country that reclaimed its “middle-income” status in the 2000s thanks to
rapid growth—the story is one of extremely uneven structural change. In Chapter 6, Resnick and
Thurlow find that structural change was an overall drag on economic growth in Zambia between
1991 and 2010, as labor productivity grew by only 0.31 percent. But if that period is divided into
two subperiods, a more nuanced picture emerges. Between 1991 and 2001, there was a mass
exodus out of urban areas as copper mines and other parastatals shut down during a phase of
privatization, with the share of employment in agriculture (the sector with the lowest
productivity) actually increasing (Table O.2).

  But starting in 2002, the share of employment in agriculture began to fall, with services
absorbing most of the workers who left the farm. Although the services sector is dominated by
small-scale informal activity, its activities are still more productive than subsistence agriculture.
Mining staged an impressive recovery, but only accounted for 1 percent of the new jobs created.
And manufacturing not only failed to rally, but actually continued its decline. In the end,
structural change and within-sector growth each accounted for around half of the 3.56 percent
increase in labor productivity between 2002 and 2010. However, Resnick and Thurlow
emphasize that the renewed growth and positive structural change have not translated into social
transformation—a reality that has been reflected “in the country’s shifting political landscape,”
and one that they contend can be seen playing out elsewhere in Africa, even in countries without
large-scale mineral resources.

  With more than half of the population engaged in low-productivity agriculture, structural
change could play a significant role in Zambia’s growth going forward. But it may well be that to
realize this potential, Zambia must first invest more in its fundamentals. Gross fixed capital
formation as a share of GDP was only 22 percent in 2010, and physical and human
infrastructures are still comparatively low.




                                                                              26
     Typology placement: India, Nigeria, and Zambia have not had the full
     benefit of quadrant (2), and India in particular has hovered not too far from
     quadrant (1). For all of them, investing in the fundamentals is now critical.


No Structural Change in Recent Years: Botswana and Brazil

  Unlike the rest of the countries featured in this book, Botswana and Brazil have been middle-
income countries for some time. Structural change played a significant role in catapulting these
countries into middle-income status, but its role has been more muted in the past two decades.
Their stories, though, are quite different.

  In Brazil, structural change was rapid from the 1950s through the 1970s (especially in the
1950s and early 1960s), accounting for 40 percent of total labor productivity growth during this
period (Figure O.7). As agricultural employment shrank, manufacturing jobs expanded slightly,
and modern service activities—the most productive sector—absorbed the bulk of the labor. By
the late 1970s, industries as a whole accounted for close to 40 percent of total labor productivity
growth. This period of high-growth, rapid structural change was one




in which policies of import substitution predominated. (It goes without saying that such policies
are anomalous from the perspective of the World Bank’s Doing Business database and Cato


                                                     27
Institute’s Economic Freedom indicators [World Bank, various years; Gwartney, Lawson, and
Hall 2012]).

  But in Chapter 7, Firpo and Pieri argue that by the late 1970s, the country had run out of room
for continuous and long-term structural change, at least along broad intersectoral lines, and had
to rely on within-sector enhancements—like investing in human capital and new technologies (in
agriculture especially) and improving institutions. In fact, they assert that efforts aimed at
reversing this natural trend (by enlarging manufacturing and contracting agriculture) failed “and
the early years of the 1980s of slow growth can serve as evidence of those efforts.”

  So what path remains open for Brazil today? The authors argue that the Brazilian experience
suggests a return to the old policies is likely to fail. They believe horizontal, across-the-board
policies are more likely to spur productivity within sectors than selective policies that give
priority to some sectors over others. Given where Brazil stands in term of its stage of
development, it is reasonable to expect that future growth will have to rely predominantly on
investment in fundamentals (institutions and human capital), and that broad patterns of structural
change will play a comparatively small role. In particular, it will be difficult for Brazil to
reindustrialize. But there are still strategic opportunities that could be exploited by a nimble
government. If used well, the country’s deep-water oil reserves should boost not only oil exports
but also a range of associated services and industries at home.

  As for Botswana, its story is similar to Brazil’s, in that the share of employment in agriculture
fell dramatically between 1970 and 1990. But unlike Brazil, the decline in agriculture’s share of
employment was almost entirely matched by an increase in the share of the labor force in
services. Moreover, numerous government efforts to industrialize never succeeded (perhaps not
surprising for a small landlocked country). The authors of Chapter 3—McCaig, McMillan,
Verduzco-Gallo, and Jefferis—point to two distinct periods in Botswana’s economic evolution.
Between 1970 and 1989, they find that labor productivity grew at an average of 8 percent per
year, with structural change playing a major role in this spectacular growth, especially in the
1970s (Figure O.8). But in the decades that followed, labor productivity slowed to 1.9 percent
per year, driven entirely by within-sector productivity growth—with structural change an actual
drag on growth in the 2000s.




                                                  28
   Historically, diamonds played a significant role in fueling Botswana’s economic growth,
although this has changed in recent years. Between 1968 and 2010, economic activity shifted out
of agriculture, first to mining and later to




services. In 2010, diamonds made up only 17.7 percent of value-added and a mere 1.5 percent of
total employment. In contrast, the share of services in value-added reached 64.4 percent, while
the share of services in employment reached 50.6 percent. Although the share of employment in
agriculture remains high at 38.6 percent, its share in value-added has dropped from 27.4 percent
to 2.7 percent—an indication of agriculture’s abysmal performance in Botswana.

   An interesting feature of both Brazil’s and Botswana’s economies is that trade liberalization in
the early 1990s did not have a major impact on the structure of either economy, although it did
give a sharp boost to within-sector productivity. This limited impact on the structural front is
especially surprising in Brazil, where manufacturing has been central to the economy. Also
unlike Brazil, Botswana does not have the same potential in agriculture, as most of the land
inhabited by farmers is semi-arid and prone to drought. For both of these countries, growth is
more likely to come from improvements in fundamentals that facilitate within-sector
productivity growth.

     Typology placement: The expectation was that Brazil would move from
     quadrant (1) to quadrant (4); but the country instead ended up in quadrant (3),
     with much-improved fundamentals, but also sharply reduced growth. Botswana
     is similarly stuck in quadrant (3), with slow growth and relatively strong
     fundamentals, although unlike Brazil, it has never industrialized.



The Verdict on Structural Change versus Within-Sector Productivity Growth

  So what do these findings on individual countries add up to in terms of broad trends in
structural change? We believe this book provides a worthwhile insight in that, although we are
only examining seven country studies, these countries together represent about 22 percent of
developing country GDP and 30 percent of developing country population. Moreover, within
their respective regions, some of these countries matter greatly—like Nigeria (19 percent of
Sub-Saharan Africa’s GDP and 19 percent of the region’s population), India (82 percent of South
Asia’s GDP and 75 percent of the region’s population), and Brazil (35 percent of Latin America
and the Caribbean’s GDP and 34 percent of the region’s population).

  Overall, our country sample shows that the past two decades have seen extraordinary growth
and rapid catch-up convergence in developing countries— underpinned by increases in labor
productivity—although the patterns of within-sector versus structural change increases vary
widely (Table O.3).

  Nonetheless, a few themes emerge at the regional level.

  Africa. Labor productivity rose in all four countries during the 2000s, with the second half of
the period characterized by a resurgence of structural change as a driver of productivity growth
in Nigeria and Zambia, and to a lesser extent in Ghana. Botswana, the only upper-middle-income
country in the African sample, resembles a Latin America country in the sense that most of the
productivity stems from within-sector growth rather than from structural change. These results
are consistent with McMillan and Harttgen (2014), who show that structural change was growth
enhancing in Africa post-2000.

  Asia. In this region, India and Vietnam represent stark contrasts in terms of what has driven
labor productivity increases. In Vietnam, structural change has been a strong driver throughout



                                                      30
the period. However, in India, most of the productivity growth has come from within-sector
productivity. In fact, the contribution of structural change decreased in the 2000s from the 1990s,
down from 1.3 percent to 0.3 percent—a definite worrying sign for a country that still has a large
portion of the population working in the agriculture sector.

  Latin America. Brazil exemplifies an upper-middle-income country that has already
undergone a deep structural transformation, moving a large share of workers from agriculture to
manufacturing by the end of the 20th century. Over the past two decades, however, the country
has strongly relied on within-sector productivity change—in fact, gains in structural change are
minimal.

The “Double Whammy” of Manufacturing

  Like India, African countries seem to be bypassing the industrialization stage that was so
important to Brazil’s and Vietnam’s rapid growth. In fact, the share of employment in African
manufacturing is still only roughly half the share in Asian manufacturing (McMillan 2013).
Instead, to the extent that structural change is taking place, it is primarily fueled by an expansion
in services. To understand the ramifications of this pattern, it is important to understand the role
that manufacturing has played in the past.

  A manufacturing-based growth strategy has two distinct advantages. First, a great deal of
manufacturing is labor intensive, so it can absorb large amounts of relatively unskilled workers
from other sectors at a substantial productivity premium. It is comparatively easy to turn a rice
farmer into a garment factory worker, without significant investment in human capital and with
manageable investment in physical capital. And the industrialization process can go on for quite
some time—several decades—during which income and productivity levels converge with those
of rich countries.

  Second, manufacturing—specifically, formal manufacturing—exhibits a remarkable property
known as “unconditional convergence.” That is, it takes place regardless of the quality of
domestic policies or institutions and other aspects of economic context, such as geography and
infrastructure (Rodrik 2013b). For developing countries, where lagging manufacturing sectors
are the norm, labor productivity tends to catch up with the productivity of developed countries,
where technologies are the most advanced as if on an automatic escalator, at a rate of 2–3 percent
per year. The greater the distance from the productivity frontier, the faster the rate of
productivity growth. Of course, the better the environment, the more rapid the convergence—
that is, conditional convergence is even more rapid (Rodrik 2013b).

  Unconditional convergence can be visualized in Figure O.9, which maps the relationship
between initial labor productivity in manufacturing industries for 21 countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa (including Ghana) and their growth rates in the subsequent decade. The negative slope of
the scatter plot captures the essence of unconditional convergence. The trend is as unmistakable
in Africa as it is elsewhere. Perhaps this outcome is not surprising, given that these industries
produce tradable goods and can be rapidly integrated into global production networks,



                                                  33
facilitating technology transfer and absorption. Even when they produce just for the home
market, these industries operate under a competitive threat from efficient suppliers from abroad,
requiring them to upgrade their operations and remain efficient.




Prospects for Economic Convergence

  Against this backdrop, where should developing countries be focusing their energies to
jumpstart economic convergence? The possible paths include reviving industrialization, focusing
on natural resources and nontraditional agricultural products, and raising productivity in services.

Revive Industrialization?

  The classic path of rapid catch-up through industrialization played out well in East Asia, as
well as in Latin America and certain other countries, such as Turkey, during their earlier, import-
substituting phase. But there are a variety of reasons to think this path will figure much less
prominently in the future:




                                                 34
  •    Many African countries are starting out with a much better endowment of natural
resources and are not as well positioned for specialization in manufacturing.

  •    The success of East Asian economies—China and its successors, such as Vietnam and
Cambodia—poses significant competitive challenges to newcomers in manufacturing, especially
in light of globalization and the reduced barriers to trade virtually everywhere.

   •   New trade rules—local content requirements, subsidies, import restrictions— limit to a
much greater extent than previously the room for industrial policies, which Asian countries have
deployed with some success.

  •    The economic difficulties of the advanced countries make them more resistant to
significant surges of manufactured imports from low-cost sources.

  •    Technological changes in manufacturing itself have made the sector much more capital
and skill intensive than in the past, reducing both the advantage of poor economies in
manufacturing and the scope for labor absorption into the sector.

  •    The prospect of climate change and the greater awareness of the associated risks call for
green technologies that are more environmentally friendly but also are more costly for
developing nations.

  Nevertheless, one can deploy counterarguments. First, diversification into manufacturing can
sometimes be facilitated by the presence of natural resources; Ethiopia, for example, can deploy
its high-quality livestock to turn itself into an exporter of designer shoes. Second, Chinese
manufacturers are now looking for low-cost suppliers themselves, not the least in Africa. Third,
even if the world economy stagnates, there are sizable domestic (Nigeria) and regional markets
in Africa. There are glimmers of hope in all of these directions in the data—but they remain
glimmers for the time being.

  It is also true, as Baldwin (2011) has emphasized, that the spread of global supply chains—
what he calls “globalization’s second unbundling”—has facilitated the spread of industry from
the advanced countries to the periphery.




                                                 35
  New entrants do not have to build entire supply chains (from intermediate inputs to final
products) at home; they can simply join existing global supply chains by producing a narrow
range of components. Even so, industrialization remains limited and fleeting, even when a
country can succeed in plugging into global supply chains.

  Taken together, these trends imply that even the most successful countries of the future are
likely to fall far short of the industrialization levels that have been the norm in economic history.
The available data indicate that deindustrialization is now beginning to happen at lower levels of
income. Manufacturing’s share of employment peaked at above 30 percent in the United
Kingdom and Germany, and at around 25 percent in Japan and South Korea. But in China,
manufacturing employment rose to slightly less than 15 percent in the mid- 1990s before it
started to fall gradually. Vietnam, Cambodia, and other smaller countries will likely not surpass
such levels. The apparent failure of African countries to industrialize to date and the
deindustrialization of Latin America have to be seen against such a global context. The
industrialization-led growth model may have run its course. The question is, what will take its
place?

Focus on Natural Resources and Nontraditional Agriculture?

  Natural resource booms can fuel growth, but resource sectors that exhibit high labor
productivity—such as oil and diamonds—tend to be capital intensive and absorb few workers.
Continued growth in a resource-based economy is dependent on rapid and sustained productivity
increases in the resource sector, new discoveries, or a steady rise in world market prices. And
even if one or more of these fortuitous circumstances materialize, the pat- tern of growth tends to
become skewed. Growth benefits the state or a rentier class, spawns inequality and distributive
politics, and proves generally detrimental to institutional development. Resource-based growth
tends to produce spurts of growth, followed by stagnation or decline. Take the case of Ghana,
where manufacturing expanded little while investment and growth were concentrated in the
resource sector—a trend that was exacerbated after the discovery of oil in 2008. Aside from oil,
Ghana’s main exports are gold, cocoa beans, timber products, and other natural resources.
Vietnam, meanwhile, is a major exporter of textiles and garments. In 2012, manufacturing’s
share of merchandise exports stood at 65 percent in Vietnam, but only 9 percent in Ghana
(having actually come down from a peak of 25 percent in 2009).


                                                 36
  As for nontraditional agricultural products—horticulture, aquaculture, floriculture, and so
on—they could well act as an intermediate stepping stone out of traditional farm products, but
here, too, the record with labor absorption is not encouraging. We do not have any examples of
countries that have successfully developed through diversification in agriculture. Typically,
agricultural transformation represents the early stage of a growth takeoff. If not followed by
rapid industrialization, growth peters out.

  Moreover, given the inexorable trends in urbanization, the bulk of the new jobs has to be
created in urban rather than rural areas. So it is hard to think of an agriculture-led path as
anything other than a bridge to a more sustain- able urban-based strategy.

Raise Productivity in Services?

  Tradable services can substitute to some extent for manufacturing, but the evidence to date on
that has not been encouraging either. The reality is that an expansion of services is not
necessarily a bad thing for structural transformation and growth, as long as the economy has
been able to build up human capital and accumulate fundamental capabilities that transform
those services into high-productivity activities (like finance and business services). However,
this typically happens rather late in the development process, after industrialization runs its
course, and high-productivity (tradable) segments of services cannot absorb as much labor. As
for labor-intensive tradable services (like tourism), they have typically spawned few links to the
rest of the economy and have not produced much diversification.

  One prominent exception is the success of Hong Kong. Its structural transformation picture
looks just like that in Vietnam, except that the roles of agriculture and manufacturing are
reversed (Figure O.10). In Hong Kong, it is manufacturing that has rapidly shrunk since 1990,
releasing more than 20 percent of the economy’s labor force to other sectors. The displaced labor
found employment in services (wholesale and retail trade, finance, insurance and business
services, and so on), but at even higher levels of productivity. So deindustrialization was growth
promoting. The difference with other countries is that Hong Kong first achieved significant
levels of industrialization




                                                  37
before deindustrializing—and then used the intervening period to strengthen its human capital
base and other fundamental capabilities.

  In principle, then, structural transformation can play a potent positive role both during the
early stages of development when there is “excess supply of labor” in agriculture and informal
economic activities, and during later stages when capabilities have accumulated and modern
services have caught up with and surpassed industrial activities. But neither outcome is ensured.
Structural change is frequently slow, and often goes in the wrong direction. And the
correspondence between market liberalization and structural change is weak, at best.

Tempering Expectations

  All of this suggests that we should not be surprised if broad patterns of inter- sectoral
structural change play a more muted role in the future. Development will have to happen the
hard way for the most part, through the steady accumulation of skills and human capital and
improvements in governance and institutions. In terms of the central growth-decomposition


                                                38
equation used in McMillan and Rodrik (2011) and the chapters that follow, growth will come
mainly from the within-sector components of productivity change, rather than from structural
change (Box O.2).

  A corollary is that rapid growth of the type experienced in South Korea, Taiwan, China,
China, Vietnam, and other East Asian cases will be out of reach for most developing countries. It
has proved significantly more complicated and time consuming to upgrade a country’s health
system, tertiary education, or judiciary—to name just a few examples of nontradable sectors—to
first- world standards than to ride the wave of global competitiveness in a narrow, but expanding,
range of standardized manufacturing industries. Automatic escalators may be rare in
nonmanufacturing parts of the economy.

  One reason is that improving human capital and institutions entails a wide range of reforms
and investments that are highly context specific and complementary to each other. Context
specificity implies that off-the-shelf imported blueprints are not useful. Local experimentation
and expertise are needed to get systems to cohere and work well. Complementarity means
investments on a broad front are required for any of them to pay off. Together, these imply an S-
shaped relationship between fundamentals and growth—investments in human capital and
institutions produce at best moderate growth until they (and income) accumulate and reach a
certain threshold (Rodrik 2013a). The downside of this mode of growth is that it can easily
produce reform fatigue.

 Box O.2 Putting the focus on the “fundamentals”
 In all of our country studies, a frequent refrain is the need to improve “within- sector”
 productivity. Here, we try to illustrate the range of policies needed with current
 examples from our sample countries. These policies can be grouped into four key
 areas.

 Political economy. In Zambia, where structural change has not translated into
 economic transformation, a major problem has been a lack of macro- economic
 stability and persistent policy volatility—like currency swings and periodic trade
 bans on maize exports and wheat imports, which deter investment in agriculture and
 other sectors. In Botswana, some of the constraints are as much political economy as
 technical ones. Building

 up the industrial sector involves issues of political capture, and making more land
 available for business touches on issues of land markets and even immigration.

 Labor regulations. In India, labor regulations appear to be a major impediment to
 employment growth in manufacturing. But in a democratic country such as India,
 changing these laws may take a long time—which is worrisome, given that the future
 potential of agriculture and services in generating overall growth is limited (beyond a
 point) at India’s stage in the development process.

 Institutions and education. In Vietnam, which continues to feature large productivity
 gaps within and across sectors, it is vital to remove distortions (like improving access
 to land and capital) to help workers transition out of agriculture and to further enhance
 agricultural productivity. In Brazil, policies that raise overall labor productivity—like
 improving educational quality—are likely to have a deeper impact on growth than
 those that are strictly con- cerned with deepening an unfinished structural change.

 Infrastructure. In Nigeria, the employment share in low-productivity agriculture is
 still quite high, indicating a potential for rapid structural change. But the country’s
 levels of human capital and infrastructure are still abysmal, making a rapid exodus out
 of agriculture unlikely in the near future. In Ghana, which needs to diversify away from
 natural resource exports, a key focus is making the manufacturing sector more
 competitive. High nonlabor costs could be reduced by investing in roads, the power
 supply, and the regulatory framework. Although the business environment has improved
 greatly over the past 20 years, a lot remains to be done for Ghana to be as competitive
 as Mauritius or South Africa.

Growth payoffs will appear as disappointing, despite substantial efforts at reform.

  The bottom line is that the balance of forces going forward appears less favorable to rapid
structural change than has been the case during the past six decades. We may well need to
moderate the optimism that the recent experience of high growth across the developing world has
spawned.
