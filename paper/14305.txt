                                              ABSTRACT

Based on the recent trade models of the Heterogeneous Firms Trade (HFT) model and the Quality
Heterogeneous Firms Trade (QHFT) model, we classify export goods (at the HS 6-digit level of disaggregation)
by quality and price competition. We find a high proportions of quality-competition goods for the
major EU countries and lower proportions for Canada, Australia and China. However, the overlap
of these quality-competition goods is not large, which suggests that characteristics of export goods
are substantially different across countries at the same HS 6-digit code.

        Based on the recent trade models of the Heterogeneous Firms Trade (HFT) model and the

        6-digit level of disaggregation) by quality and price competition. We find a high

        proportions for Canada, Australia and China. However, the overlap of these
        quality-competition goods is not large, which suggests that characteristics of export
        goods are substantially different across countries at the same HS 6-digit code.

Key words: Quality vs Price competition, heterogeneous firms trade model.
JEL Classification: F14
1. INTRODUCTION
Recent work on the theory and empirics of firm heterogeneity and trade provides new and wide
ranging insights. In the mainstay model in this ‘new new trade theory’ – the heterogeneous firms
trade model of Melitz (2003) – competitiveness of a firm’s product depends upon price; the cheapest
goods are the most competitive. A minor twist on this model (which was foreshadowed by a footnote
in Melitz 2003) turns the standard heterogeneous firms trade (HFT) model into the quality
heterogeneous firms trade (QHFT) model where competitiveness depends upon the quality-adjusted
price. If consumers care enough about quality, the highest priced goods are the most competitive, so
the association between observed price and competitiveness is reversed, i.e. firms with the lowest
observed prices are the least competitive.1
A simple empirical prediction separates the HFT and QHFT models in trade data. Since trade costs
rise with distance of the market, the HFT model predicts that products with the lowest price get sold
in the most distant markets while the opposite holds in the QHFT, i.e. the highest priced goods travel
the furthest. These diametrically opposed implications provide the foundation of a test of the models
by Baldwin and Harrigan (2006), BH henceforth; that paper, however, pools across all categories of
US exports thus implicitly assuming that all US exports are characterised either by a falling
price-distant link (HFT) or by a rising price-distant link (QHFT).
Our paper follows up on the BH by estimating the price-distance relationship separately for each
product using panel data. Our paper’s main value-added is to establish a list of three types of
products. Those where competition appears to be based on price, those where it is based on quality,
and those that cannot be confidently placed in either category. Specifically we use export data for
nine large exporting nations at the HS 6-digit2 level of disaggregation. Our key findings are:

    In the text below, the terms ‘HS 6-digit’ and ‘HS6’ are used interchangeably.

1) Of the HS 6-digit codes that can be clearly classified as quality or price competition, 50 to 60% of
HS 6-digit codes exports of large European nations can be classified as ‘quality goods’, while only 30
to 40% of US and Japanese exports fall into this category.
We believe that the difference may lie in pervasive trade in parts and components stemming from US
and Japanese companies’ offshoring strategies that means nearby customers (the offshored factories)
are a different type of buyers than the far away customers (arm’s length purchasers).
2) For commodity exporters like Canada and Australia, the fraction of quality goods is much lower,
only 15-25%. The share of quality goods in China’s exports also fall in this range.
We believe that this fits in with our priories that nations with a comparative advantage in raw
materials should systematically see a lower incidence of quality-type goods in their export mix.
Literature
One of the pioneering articles on the empirical front to use price as a proxy for quality is Schott
(2004). It has documented a large difference in product prices within the most disaggregated level of
product classification. Schott (2008) shows that the US consumers pay less for “Made in China” than
for “Made in OECD” for similar goods. Fontagné, Gaulier, and Zignago (2008), analysing unit prices
of HS 6-digit products of 200 countries, finds that the developed countries’ products are not directly
competing with the developing countries’ products. Especially, because of their products’ superior
quality, EU countries have less direct competition with the developing countries than Japan or the US
does. These findings have important policy relevance. It suggests that developed countries can
maintain their competitiveness by climbing up the quality ladders within the existing industries rather
than moving to a new industry. But which goods are quality goods? We, consumers, also know that
some goods are not competing in qualities but in prices. Commodity goods and raw materials are
mostly competing in prices. Thus, it is interesting and useful for policy purposes to sort out products
by the degree of quality or price competition.

Plan of paper
Section 2 briefly reviews the theory that structures our empirical exercise. Section 3 explains the data,
estimation equation and results. The final section concludes.
2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
To structure our empirical analysis, we briefly summarize the price competition and quality
competition versions of the heterogeneous firms trade model, highlighting two simple empirically
testable predictions of these models.
The classic HFT model (Melitz 2003) can be thought of as the Dixit-Stiglitz monopolistic
competition trade model where firms have randomly drawn marginal cost functions and face iceberg
trade costs as well as a fixed cost of establishing a ‘beachhead’ in each market. As usual, the
Dixit-Stiglitz structure links the value of sales directly to operating profits, so the beachhead cost
means that only sufficiently competitive firms export. Moreover, distance-linked iceberg trade costs
imply that a firm’s competitiveness is diminished in more distant markets, so export status displays a
distance-marginal cost gradient. The threshold degree of competitiveness necessary to sell in markets
rises with the market’s distance, so average competitiveness of firms servicing a particular market
rises with distance.
The HFT and QHFT models differ only in their determinants of competitiveness. In HFT, price is the
sole basis of competition, i.e. market entry thresholds can be written in terms of a maximum price. In
QHFT, competitiveness depends upon quality-adjusted price, so market-entry thresholds are defined
in terms of quality-adjusted price. In the standard version of the model, the lower quality-adjusted
prices (unobserved) are associated with higher unadjusted (observed) prices. In other words, firms
only export the most expensive goods to the most distant markets.

                                                   2
The BH test of this prediction found that the QHFT provided a better explanation of the US export
data for 2005. That finding, however, pools across all US exports, thus implicitly assuming that all
US exports are marked either by quality competition or by price competition.
In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that some goods may fit HFT predictions while others fit the
QHFT predictions. The hope is that we can identify a set of products which are – for a number of
major exporting nations – characterised by either HFT or QHFT.


3. DATA, EMPIRICAL MODEL AND RESULTS
Taking the distance-price prediction to the data requires some care in handling the theoretical
predictions. Suppose we had the true product-level data, i.e. data on the prices and sales by particular
firms of particular products in particular destination markets. If the baseline model is true,
Dixit-Stiglitz mark-up pricing would imply that the producer price, i.e. FOB price, for each variety
would be insensitive to distance. The point is that the distance-price-gradient prediction stems from
product/firm selection, not from firms’ pricing behaviour.
However, if we work with publicly available trade data, where the finest disaggregation available for
all nations is HS 6-digit for all nations (HS 9-digit or HS 10-digit for some nations) then distance will
have a selection effect. We should find that the average export price rises (QHFT) or falls (HFT) due
to an unobserved shift in the bilateral composition of varieties/firms.
For example HS6 category 854449 comprises “Other electric conductors for a voltage less than or
equal to 80 volts”. Inside this category will be some high priced varieties and some low priced
varieties (they coexist in both models due to product differentiation). The empirical lever comes from
the way the nation-specific price mix changes with distance of the market. If QHFT is correct,
Germany’s HS 854449 export basket to France will have more low priced varieties than its export
basket to the US. Empirically, this will show up as a lower unit value index for Germany’s HS 854449
exports to France. If the HFT model is correct, we should observe the opposite.
We conduct the analysis at the HS 6-digit level because this is the most disaggregated internationally
harmonised classification code. Thus if our classification is to prove useful for a broad range of
nations, it must be at the HS 6-digit level. Below, we report some sensitivity analysis at the HS 9-digit
level for Japan.
3.1. Empirical model and results
The empirical model we employ is akin to BH. The main differences lie in our use of log-linear
distance (instead of distance bands) and our panel dimension.
BH uses a panel for US exports of different products to different destinations but for a single year.
Our panel data looks at a given origin nation’s exports of a given HS6 product to all the destination
countries over a ten years period (1997-2006). For example, as is shown below, 4,845 HS 6-digit lines
have at least 20 observations for the whole period. We run 4,845 regressions for the US. We do the
same for the other 8 exporters. In total, we estimate approximately 40,000 regressions.
The regression equation is:
                  pt ,d = β 0 + β1 log(DISTd ) + β 2 log(GDPt ,d ) + β 3 log(GDPCAPt ,d ) + β 4 D + ε t ,d
                                                                                            ~

where pt ,d is the log of the FOB unit value index to destination country d at time t, DISTd is the
bilateral distance from the exporter under study and destination country d, and GDPt ,d is the
destination-country GDP at time t ; GDPCAPt ,d is the corresponding GDP per capita. D is a
vector of year dummies. ε t , d is an iid error.

3.2. Data
The export data we use is for 9 exporters (the world’s top 8 exporters plus Australia) for 1997 to 2006.
These are taken from the UN COMTRADE database. The distance data are from CEPII; the GDP and
population data are from the World Development Indicators of the World Bank.
For the nine exporting nations we work with, Table 1 shows the world export rank and the number of
HS 6-digit lines with at least 20 observations.

3.3. Results
Table 2 summarises the results.3 The first column shows the number of HS6 products for which the
distance coefficient is statistically significant at least at the 5% level. The second and third columns
show the breakdown between the lines with positive and negative coefficients on distance,
respectively. The first three lines show the results for the US, Germany and Japan. Consider the US
numbers.
Out of the US’s 4,845 HS 6-digit products, 1,957 products have statistically significant distance
coefficients with 1,667 of these being positive. This suggests that about 34% of US HS6 exports are
‘quality goods’, about 6% are ‘price goods’. The remainder, almost 60%, cannot be classified,
perhaps because the statistical groupings bundle together some price and some quality products.
The results for Japan are broadly consistent with those for the US, with 38% of the HS6 lines
displaying positive distance coefficients (suggesting quality competition) and 9% displaying negative
coefficients.
Findings for the four large EU exporters, Germany, France, Britain and Italy, reveal a much higher
share of quality goods. About 50% of German, French and British exports are classified as quality
goods, while the figure for Italy is almost 60%. We also note that the share of unclassifiable lines is
much lower for these nations, with the share range from 33% for Italy to 48% for Britain, while
France and Germany both close to 40%.
An informal test is given by contrasting these results for highly industrial nations with nations who
are known to be more dependent on commodity exports where we expect price to matter more than
quality.
Australia and Canada are the nations we chose as they are both large exporters, heavily reliant on
primary good exports and have excellent data. For these two nations the share of quality goods is only
15% (Canada) and 27% (Australia). The share of price goods is 7% for Canada, and 5% for Australia.
China presents an interesting case. Its exports are dominated by industrial goods, but it is widely
perceived to be an export of varieties where low prices are the key to their success. What we find is
that about 21% of its exports are quality-goods by our measure and 17% of its exports are price goods.

3.4. Overall among US, German and Japanese quality goods
The next question is whether these goods classified at HS 6-digit level are common to the countries in
study. The fourth row of Table 2 shows the number of HS 6-digit lines that overlap among the US,
Japan and Germany, i.e. the number of products which show statistically significant coefficient
estimates of the same sign for the distance variable for all the three countries.
Out of 3,905 HS 6-digit product lines which were common for all the three countries, 510 show
statistically significant coefficients for all the three countries. Out of the 510 product lines, 322 show
statistically significant positive coefficient estimates for all the three countries. We would like to
suggest that these HS codes could be considered as marked by ‘quality goods’. The 322 figure
represents just 8% of the 3,905 HS 6-digit product lines exported (about 10% in terms of export
value).
Only one HS 6-digit code has statistically significant negative coefficient estimate for all the three
countries.
There are 157 products that show two positive signs and one negative sign, so maybe we could call
these quasi-quality competition goods. 30 products show one positive sign and two negative signs.
The proportion of quality and quasi-quality competition goods is much higher than price and
quasi-price competition goods. The rather small proportion of the overlap of product codes across the
three countries implies that the product mixture in terms of quality/price competition for a particular
HS 6-digit code is different across countries.
3.5. More detailed disaggregation
Fact that less than one out of ten lines can be unanimously classified as quality or price goods
suggests that there may be a great deal of heterogeneity (across exporters) among the basket of goods
included in each HS6 category.

                                                    5
To investigate the hypothesis, we compare the analyses at HS6 results with estimates on HS 9-digit
data for Japan. Specifically we reproduce the above procedure for all the HS9 lines within given HS6
codes. Since the purpose here is a simple check, not an exhaustive analysis, we have conducted an
analysis using a random sample from HS codes.
Japan has approximately 5,000 lines at the HS6 level with roughly 9,100 lines at the HS9 level. Some
HS6 codes have only a single HS9 code, rendering our test invalid so we discard all such HS6 codes
and then take a 1 % random sample of the remaining HS6 codes. For these randomly sampled HS6
codes, we have taken the export data at the HS9 level. The regression is run for each HS 9-digit code.
The test will come from comparing the distance coefficient estimates for the HS6 aggregate with the
more disaggregate estimates for the HS9 codes encompassed by the HS6 code.
Table 3 summarises the results. The left panel shows that HS6 result, with the first column displaying
the HS6 code, the second the distance coefficient and the third the p-value. The fourth column
summarise the finding by putting a + or – where the distance coefficient is positive or negative at the
5% level respectively. The right panel shows similar statistics for the HS9 codes that make up the
HS6 code listed. The final column summarises the match between the two as a half-match (H), a
full-match (F) or more-than-half-match (MF). N indicates no-match.
If HS9 heterogeneity is a key source of the low number of goods that can be clearly classified as
quality or price goods, then we should see a stark mismatch between the results indicated by the HS9
data and the more aggregated HS6 data, i.e. many “N” in the final column.
Out of the total 16 HS 6-digit codes we checked, 7 have full fit and 3 have more than a half fit. Only 3
have no match. Closer examination of the no-match cases is revealing. In two of the cases (520544
and 611120), the distance coefficient is positive and significant for the data pooled at the HS6 level,
but none of the underlying HS9 coefficients are significant. We note however that the HS9
coefficients are positive. This suggests that the lack of variation in the HS9 export destinations may
account for the lack of statistical significance.
The remaining case of no match (901890) is very instructive. Here we see that most of the HS9
coefficients are positive, but one is negative. The aggregate HS6 coefficient is estimated to be
negative but not significantly different from zero. This case suggests that the HS6 classification is
inappropriate for our purposes in that it pools price and quality goods. If this sort of result were
widespread, then it would cast doubt on our HS6 results, but the fact that it occurs in only one of the
16 cases provides some assurance that our HS6 estimates are yielding useful results.
While further testing is required, using for example US HS10 and EU HS8 data, our exploratory
investigation suggests that analysis at HS6 level provides a reasonably good indication of the
underlying situation. It is particularly important to note that in no case did the HS6 result indicate that
the line was a quality or price good when the HS9 data indicated otherwise.
Our finding does not resolve the issue of the low number of clearly classifiable HS6 codes. We cannot
say whether there is something wrong with our empirical framing of the question, or whether the
problem lies in heterogeneity (by exporting country) of basket of goods in the HS9 codes.

4. CONCLUSION
This seeks to classify HS6 digit products as being characterised either by price-competition or by
quality-competition goods as suggested by the HFT and QHFT models. We find that about 8% of
HS6 codes can be thus classified in the sense that results for the US, Germany and Japan all
coincided.
Of the goods that can be clearly classified, we find that the major EU countries are leading the quality
competition race with 50 to 60 % of their exports being goods in which quality seems to matter in the
sense that the goods that get sold to the most distant markets are the most expensive ones. For Japan
and the US the figures are lower at 38 and 34 % respectively. Canada, Australia and China have much
lower proportions of quality-competition goods.
To check for problems with aggregation, we analyse Japan’s export data at the HS 9-digit level and its
aggregation into the HS6 scheme. We find few difference in the inferences that come from analysis at
the HS9 versus HS6 level.
