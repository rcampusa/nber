This chapter surveys experience with performance pay in developing country health programs. In
doing so, it focuses on four key conceptual issues: (1) What to reward, (2) Who to reward, (3) How
to reward, and (4) What unintended consequences might performance incentives create. We highlight
that the use of performance pay has outpaced growth in corresponding empirical evidence. Moreover,
very little research on performance incentives focuses on the underlying conceptual issues that we
outline. We consider these to be important constraints to the design of better performance incentives
in low- and middle-income country health programs.

1. Introduction

       Poor performance of health care providers plagues the delivery of health services in many

low- and middle-income countries (Banerjee, Deaton, and Duflo 2004; Das, Hammer, and

Leonard 2008; Berendes et al. 2011). The underlying reasons are complex and incompletely

understood, but poor performance is not simply due to inadequate training or deficiencies in

provider knowledge.

       Instead, a growing body of evidence documents substantial deficits in provider effort.

One striking example is the high absenteeism rates (as high as 75%) among health professionals

documented in a number of studies (Chaudhury and Hammer 2003; Chaudhury et al. 2006;

Lewis 2006). When providers are present, a sizeable “know-do” gap (or failure to do in practice

what a provider knows to do in principle) also contributes to low quality medical care (Das and

Hammer 2004; Alcazar et al. 2006; Chaudhury et al. 2006; Das and Hammer 2007; Das et al.

2012). Provider effort may also not focus directly on improving health – for example, health

professionals may provide unnecessary services that are not medically appropriate (intravenous

glucose drips to create the illusion of therapeutic effectiveness, for example) (Phadke 1998;

Kremer 2002; Blumenthal and Hsiao 2005; Bloom et al. 2006). Moreover, even when providers

exert appropriate effort during a clinical encounter, they may do little to promote the health of

their patients outside of the encounter (through prevention and outreach activities, for example)

(Eichler and Levine 2009).

       One might expect that given weaker market incentives, these problems would be more

prevalent in public sector health service delivery. However, sub-optimal provider effort can be

sustained in equilibrium in all sectors, including private practice, due to well-known market

failures. For example, a well-established literature demonstrates that asymmetric information



                                                 2
limits the ability of patients and the lay-public to observe provider effort or judge medical care

quality (Arrow 1963; Holmstrom and Hart 1987; McGuire 2000). As a result, patients are

unable to penalize under-performing providers through their choices. These problems are

compounded by market conditions and rigidities common in low- and middle-income countries,

including inadequate regulatory processes (World Health Organization 2003) and a relatively

large government role in financing and delivering health services (given more prevalent

infectious diseases and larger positive externalities in service delivery, for example).

        To better align provider incentives with patient and population welfare (or health – one

argument of welfare), “pay-for-performance” schemes have become increasingly common in

developing country health service delivery.1 In principle, the idea is straightforward: drawing on

the logic of performance pay in human resource management (Lazear 1995; Hall and Liebman

1998; Lazear 2000), this approach rewards providers directly for achieving pre-specified

performance targets related to health. Use of performance incentives in wealthy countries began

in earnest during the 1990s with programs that rewarded both process indicators and measures of

clinical quality (Rosenthal et al. 2004). Examples of performance targets include immunization

rates (Fairbrother et al. 1999; Fairbrother et al. 2001); disease screening (Rosenthal et al. 2005);

adherence to clinical guidelines (Roski et al. 2003); and the adoption of case management

processes, physician reminder systems, and disease registry systems. The UK went further with

the National Health Service’s Quality and Outcomes Framework, tying physician practice

bonuses to a comprehensive range of quality indicators (Roland 2004; Gravelle, Sutton, and Ma


1
  A variety of terms have been used interchangeably for pay-for-performance (P4P) incentives, including
performance-based incentives (PBI), performance-based pay (PBP), and performance pay (PP). Beyond aligning
provider incentives with patient and population health, there are other rationales for performance pay, including
reducing the regulatory resources and effort otherwise required for provider monitoring (Lewis and Gunilla 2009).

2007). Performance pay in low- and middle-income country health programs emerged in the late

1990s (Franco, Bennett, and Kanfer 2002), and its use has grown rapidly since then.

       In practice, pay-for-performance contracts are complex and fraught both with difficult

trade-offs and with the possibility of ‘multitasking’ and other unintended consequences

(Holmstrom and Milgrom 1991; Petersen et al. 2006; Rosenthal and Frank 2006; Mannion and

Davies 2008). This chapter outlines key conceptual issues in the design of pay-for-performance

contracts and summarizes existing empirical evidence related to each. In doing so, it focuses on

four key conceptual issues: (1) What to reward, (2) Who to reward, (3) How to reward, and (4)

What perverse incentives might performance rewards create. We conclude by highlighting

important areas for future research and by noting the overall lack of evidence on many key

aspects of incentive design in the health sector.



2. What to Reward

       If “you get what you pay for,” then it presumably follows that one should pay for what

one ultimately wants (Cutler 2005). If a health program’s primary objective is good patient or

population health outcomes, it would seem natural for performance incentives to reward good

health or health improvement directly rather than the use of health services or other health inputs.

Rewarding health outcomes rather than health input use not only creates strong incentives for

providers to exert effort, but it can also create incentives for providers to innovate in developing

new, context-appropriate delivery strategies. Put differently, rather than tying rewards to

prescriptive algorithms for service provision (often developed by those unfamiliar with local

conditions), rewarding good health outcomes encourages providers to use their local knowledge

creatively in designing new delivery approaches to maximize contracted health outcomes.



                                                    4
        In practice, however, very few pay-for-performance schemes have rewarded good health.

At the time of writing this review, we are aware of only two: performance incentives for primary

school principals in rural China to reduce student anemia (Miller et al. 2012) and incentives for

Indian day care workers in urban slums to improve anthropometric indicators of malnutrition

among enrolled children (Singh 2011).2 In the Chinese study, researchers measured student

hemoglobin concentrations at the beginning of an academic year, issued incentive contracts

rewarding anemia reduction to principals shortly afterwards, and measured student hemoglobin

concentrations again at the end of the school year. School principals responded creatively,

persuading parents to change their children’s diets at home as well as providing micronutrient

supplementation at school, and anemia prevalence fell by roughly 25%. In the Indian study,

researchers measured child anthropometrics at day care facilities, issued incentive contracts

rewarding providers for each child with an improved malnutrition score, and repeated

anthropometric measurement three months later. In response, day care workers visited mothers’

homes and promoted the use of nutritious recipe booklets; malnutrition indicators declined by

about 6%.

        The fact that so few pay-for-performance programs reward health outcomes may reflect

important limitations to doing so that arise in practice. Instead, performance incentives generally

reward the use of pre-specified health inputs. In the following sections, we discuss shortcomings

and trade-offs inherent in incentive contracts that reward health outcomes.

Share of Variation in Contracted Outcome under Provider Control

        One drawback to rewarding good health is that even when exerting optimal effort, a

relatively small amount of variation in health outcomes may be under the control of providers.

2
 Leonard (2003) studies traditional healers who voluntarily offer payment contracts to patients contingent on health
outcomes in Cameroon, Tanzania, and Ethiopia is a related example.


                                                         5
For illustration, consider the case of neonatal survival. Maternal health behaviors during

pregnancy are key determinants of birth weight, and low birth weight is a leading risk factor for

neonatal death (McCormick 1985). Although rewarding maternity care providers for neonatal

survival could in theory motivate them to engage expectant mothers from an early stage of their

pregnancy, providers may be unlikely to succeed or may believe a priori that they will be unable

to change maternal health behaviors. Patients or community members may also respond to

changes in provider behavior caused by performance incentives; in some cases, these responses

may undermine provider actions. For example if educators or health providers take direct action

to improve nutrition because of performance incentives, parents may respond by reducing

children's dietary quality at home. In both cases, if providers do not believe that their effort will

ultimately be rewarded, they may simply not respond to the performance incentive.

         A clear (and common) alternative is to reward the use of health services and inputs,

particularly those that are relatively sensitive to provider effort.3 Providers generally have

greater influence on service use than health outcomes, and even more so on quality of clinical

care. In several rigorous studies of pay-for-performance incentives in Rwanda, providers were

rewarded for prenatal care visits, immunizations among children and pregnant women,

institutional deliveries, HIV testing, and a wide range of service quality indicators. Incentive

payments were offered for each service provided and were weighted using overall quality scores.

This set of incentives motivated providers both to increase delivery of contracted services and to

raise overall quality of care. Researchers found that the program increased institutional delivery

rates by 23% and preventive service use among children under age 4 by 25-50%, and it also


3
  Beyond trade-offs in rewarding health input use vs. health outputs, optimal contract design more generally requires
information about the cost of provider effort, the productivity of provider effort, and the utility functions of both
providers and the contracting ‘principal’ (Laffont and Tirole 1993; Salanie 2005).


                                                         6
reduced the “know-do” gap by 20% (Basinga et al. 2011; Gertler and Vermeersch 2012) .

Although not directly contracted, infant weight-for-age and child (2-4 year old) height-for-age

rose by roughly 0.5 and .25 standard deviations, respectively. The incentives also led to a 15%

increase in the rate of HIV testing and counseling among couples, and an 18% increase in the

probability that both partners in HIV discordant households had been tested for HIV at least once

(de Walque et al. 2013).

Interactions with Provider Skill/Human Capital Base

       A second limitation to rewarding good health outcomes is that providers may not possess

adequate ability to innovate if they lack the necessary skills and human capital. These skills can

be both technical and inter-personal. Loevinsohn and Harding (2005) suggest that providers may

be unsuccessful in responding to performance incentives when success requires changing patient

behavior (which requires skills beyond clinical ability). In the Rwandan program, providers

were unsuccessful in increasing contraception use and in persuading patients to complete the

contracted sequence of four prenatal care visits in part because of local patient preferences

(superstitions about acknowledging pregnancies at an early stage) (Basinga et al. 2011; Gertler

and Vermeersch 2012). To address this shortcoming, one program in the Democratic Republic

of Congo paired performance incentives with consulting services for community outreach and

business planning. Health facility managers were encouraged to submit quarterly business plans

detailing their strategies to achieve incentivized targets, and consultants provided them with

custom-tailored advice (Soeters et al. 2011; Bishai 2012).

Measurement of Contracted Outcomes

       A third obstacle to rewarding good health is that health outcomes can be more difficult

and expensive to measure than health service or input use, particularly when physiological health



                                                 7
indicators must be measured directly. For example, all else equal, the expense of measuring

hemoglobin concentrations would potentially be an important barrier to scaling up the China

performance pay program described above (Miller et al. 2012).4 Alternatively, incentives tied to

service and input use have successfully relied on combinations of self-reporting and random

audits to measure contracted outcomes on a larger scale (see Regalia and Castro 2009 and

Gertler and Vermeersch 2012, for example). Examples of contracted health inputs measured this

way include well-baby visits (Basinga et al. 2011) and adherence to clinical protocols during

medical visits (Soeters et al. 2011). Finally, measurement of contracted outcomes (either health

input use or health outcomes) among patients in clinical settings may pose fewer measurement

challenges than in community-wide settings (Section 5 considers trade-offs between rewards for

outcomes among patients vs. population members).



3. Who to Reward

        Another important issue in designing performance incentives is deciding who to reward.

Which agents at what organizational level will be most efficient and effective in improving on

contracted outcomes? In this section we describe conceptual issues in contracting at the macro

(or organizational) and micro (individual) level.

Macro-level Incentives: Organizations and Local Government

        At the macro-level, central governments in low- and middle-income countries often

contract with private organizations or transfer resources to local government to deliver health

services – and performance incentives are increasingly being included in these schemes.5

  A cost-effectiveness analysis of this program has not yet been conducted.

  Although beyond the scope of this chapter, a growing number of international donors also use pay-for-performance
incentives under the umbrella of “results based financing” – for example, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and


                                                        8
Because performance pay shifts risk to incentivized agents, the more risk averse the agent, the

greater the expected compensation must be (all else equal). One advantage of organizational-

level incentives is that collectively, organizational agents may effectively be less risk averse than

individual employees. This is because idiosyncratic risk that effort will not result in good

performance – and thus not be rewarded – is pooled across individuals within organizations. As a

result, overall program costs may be lower when contracting at the organizational level (all else

equal). However, contracted organizations must then solve their own internal principal-agent

problems, and they may pass the costs of doing so on to the principals contracting with them.

        There are many circumstances under which central governments “contract-out” health

service delivery to private organizations (typically NGOs). One is settings in which public

sector facilities are largely absent – for example, regions of post-conflict Afghanistan (Palmer et

al. 2006; Sondorp et al. 2009) and Haiti (Eichler et al. 2009). Under these conditions,

governments and international organizations have contracted with NGOs to open facilities,

recruit and train providers, and manage all aspects of service delivery. In the context of

Afghanistan and Haiti, achieving performance targets was rewarded with operating budget

transfers of up to 10% of the base contract amounts (paid by the World Bank and USAID,

respectively). In Afghanistan, studies found that these contracting strategies were associated

with improvements in service availability (measured as the ratio of facilities to population, which

increased by about 30%, and the share of facilities providing antenatal care, which rose by 45%

to 75%) and institutional delivery rates (which roughly doubled) (Eichler and Levine 2009). In

Haiti, research suggested that performance pay was associated with 13-24 percentage point

Immunization (GAVI) provides recipient countries with an initial unconditional payment followed by additional
financial rewards based on quality of vaccination data and improvements in immunization coverage. The
Millennium Challenge Corporation also uses a performance-based model for determining ongoing eligibility for aid
among recipient countries (MCC 2012).


                                                       9
increases in full childhood immunization coverage and 17-27 percentage point increases in

institutional delivery rates (Eichler and Levine 2009).

       Contracting-out also occurs when public sector facilities exist but perform poorly. For

example, in 1999, the Cambodian government began contracting with NGOs to manage health

service delivery in five randomly-selected districts (8 districts were chosen for contracting, but

not all districts had suitable quality proposals from NGOs). Contracts rewarded eight explicit

performance indicators (immunization rates, vitamin A supplementation, antenatal care use,

medical supervision of deliveries, institutional delivery rates, contraceptive use, and use of

public vs. private sector health facilities). Researchers found that after five years, performance-

based contracting led to a 32 percentage point increase in antenatal care use, a 16 percentage

point increase in completion of recommended childhood immunizations, and a 17 percentage

point increase in vitamin A supplementation. Cambodia’s contracting strategy also improved

general facility operations (24 hour service availability, staff attendance, managerial supervision,

and equipment availability) (Bloom et al. 2006).

       Macro-level performance incentives have also become increasingly common in the public

sector. In the 1980s, central governments in many low- and middle-income countries began

transferring funds for service provision to local governments, decentralizing authority over

policy design and management (Manor 1999). One of the rationales for decentralization is that

local governments have superior information about local preferences and are therefore better able

to satisfy them (Rondinelli 1980; Conyers 1983; Mills et al. 1990; Maccini 2006). However,

even if local governments have superior information about local preferences, they do not

necessarily have strong incentives to satisfy them. Decentralization can therefore include

performance-based incentives. For example, a recent initiative in Indonesia gave block grants to



                                                 10
village leaders to provide maternal and child health services and to run schools. In a randomly

selected subset of villages, the size of subsequent block grants was tied to performance according

to 12 performance measures (8 maternal and child health indicators and both enrollment and

attendance in primary and secondary schools). With performance incentives, midwives in

treatment villages worked longer hours, increasing the availability of health services – and

prenatal care visits rose by 37 percentage points. Local administrators in incentivized districts

also used central government funds more efficiently, negotiating savings in education (without

any apparent decline in school attendance) and re-allocating the savings to the health sector

(Olken, Onishi, and Wong 2012).

        Under all of these circumstances, organizational autonomy may be critical for the success

of incentive programs. The Cambodian program experimented explicitly with the degree of

independence given to contracting NGOs, using both more restrictive “contracting-in” and more

autonomous “contracting-out” arrangements. Management and facility indicators improved more in

contracting-out districts, and there is suggestion that health indicators did as well (Bloom et al. 2006).

Other cases illustrate the breadth of responses to performance incentives enabled by autonomy. For

example, hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil with municipal health delivery contracts that rewarded hospital

efficiency, patient volume, and service quality developed creative organizational strategies tailored to

their own hospital settings (Jack 2003). Hospital spending fell and efficiency indicators rose without

measurable declines in service quality. La Forgia and Couttolenc (2008) and La Forgia and Harding (2009)

estimate that to produce comparable changes in patient discharges absent performance incentives,

hospitals would need to increase spending by about 60%.

        An important limitation of macro-level incentives is that they may not translate into

private rewards for organizational leaders. Although performance incentives could in principle

be structured this way, to date they have generally been designed as operating budget transfers


                                                     11
and eligibility for future contracts (we discuss rewards paid as budget transfers vs. private

income in more detail in Section 4 on “How to Reward”). A related drawback is the possibility

that organizational policies and regulations limit organizational or local government ability to

solve their own internal principle-agent problems (if managers are not permitted to use budget

transfers for employee bonuses, for example). In Cambodia, contracting NGOs increased the use

of many (presumably productive) health inputs, but actual health outcomes (the infant mortality

rate and diarrhea incidence among children under five) did not improve (Bloom et al. 2006).

NGOs managing hospitals in Afghanistan (Sondorp et al. 2009) and Costa Rica (under similar

programs) (Garcia-Prado and Chawla 2006) made improvements in facility management and

service provision, but there were no measurable gains in health input use (immunizations, for

example).

Micro-level Incentives

       At the micro-level, organizations often use performance incentives to solve principal-

agent problems with individual employees. These incentives can target upper-level managers

and/or rank-and-file providers that they supervise.

       An important virtue of rewarding managers for good performance is that they possess

greater flexibility for innovation in service delivery. In contrast, lower-level health workers

often must follow detailed, highly prescriptive protocols from which they are not allowed to

deviate. For example, a recent study shows that Chinese primary school principals (who manage

schools) offered performance rewards for reducing student anemia (Miller et al. (2012) see

Section 2) not only supplemented school meals with vitamins, but they also took the initiative to

discuss nutrition with parents, persuading them to increase their children’s consumption of iron-

rich foods at home. As a result, anemia prevalence among participating children fell by roughly



                                                 12
25% (Miller et al. 2012). In Nicaragua, health facility managers were given performance

incentives for offering and providing both prenatal care and well-child services to a large share

(90%) of local CCT program beneficiaries. In response, managers took the initiative to partner

with community organizers (promotoras), school teachers, and the local media to conduct

community outreach campaigns encouraging mothers to bring their children for check-ups.

These managerial efforts were reportedly successful: nearly all providers were judged to have

achieved the performance targets, preventive care use increased by 16 percentage points, and

vaccination rates rose by 30 percentage points (Regalia and Castro 2009).

       In practice, many pay-for-performance schemes to date have rewarded individual

providers rather than their managers for good performance. Although rank-and-file health

workers may have less flexibility to innovate in service delivery, their effort may ultimately

matter most for organizational performance. Additionally, because they have the most direct

contact with target populations, individual providers may also have better knowledge about local

conditions. For example, day care workers in the Indian program rewarding reductions in

malnutrition (Singh 2011) made more frequent home visits in addition to providing more

nutritious meals at day care facilities. Through these home visits, they encouraged mothers to

use nutritious recipe booklets, and malnutrition among children at their day care centers declined

by 4.2% over a 3 month period (Singh 2011). In Rwanda, individual public sector providers

responded to incentives for higher prenatal care and institutional delivery rates by partnering

with midwives to identify and refer pregnant women for services. The associated increase in

institutional deliveries was 10-25 percentage points (Rusa et al. 2009; Basinga et al. 2011;

Gertler and Vermeersch 2012).




                                                13
        In addition to lacking flexibility to innovate in service delivery, there can be other

limitations to incentivizing individual health workers as well. A potentially important one is that

rewarding health workers for their own individual performance may create disincentives for

teamwork or cooperation. Alternatively, rewarding providers for group performance (see

Peabody et al. 2011, for example) creates incentives for free-riding because individual health

workers do not bear the full cost of shirking – and may be rewarded for good performance

among co-workers.



4. How to Reward

        Using performance incentives to increase provider effort necessarily requires

assumptions about what motivates providers. It is reasonable to assume the providers care about

both financial compensation (Ellis and McGuire 1986; Ellis and McGuire 1993) and patient

welfare (Delfgaauw 2007) to varying degrees. But human motives are complex, and other factors

undoubtedly play a role too – professional recognition and the esteem of colleagues, pride in

one’s work, opportunities for professional advancement (career concerns), working conditions,

and amenities where one lives, for example. From the standpoint of policy or program design,

many of these other factors cannot be translated into performance rewards as easily as financial

incentives. However, these other motives can interact with financial incentives in important

ways.

        In this section, we discuss general conceptual issues in the structure of performance

incentive contracts.

Balancing Fixed vs. Variable Compensation




                                                 14
         As discussed in the literature outside of health (on executive compensation, for example),

performance pay should optimally balance fixed (unconditional) and variable (performance-

based) pay. On one hand, performance bonuses must be sufficiently large to influence provider

behavior. Aligning executive effort with firm interests may require that a large share of total

compensation be tied to firm performance through performance pay (Hall and Liebman 1998).

Several studies suggest that in health care, performance incentives may be ineffective if they are

too small (Grady et al. 1997; Hillman et al. 1998; Petersen et al. 2006; Rosenthal and Frank

2006).

         On the other hand, increasing variable pay as a share of total compensation increases the

financial risk borne by providers (Ellis and McGuire 1990). Because providers are generally

risk-averse (to varying degrees), they must be compensated for bearing additional risk inherent in

pay-for-performance contracts. Negotiations over a health service delivery contract in Haiti

between a NGO (Management Sciences for Health) and USAID illustrates this point (Eichler and

Levine 2009). When re-negotiating its contract, Management Sciences for Health was only

willing to accept the additional risk imposed by performance pay if USAID would increase the

total amount that could be earned to exceed contractual payments under the alternative

unconditional contract (under the performance pay contract, fixed payments were set to 95% of

the unconditional contract amount, and an additional 10% was made conditional on good

performance (Eichler et al. 2009)).

The Functional Form of Provider Rewards

         A second issue in the structure of performance pay contracts is the functional form

mapping incentive payments onto performance indicators. Absent knowing what the contract

theory literature suggests is needed for optimal incentive contract design, a simple approach is to



                                                 15
offer rewards that are linear in contracted outcomes. Examples include constant incremental

rewards per child reduction in malnutrition (Singh 2011), per child reduction in anemia (Miller et

al. 2012), or per infant delivery supervised by a skilled birth attendant (Basinga et al. 2011).

         Other programs have adopted a step-function approach, offering bonuses for surpassing

one or more bright-line performance thresholds. Depending on its specific form, this approach

can have theoretical grounding6 and may also be appropriate when thresholds have clinical

significance (vaccination rates at levels that confer herd immunity, for example (Anderson

1992). However, a drawback to the step-function approach can be greater risk that provider

effort will not be rewarded. Specifically, it creates strong incentives in the neighborhood of a

threshold, but it may also be a poor motivator for health workers far below (or above) a

threshold.7

Salary vs. Operating Budget Rewards

         Structuring performance rewards as private income or operational budget revenue also

requires assumptions about what motivates providers. In one extreme, if providers were purely

motivated by private financial considerations, offering rewards as private income would

presumably induce them to exert greater effort. In the other extreme, if providers were purely

philanthropic, incentive payments made as operational revenue could be more effective. Given

that preferences are mixed in reality (and also include other things such as professional esteem,


6
  Contract theory suggests that optimal incentive contracts are likely to be non-linear in contracted outcomes
(Laffont and Tirole 1993; Salanie 2005), and step-functions could provide a reasonable approximation of these non-
linearities. However, the information required for optimal contract design (including the cost of provider effort, the
health productivity of provider effort, and the utility functions of both providers and the contracting principal) is
unlikely to be available in practice.
7
  Alternatively, Toonen and co-authors argue that setting bright-line aspirational goals could change institutional
culture to be more results- or goal-oriented (Toonen et al. 2009). Although there is little evidence among studies of
performance pay, bright-line performance incentive targets may also help to focus attention on contracted outcomes
when provider attention is scarce (DellaVigna 2007; Shah, Mullainathan, and Shafir 2012).

pride in one’s work, career aspirations, etc.), predictions about the relative effectiveness of

different types of financial incentives are ambiguous and may be context-specific. One study

suggests that NGO employees providing health services in Afghanistan responded positively to

performance incentives even though bonuses accrued to facilities and did not result in personal

financial gain. In principle, combinations of the two are possible, although we are unaware of

schemes that mixed the two. In practice, macro-level rewards are often paid as operational

revenue, while micro-level rewards are typically offered as private income.

Non-Financial Incentives

         While pay-for-performance contracts strengthen extrinsic incentives, intrinsic motivation

is commonly thought to be an important determinant of provider effort as well (Bokhour et al.

2006).8 Although not focused specifically on health care provider behavior, research on intrinsic

motivation in psychology suggests that more altruistic individuals work harder to achieve

organizational goals (Franco, Bennett, and Kanfer 2002). In the health sector, altruistic

individuals are more likely to work for health delivery organizations with explicit charity

mandates (Serra, Serneels, and Barr 2011), suggesting that intrinsic motivation may be

heterogeneous across types of health facilities. Health care providers with greater intrinsic

motivation may also be more responsive to professional recognition among community members

or peers (Franco, Bennett, and Kanfer 2002; Benabou and Tirole 2003). In such cases, non-

financial rewards and other psychological tools9 may be close substitutes for (or may even be

more effective than) financial incentives.

8
  Intrinsic motivation refers to rewards that are internal and related to deriving enjoyment or satisfaction from the
very act of completing a task. By contrast, extrinsic motivation refers to incentives or pressures that originate from
the outside (the offer of financial rewards, for example).
9
  For a discussion of behavior modification strategies that do not rely on extrinsic incentives (including the use of
framing, priming, and cognitive dissonance), see Kamenica (2012). We discuss the possibility that financial rewards
undermine intrinsic motivation in Section 5.


                                                         17
       Qualitative and anecdotal evidence from field studies support the hypothesis that health

care providers are intrinsically motivated. Health workers employed by NGOs in post-conflict

Afghanistan reportedly felt a great sense of pride and accomplishment after meeting contracted

performance targets (Palmer et al. 2006). A program (not formally evaluated) in Myanmar

offered new scales for measuring patient weight to providers who met Tuberculosis (TB) case

identification and registration goals. In townships with these (essentially) non-financial

incentives, identification of TB cases rose by 30 percentage points relative to informal

comparison townships (Maung, Kluge, and Aye 2006). Anecdotal reports suggest that Zambian

health workers participating in an incentive program (rewarding malaria treatment, infant and

maternal care, and childhood immunizations) responded more favorably to trophies than to cash

incentives (USAID 2006). Finally, case studies suggest that health providers rewarded for good

performance with t-shirts (Speizer, Trambashe, and Tegang 2001), badges and certificates

(Amare 2011), and recognition photographs (Bhattacharyya et al. 2001) may have been

successful.

       One rigorous quantitative study concurs with this qualitative and anecdotal evidence. In

studying Zambian hair stylists with financial and non-financial incentives to sell condoms to

salon clients, Ashraf, Bandiera, and Jack (2012) find that public recognition out-performs

monetary incentives. These results are heterogeneous across stylists and are largely due to

strong behavioral responses among stylists believed to be more committed to the cause of HIV

prevention.



5. Perverse Incentives and Unintended Consequences




                                                 18
        The use of incentives to improve health program performance is fraught with the

possibility of unintended and potentially perverse consequences. In this section, we discuss

some of these concerns and describe the empirical literature related to each.10

Non-Contracted Outcomes

        One type of unintended behavioral response to performance incentives has been studied

in the theoretical literature on “multitasking.” When agents are responsible for multiple tasks or

multidimensional tasks (some of which are unobservable or non-contractible), rewarding

performance on a subset of contractible tasks or outcomes can lead to a reduction in effort

devoted to non-contracted outcomes (Holmstrom and Milgrom 1991). The degree to which this

occurs may depend in part on the extent to which non-contracted outcomes share inputs with

contracted outcomes (Mullen, Frank, and Rosenthal 2010; Sherry, Bauhoff, and Mohanan 2013).

        Empirically, some studies of performance incentives have found evidence of such

behavioral distortions. A Kenyan school meal program rewarding improved pupil malnutrition

rates found that subsidized meal preparation crowded out teaching time by 15% (Vermeersch

and Kremer 2005). Similarly, providing incentives to Chinese primary school principals for

reductions in student anemia may also have displaced teaching effort, leading to lower test scores

in some cases (Sylvia et al. 2012). Findings across empirical studies of performance incentives

are heterogeneous, however. Several rigorous studies also report no clear evidence of

distortionary or detrimental reallocation of effort or other resources in response to performance




10
  This section discusses costly behavioral distortions that performance incentives may induce. We do not include
misrepresentation of contracted outcomes (lying about them, for example) in our discussion because fraud/deception
do not generally represent costly behavioral distortions (although fraudulent reporting that leads to undeserved
incentive payments has a true resource cost).


                                                       19
incentives (Bloom et al. 2006; Mullen, Frank and Rosenthal 2010; Olken, Onishi, and Wong

2012, for example).11

         Beyond the standard multitasking framework, performance incentives may lead to other

closely related behavioral distortions. For example, although not studied empirically (to the best

of our knowledge), performance incentives could lead to reallocation across multiple substitute

activities related to the same disease or health outcome – or even the purposeful neglect of one to

earn higher rewards for another (rewarding the successful treatment of a disease would

undermine incentives to prevent it). Given growing emphasis on “impact evaluation,”12 another

related example would be distortionary reallocation of effort and resources towards an

evaluation’s primary outcomes (and away from outcomes not emphasized by the evaluation).

Because demonstrating “impact” can lead to new or continued funding, the evaluation process

itself may therefore create important behavioral distortions (depending on the beliefs of the

evaluated organization).

Heterogeneity in the Return to Effort across Contracted Outcomes

         Among contracted outcomes, providers may also allocate effort to those that yield the

largest (net) marginal return (Mullen, Frank, and Rosenthal 2010; Gertler and Vermeersch 2012;

Sherry, Bauhoff, and Mohanan 2013). In Rwanda, researchers found that rewards for good

performance were most effective in improving outcomes that appear to have the highest marginal

return or require the least effort. For example, performance incentives were more effective in

increasing institutional delivery rates among pregnant women already in contact with community

health workers (a relatively easy task because new patient relationships did not have to be

11
   Olken, Onishi and Wong (2012) find technical efficiency gains in education and re-allocation of resulting savings
from education to health spending. However, measured education outcomes did not decline.

   For example, see the Systematic Reviews series published by the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation
(3IE) available at http://www.3ieimpact.org/en/publications/

created) than they were in initiating the use of early prenatal care (which the authors suggest to

be a relatively difficult task because doing so requires early identification of pregnant women not

yet in contact with the health care system). Moreover, the incremental payment for institutional

deliveries was relatively high (US $4.59), while the incremental payment for completion of

quarterly prenatal care visits was relatively low (US $0.09) (Gertler and Vermeersch 2012).

Ultimately, institutional delivery rates rose by more than 20 percentage points, but there were no

increases in the share of women completing all quarterly prenatal care visits.

Patient/Sub-Population Selection

       In addition to altering how providers choose among tasks, performance incentives may

also influence how providers allocate effort among patients or community members. Although

not the focus of our review, incentives for patient selection are a ubiquitous concern with the use

of high-powered incentives that emphasize cost containment (capitated contracts under managed

care in wealthy countries, for example) (Frank, Glazer, and McGuire 2000). With performance

incentives for good patient outcomes, selection against the sickest or most remote patients

(‘cherry picking’) may occur if producing contracted outcomes among them is relatively difficult

or costly (Shen 2003; Oxman and Fretheim 2008).

       Performance could alternatively be linked to population rather than patient outcomes, but

providers could then be discouraged from providing services to individuals outside of the pre-

defined population. Similarly, they may simply focus on the easiest to treat sub-populations

within their defined service area. Some pay-for-performance schemes have tried to limit

perverse incentives like these by offering larger rewards for services provided in more difficult

or remote areas (Meessen, Soucat, and Sekabaraga 2011). Although such design features may




                                                 21
reduce incentives for selection, eliminating them is a nearly impossible task (as the literature on

risk adjustment suggests (van de Ven and Ellis 2000)).

Erosion of Intrinsic Motivation

       Finally, pay-for-performance incentives may have unintended consequences for the

intrinsic motivation of individual providers and for the institutional culture of health care

organizations. Benabou and Tirole (2005) develop a model in which effort in the presence of

rewards is a function of intrinsic motivation (operationalized as altruism, but which could also

include pride in one’s work, etc.), extrinsic motivation (material self-interest), and ‘reputational’

motivation (related to social- or self-image). In the model, monetary rewards undermine

‘reputational’ motivation and can therefore crowd-out effort by changing the perceived meaning

of one’s actions (an ‘image-spoiling’ effect). Both laboratory and field evidence lend some

empirical support to this prediction. In one experiment asking students to perform an altruistic

task (collecting charitable donations), Gneezy and Rustichini (2000) show that the net effect of

small monetary incentives on pro-social effort is negative – students put more effort into the task

when they were not compensated than they did when offered a small incentive. A set of

experiments conducted by Hayman and Ariely (2004) also suggest that financial rewards may

frame a task as a ‘money-market’ rather than a ‘social-market’ task, potentially leading to

reduced effort.

       In low- and middle-income countries, there is similar concern that the use of financial

incentives may lead to demoralization (due to perceptions of ‘bureaucratization’) (Oxman and

Fretheim 2008), reductions in intrinsic motivation (McDonald et al. 2007; Ashraf, Bandiera, and

Jack 2012), and less trust between patients and providers (Ellingsen and Johannesson 2008).

Over time, the quality of individuals entering the public health workforce could also decline if



                                                 22
the use of financial incentives selects against intrinsically motivated health care workers (Witter

et al. 2012).

         Even if extrinsic incentives appear to work in the short-run, the errosion of intrinsic

motivation can still be a longer-run concern. Psychology experiments reviewed by Deci,

Koestner, and Ryan (1999) and Kamenika (2012) suggest that individuals offered monetary

incentives to perform an otherwise intrinisically rewarding task put substantially less effort into

the task (compared to control groups) when the incentives were removed. Social psychologists

attribute this to the effect of extrinsic rewards on individuals’ perception of themselves, on the

value of the rewarded task (Gneezy, Meier, and Rey-Biel 2011), and on social perceptions of the

task (Gneezy and Rustichini 2000).13 Although not yet studied in low- and middle-income

country health programs, one study of performance pay in the U.S. (at Kaiser Permanente

hospitals) supports these findings (Lester, Schmittdiel, and Selby 2010).



6. Conclusion

         This chapter summarizes important conceptual issues in the design of pay-for-

performance incentive schemes. These include choice of contracted outcomes, the

organizational level at which to offer incentives, the structure of incentive contracts, and what

the unintended consequences of performance pay might be. In doing so, we have also surveyed

existing peer-reviewed evidence related (in varying degrees) to each. We highlight that despite

the growing body of research on performance incentives, very little of it has studied the


13
  Murayama and coauthors (2010) study a neural basis for this effect, measuring neurobiological changes when
extrinsic rewards are introduced for otherwise intrinsically rewarding tasks. Although subjects offered financial
rewards outperformed control subjects, researchers showed that the magnitude of the neural response to extrinsic
rewards was negatively correlated with subsequent voluntary participation in the same activity after the rewards
were withdrawn.


                                                         23
underlying conceptual issues that we outline;14 we consider these to be important areas for future

research. We also note that evaluation has not kept pace with growth in the use of performance

pay: Table 1 lists programs that have not been studied (or studied rigorously) to the best of our

knowledge. Strategically selected empirical research on these unstudied programs may provide a

low-cost way of strengthening the body of evidence on foundational issues inherent in the design

of performance incentives. In concluding, we also raise additional issues for further research not

discussed in the body of our review.

        The first is that there is substantial heterogeneity in responses to performance pay both

across and within programs. We therefore caution against direct comparison of pay-for-

performance schemes across different organizational, social, and institutional environments.

However, we also note that understanding the underlying sources of this heterogeneity may

provide insight into the circumstances under which performance pay is more or less effective (or

socially desirable) too. For example, lack of autonomy among providers or health care

organizations may be a critical obstacle to the effective use of performance pay in the public

sector (because it restricts the range of behavioral responses that are possible) (Jack 2003).

        Performance incentives may also interact with pre-existing incentives and social norms in

important ways. In one study, the impact of performance pay varied across incentivized agents

by a factor of three or more (and the underlying source of heterogeneity was not strongly

correlated with demographic and socio-economic characteristics) (Miller et al. 2012). Another

found that provider responses to performance pay varied significantly by baseline provider

quality indicators (Sherry, Bauhoff, and Mohanan 2013). More generally, adequate bureaucratic

capacity to enforce contracts, collect data, and verify performance is presumably necessary for

14
  See Christianson, Leatherman and Sutherland (2008), Mullen, Frank and Rosenthal (2010), and Eijkenaar (2012)
on related work in high-income countries.


                                                      24
pay-for-performance schemes to succeed (Banerjee, Duflo and Glennerster 2008). Analysis of

heterogeneous responses to performance incentives is an important area for future research.

       Second, pay-for-performance schemes may have important equity implications (Yujing

Shen 2003; Mannion and Davies 2008; Bierman and Clark 2007). Given that the net return to

provider effort will undoubtedly vary across activities and sub-populations, performance pay

may lead providers to focus on individuals with varying socio-economic or health characteristics.

Pay-for-performance contracts offered to village governments in Indonesia attempted to address

this concern by allocating equal performance pay budgets across geographic regions with

varying socio-economic characteristics (to prevent some regions from benefitting

disproportionately from the performance scheme) (Olken, Onishi, and Wong 2012).

Competition among villages for performance rewards therefore occurred within, but not across,

regions.

       Finally, there has been surprisingly little rigorous empirical evaluation of the full welfare

consequences of performance pay. The necessary building blocks for a cost-benefit analysis

include a full understanding of the behavioral responses to performance pay and their

magnitudes (including unintended ones) and a method for valuing each in common (typically

monetary) units. Such evaluations are critical for understanding the ultimate social desirability

of pay-for-performance schemes.
