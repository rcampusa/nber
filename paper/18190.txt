Is the FHA Creating Sustainable Homeownership?

                                           ABSTRACT

We produce first results on the sustainability of homeownership for recent (2007-2009) FHA-insured
borrowers. More than 15 percent of these borrowers have already been 90 days or more delinquent,
while less than 7 percent have completed their graduation to sustainable homeownership by finally
paying off all FHA mortgages. We project that the proportion who have been 90 days or more delinquent
will rise above 30 percent within five years, while fewer than 15 percent will have completed their
graduation to sustainable homeownership. We show that the FHA uses an outmoded econometric model
that leads it to underestimate delinquency risk to borrowers and financial risks to taxpayers. Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac use this same outmoded model. More accurate estimates would serve the cause
of transparency and help policy-makers to determine these organizations' appropriate roles in the U.S.
housing finance markets of the future.

I. Introduction

    Following the collapse of the private mortgage market, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has

become the only major issuer of low down-payment mortgages. In 2012 the FHA had an estimated $1 trillion

dollars of insurance in force – roughly three times the 2005 level (IFE [2011], HUD [2005]). A key question is

how many of these loans will produce delinquency and default as opposed to sustainable homeownership.

    In this paper we use a new data set to provide first answers on sustainability for recent (2007-2009) FHA-

insured borrowers. We find that more than 15 percent of these borrowers have already been 90 days or more

delinquent. By way of contrast, less than 7% have completed their graduation to sustainable homeownership

by finally paying off all FHA mortgages. We project that the proportion who have been 90 days or more

delinquent will rise above 30 percent within five years while fewer than 15 percent will have completed their

graduation to sustainable homeownership.

    When homeownership is not sustainable, the human consequences can be tragic. Most borrowers who

become 90 days or more delinquent will eventually lose their homes. They will also lose access to credit (see

Brevoort and Cooper [2010]), may suffer health setbacks (see Currie and Tekin [2012]), and find it difficult it

to move to other parts of the country to find jobs (see Ferreira et. al. [2010, 2011]).

    The high delinquency rates that we identify are easy to understand. Most recent FHA loans have been for

98% of the home value (96.5% LTV plus the 1.5% fixed insurance fee). Many of the homes bought with

these loans have fallen in value since first purchased. Hence many borrowers are underwater. This makes it

difficult for them to exit the FHA system either by selling their homes or by refinancing with non-FHA

insured mortgages. In the meantime, the continuing weakness in the real economy leaves many exposed to

unemployment risk. They will likely remain locked in with the FHA for years to come, all the while remaining

one bad shock away from default.

    Non-sustainable lending is costly not only for borrowers, but also for taxpayers, since FHA insurance is

fully backed by the U.S. government. Unfortunately the FHA has not provided an accurate risk assessment.

Losses from eventual claims have been consistently underestimated in the last several Annual Reports to
                                                                                                                                     1

Congress (Gyourko [2011]). Outmoded methodology is largely responsible for this underestimation of risk

(Aragon et al. [2010], Caplin ([2010], [2011]). The FHA counts as successful any mortgage that is paid off

without an insurance claim, even if this is just an internal refinance of one FHA mortgage into another. So a

borrower who defaults after internally refinancing is treated by the FHA as creating one success (termination

of the first mortgage) and one failure (default of the second mortgage). In fact, the borrower has nothing to

show for their “success” in refinancing, and taxpayers face a large bill.1 The situation with the GSE’s (Fannie

Mae and Freddie Mac) is the same. They treat as successful any agency mortgage that refinances into another

agency mortgage.

     The overcounting of success makes FHA’s risk assessment overly optimistic. We show below that the

over-counting of success is important in the recent period not only in qualitative but also in quantitative

terms. Of those mortgages paid off by FHA borrowers in the 2007-2009 cohorts, more than two-thirds have

been internally refinanced. These neither represent successful transitions to homeownership, nor resolutions

of credit risk to the FHA.

     Opening up FHA and GSE data to researchers is important if U.S. housing finance markets are to be

rebuilt on more stable foundations. We obtained our data from a mortgage data and analytics provider,

CoreLogic, because internal data on FHA-insured mortgages is not publicly available. We were also unable to

obtain data on GSE mortgages. Hence some of the borrowers we count in our data as successfully exiting

FHA may in reality have been refinanced with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac so that the taxpayer remains

exposed to the remaining credit risk. To this date, no one knows the full risks to which borrowers and

taxpayers are being exposed by FHA and the GSE’s.

     Even without making their data publicly available, the FHA and the GSE’s could readily adopt the

borrower-based data structure developed herein. Doing so may lead to higher loss estimates. Yet it would




1 We are not criticizing the FHA’s internal refinance programs. In fact, reducing the frictions for high LTV mortgages to refinance has
been shown to have important macroeconomic benefits (Caplin et. al. 1997). Rather, our criticism is with how these programs are
treated in measuring FHA default rates and projected default losses.
                                                                                                              2

serve the cause of transparency and help policy-makers to determine these organizations' roles in the U.S.

housing finance markets of the future.

    We describe the CoreLogic data in Section 2. We develop and estimate our model of borrower

performance in Sections 3 and 4. We forecast default and prepayment rates in Section 5. In section 6 we show

that the Actuarial Reports understate the risks that FHA-insured mortgages pose to borrowers and taxpayers

alike. Section 7 concludes.




II. The FHA Sample

A. The FHA and the Borrower Experience

    The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was set up in 1934 to improve the functioning of mortgage

markets. Since then it has become an important institution for implementing housing policy, providing strong

support for housing affordability and homeownership. As a result of the recent financial crisis, the FHA has

moved into the unprecedented position of being the low down-payment “lender of last resort.” The FHA

must ensure that alongside its increased market share of mortgage originations it still achieves its key goal of

creating sustainable homeownership.

    What little is known about recent FHA performance with regard to sustainable homeownership is

contained in the FHA’s mandated annual actuarial reviews and its contemporaneous reports to Congress (see

for example IFE [2009, 2010, 2011]). As pointed out by Aragon et. al., one problem with the analyses in the

actuarial review is that the data used does not link together FHA mortgages involved in an internal refinance.

FHA mortgages that undergo an internal refinance are treated no differently than FHA mortgages that finally

pay off thereby removing any further credit risk to the FHA.

    The current mortgage-based approach is inappropriate for the study of sustainability. Instead, one must

focus on the borrower. Specifically, one must construct the borrower experiences by linking together strings

of consecutive mortgages taken out by the same borrower and secured on the same property. A borrower
                                                                                                                                      3

experience begins with the initial exposure of the FHA fund through a purchase mortgage or a refinance

from a non-FHA mortgage and ends either through prepayment outside of the FHA or through default.

Internal FHA refinances carry over the credit risk from one loan to another. Linking together mortgages is

especially relevant for streamline refinance loans with high LTVs because they face a high default risk.



B. Sampling Method

     Using borrower experiences to measure sustainability in homeownership requires data in which

contiguous FHA mortgages on the same home and with the same borrower are linked together.2 In

particular, to follow a borrower experience we need to match FHA mortgages that are the two sides of

an internal FHA refinance. To execute this we specified an FHA borrower data set to CoreLogic, which

made available anonymized data from two of its largest databases: (i) the mortgage servicing database

containing monthly FHA mortgage performance history data from servicers, and (ii) the property

record database containing property record information sourced from county assessors and recorders.

Use of the latter data enables us to identify mortgages from the servicing database that are tied to the

same property, enabling us to link the data. The CoreLogic servicing database includes monthly

performance information for a large percent of the FHA’s outstanding insured mortgage portfolio.

More recent vintages have a higher coverage of FHA loans, due in part to large servicers becoming

more involved in FHA servicing. This database covers more than 7.5 million FHA loans insured

between 2003 and 2011. CoreLogic’s property record database contains information for real estate sales

and mortgage transactions covering 97 percent of the US population.3



2Gerardi et al (2007) is the only other example we are aware of in which the frame of reference is the borrower rather than the
mortgage. They examine the sustainability of borrower experiences that begin with a subprime mortgage.

3CoreLogic’s coverage is 99.9 percent (3,120 counties) of the US population for county assessor-sourced data such as tax valuations
and 97 percent (1,800 counties) of the US population for title and mortgage recordings sourced from county recorders.
                                                                                                                                    4

     CoreLogic was able to identify 282,000 FHA to FHA refinance pairs. CoreLogic also provided FHA

loans that were not internally refinanced – either purchase or external refinance mortgages. To construct a 5

percent representative sample for estimation, we worked backwards in time. In each year, we aligned the

composition of originations across the purchase, external FHA refinance, and internal FHA refinance

categories to published data on the composition of FHA originations. To standardize the sample, we only

selected first-lien, owner-occupied mortgages. Starting in 2010, we randomly selected purchase and refinance

loans to match the published FHA data scaled down to a 5 percent sample. For the internal FHA refinances

that were randomly selected we pulled in the full chain of linked prior FHA mortgages as well. We then

adjusted the required number of mortgages of each type for prior years up to but not including 2010 based on

any linked mortgages that were already selected into the sample by virtue of being part of a borrower

experience linked to the sampled mortgage for 2010. We then repeated the exercise for 2009 and proceeded

in this manner back to 2007.4 Our final sample is a 5 percent random sample of FHA originations from 2007

through mid-2010. These loans have performance data up to September 2011.5

     The random sample generated from the CoreLogic linked data set closely matches published FHA data in

key respects. Appendix Tables A1 to A3 provide comparisons between the published FHA data and our

random sample for average FICO scores, origination loan-to-value (LTV) levels, and early delinquency rates.

These show that the random sample tracks published values of key risk measures quite closely. Since the

origination balance reported in the CoreLogic data incorporates any up-front mortgage premium that was

financed by the borrower, we back out estimates of these origination fees from the initial loan balance in




4
 These refer to FHA fiscal years (which run from Q4 of the prior year through Q3 of the stated year) so that the last loan for any
borrower must be originated no earlier than calendar year 2006 Q4. However, prior loans in a chain for any borrower can have earlier
origination dates.

5We include in the hazard estimation all of the data including the borrower experiences that begin in 2010, but we censor all monthly
observations prior to January 2007. In addition, we restrict our cohort level analysis to FHA borrowers from calendar years 2007 to
2009 for whom a longer history of performance is available.
                                                                                                                                     5

order to make our origination LTV measures comparable to the published FHA data.6 We track the

measured LTV trends quite closely up to the third quarter of 2010. On average however, our early

delinquency rates by year tend to be slightly lower than the published rates.



C. Internal Refinancing

     The data from CoreLogic confirm the significance of the distinction between the borrower experience

and the mortgage experience – our sample shows a high rate of internal refinancing in recent years. Our

sample implies that FHA-to-FHA refinancing in 2009 has been 44 percent as large as the number of purchase

originations, similar to the HUD estimate of 42 percent.

     The FHA’s internal streamline refinance program, in particular, has had a high take-up rate in recent

years. This program is directed towards FHA borrowers with high LTVs that exceed the maximum allowed

for new FHA mortgages. Without necessarily requiring a new appraisal, the program allows these borrowers

to refinance into new FHA mortgages even in cases in which borrowers no longer have enough equity to

meet the standard down payment amount.7 While the FHA has put in place several requirements – for

example, the new balance cannot exceed the prior balance and that the borrower must have a sufficiently

clean payment history – the program allows high-LTV borrowers to lower their monthly payments without

being re-underwritten. Since many of the FHA borrowers refinancing are underwater, it will be difficult for

them to exit the FHA system by either selling the house or refinancing into a non-FHA mortgage. As such,

these borrowers may remain at risk of default for many years.




6 The upfront premium charged for the 2009 fiscal year through March 2010 was 1.75% for fully underwritten loans and 1.5% for
streamline refinance loans. The premium rose to 2.25% in April 2010, for all loans. For loans originated prior to the 2009 fiscal year,
the rule of thumb for fully underwritten loans from 2009-2010 (1.75%) was applied. Upfront premiums can be refunded according to
the following schedule: http://portal.hud.gov/FHA-Handbooks/collections/current/print/4155-2_7.pdf. We adjust the upfront
premiums subtracted from the LTV accordingly.

7 Since no new underwriting is required for a streamline refinance, the origination loan-to-value, debt-to-income, and borrower credit
score is not reported. Since no new underwriting is required for a streamline refinance, the origination loan-to-value ratios, debt-to-
income ratios, and borrower credit scores are not reported.
                                                                                                                                          6

D. Delinquency

       Whether an FHA borrower experience generates a claim against the FHA is not definitively known until

the borrower experience finally terminates. This claim represents the last stage of a process that begins with

an initial delinquency, is followed by serious delinquency, the onset of the foreclosure process, the conclusion

of the foreclosure process, and finally the sale of the property and settlement of the FHA claim.

       The time between the events that precipitated the borrower’s delinquency and the claim is highly variable.

Table 1 illustrates these time lags for various default triggers, where the time lag is defined as the number of

months in an unbroken string of delinquencies from 30-days delinquency until the onset of the specified

trigger. On average it takes 3.9 months, with a standard deviation of 2.4 months, to reach the 90-days

delinquency trigger from an initial delinquency. Pushing back to the beginning of a foreclosure process, the

time lag increases to a mean of 9.6 months with a standard deviation of 6.0 months. Lastly, looking at the

start of the REO process as the trigger, the time lag is 15.8 months with a standard deviation of 7.2 months.

The increase in the variability of the gap between the initial delinquency and the trigger poses a challenge for

specifying an empirical model of the default event.8

       Our assessment of FHA performance requires estimating sustainability for FHA borrower experiences

that are still ongoing. Using 90-plus day delinquency as a measure of sustainability allows us to gain early

insight into what fraction of recent FHA vintages are likely to generate final claims on the FHA, even if these

claims may not materialize until much later. Table 2 shows the fraction of FHA mortgages in our data that

terminate in a claim conditional on the loan reaching a given stage of delinquency. The table shows that in

our data, some 13 percent of loans that reach 90-days delinquency have terminated by the end of our sample,

61 percent of which have generated a claim. We can estimate the “cure” rate for each default trigger by

adding the number of terminated borrower experiences that fully pay off to the number of active borrower

experiences that are no longer delinquent, and then dividing by the number of borrower experiences that ever

reach the default trigger. The estimated cure rate declines from 24.8 percent for the 60-plus default trigger, to

8   The increase in the mean time lag is not as serious a problem since the time-varying control variables can be lagged appropriately.
                                                                                                                                 7

21.2 percent for the 90-plus trigger, and down to 16.4 percent for the foreclosure start trigger. The choice of

the appropriate default trigger needs to balance the aims of a low variability of time since the initial

delinquency with a low cure rate. We define the default event to be the first time the mortgage reaches 90-

days delinquent.



III. The Proportional Hazard Model

A. Econometric Specification

        We use a standard competing-risk model to analyze the impact of borrower risk characteristics, mortgage

and property characteristics, and economic factors on prepayment and default outcomes. We use a

proportional hazard framework assuming independent risks. The prepayment (p) and default (d) hazard rates

since origination at duration t are given by:



                                                                                                                 (1a)

                                                                                                                 (1b)



where g(t) is the baseline hazard function of the time since the mortgage was originated. We approximate the

baseline hazard using a monthly step-function.9 The key assumption is that the explanatory variables Xt shift

the baseline hazard proportionally.10

        As detailed above, we define the default event as the borrower experience first reaching 90-days

delinquent and censor any remaining payment history on the borrower experience.11 We use borrower

experiences as the frame of reference, hence prepayment only occurs when the borrower pays off the FHA


9   See Meyer (1990) for an early example of using step-function approximations to the baseline hazard.

10   See Kalbfleisch and Prentice (2002) for details.

11That is, we do not model whether a seriously delinquent mortgage cures or the time it takes to work through the various stages of
foreclosure to a final claim.
                                                                                                                 8

mortgage by either selling the house or refinancing into a non-FHA mortgage. We follow each borrower

experience starting in the third month after its origination date up until either the borrower prepays, the

default event occurs, or the sample ends.12 Our data are at a monthly frequency.

       With the estimated prepayment and default hazards we can estimate the probability that any active FHA

borrower will default over a specified horizon and consequently, the probability that the borrower experience

survives this horizon. Let S denote the estimated joint survivor function, given by:


                                                                                                          (2)


where t indexes the number of months into the forecast period and S(0) equals one.

       For forecasting default and prepayment probabilities, we need to specify the path of the dynamic

variables over the forecast horizon. The estimated probability that an active FHA borrower experience with

current duration t will default and prepay over the next T months is given by:


                                                                                                          (3a)



                                                                                                          (3b)


       We compute these default and prepayment projections for all active FHA borrower experiences starting

at the end of our sample to generate an overall prepayment and default rate.

       While the default and prepayment hazards condition on a large list of observable factors that could affect

default, there may still be unobservable factors that are important for determining default rates. For example,

these unobservable factors may be correlated with the “vintage” of the mortgage when it was underwritten.




12
     The third month is the first time period that the borrower is at risk of going 90 days delinquent.
                                                                                                                       9

We test for the presence of unobserved determinants by estimating the model allowing for a parametric

distribution of the unobserved heterogeneity. The data indicate that this distribution was degenerate.13



B. Variables in the Specification

       The CoreLogic data provide information on a variety of borrower, loan, and property risk characteristics.

We supplement these with data on economic factors and state legal requirements that may impact underlying

mortgage performance. For a borrower with more than one FHA mortgage, we use reported characteristics

of the refinances as opposed to carrying over characteristics from the previous loan. In the case of streamline

refinances however, where data are often missing, we carry over loan characteristics from the previous loan.

Summary statistics of the variables in the estimation are given in Table 3. The first panel presents summary

statistics of static variables for underwritten loans (not streamline refinances) whose values do not change

over the life of the underlying mortgage. The second panel presents dynamic variables whose values are time-

varying. For the categorical variables, the left-out group is selected to be the high-quality or relatively more

common mortgage type characterized.

       A borrower’s current LTV likely impacts the probability of default and prepayment. We calculate this

using the current mortgage balance – reflecting amortization, any accelerated payments, and inclusive of any

upfront mortgage insurance premium financed by the borrower – and an estimate of the current value of the

home. To estimate the house value each month, we update the appraisal value of the property using the

CoreLogic metro area overall repeat-sale house price indices. Thus, the current LTV is a dynamic variable

that changes to reflect both debt amortization as well as house price changes. For streamline refinances, we

impute the origination LTV using the updated LTV at the end of the prior FHA mortgage. In the estimation,

we include intervals for this current LTV variable beginning with an indicator for 80-84 LTV to an indicator

for 120 LTV or higher. The left-out category is a current LTV below 80.




13   That is, the variance of the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity was converging to zero in the estimation.
                                                                                                              10

       Two other important borrower-specific risk factors are the credit score and the debt-to-income ratio

(DTI). For underwritten mortgages, we observe the borrower’s FICO score at the origination date, so in our

data FICO is a static variable that does not change over the life of a mortgage. However, it can change

between mortgages for a given borrower experience if more than one underwritten mortgage is involved. For

internal FHA refinances, we use the new FICO score if the loan is underwritten, while we carry over the

FICO score from the prior FHA mortgage for streamline refinances. In the estimation, we include a series of

indicator variables for FICO score ranges from below 580 to 680-719. The left-out category is a FICO score

of 720 or higher. We include a separate indicator if the FICO score is missing and the mortgage is not a

streamline refinance.

       We also include the borrower’s back-end DTI which is a measure of the borrower’s ability to meet

monthly mortgage payments. The numerator of the back-end ratio is the sum of the annual mortgage

payments, property taxes, house insurance and any other annual recurring debt payments such as student

loans, auto loans and minimums on credit card balances. The denominator is the borrower’s annual income.14

We include indicators for DTI intervals from 28 – 35, 36 – 43, and 44 or higher. The left-out category is a

back-end DTI of less than 28. We include an indicator if the DTI is not recorded and the mortgage is not a

streamline refinance.

       Additional indicators are included for the type of mortgage (FRM is the left-out type), term of the loan

(30-year is the left-out term), reason for the mortgage (purchase loan is the left-out reason), level of

documentation (full documentation is the left out status), and property type (single family residence is the

left-out property type). In addition, we control for the size of the FHA mortgage at the origination. Models of

strategic default predict that the default risk increases with the mortgage balance since the costs of default are

mostly fixed while its benefits tend to increase with the size of the remaining balance.15




14   In cases where there is a co-applicant for the mortgage the sum of the two annual incomes is used.

15   See for example Haughwout et al (2010).
                                                                                                                                   11

       Several local economic variables are included. To ensure that the coefficients on the LTV indicators

reflect the effect of the borrower-specific equity position on observed default behavior, we include the 12-

month change in local house prices to capture the effect of non borrower-specific factors. FHA mortgages

with high LTVs are likely to be in local housing markets that have suffered more serious house price declines

and have faced many other economic challenges as well. While we attempt to control for local dynamics,

there are other stress variables not completely captured in our data. Including the change in local house prices

helps isolate any of these left-out factors that are correlated with declining house prices, which in turn impact

borrower behavior.

       The effect of an unemployment spell on a borrower’s behavior is difficult to capture since we do not

observe these spells.16 The local unemployment rate is our best proxy, although it is not highly correlated with

the unobserved borrower-specific unemployment. We include the MSA unemployment rate reported by the

U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics lagged 6 months to take into account the time lag between the onset of

unemployment and when the borrower reaches the 90-day delinquency status. The unemployment variable is

dynamic at a monthly frequency.17

       We capture the incentive to prepay a mortgage by including a spread variable that reflects the decline in

interest rates since origination. This is calculated each month by taking the difference between the average 30-

year fixed-rate mortgage interest rate at the origination month and its average value at that month, then

setting it to zero if the difference is positive, i.e. interest rates have increased.18 To the extent that there is

value in the option to refinance a mortgage, the refinance incentive can reduce the likelihood of default.




16 See Foote et al (2008) and Gerardi, Shapiro, and Willen (2007) for discussions of the “double-trigger” hypothesis that the
combination of a borrower being in negative equity and then suffering an income shock leads to a higher likelihood of default and
foreclosure. Aragon et al (2010) show that FHA borrowers who are significantly underwater are also dangerously exposed to
unemployment risk. The question is how to take this into account given micro hazards do not feature the unemployment rate.

17 For purchase mortgages, we zero out the first four observations (months 3 – 6 following origination) on the unemployment

variable since the lag value is pointing to a time before the mortgage is underwritten. This is based on the premise that an unemployed
borrower would not be approved for a new FHA mortgage.

18   We use the mortgage rate reported in the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey.
                                                                                                            12

        Local contagion can affect a borrower’s decision to default as well. A recent survey (Fannie Mae,

[2010]) finds that borrowers who know someone who has experienced a foreclosure are more than twice as

likely to seriously consider default compared to borrowers who do not.19 We control the contagion effect by

including the number of distressed sales per 10,000 households in the MSA. We calculate a three-month

moving average of distress sales for each MSA using CoreLogic data. The number of households in the MSA

is taken from the 2008 American Community Survey.20

        Finally, the legal environment that governs how mortgage delinquencies are handled varies by state and

we include two variables to capture this variation. First, mortgages originated in a state with a judicial

foreclosure process can expect delays in completing any foreclosure, which could incentivize borrowers to

strategically default.21 An indicator for judicial foreclosure is included in the estimation. Second, mortgages

are considered as recourse depending on the state, meaning the lender has the ability to pursue a defaulted

borrower with a deficiency judgment. Recourse loans potentially provide more security to the lender and as a

result, borrowers may be less likely to default. We also include an indicator for recourse.

        A concern with loan-level data is that we only have information on first lien mortgages. If the borrower

takes out second liens, then the actual combined LTV will exceed the measured LTV used in the analysis.

This will bias the hazard coefficient estimates on the LTV intervals to the extent that second liens are

prevalent in the data. To explore this we examined a unique panel data set which links credit files across

household members constructed by Equifax for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to calculate what

fraction of FHA borrowers have second liens. However, we did not find this to be a source of concern.22



IV. Estimation Results

       We report the exponentiated hazard coefficients from the estimation in Table 4. A reported hazard above

(below) one indicates a higher (lower) prepayment or default risk relative to the baseline borrower experience

consisting of high-quality, fully-documented, 30-year, fixed-rate purchase mortgages with current LTV below

80, FICO score above 720, DTI below 28, and secured by a single family residence.

       We begin by examining the impact of the current LTV on the default and prepayment risks. 23 The results

show high LTV to be an important driver of FHA default risk, which rises monotonically with the estimated

current LTV of the underlying mortgage. A borrower with an estimated current LTV between 100 and 104 is

more than twice as likely to default compared to a borrower with an estimated current LTV below 80. As we

raise the current LTV to 120 or higher, the relative default risk increases to over three and a half times higher

than the baseline. These estimated LTV effects reflect changes in default risks holding constant the change in

local house prices over the past year.

       LTV is also a determinant of prepayment. Recall that prepayment in our borrower-based data involves

either paying off the mortgage due to a sale of the house or refinancing to a new non-FHA mortgage. Finding

the required resources to pay off a mortgage in full is particularly hard for borrowers in negative equity (LTV

more than 100) who need to make up the difference between the property value and the mortgage balance in




22 The Equifax data follows a 5 percent random sample of households over time by linking credit files across household members. As
of December 2009, the data indicate that only 6.7 percent of FHA borrowers had some form of a second lien. In contrast, 27.6
percent of prime borrowers and 25.9 percent of non-prime borrowers hold at least one second lien. Conditional on an FHA borrower
having a second lien, the average balance on the second lien is 22.4 percent of the existing combined balances across all liens. Hence
not having data on second liens poses less of a problem for FHA borrower experiences. We also looked at households with an FHA
mortgage and no other first lien mortgage. While it is possible that the borrower has two homes, with an FHA mortgage on one
house and only a second lien on the second house, we do not expect many such cases. It is then highly likely that any existing second-
liens are tied to the same property.

23   Note however that the measured current LTV for a borrower is a noisy measure of the true current LTV.
                                                                                                                                    14

cash.24 Comparing a borrower with an estimated current LTV of 100 – 104 to one with an estimated LTV

below 80, the prepayment rate is reduced to 64 percent of the baseline. As we raise the estimated current

LTV to 120 or higher, the prepayment rate declines only slightly further to 50 percent of the baseline. A

borrowers with an underwater mortgage faces a combination of a high default risk and a low prepayment rate

which implies a high cumulative probability that the borrower experience will be non-sustainable.

       The FHA has stressed the improvement in the FICO scores for its new originations over the past couple

of years as a factor that will hold down credit losses compared to earlier vintages.25 This improvement in

FICO scores can be seen in Table A1 where the average FICO score for all new originations went from the

low to mid 600s in 2007 to close to 700 in 2010. Our results confirm that the credit score at origination is a

strong predictor of default. The default risk rises dramatically as the borrower’s FICO score is lowered.

Relative to a borrower with a FICO score above 720, the default hazard is over seven times higher for

borrowers with FICO scores between 580 and 619, and over ten times higher for borrowers with FICO

scores below 580.26

       The affordability of the FHA mortgage as gauged by the borrower’s back-end DTI is also a determinant

of the sustainability of an FHA borrower experience. Recall that the back-end DTI captures not only the

mortgage and related housing costs (such as property taxes and insurance), but also other recurring debt. As

we move from a borrower with considerable budget leeway (a back-end DTI below 28) to a borrower who is

more cash-flow constrained in making all required payments (a back-end DTI of 44 or higher), the relative

default hazard increases by more than 50 percent.




24
   The effect of this “collateral constraint” on prepayments has previously been observed in other mortgage products (see Caplin et al
(1997)). The FHA streamline refinance program is designed precisely to prevent the collateral constraint imposed by high LTVs from
limiting borrowers’ ability to refinance.

25
     See Secretary Donovan’s written testimony before the House Committee on Financial Services, December 1, 2011.

26Deng and Gabriel (2006) also find that FICO scores are a strong predictor of FHA defaults using data covering from 1992 to 1996.
Their results indicate a smaller effect than our findings. This may reflect that they can control for other borrower characteristics such
as age, sex, race and number of dependents.
                                                                                                                     15

       Turning to the other mortgage-specific factors, we find that borrower experiences that begin with a

cash-out refinance mortgages are 28 percent more likely to default and 47 percent more likely to prepay

(holding constant the current LTV and the mortgage balance). In terms of documentation, the results indicate

that borrower experiences involving mortgage originations with less than full documentation are associated

with lower default risks than the baseline. However, the data also indicate that borrower experiences

involving mortgages with missing LTV, FICO and DTI information all have significantly higher default risks.

The mortgages with these missing origination characteristics are concentrated in the low- and no-doc loans.

Taken together, this indicates that mortgages that are not subject to full underwriting pose higher credit risks

to the FHA. Adjustable rate mortgages are over three times more likely to prepay than FRMs. Lastly,

borrower experiences with higher mortgage origination balances have higher prepayment and default risks.

The higher default risk is consistent with simple models of strategic default where the incentive to strategic

default is increasing in the mortgage balance controlling for the current LTV (see Haughwout et al (2010)).

       Housing market-specific variables are meant to capture economic determinants of prepayment and

default. As noted earlier, the local unemployment rate is included as a proxy for whether the borrower

experiences an unemployment spell. While measurement error will attenuate the estimated impact, the data

still suggest that the lagged MSA unemployment rate is significantly related to the default risk on an FHA

borrower experience. Controlling for the current LTV, declining house prices over the past year are

associated with rising prepayment and default risks. This could reflect a variety of other economic factors in

local housing markets that are correlated with declining house prices. The data do not indicate the presence

yet of a contagion effect from distress sales. With regard to the interest rate incentive to prepay, the interest

rate spread is a strong predictor of prepayment for borrower experiences involving fixed-rate FHA

mortgages.27

       Finally, the legal environment governing mortgage lending which varies by state affects default risk. The

data indicate that judicial foreclosure is associated with higher default risk on FHA borrower experiences,


27   Deng and Gabriel (2006) also find this result for a sample of FHA mortgages originated between 1992 and 1996.
                                                                                                                16

supporting the hypothesis that some borrowers strategically default. As noted earlier, mortgages with

recourse should raise the costs of default and therefore lower the default risk on a mortgage. The data

indicate, however, that default risk is 11 percent higher for borrower experiences located in states with

recourse lending.



V. Forecasts

       We use the estimated model to generate default and prepayment forecasts for the portfolio of active

FHA borrower experiences as of the end of our estimation sample. The forecast is performed over a five-year

horizon where we use updated dynamic variables based on consensus forecasts for four underlying data series

– house prices, unemployment rate, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage interest rates and distressed sales ratios. In

particular, the unemployment rate is projected to decrease at an increasing rate, going down by a total of 2.9

percentage points at the end of five years.28 Mortgage rates are projected to increase by 20 basis points in each

of the five years.29 The percent of distressed sales is projected to stay at current levels for the first two years,

then to return to average historical levels over the next three years.30 Finally, average nationwide house prices

are projected to decline by around 2.5 percent in the first two years then slowly appreciate in the next three. 31

For simplicity, the forecast paths of the economic variables are assumed to be the same across all

metropolitan areas covered by our data. We simulate the performance of FHA borrowers from the end of

our sample period in October 2011 until September 2016 according to the methodology described in Section

IIIA.

    One might expect the sustainability performance of a particular vintage of FHA borrowers to improve

with the passage of time because this has certainly been the historical pattern based on mortgage based

analysis. Unfortunately, this appears to be less apparent with recent vintages of FHA borrowers. Default rates

are projected to remain high for years to come as shown in the 5-year projections given in Table 5. In

particular, 31 percent of loans are expected to default within this time frame. Looking across the three

vintages, the cohort of 2007 FHA borrowers is projected to perform the worst with as much as 53 percent of

borrowers defaulting on their loans. While the 2009 vintage is projected to perform better, the default rate is

still estimated to be around 23 percent.

    In addition to the continuing high rate of default, the other striking factor is how few are projected finally

to graduate to sustainable homeownership by paying off their FHA-insured mortgages in full. Across all three

vintages more than twice as many borrowers are projected to become 90 or more days delinquent as are

projected to fully achieve sustainable homeownership.

    There is a simple reason why recent FHA borrowers may not fit the historical pattern in which after a

few years default rates decrease rapidly over time. In the past, generally rising house prices and the availability

of non-FHA mortgages have made it possible for borrowers to pay off their FHA mortgages in full. Neither

of these routes is currently available for most FHA borrowers. There has been little or no increase in prices

since these borrowers purchased their homes – in fact, we estimate that 40 percent of the active loans at the

end of our sample period are in negative equity, and another 20 percent are near negative equity with an LTV

of 95 to 100. Additionally, house prices are not expected to significantly increase over the next five years. As a

consequence, many recent FHA borrowers are likely to remain vulnerable to economic shocks so that

defaults are projected to continue at a high rate.

    The bottom line is that while borrowers from 2009 are projected to perform better than those from 2007

and 2008, there is little reason to argue that sustainability issues were confined only to the 2007 and 2008

vintages of FHA borrowers.

VI. Underestimation of Risk

        The FHA is designed to be a self-funded mortgage insurance program and not to need direct taxpayer

support. To gauge the FHA’s performance and to evaluate its financial condition, an external audit of its

insurance fund is conducted each year. A key part of this audit review involves projecting future default of

currently active FHA mortgages. For the past three years, default projections from the prior year have been

revised upward.32

        The recent systematic underestimation of future credit losses may be due to deficiencies in the audit

analysis (Gyourko [2011). Aragon et al [2010] argued that an important flaw is the data framework used in the

analysis – it is based on FHA mortgages rather than on FHA borrower experiences. In the mortgage-based

view an internal refinance is treated as a successful exit as if the credit risk had been eliminated. Meanwhile, in

the borrower experience view, subsequent mortgages taken out by the same borrower are tracked and the

borrower’s risk only leaves the FHA system when the borrower pays off the final FHA mortgage in full. This

is quantitatively important since recent reductions in mortgage interest rates have dramatically increased the

volume of internal refinancing from one FHA mortgage into another. In our sample where we track

borrowers and their multiple mortgages, we estimate that only 6.4 percent of FHA borrowers since 2007 have

successfully exited the FHA program. In contrast, if we use the mortgage data framework, the success rate is

three times as high at 19.4 percent.33 This reflects the fact that a majority of terminated mortgages have in fact

immediately been refinanced back into new FHA mortgages.

        The intuition that an analysis using mortgages rather than borrowers overstates successes and understates

future losses has not resonated with everyone for a couple of reasons. First, it is standard academic and

industry practice to perform credit risk analysis at the mortgage level. In this sense, the external audit is

implementing what is considered the “best practice”. Second, some have argued that there is no


32   IFE 2009 (page i), 2010 (page iii) and 2011 (page iii).

33Around 18 percent of our borrowers have two or more FHA mortgages comprising their current borrower experience. The time in
months between a mortgage origination (either a purchase mortgage or a refinance from a non-FHA mortgage) to an internal
refinance peaks at around 12 months.
                                                                                                            19

understatement of risk because for internal refinances the credit risk is carried forward in the data as the

FHA mortgage that prepays is replaced by the new FHA mortgage. As a consequence, the credit risk is not

treated in the data as if it has terminated even if mortgages are analyzed individually rather than as a linked

sequence.

    Our customized FHA data allow us to further investigate the implications of the data structure on

projected credit losses. We already presented the hazard estimates based on analyzing the data organized by

borrower experiences in Table 4. For comparison, Appendix Table A4 presents the hazard estimates based

on analyzing the data organized by mortgages. It is important to highlight that the same data is used in both

cases, the same variables are used to explain defaults and prepayments, and the same statistical model is used

in the estimation. The only difference is how the unit of observation is defined – a borrower experience

versus a mortgage.

    The relative hazard coefficients between the two approaches are similar in many respects. The key

difference is seen in the coefficients of the high LTV indicators in the prepayment hazards and in the baseline

hazards. Data organized according to borrower experiences indicate that those with a current LTV of 120 or

higher have a prepayment rate that is only 50 percent of the rate for borrowers with a current LTV of 80 or

less. In contrast, data organized according to mortgages reveal a relative prepayment rate of 78 percent that of

the baseline. The same pattern exists for each of the high LTV indicators which indicate that the FHA’s

streamline refinance program helps reduce the friction that high LTVs create for refinancing. This contrast is

evidence that the FHA streamline refinance program is achieving its goal of allowing more high LTV FHA

borrowers the opportunity to refinance to a lower mortgage rate.

    Figures 1 and 2 contrast the default and prepayment baseline hazards between the borrower and

mortgage data frameworks. The baseline default hazard curves are very similar for both data frameworks for

the first two and a half years. Afterwards, the borrower baseline default hazard is above the mortgage baseline

default hazard. However, the differences are more apparent for the baseline prepayment hazards. The

mortgage data approach significantly raises the estimated baseline prepayment hazards relative to the
                                                                                                                             20

borrower-centered data approach particularly in the first two years.34 The striking difference in the

estimated baseline prepayment hazards meaningfully impacts default projections going forward by

underestimating the amount of time for which the borrower will remain at risk of default. This is illustrated in

Figure 3 where we show the estimated prepayment survivor functions over the five year forecast horizon for

the active mortgages at the end of our sample. At any point in the forecast horizon, the survivor functions as

we have constructed them indicate the fraction of the borrowers (or mortgages) that would be predicted to

still be active assuming that there are no exits due to serious delinquency. Using borrower data, 92 percent of

the borrowers are predicted to still be active in five years. In contrast, using mortgage data, only 47 percent of

the mortgages are predicted to still be active in five years – a decline of 45 percentage points.

     Table 6 provides the 5-year projections of the estimated hazard models based on the two different

frameworks for the same set of mortgages that are still active at the end of our sample. To reiterate, the only

difference is due to the data structure since all variables, including forecast paths of time-dependent variables,

are identical. Using the data organized by borrower experiences, we estimate that 7.3 percent of the currently

active borrowers will prepay over the next five years. In contrast using the data organized by mortgages, we

estimate that the prepayment rate will be much higher at 47.5 percent. Switching the analysis from FHA

borrowers to mortgages increases the forecasted prepayment rate by 40 percentage points due to the recent

heavy use of the FHA’s internal refinance programs. Similarly, using the estimates from the borrower data we

project that 17.3 percent of the active mortgages at the end of our sample will reach 90 days delinquent over

the five year forecast horizon. In contrast, using the estimates from the mortgage data we project that only

11.2 percent will reach 90 days delinquent.

     The 2010 audit report on the FHA’s mutual mortgage insurance fund indicated that the FHA linked their

streamline refinances for the purpose of initializing the origination LTV on the streamline refinance. In

addition, the FICO and DTI information was filled in from the prior FHA mortgage. However, mortgages


34While the direction of the effect on the baseline prepayment baseline hazards should be robust, the magnitude of the difference
between the borrower and mortgage based hazards will depend on the degree to which the borrower data base spans periods where
the internal refinancing activity has been less active than of recent.
                                                                                                       21

rather than borrowers were still used as the unit of observation. Instead, mortgages that began as a

streamline refinance were allowed to have separate estimated default and prepayment hazards.35 This raises

the question of how this strategy does at approximating the results one would obtain from switching to the

borrower data framework. The results in Table 6 indicate that in our sample of FHA data this strategy moves

the projections in the direction of those obtained by the borrower based analysis, but only partially. For

example, using our borrower-based methods, we project defaults over the next five years to be more than

twice as high as successful exits. Even after applying the FHA’s new estimation strategy, defaults over the

next five years are projected instead to be less than half as high as successful exits. The continued over-

counting of successful exits results in a potentially significant underestimate of the risk to the FHA’s

insurance program.



VII. Concluding Remarks

       We produce first results on the sustainability of homeownership for FHA borrowers between 2007 and

2009. More than 15 percent of these borrowers have already been 90 days or more delinquent, with less than

half that number graduating to sustainable homeownership by paying off all FHA mortgages. We project that

the proportion who have been 90 days or more delinquent will rise above 30 percent within five years. Fewer

than 15 percent will have fully graduated to sustainable homeownership.

       We show that accurately measuring sustainability requires a new data structure organized around

borrowers rather than mortgages. The current mortgage based data structure results in future defaults being

under-estimated and prepayments overestimated. This combination artificially lowers loss estimates to the

FHA’s insurance fund. This same data structure is used by the GSE’s (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), which

therefore understate the risks their mortgages pose to borrowers and to taxpayers.

    Opening up FHA and GSE data to researchers is important to help inform the debate of how the U.S.

housing finance markets can rebuilt on more stable foundations. Even without making their data publicly

available, the FHA and the GSE’s could readily adopt the borrower-based data structure developed herein.

This would serve the cause of transparency and help policy-makers to determine these organizations' roles in

the U.S. housing finance markets of the future.

Notes: FHA statistics are from the FHA Quarterly Reports. Fiscal years run from October of the prior year
through September of the indicated year. The FHA LTV averages exclude any financed up-front mortgage
insurance premium from the loan balance. The up-front premium charged from FY09 through March 2010
was 1.75% for fully underwritten mortgages, and 1.5% for streamline refinanced mortgages. Starting in April
2010 the up-front premium was increased to 2.25% for all mortgages. Prior to FY09 the premiums varied. We
adjust the CoreLogic LTV by backing out these up-front mortgage premiums.
