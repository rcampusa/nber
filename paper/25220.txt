We develop a New Monetarist model with expenditure and unemployment risks that generates
equilibria with non-degenerate distribution of money holdings. Distributional effects can overturn
key insights of the model with degenerate distributions, e.g., the value of money depends on the
income distribution; a one-time money injection raises aggregate real balances in the short run –
price adjustments look sluggish; anticipated inflation can raise output and welfare; there can be a
long-run trade-o¤ between inflation and unemployment. Distributional effects also generate a
quantitatively significant aggregate demand channel through which transfers financed with
money creation can raise employment, and productivity shocks are amplified.

1         Introduction
This paper studies equilibria of a New Monetarist model with both expenditure and income
risks and non-degenerate distributions of money holdings.1 While the literature following La-
gos and Wright (2005) focuses almost exclusively on equilibria with degenerate distributions
of money holdings, we explore the region of the parameter space where equilibria feature
endogenous ex-post heterogeneity. We show that a large class of those equilibria remain
analytically tractable and exhibit distributional e¤ects that can overturn key insights of the
model regarding short-run money neutrality, the e¤ects of anticipated in‡ation on output
and welfare, and the relationship between in‡ation and unemployment. Moreover, the in-
come distribution, the distribution of real balances, and labor market outcomes are jointly
determined, which has novel implications for policy and the ampli…cation of productivity
shocks.
        Our environment is composed of workers who receive opportunities to consume early, in
a decentralized market where money is essential (because credit is not incentive-feasible), or
late, in a centralized market. In the late period, they receive an income, , that they can
use to accumulate liquid assets in the form of real balances. If  is not too large, it takes
        2 periods, where  is endogenous, for a worker with no money to reach his targeted real
balances ( = 1 in the Lagos-Wright model). As a result, the distribution of money holdings
is non-degenerate and value functions are strictly concave in money holdings. In contrast
to the Lagos-Wright model, the value of money at a steady-state equilibrium increases with
workers’income, which creates a channel through which the income distribution a¤ects …rms’
pro…ts, entry, and hence unemployment.
        We …rst illustrate the distributional e¤ect in the context of an elementary classical mone-
tary experiment: a one-time, unanticipated increase in the money supply, as …rst envisioned
by Hume (1752) and Cantillon (1755). We characterize the transitional dynamics for alloca-
tions and prices when the increase is engineered via a "helicopter drop" of money to workers
in the centralized market. If workers can reach their targeted real balances in a single pe-

Wright (2017).

riod,  = 1, as in the Lagos-Wright model, such a money injection has no real e¤ect, i.e.,
the price level adjusts proportionally to the money supply instantly. In contrast, if       2
then our model features non-trivial transitional dynamics. For instance, if  = 2 then a
one-time increase in the money supply raises aggregate real balances, i.e., the price level
does not increase as much as the money supply. The distribution of real balances becomes
less dispersed in the following decentralized goods market, which raises social welfare. We
provide conditions under which the injection of money triggers a de‡ation in the short run,
in accordance with the "price puzzle" of Eichenbaum (1992).
   Next, we incorporate exogenous income risk by assuming that  follows a two-state
Markov chain where the low state is interpreted as unemployment. In the Lagos-Wright
model, income risk is irrelevant since it does not a¤ect workers’ choice of real balances
(e.g., Berentsen, Menzio, and Wright, 2011). In contrast, when         2 income risk matters
and the distribution of real balances becomes a function of the income distribution across
workers. It follows that the e¤ectiveness of monetary policy depends on the state of the
labor market. For instance, a one-time injection of money is more likely to have real e¤ects
when unemployment is high and the income of the unemployed is low. Anticipated in‡ation
can raise welfare when unemployment is high.

aggregate demand channel: when a shock redistributes liquidity towards those workers who
face tighter liquidity constraints, then total expenditures increase and …rms …nd it optimal to
post more vacancies, which ultimately reduces unemployment. This leads to new predictions.
First, an increase in unemployment bene…ts reduces unemployment. Second, there is a long-
run Phillips curve if money growth is implemented by transfers to workers. The resulting
trade-o¤ between in‡ation and unemployment is exploitable and can raise society’s welfare.
Third, the aggregate demand channel ampli…es productivity shocks. Indeed, as productivity
goes up, the fraction of employed workers increases. Employed workers accumulate real
balances faster than unemployed, which generates an increase in aggregate real balances.
The ultimate impact on unemployment is quantitatively signi…cant: relative to a model
without aggregate demand channel, the elasticity of unemployment to a productivity shock
increases by about 30 percent.


1.1    Literature review
Our paper is part of the literature on search equilibria with distributions of money holdings,
starting with Diamond and Yellin (1985) in a model with price posting. This literature
includes Green and Zhou (1998) and Zhou (1999) under price posting, Camera and Corbae
(1999), Molico (2006), Zhu (2005) under bargaining, and Menzio, Shi, and Sun (2013) in a
model of posting with directed search. A key assumption of our model is that the economy
is composed of two goods traded in alternating markets as in Lagos and Wright (2005)
and Rocheteau and Wright (2005). In that vein, Chiu and Molico (2010, 2011) relax the
assumption of quasi-linear preferences but they have to solve the model numerically. Zhu
(2008) achieves tractability by assuming overlapping generations of …nitely-lived agents while
Berentsen, Camera, and Waller (2005) assume two rounds of decentralized trade before
agents can readjust their money holdings. In contrast, we work with a similar environment as
in Lagos-Wright and Berentsen, Menzio, and Wright (2011) but study equilibria with binding
constraints (on consumption or labor supply) that have not been investigated before. Those
equilibria are tractable and can be solved in closed-form. Moreover, we study out-of-steady-
state dynamics, income risk, and unemployment. Chiu and Molico (2014) and Jin and Zhu

                                              3
(2014) also study transitional dynamics following "helicopter" drops in the context of the
Shi-Trejos-Wright model with general distributions of money holdings and show, through
numerical examples, that a money injection can have a persistent e¤ect on output and price
adjustments are sluggish. Their …ndings are broadly consistent with our analytical results.
       This paper is related to the continuous-time model of Rocheteau, Weill, and Wong (2018),
who consider a competitive economy populated with ex-ante identical agents, along the lines
of Bewley (1980) and Lucas (1980). In contrast, we study a discrete-time economy with
random matching and non-competitive pricing. In discrete time, the distribution of money
holding is often simple – for instance, we show that, in a quantitatively realistic region of
the parameter space, the distribution of money holdings has just two points,  = 2. Such
a simple distribution of money holdings facilitates the analysis of transitional dynamics, the
study of income risk, and the introduction of a frictional labor market. The combination
of both random matching risk and employment risk is related to Algan, Challe, and Ragot
(2011) who study temporary and permanent changes in money growth in a Bewley economy.
Related to Lippi, Ragni, and Trachter (2015) the e¤ects of lump-sum monetary injections
depend on the state of the economy. Our expenditure shocks are similar to the uncertain
lumpy expenditures in the Baumol-Tobin model of Alvarez and Lippi (2013), but we do not
take the consumption path as exogenous and we endogenize the income risk.
       Our extension with a frictional labor market is related to the Mortensen-Pissarides model
of Krusell, Mukoyama, and Şahin (2010) with risk-averse agents who self-insure by accumu-
lating capital. In our model, agents self-insure with money holdings against both expenditure
and income shocks, which allows us to study monetary policy. Equity shares play no insur-
ance role as they are held by risk-neutral entrepreneurs.2 However, our model incorporates
an aggregate demand mechanism that operates through the composition of early and late
consumption and the distribution of money holdings. A key di¤erence relative to Berentsen,
Menzio, and Wright (2011) is that the income risk arising from the frictional labor market
matters since wealth e¤ects are present in equilibria with nondegenerate distributions. The

induced relationship between the income distribution and the distribution of liquidity can
overturn some policy predictions and generates an ampli…cation mechanism.
        Our paper is related to the recent literature on heterogenous agent new-Keynesian (HANK)
models recently surveyed by Kaplan and Violante (2018). This literature studies cashless
economies with monopolistic competition, sticky prices, and uninsurable idiosyncratic risk,
and analyzes the redistributional e¤ects of monetary policy implemented via Taylor rules. In
contrast, in our model monetary policy is conducted through changes in the money growth
rate and we do not assume nominal rigidities.3 We introduce two types of goods, early- and
late-consumption goods, which allows us to endogenize the real value of …rms’ sales as a
function of the distribution of real balances. Importantly, the distribution of liquidity across
workers matters for the composition of …rms’sales, which in turn a¤ects …rms’incentives to
open jobs and feedbacks into employment risk.


2         Environment
Time,  2 N0 , is discrete and the horizon is in…nite. Each period has three stages. In the
…rst stage, a subset of agents are subject to income shocks. In the second stage, agents trade
in a decentralized retail market (DM). In the third stage, they trade in a centralized market
(CM). The DM and CM consumption goods are perishable and the CM good is taken as the
numéraire.
        The economy is populated by two types of agents: a unit measure of workers and a
large measure of risk-neutral entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs consume in the CM stage only.
Workers consume in both DM and CM stages but only work in the CM stage. The period
utility function of a worker is " () +  where  2 f0 1g is a preference shock,  2 R+

    There are similarities. For example, in Kaplan, Moll, and Violante (2018), monetary policy impacts hand-
to-mouth households through their labor income and the …scal implications of the policy and unconstrained
households through a change in the rate of return on liquid assets. In our model, households who are away
from their targeted real balances are a¤ected by the growth rate of money through …scal e¤ects and a change
in the rate of return of money. Households who have reached their target are a¤ected via the rate of return
of money only.

is (early) DM consumption and  2 [0 ] is (late) CM consumption, with   0.4 We
assume that          is continuously di¤erentiable, bounded, and strictly concave with (0) = 0,
 0                       0
     (0) = +1, and           (+1) = 0. Preference shocks, f g are i.i.d. across agents and time with
Pr ( = 1) =         and Pr ( = 0) = 1 ¬ . The period utility of an entrepreneur is  2 R+ .
The discount factor across periods,                     (1 + )¬1 2 (0 1), is common to all agents.
         Workers are in one of two states,  2 f0 1g, interpreted as employment states, i.e.,  = 1
if the worker is employed and  = 0 if the worker is unemployed. This state evolves according
to a Markov process with transitions occurring in the …rst stage. A transition from  = 1
to  = 0 occurs with probability . Likewise, a transition from  = 0 to  = 1 occurs with
probability . We endogenize                      in Section 7 in a frictional labor market, along the line
of Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). We denote                                 =( + ), which corresponds to the
steady-state measure of workers in state  = 1. A worker in state  receives a real income,
 , at the beginning of the CM stage, where 1                        0 .
         Entrepreneurs can be active or idle. We assume that the measure of active entrepreneurs
is equal to the measure of workers in state  = 1, which is . We justify this assumption
in Section 7 by having each active entrepreneur operating a technology requiring a single
worker, as in the Mortensen-Pissarides model. Each active entrepreneur creates  units of
     4
    The upper bound only plays a technical role: it keeps value functions bounded, which allows us to
apply standard dynamic programming results. Throughout, we choose  to be su¢ ciently large so that in
equilibrium   never binds for any agent.


                                                               6
output at the beginning of each period. Output is perfectly storable across stages and can
be divided into  units of DM output and  ¬  units of numéraire. Hence, the opportunity
cost of selling  in the DM is exactly . Output is perishable across periods.
    Market structures di¤er in the DM and CM. In the DM, the demand from                    workers
with a preference for early consumption is divided randomly and evenly among  active
entrepreneurs, i.e., each entrepreneur serves a fraction     =  of the overall demand. We
assume a simple trading mechanism according to which entrepreneurs charge a constant
gross markup         1 over their linear cost, i.e., each unit of DM consumption costs      units of
numéraire. The key feature of this trading mechanism is that entrepreneurs enjoy a markup
over their average cost, which would also be true under bargaining, competitive pricing with
strictly convex costs (e.g., Rocheteau and Wright, 2005), or monopolistic competition (e.g.,
Silva, 2017). The case       = 1 coincides with the commonly-used mechanism whereby the
buyer makes a take-it-or-leave-it o¤er to the producer. Given this markup, we denote   0
            0
such that       ( ) = . As will become clear later,  is the demand of a worker who is not
cash constrained in the DM. In the CM, all agents are price-takers and markets clear.
    In the absence of enforcement and monitoring technologies, debt contracts, either across
stages or across periods, are not incentive feasible. There is an intrinsically useless, perfectly
divisible and storable asset called money that agents can (but don’t have to) use as a medium
of exchange to overcome these frictions. We use  to denote the money supply at the start
of period . The CM price of money in terms of the numéraire is        .   The gross rate of return
of money between time  and  + 1 is denoted +1          +1 =  .




3     Equilibrium
We characterize an equilibrium in three steps. First, we study the decision problem of a
worker who takes as given the sequence of rates of return on money, f+1 g+1
                                                                           =0 . Second,

given the worker’s optimal consumption/saving decisions, we write the law of motion for the
distribution of real balances. Third, we clear the money market in every CM in order to
obtain the value of money, f  g+1                                         +1
                                =0 , and hence its rate of return, f+1 g=1 = f
                                                                                                 +1
                                                                                        +1 =  g=0 .



                                                7
For now entrepreneurs are passive — they do not hold liquid assets, they make no entry
decision, and they price their early sales at a constant markup.


Value functions Consider …rst the problem of a worker at the beginning of the CM of
period  with employment state  2 f0 1g holding                0 real balances (money balances
expressed in terms of numéraire). We analyze this problem given two restrictions on the
sequence of returns f+1 g+1
                           =0 . First, there exists some   0 such that, for all            0,
+1  . This …rst restriction rules out hyper-in‡ationary dynamics where the gross rate
of money approaches 0. Second,

                                 =1                   =1


This restriction allows us to prove the di¤erentiability of the value function. Both restrictions
will be veri…ed for the steady states and transitional dynamics we analyze in the paper.
   The value function of a worker at the beginning of the CM solves:

       ( ) = max
                   0
                      f +  [+1 ( 0  0 )]g s.t.  0 = +1 ( +  ¬ )    0,       (2)
                     0


where +1 is the value function of the worker at the beginning of +1 following the realization
of the employment state, 0 , but before entering the DM. (We use a prime to denote a state
variable in the following period). Correspondingly, the operator  takes expectations over
0 , conditional on the current employment state, . According to (2), the worker chooses
his consumption, , and next-period real balances,  0 , in order to maximize his expected
discounted continuation value in  + 1. The budget constraint speci…es that the next-period
real balances must be non-negative, and equal to current real balances and income net of
consumption multiplied by the gross rate of return of money. The value functions are indexed
by  as the gross rate of return of money, +1 , might vary over time.
   The lifetime expected discounted utility of a worker at the beginning of the DM is:

                   ( ) =   max [ () +  ( ¬ y )] + (1 ¬ ) ( )                 (3)

                                                   8
With probability , the worker receives a preference shock for early consumption, in which
case he consumes  in exchange for y real balances. With probability 1 ¬ , the worker
does not wish to consume early and enters the next CM with  real balances.

Proposition 1 Given f+1 g+1
                           =0 satisfying (1), the Bellman equations (2) and (3) have
unique bounded solutions,  ( ) and  ( ), that are continuous, concave, strictly in-
creasing, and satisfy
                                             + k k                   + k k
                             k k                   and k k                 

Moreover,  ( ) and  ( ) are continuously di¤erentiable with 0 (0+  )  1 and
0 (0+  ) = 1 for all  2 f0 1g.

       In order to prove Proposition 1 (see Appendix) we use (2) and (3) to de…ne a contraction
mapping from the set of bounded functions into itself. In order to establish di¤erentiability,
we apply the envelope theorem of Rincón-Zapatero and Santos (2009).


Choice of real balances Let                     denote the Lagrange multiplier associated with              0.5
When  = 0, the worker …nds it optimal to forego all consumption in the current CM
in order to accumulate real balances he can spend in the following DM. Substituting  =
 +  ¬  0 +1 into the objective, we rewrite the worker’s problem as:

                         ¬1
    ( ) =  +  + +1 max
                              0
                                 f¬ 0 + +1  [+1 ( 0  0 )] +           [+1 ( +  ) ¬  0 ]g    (4)
                                        0


If      0 does not bind, then          = 0 and the choice of next-period real balances is independent
of current wealth and  is linear in . However, if                  0 binds,          0, then the choice
of real balances is no longer independent of current wealth and  is no longer linear in 
— the two key ingredients for the tractability of the Lagos-Wright model. The …rst-order
condition for the choice of real balances is

                                              0
                      ¬  ( ) + +1  +1 ( 0  0 )     0   “ = ”if  0  0                        (5)
   5
    Throughout, we assume  is large enough so that   never binds in the decision problem of an agent
with real balances , for all  in the support of the money distribution.

where   ( )         0 ( ) = 1 +      measures the marginal cost of accumulating real balances,
              0
and +1  +1 ( 0  0 ) is the marginal expected bene…t. We denote +1
                                                                         

It equalizes the marginal utility of consumption, one, with the discounted marginal value of
                                                                                                       
real balances in the next DM. The constraint                      0 does not bind if  +           +1 +1 .


Choice of early consumption. The solution to the maximization problem on the right
side of (3) is

                                         0¬1
                          ( ) =            [ W0 ( ¬ y )] if      0
                                                                              (= )  W0 (0 );                 (7)

                                   = =         otherwise.                                                        (8)

According to (7)-(8), whenever possible the worker equalizes its marginal utility of early
                     0
consumption,             (), with its opportunity cost measured by W0 . Using that 0 ( ¬ y )
is non-increasing in , it follows that  ( ) is non-decreasing in . If                       0 does not bind
in the following CM, then 0 = 1 and  ( ) =                  0¬1
                                                                         ( ) =  . If        , where  is the
solution to

                                                             = W0 (0 )                                        (9)

then the worker spends all his real balances. From Proposition 1, 0 (0 )  +1 and hence
  0. We summarize the optimal solution to (3) in the following proposition.

Proposition 2 (Early consumption) For given f+1 g+1

Distribution of real balances. We denote  () the measure of workers in state  2
f0 1g holding no more than  real balances at the start of the CM stage (before late con-
sumption) in period . It solves:
                               Z
                   () =            If¬   y () g   + (1 ¬ )If   g    ()            (10)
                      () = 0 () + 1 ()                                                   (11)

where  () is the measure of workers in employment state  with less than  real balances
at the start of the DM market of period . The …rst term on the right side of (10) captures
the measure of workers who receive a spending opportunity in the DM and enter the CM
with  ¬ y ( ) real balances. The second term corresponds to workers who do not receive
a spending opportunity. The measure of workers at the start of the DM market is given by:
                                     X      Z
                      0 +1 () =   0 If+1 () g  ()              (12)
                                        2f01g

where 0 is the transition probability from  to 0 , e.g., 01 =      and 10 = , and +1 ( ) is
the CM choice of real balances conditional on holding  real balances in employment state .
Hence, the distribution of real balances across all workers is given by  () = 0 ()+1 ().
Finally, we assume that the measure of workers who are initially in state  = 1 is equal to
the steady-state measure,
                                           0 =  =                                                 (13)

Value of money The value of money is determined by the following money market clearing
condition:                                            Z
                                                =        ()                                  (14)

It depends on the distribution, which itself depends on policy rules. The rate of return of
money is                                          R
                                                +1 +1 ()

   Finally, we impose the following feasibility condition in the DM goods market:
                                 X Z
                                           ( ) ()                                       (16)

                                                      11
where       =     denotes the measure of workers with a preference for early consumption
per active entrepreneur. This condition requires that the demand for DM consumption per
entrepreneur is no greater than the output of each entrepreneur. It is satis…ed provided that
 is su¢ ciently high.

De…nition 1 Given some initial distribution of nominal money balances, 0 , a perfect-
foresight monetary equilibrium is composed of:

    1. A sequence of value functions, f   g+1
                                                =0 , that solve the Bellman equations (2) and
         (3).

    2. A sequence of prices, f   +1 g+1
                                         =0 that solve the market-clearing condition, (14), and
         the de…nition (15).

    3. A sequence of distributions of real money balances across workers, f     g+1
                                                                                             =0 ,
         that solves the law of motions (10)-(11), (12),  () = 0 () + 1 (), and 0 () =
         0 (= 0 ).

    4. Distributions and policy functions satisfy the feasibility condition in the DM goods
         market, (16).

    The value functions cannot in general be determined independently from the sequence of
prices and distributions. An exception is given by steady-state equilibria where f         g   is
constant over time and the gross rate of return of money is  =         +1 =    = 1.


4        Money in the long run
In this section, we shut down employment risk,           = 0, so that all workers are employed,
 = 1, and receive the same income  = 1 , and we specialize our analysis to steady-state
equilibria where workers in the DM spend all their real balances,    . This class of
equilibria encompasses equilibria with degenerate distributions studied in Lagos and Wright
(2005) and Rocheteau and Wright (2005), LRW thereafter. It also contains equilibria with
non-degenerate distributions where value functions are strictly concave and wealth e¤ects
exist.

                                                 12
Targeted real balances The marginal value of real balances at the beginning of the DM
is
                                             
                          0 () =       0
                                                   + (1 ¬ )() 8                  (17)

where the …rst term on the right side is the expected marginal utility of real balances in
the DM. From (6) with  = 1 and  = 1, because we focus on steady-state equilibria with
constant money supply,   solves:

                                     0                          
                                                   =         1+                        (18)

At the targeted real balances, the marginal utility of DM consumption is equal to the product
of two wedges: the markup and the average holding cost of real balances due to discounting.


Distribution of real balances Workers increase their real balances by  until they reach
their target or until they receive an opportunity to consume in the DM and deplete their
money holdings. Hence, the support of the distribution of real balances across workers at
the beginning of a period is f 2  ( ¬ 1)   g where  2 N solves
                                                        h          i

The distribution  is composed of  mass points, f g
                                                      =1 , where  is the measure of

workers holding  for all  2 f1   ¬ 1g and  is the measure of workers holding their
target,   . We have:

                          1 =                                                          (20)
                           = (1 ¬ )¬1 for all  2 f2  ¬ 1g                        (21)

                           = (1 ¬ ) ¬1                                             (22)

According to (20), a measure     of workers receive a preference shock for early consumption,
in which case they spend all their real balances. Those workers start the following period
with 1 =  real balances. According to (21)-(22), workers with ¬1 = (¬1) real balances
in a given period hold  =  in the following period if they do not have a preference for


                                                        13
early consumption, with probability 1 ¬ . From (20)-(22), the distribution of real balances
is a truncated geometric distribution:

                            =    (1 ¬ )¬1 for all  = 1   ¬ 1                        (23)
                            = (1 ¬ ) ¬1                                                   (24)

                                                                         P
Value of money and prices. Aggregate real balances are M =                =1     . From (23)-
(24), and after some calculation, this gives

                             1 ¬ (1 ¬ ) ¬1 [( ¬ 1) + 1]
                   =                                       + (1 ¬ ) ¬1                  (25)

Aggregate real balances do not depend on the nominal money supply and hence money is
neutral in the long run.

Proposition 3 (Distribution of real balances and workers’ income) Consider a
steady-state equilibrium with full depletion of real balances (   ) featuring a  -point
distribution of real balances. If  = 1 then M =   , which is independent of . If           2,
then ( M )  0.

   If the distribution of money is degenerate,  = 1, then M reduces to   . In that case,
workers’income does not a¤ect aggregate real balances. In contrast, for a given             2 the
value of money increases with  and it decreases with . For instance, in the case  = 2
aggregate real balances are a weighted average of income and target,  =  + (1 ¬ )  .
The fact that income matters for the mean of the distribution will generate a new aggregate
demand channel with implications for (un)employment once we endogenize the measure of
entrepreneurs/…rms in Section 7.


Marginal value of real balances From (5), () =  0 ( 0 ) where  0 = minf +    g.
Substituting  0 ( 0 ) by its expression given by (17) the marginal value of money solves

late consumption, plus the discounted sum of the di¤erences between the marginal utility of
DM consumption at a point in time and the marginal utility of consumption at the targeted

5          Money in the short run
There is a long tradition in monetary economics to study the e¤ects of unanticipated changes
of the money supply on the dynamics of prices and the real economy, going back to Cantillon
(1755) and Hume (1752), and more recently Friedman (1969), Lucas (1972) and Wallace
(1997). For instance, Hume considers the following thought experiment: "For suppose that,
by miracle, every man in Great Britain should have …ve pounds slipped into his pocket in
one night; this would much more than double the whole money that is at present in the
kingdom." We consider a related experiment where the monetary authority transfers  ,
with         0, in a lump-sum fashion to all workers at the time they enter the CM of  = 0.6 We
contrast the e¤ects of such an "helicopter drop" on equilibria with a degenerate distribution
( = 1) and equilibria with a nondegenerate distribution ( = 2).
                                                                                         0
         As a benchmark, consider …rst equilibria with  = 1, which requires                 ( )    (1 + = ).
                                                              
From (6) and (17), the targeted real balances at time  + 1, +1 , are determined by the fol-
lowing Euler equation:
                                                
                                           0   +1
                                 +1                      +1¬      = 1 for all    1                    (28)

By substituting 1 = 1  [ 0 (1 + ) ] and +1 = +1
                                                     

     6
     Similarly, Friedman (1969) introduces the famous "helicopter drop" parable: "Let us suppose now that
one day a helicopter ‡ies over this community and drops an additional $1,000 in bills from the sky, which is,
of course, hastily collected by members of the community. Let us suppose further that everyone is convinced
that this is a unique event which will never be repeated."

    The value of money adjusts instantly to its new steady state so that aggregate real
balances are constant. The money injection has no real e¤ects.
    In the rest of this section, we focus on equilibria with  = 2, which requires  
   0¬1
         [ (1 + = )]   2. The initial distribution of money, 0 , corresponds to the steady-
state distribution where a measure                   of workers hold  =  [  + (1 ¬ )  ] and a
measure 1 ¬       hold  =    [  + (1 ¬ )  ]. At the beginning of the CM of  = 0,
after a round of DM trades, the distribution of money holdings has three mass points. There
is a measure      of workers holding no money (the workers who had a preference for early
consumption in the previous DM), a measure (1 ¬ ) holding  , and a measure (1 ¬ )2
holding  .
    Assuming      is close to 0, and by continuity with respect to the steady state, we conjecture
that the distribution of real balances at the start of the DM,  ,                           1, has two mass points,
1 and  . The …rst mass point, 1 , corresponds to the real balances held by the                          workers
who depleted their money holdings in the previous DM. At  = 1, 11 = 1 ( +                                0 )   while
for all     2, 1 =  . The second mass point,  , corresponds to the targeted real balances
of the remaining 1 ¬       workers who were unmatched in the DM of  ¬ 1. It solves

                            0                          1 +  ¬ 

Aggregate real balances are equal to the population-weighted average of 1 and  :

This system is the analog of (29)-(30) for equilibria featuring  = 2.

Proposition 6 (Money injection with nondegenerate distributions) For all                                            close
to 0, there exists a unique solution to (33)-(34) that becomes stationary starting at  = 2
with  = 1 and            (1   + ) =  + (1 ¬ )  for all                   2.

     2. Initial aggregate real balances are

                                                                 ( ¬ )    ( + )
           then 0  1, i.e., there is de‡ation in the short run.

     4. There is a mean-preserving reduction in the distribution of real balances in the DM of
            = 1 and an increase in society’s welfare.

         The initial value of money,           0,   does not fall in the same proportion as the increase in
 so that aggregate real balances rise above their steady-state value. The economy returns
to its steady state in the CM of  = 1.7 Hence,                     0      1    and 1  1. To understand why
 0         1,   assume instead that the price adjusts instantly to its steady state value,                    0    =   1.
     7
    We show in Rocheteau, Weill, and Wong (2015) that transitional dynamics following an unanticipated
increase in the money supply are long lasting for equilibria featuring  3.


                                                            18
Then, since 1          1= 0   = 1, the real balances of unconstrained workers remain equal to
their steady-state value,   . At the same time, constrained workers …nd it optimal to save the
lump-sum transfer, and hence their real balances are larger than their steady-state value. On
aggregate, real balances are thus larger than their steady-state value, which is inconsistent
with our premise. Therefore, in equilibrium,              0   has to rise above its steady-state level for
1 to fall, so that unconstrained workers …nd it optimal to hold lower real balances.8
       The money injection generates a redistribution of real balances and consumption. The
1¬        workers who are unconstrained by their income when choosing  respond to a lower
1 by reducing . As a result, they consume less relative to the steady state, 1    .
In contrast, the       workers who are constrained by their income in the CM can raise  by
saving the lump-sum transfer, and hence they consume more in the following DM. Total real
balances spent in the DM are the same as in the steady state, but welfare is higher due to
better risk sharing under workers’concave preferences. Also, if the DM production cost of
entrepreneurs is convex, then DM output increases (see Rocheteau, Weill, and Wong, 2015).
       The real value of money in the initial steady state is (1 + ) 1 : it exceeds the real value
of money in the new steady state by a factor equal to the growth rate of the money supply,
1 + . Under condition (37), according to which the target for real balances is su¢ ciently
inelastic in , the money injection causes the real value of money to rise on impact, at  = 0,
before falling at time  = 1. Hence, we obtain the paradoxical result that a small money
injection generates de‡ation followed by future in‡ation.9
       We conclude this section by discussing the robustness of our results to alternative transfer
schemes. While lump sum transfers to workers have distributional e¤ect, it is well known
that proportional transfers are neutral, in the sense that they neither impact relative prices
nor agents’decisions. The converse is also true: in order to be neutral, a transfer scheme
   8
     Proposition 6 has been derived for close to 0. If the money injection is su¢ ciently large, then workers
who enter the CM of  = 0 with depleted money holdings can reach their target 1 solution to (31), i.e., the
distribution of real balances is degenerate, and 1  1 solves 1 =  +(1¬ )  . Moreover, 1  (1+ )¬ 1 ,
so that prices increase relative to their initial steady-state value.
   9
     This …nding is consistent with the "price puzzle" from Eichenbaum (1992) according to which a con-
tractionary shock to monetary policy raises the price level in the short run.



                                                     19
must be proportional. We can weaken the notion of monetary neutrality and characterize
transfer schemes that have distributional e¤ects but leave aggregate real balances unchanged.
If the proceeds of money creation go exclusively to workers who can reach their target in one
period, then the standard argument for neutrality applies: since those agents can reach their
target without the transfer, they spend the transfer …nanced with money creation on late
consumption, the price level adjusts instantly, and aggregate real balances are unchanged.
   Conversely, using the same proof by contraction as above, aggregate real balances increase
provided that transfers are not proportional and some of the money newly created goes to
workers who cannot reach their target in a single period. For instance, if both workers and
entrepreneurs receive a lump-sum transfer equal to (1+ ), then 1  1 (see Rocheteau,
Weill, and Wong, 2015). The same result holds if the proceeds from money creation are given
exclusively to workers who just depleted their money balances (i.e., workers who experienced
a preference shock for early consumption).
   Finally, suppose that the monetary authority uses the seigniorage revenue for its own
consumption by purchasing goods in the CM. Workers and entrepreneurs do not receive any
transfer. The     workers with depleted money balances accumulate 1  real balances (in
terms of  = 1 CM goods). The (1 ¬ ) workers with low money balances accumulate 1
if they are unconstrained and 1  + (1 + ) otherwise. The (1 ¬ )2 workers with large
money balances accumulate 1 if they are unconstrained and 1  +   (1 + ) otherwise. It
is easy to check that if 1 +    (  ¬ ) then 1 = 1, the value of money adjusts instantly
to its new steady state, and there is no transitional dynamics. These results show that in
the presence of ex-post heterogeneity the details of monetary policy implementation matter
considerably. While there is more to be done on this topic, we hope our results illustrate
the importance of incorporating distributional considerations to understand the transmission
mechanism of monetary policy.

6        Income risk
We now reintroduce the income risk,                0 and   1. We focus on equilibria with full
depletion, in which employed workers are similar to the agents in the LRW model in that
they can reach   in a single period, 1    . In contrast, unemployed workers are similar
to the agents in Section 5 and can accumulate   in  = 2 periods, i.e., 0                         20 .10
We study the e¤ects of both one-time money injections and constant money growth.


One-time money injection We revisit …rst the experiment in Section 5 that consists in
a small money injection through a lump-sum transfer to all workers. The rate of return of
money in the …rst period, 1 , solves a generalized version of (35),

                              1 0 + (1 ¬ ) 1
                                                   = 0 + (1 ¬ )                                      (38)
                               1 ¬ u  (1 + )
                  0¬1                                                        0¬1
where 1 =             [ + (1 +  ¬ 1 ) = 1 ] and where   =                   ( + r ). The novelty
is that 1 now depends on the unemployment rate,  = 1 ¬ , where  solves (13). Hence,
short-run dynamics depend on the state of the labor market.

Proposition 7 (Money injection with income risk) Assuming  is small, the e¤ect of
a one-time, unanticipated money injection on the rate of return of money is approximately
                                                                 ¬1
                                     1           ln(1 )
                                              ¬                       0.
                                                   1

       The e¤ect of unanticipated in‡ation on the rate of return of money is the product of
three terms: the frequency of expenditure shocks,                , the measure of unemployed, , and
the inverse of the interest-rate semi-elasticity of money demand. The key insight is that the
state of the labor market matters for the e¤ectiveness of monetary policy. If  is close to 0,
then 1 is close to 1 and money is almost neutral. In contrast, if  is positive, then a money
injection reduces 1 below one and raises aggregate real balances.
  10
    It is easy to see that, in this case, targeted real balances,   , are independent from the worker’s em-
                                                                                 ¬1 0
ployment status. The condition for full depletion of real balances, (0 0)           (  = ) = 1 + = , can be
                            0            0  
reexpressed as =        [ (0 = ) ¬ ( = )] = .

Anticipated in‡ation We now turn to the case of constant money growth, +1 ¬  =
  , implemented via lump-sum transfers to workers in the CM. In steady state  = (1+ )¬1
and   solves
                                           0                  
                                                    =     1+                                       (39)

where          (1 + )(1 + ) ¬ 1. The quantity  can be interpreted as the nominal interest
rate on an illiquid bond that can be held by entrepreneurs only.11 By the same reasoning as
above, aggregate real balances are:
                                                0 + (1 ¬ )(1 + ) 
                                M        =                                                        (40)
                                                    1 + (1 ¬ )
Aggregate real balances depend on the income distribution through  and 0 : they increase
with 0 but, since 0  1 , they decrease with . In turn, the sales of each entrepreneur
expressed in terms of the numéraire depends on aggregate real balances as follows:
                                                     ¬1
                                               =          + ,                                    (41)

where       =     is the measure of early consumers per entrepreneur so that the …rst term
corresponds to the pro…t made on selling early consumption at markup                   . From (40), 
increases with  because it determines how much early consumers can spend on goods sold
at a markup. Given the dependence of  on the income distribution, it follows that 
increases with 0 and decreases with . These relationships generate an aggregate demand
channel through which unemployment and income a¤ect entrepreneurs’revenue.
       In terms of the transmission of monetary policy, money creation reduces the demand
for real balances of unconstrained workers,   , by lowering the rate of return of money,
but it increases the real balances of the  constrained workers through the distribution of
lump-sum transfers.

Proposition 8 (The in‡ation-output trade-o¤ ) A small in‡ation raises  and  if
                               00
                                    (  = )(  = )                

   An illiquid bond that could only be traded in the CM would exhibit a liquidity premium by allowing
workers to manage more e¢ ciently their holdings of liquidity in the CM. See, e.g., Rocheteau, Weill, and
Wong (2018).

                                                     22
               0¬1
where   =          [ (1 +  )].

    If   is relatively inelastic to a change in , as implied by (42), then an increase in   above
0 a¤ects mostly the real balances of the poorest workers. As a result, a small increase in
raises  and, from (41), entrepreneur’s output, . The condition for a positive output e¤ect
of in‡ation, (42), is more likely to hold when  is large, which is another example where the
state of the labor market matters for the e¤ects of monetary policy. Finally, in‡ation also
raises social welfare by reducing the dispersion of the distribution of real balances.
    We conclude this section by describing succinctly equilibria where both employed and
unemployed workers need two periods to reach their targeted real balances. A worker in state
 in the CM with depleted real balances starts the following period with ( +  ) (1 + )
real balances. Hence, aggregate real balances are

                                (0 + 1 ) + (1 ¬ )(1 + ) 
                             =                                
                                        1 + (1 ¬ )
Aggregate real balances increase with the mean income, 0 + 1 . An increase in the
employment rate raises  if 1  0 . So we now have a channel through which wages can
a¤ect real balances, which in turn a¤ect …rms’sales. We explore this channel further in the
next section in a model with …rm entry.


7     Unemployment and the distribution of money
We now introduce a frictional labor market in the …rst stage (see Figure 2), as in Mortensen
and Pissarides (1994), in order to endogenize the employment risk,          and . This extension
generates equilibria of the Berentsen, Menzio, and Wright (2011) model as a special case but
also new equilibria with a non-degenerate distribution of money holdings across workers. In
order to start production and become active, an entrepreneur must now hire a worker in a
…rst-stage frictional labor market. The cost to open a vacant job in period  is   0 incurred
in the CM of  ¬ 1. We assume that there is a su¢ ciently large measure of idle entrepreneurs
so that, with free entry, the ex ante expected pro…ts of posting a vacancy are equal to zero.
The worker’s job …nding probability, ( ), is an increasing and concave function of labor

                                                23
market tightness, , de…ned as the number of vacancies per unemployed, with (0) = 0 and
 0
     (0) = 1. The vacancy …lling probability is ( )= .
          The expected discounted pro…ts of a …lled job are           = (1 + ) ( ¬ 1 ) ( + ), where
1 is now the wage paid by the entrepreneur to his employee and  is total sales per job
expressed in terms of the numéraire as given by (41).12 The decision of an idle entrepreneur
to enter the labor market and post a vacancy obeys the following optimality condition:

                                      ( )        ¬ 1
                               ¬ +                           0, " = " if    0                       (43)
                                                 +

The …rst term on the left side is the cost to open a vacant job while the second term is the
probability to …ll the job times the expected discounted pro…ts of the job. Unless speci…ed
otherwise, the revenue from money creation is distributed in a lump-sum fashion to all
risk-neutral entrepreneurs, and hence it does not a¤ect job creations.
          Substituting  by its expression given by (41) into (43), where           =  represents the
number of early consumers per …lled job, assuming an interior solution, and keeping in mind
that  = ( ) [ + ( )], we obtain that labor market tightness solves

                               ( + )  ¬ ( )( ¬ 1 )                         ¬1

                                        + ( )

where ( ) is a measure of entry costs net of pro…ts from sales in the CM and  
represents pro…t margins on early sales due to the positive markup (where   stands for
markup). The following lemma gives important properties of the LHS.

Lemma 1 Assuming  ¬ 1  0, there is                     0 such that: (0) = ( ) = 0, ( )  0
                                            0
for all        2 (0 ), and ( )  0,  ( )  0 for all           .

          In the textbook Mortensen-Pissarides model,          = 0 and   = 0, the intersection of 
and the horizontal axis determines          = , marked "  " in the left panel of Figure 4.
     12
     Entrepreneurs cannot commit, and hence they cannot issue claims on the pro…ts of the jobs they created.
It follows that pro…ts are discounted according to the entrepreneurs’ rate of time preference. For related
models of unemployment where claims on …rms’pro…ts are liquid and the real interest rate is endogenous,
see Krusell, Mukoyama, and Şahin (2010) and Rocheteau and Rodriguez (2014).



                                                         24
       We consider …rst equilibria studied in BMW where both employed and unemployed work-
ers can accumulate   in a single period, which requires 0    . The pro…t margins on
early sales are   =        ( ¬ 1)   = and the equilibrium reduces to a triple (     ) solu-
tion to (13), (39) and (44). Graphically, the equilibrium is determined at the intersection
of  and the   curve, marked "   ". Notice that, in this case, the   curve
is horizontal. This property is a consequence of the distribution of money holdings being
degenerate: all workers, unemployed or employed, have identical money demand,   . As a
result, real balances,   , are una¤ected by labor market outcomes, such as  , ( ), and .13
An increase in the in‡ation rate reduces  and   , thereby shifting the   curve downward
and reducing .

7.1       Ex-post heterogeneity across unemployed workers
We now consider the same type of equilibria as those studied in Section 6 where employed
workers reach   in a single period, 1    , whereas unemployed workers reach   after
  13
     In Berentsen, Menzio and Wright (2011) the steady-state equilibrium might not be unique because the
arrival rate of spending opportunities, , is an increasing function of , which creates strategic complemen-
tarities between …rms’entry decision and households’choice of real balances.


                                                          25
two periods, 0 2 (   (1 + )    ). In a steady state  workers hold 0 real balances
and 1 ¬  hold   so that

                                              ¬1
                              = (1 ¬             ) [(1 ¬ )   + 0 ]                          (45)

In the right panel of Figure 4, the  -curve is now upward sloping. Indeed, as                increases,
the share of workers who are employed rises. Employed workers have su¢ cient income to
reach their target holdings in one period, while unemployed workers cannot. As a result,
when the share of employed workers rise, the aggregate amount of liquidity accumulated
increases, which raises the aggregate demand for early consumption.
       The fact that   increases with         generates a novel ampli…cation mechanism to a
productivity shock.14 If  increases, more jobs are opened, which reduces the measure  of
workers with low real balances and raises the demand for early consumption. This generates
an endogenous increase of  and more entry. In Figure 4, an increase in  shifts the  curve
upward. If we keep  constant in the expression for  , then               rises to point 1. However,
because  is endogenous and decreases with , market tightness rises further from point 1 to
point 2.
       Equation (45) shows that the income distribution across workers a¤ects the distribution
of liquidity and, ultimately, entrepreneurs’pro…ts. Consider an increase in unemployment

for all      1 and   0. The size of this e¤ect increases with the unemployment rate, the
frequency of expenditure shocks, the markup, and the rate of return of money. From (44)
we have the following implications for unemployment.
  14
    This ampli…cation mechanism is distinct from the one in BMW where the frequency of early-consumption
opportunities, , is an increasing function of . In contrast, we assume that is constant. Our ampli…cation
mechanism operates through the distribution of real balances across workers that depends on the state of
the labor market.



                                                     26
Proposition 9 (Unemployment insurance and liquidity) Suppose 0 is …nanced with
a lump-sum tax on all entrepreneurs, irrespective of entry decisions, and 1 is exogenous.

  1. If the equilibrium features  = 1 then an increase in 0 has no e¤ect on aggregate real
      balances or (un)employment, 0 = 0 = 0.

  2. If the equilibrium features  = 2 then an increase in 0 increases the distribution of
      real balances in a …rst-order stochastic sense and it reduces unemployment, 0  0
      and 0  0.

   Graphically, if  = 1 then the   curve is independent of 0 . Indeed, an increase in
unemployment bene…ts does not change the demand for real balance, and so it leaves early
consumption the same. If  = 2, by contrast, the   curve shifts upward. In that case,
workers who just received a preference shock for early consumption and depleted their money
balances use all their unemployment bene…ts to replenish their real balances, thereby raising
the demand for early consumption, entrepreneurs’pro…ts, and aggregate employment.
   We now turn to the e¤ects of monetary policy described as a constant money growth rate.
In order to separate the monetary from the …scal implications, we maintain the assumption
that the money supply grows through lump-sum transfers to all entrepreneurs irrespective
of their entry decision. Pro…t margin from early sales depend on  as follows:

                                       ¬1                
                            = (1 ¬             ) (1 ¬ )        + 0  0
                                                         

If the target for real balances is inelastic,        0, then the strength of the transmission
mechanism is determined by 0 . Monetary policy is more e¤ective in economies with high
unemployment and low income for the unemployed.
   If the revenue from money creation is rebated in a lump-sum fashion to all workers then,
from (40),

                             ¬1                 ¬1       0 + (1 ¬ )(1 + ) 
                                 =                                           
                                                             1 + (1 ¬ )

In‡ation reduces   but the revenue from money creation …nances a transfer to workers, a
fraction  of whom are constrained by their income when choosing . From Proposition 8,

                                                  27
in‡ation raises  if (42) holds. As a result, entrepreneurs’pro…ts and employment increase.
So the model can generate a long-run Phillips curve with an exploitable trade-o¤ between
in‡ation and unemployment.15 We summarize these results with the following proposition.

Proposition 10 (Long-run Phillips curves) Consider an equilibrium with  = 2 and
in the neighborhood of 0.

   1. Money growth through lump-sum transfers to entrepreneurs raises unemployment,  
         0, i.e., the long-run Phillips curve is upward-sloping.

   2. Money growth through lump-sum transfers to workers reduces unemployment,  
         0, if (42) holds, i.e., the long-run Phillips curve is downward-sloping.


7.2        Ex-post heterogeneity across employed workers
Suppose now that both employed and unemployed workers need two periods to reach their
targeted real balances, 1    and 0 (1 + )    .16 The margins on early sales are
now:
                                             ¬1
                            = (1 ¬              ) f 0 + 1 + (1 ¬ )  g                      (46)

where the right side of (46) takes into account that  () has three mass points, i.e.,                  
workers hold 0 real balances,  hold 1 , and the remaining 1 ¬                      hold   . The  -
curve in the right panel of Figure 4 is now a function of 1 . As 1 increases, the average
real balances of employed workers increase and so does their early consumption. The size of
this e¤ect, is
                                                    2           ¬1

                                         1
It increases with          and    . In the following, we determine how an increase in 1 a¤ects
aggregate real balances and employment. We start from an equilibrium where all workers
have the same income, 0 = 1 .
  15
   Rocheteau, Rupert, and Wright (2008) also obtain a long-run trade-o¤ between in‡ation and unemploy-
ment in a New Monetarist model with indivisible labor by assuming substituability between CM and DM
goods. However, exploiting this trade-o¤ is not welfare improving.
                                                          h                  i

       The condition for full depletion of real balances is        0 (0 = ) + 1 ¬   1 + = .

Proposition 11 (E¤ ects of wages on liquidity and employment) Suppose  = 1,
0 = 1 , and consider an equilibrium with  = 2. A small increase in 1 , keeping 0
constant, raises  but reduces .

   Even though an increase in 1 raises aggregate real balances and sales to early consumers,
the positive e¤ect on aggregate demand is outweighed by the negative e¤ect on the labor
cost. Hence, aggregate employment decreases.
   The total margins on early sales increase with . Formally,
                                            2            ¬1

                                 
The strength of this e¤ect increases with the income di¤erence between the employed and
the unemployed. If the increase in  also raises 1 , e.g., through wage negotiation, then the
e¤ect becomes even stronger since  2  1   0. We now turn to this possibility by
endogenizing wages.
   Suppose  = 1 (to ease the exposition) and 1 =  + (1 ¬ )0 , where                    is interpreted
as workers’bargaining power. Then, the revenue of a job is
                                      ¬1

                                              1 ¬ 2 (1 ¬ ¬1 )
A change in  has a multiplier e¤ect:
                                                     1
                                     =              2 (1     ¬1 )
                                                                      1                           (48)
                                     1¬               ¬
If  increases, then 1 increases by . Because a fraction                   of employed workers are con-
strained when choosing their real balances, the increase in 1 raises aggregate real balances
and the demand for early consumption, which raises . This generates a further increase of
1 . And so on.
   The equilibrium condition for market tightness, (44), is rewritten as
                      ( + )  ¬ ( )(1 ¬ ) ( ¬ 0 )

The key novelty is that   is now directly in‡uenced by productivity, , since  a¤ects 1 ,
which a¤ects the distribution of real balances. Equilibrium is represented in Figure 5. We
can decompose graphically the e¤ects of an increase in  into three components. First, there
is a shift to the right of the  curve, which corresponds to the direct e¤ect of  on     in
the MP model. Graphically,     increases to the point marked "1" in Figure 5. Second, there
is a movement along the JC curve toward the upward-sloping   curve, from "1" to "2"
because the endogenous increase in     raises , which in turn generates an increase in the
distribution of liquidity across workers (in a …rst-order stochastic dominance sense). Third,
there is a shift upward of the   curve because the increase in  raises 1 through the
wage negotiation, which also improves the distribution of liquidity across workers. Market
tightness increases from "2" to "3".

We now provide a quantitative illustration of the ampli…cation mechanism associated with
the joint determination of the income distribution and the distribution of real balances. Our

 2 (0 1), and , are set following Shimer (2005). The wage is set according to 1 =
  + (1 ¬ )0 where      is chosen to generate a realistic labor share. We interpret 0 as
unemployment bene…ts …nanced by a tax on …lled jobs where the level of this tax corresponds
to an average corporate tax rate of 35 percent, as in the U.S. prior to 2018. The gross
markup on early consumption is set to         = 215 in accordance with De Loecker, Eeckhout
and Unger (2018). The economy-wide markup of 61 percent pins down the size of DM sales
relative to overall sales. We identify        based on some measure of velocity of money for
early-consumption goods. Preferences for early consumption take the form   1¬ (1 ¬ )
where the parameters  and  are set to match the level and elasticity of aggregate money
demand. Finally, the vacancy posting cost is chosen so that the free entry condition holds.

and a permanent change in the money growth rate, and we compare the results to the
ones obtained under two alternative versions of the model: a version similar to Berentsen,
Menzio, and Wright (2010), labeled as “BMW", where agents face no constraint on money
accumulation in the CM,  = 1, and a nonmonetary version as in Mortensen and Pissarides,
labeled “MP" where we shut down the demand for early consumption.

   Consider …rst an increase in productivity, . The quantitative responses are signi…cantly
larger in our model than in the BMW and MP models: the response of unemployment is
about 30% larger, and the response of aggregate output is about 25% larger. It should be
noted that we obtain quantitatively signi…cant e¤ects even though our model and calibra-
tion have features that tend to weaken the aggregate demand channel: preference have no
curvature in the CM and little curvature in the DM ( = 013) and unemployment bene…ts
provides a large amount of insurance (0 = 0821 ).
   Our second experiment studies an increase in the money growth rate . While the semi-
elasticity of unemployment to the nominal interest rate is 1.204 in the BMW model, it is
0.43 in our model. So our model predicts a long-run Phillips curve that is closer to a vertical
line – the slope  log()    is about three times smaller than the one in a BMW model.
The increase in in‡ation has redistributive e¤ects that boost the aggregate demand for early
consumption, thereby restoring …rms’incentives to enter.

8     Conclusion
The New Monetarist literature based on the two-sector, random-matching model of Lagos
and Wright (2005) focuses almost exclusively on equilibria with degenerate distributions
of asset holdings. Our objective in this paper was to show that an o¤-the-shelves version
of the model has other equilibria, in a separate and realistic part of the parameter space,
that feature a non-degenerate distribution of real balances. Those equilibria are analytically
tractable — a trademark of the New Monetarist approach — and yield novel qualitative and
quantitative insights for monetary policy and the propagation of real and monetary shocks.
For instance, a one-time injection of money in a centralized market with ‡exible prices are
not neutral and the e¤ects are non-monotone with the size of the money injection. We ex-
tended the model by adding a frictional labor market, thereby endogenizing the employment
risk, and we calibrated it. We showed that a textbook calibration favors equilibria with
nondegenerate distributions and distributional e¤ects are quantitatively signi…cant.
    A key message of this paper is that the quest for tractability is not incompatible with
models that place distributional considerations at their forefront. However, tractability does
entail several restrictive assumptions that matter for quantitative analysis: the utility over
late consumption is linear; only one class of agents (entrepreneurs) can accumulate claims
on …rms’pro…ts; …at money is the only liquid asset; and the markup on early consumption
is exogenous. In addition, even though we extend the set of equilibria relative to the original
New Monetarist model, this set is still restricted to equilibria featuring full depletion of real
balances.
    Our research program going forward consists in relaxing these assumptions in order to
explore further the quantitative implications of the model. An e¤ort in that direction is
provided by Bethune and Rocheteau (2019) who study and calibrate a version of our model
with general preferences and an extended set of assets with di¤erent degrees of liquidity.
They calibrate the model by targeting moments of the wealth distribution and by identifying
expenditure shocks with large unplanned household expenditures, such as vehicle repairs or
out-of-pocket medical costs. They show that the model produces heterogeneity in terms of


                                               33
consumption and saving behavior that is not directly targeted but is consistent with empirical
evidence and they use their model to identify and quantify di¤erent channels through which
monetary policy operates and a¤ects labor market outcomes.

Proofs of Propositions 1 and 2
Elementary Properties of Value Functions
Consider the pair of Bellman equations, for all  2 f0 1 2   g and  2 f0 1g:

                  ( ) = sup f [ () +  ( ¬ y )] + (1 ¬ ) ( )g                       (51)
                                 

                 ( ) = sup fminf g +  [+1 ( 0  0 )]g                                (52)
                                 0 

s.t.  0 = +1 ( +  ¬ ) 0 and where the expectation on the right side of (52) is with
respect to the future employment state, 0 2 f0 1g, conditional on the current employment
state, . First, we substitute  ( ) from (51) into (52) to obtain the following Lemma:

Lemma 2 The functions  ( ) and  ( ) solve (51)-(52) if and only if

   ( ) = max fminf g +  [ [ (0 ) + +1 ( 0 ¬ y0  0 )] + (1 ¬ )+1 ( 0  0 )]g 

with respect to     0,  0 = +1 ( +  ¬ ), and 0        y0     0 for 0 2 f0 1g.

   Next, we apply standard contraction-mapping arguments to this Bellman equation. We
obtain:

Lemma 3 The Bellman equations (51)-(52) have unique bounded solutions,  ( ) and
 ( ), that are continuous, concave, strictly increasing, and satisfy
                                         + k k                 + k k
                            k k                and k k               
                                           1¬                    1¬

   Proof. Consider the space  (N R+ f0 1g) of bounded and continuous functions
from N R+ f0 1g to R, equipped with the sup norm. By Theorem 3.1 in Stokey, Lucas,
and Edward Prescott (1989, henceforth SLP), this is a complete metric space. Now, for any
 2  (N R+ f0 1g), consider the Bellman operator:

   [ ] ( ) = max fminf g +  [ [ (0 ) + +1 ( 0 ¬ y0  0 )] + (1 ¬ )+1 ( 0  0 )]g

with respect to     0,  0 = +1 ( +  ¬ ), and 0    y0    0 . It is straightforward to
verify that  satis…es the Blackwell su¢ cient condition for a contraction (Theorem 3.3 in

                                                  39
SLP). Moreover, the constraint set is non-empty, compact valued, and continuous. Hence
by the Theorem of the Maximum (Theorem 3.6 in SLP), we obtain that  [ ] is continuous.
It is clearly bounded since all the functions on the right-hand side of the Bellman equation
are bounded. Note as well that if  is concave, then  [ ] is also concave since the objective
is concave and the constraint correspondence has a convex graph. An application of the
Contraction Mapping Theorem (Theorem 3.2 in SLP) implies that the …xed point problem
 =  [ ] has a unique bounded solution,  ( ), and that this solution is continuous and
concave.
     Also, consider a state ( 1  ) and some feasible choice (1   10  01  11 ). Then, for  2  1 ,
the following choice is feasible: 2 = 1 +  2 ¬  1 ,  20 =  10 and 20 = 10 for 0 2 f0 1g. That
is, a worker starting with  2 can always consume  2 ¬  1 and otherwise behave as if he started
with  1 . Since this yield (weakly) higher utility this implies that  [ ] ( ) =  ( ) is
increasing. Hence, the bounded solution of the Bellman equation is increasing. One also
sees that it must be strictly increasing. Indeed, a worker starting at  2   1 can wait
to use  2 ¬  1 in order to pay for more consumption in the DM if an opportunity occurs
with strictly positive probability,  0. Since () is strictly increasing, this implies that
 [ ] ( ) =  ( ) is strictly increasing.
     Given a …xed point  ( ) of the Bellman operator  , we can de…ne  ( ) as in (51).
By identical arguments as above, one sees that  ( ) is bounded, continuous, concave, and
strictly increasing.
     Finally, we can derive upper bounds for  ( ) and  ( ). From (52) we have:
                                                                           + k k
              k k      +      [k k + k k] + (1 ¬ )k k ) k k                    
                                                                              1¬
We obtain the bound on k k following identical arguments but for  ( ).
    For the rest of this section, we slightly simplify the Bellman equation by reducing the
number of optimizing variables. To do so, we …rst note that, since  ( ) is strictly in-
creasing, it is strictly suboptimal for a worker to choose   : the worker can instead reduce
consumption, with no loss of utility, and choose higher savings  0 . Hence, in the objective of
the Bellman equation, we can replace minf g by . Substituting  =  +  ¬  0 +1 in
the objective, and keeping in mind that 0  , we can rewrite the Bellman equation as:
                               0
 ( ) = max  +  ¬           +  [ [ (0 ) + +1 ( 0 ¬ y0  0 )] + (1 ¬ )+1 ( 0  0 )] 
                              +1
                                                                                                 (53)
                   0           0                                                  0

                     0
and 0       y0  .
    It will be sometimes convenient to rewrite (53) more compactly as:
                                       0                         0
       ( ) = max  +  ¬             +  [        +1 (        0 ) + (1 ¬ )+1 ( 0  0 )]    (54)

for real balances in the DM, i.e.,

                                           ( )   = max f () +  ( ¬ y )g                                           (55)

Elementary properties of decision rules
We …rst consider the problem of a worker in the DM, (55).

Lemma 4 The worker’s DM problem, (55), has a unique solution,  ( ). This solution
is continuous, increasing, satis…es lim!0  ( ) = 0 and lim!1  ( ) = 1. Its value,
                                                                                               0 +             0
  ( ),   is continuous, strictly increasing, concave, and satis…es                          (  )           [ ( )] = .

     Proof. The problem (55) is strictly concave since () is strictly concave. Hence, it has
a unique solution, denoted by  ( ). By the Theorem of the Maximum (SLP Theorem
3.6), uniqueness implies that  ( ) is continuous. To show that  ( ) is increasing,
consider any two 1  2 . If  (2  ) 1 = , then by feasibility it immediately follows that
 (1  ) 1 =    (2  ). Otherwise, suppose  (2  )  1 = and  (2  )   (1  ),
then …rst-order conditions for  are
                                    0
                                        [ (2  )]          W0 (2 ¬ y (2  ))¬                                    (56)
                                    0                                                   +
                                        [ (1  )]          W0    (1 ¬ y (1  ))                                  (57)

where we recall that  ( ) is concave and so it has left- and right-derivatives for all   0.
By concavity 0 ( ) is decreasing in , the fact that  (2  )   (1  ) and 2  1 implies

                       W0 (2 ¬ y (2  ))+                         W0 (1 ¬ y (1  ))¬   

which implies 0 [ (2  )]     0
                                    [ (1  )] by using (56) and (57). Since is strictly concave,
it contradicts the premise that  (2  )   (1  ).
    From the feasibility constraint, 0            y , it follows that lim!0  ( ) = 0. Suppose
that  ( ) is bounded away from in…nity. Indeed, since  ( ) is bounded, increasing, and
concave, we have 0 0 ( ¬  )  ( )¬ (0 ) k k, so that lim!1 0 ( ¬  ) = 0.
Then the …rst-order condition 0 ()                W0 ( ¬ y)¬   cannot hold for  large enough
because  ( ) must satisfy Inada condition at in…nity.
    The value  ( ) is continuous by the Theorem of the Maximum. It is strictly increasing
because  ( ) is strictly increasing. To establish the lower bound on the right derivative,
we note that,  ( ) is feasible for any  0 . This implies that, for all  0 :

                               0                                   0 ¬ 
                         (        )               ( ) +            +  [ ¬ y ( ) ] 

                                                                    41
with equality if  =  0 . The result follows by subtracting the equality for  =  0 to the above
inequality, dividing by  0 ¬ , and letting  0 !  + .
    To solve for an optimal money holdings decision, we proceed as follows. We de…ne the
set of optimal real balances if  is su¢ ciently large so that  0 does not bind as:

                                    0                          0

           +1 = arg max ¬           +  [         +1 (        0 ) + (1 ¬ )+1 ( 0  0 )] 

                 
Lemma 5 The set +1 is convex, bounded above, and bounded away from zero. Given any
         
+1 2 +1 , a worker’s optimal choice of real balances at time  is:

                    0 = max +1 ( +  ¬ ) min +1 ( +  ) +1
                                                                     
                                                                                                          (58)

                      
   Proof. The set +1   is bounded above because both () and +1 ( ) are concave
and bounded, implying that they satisfy Inada condition at in…nity. To see that it is bounded
away from zero, recall that 0+1 ( )    0
                                             [( )] = and lim!0 ( ) = 0. Since 0 (0) =
+1, it follows that lim!0 +1 ( +  ) = 1. This implies that, near zero,
                        1               0     + 0                0
                   ¬        +         +1 (0   )   + (1 ¬ )+1 (0+  0 )  0
                       +1
                  
Hence 0  min +1  . The rest of the proposition follows because the optimization program
           
de…ning +1 is concave.
                                                                    
   The optimal rule for next period real balances is to approach +1 as closely as possible,
keeping consumption below the satiation point, . Hence, for low values of , the worker
               
approaches +1   by lowering  to 0, in which case  0 = +1 ( +  ). For large enough
                                      
values of , the worker approaches +1  by consuming up to the satiation point , in which
      0                                                                      
case  = +1 ( +  ¬ ). For values of  in some middle range, near +1     , the worker
             
can reach +1 in one period by consuming less than .

                                                   into (54), we obtain:
                                  
                                 +1                          0

                                 +1

which implies 0 (0+  ) = 1.



                                                  42
       
   If +1  +1  then for all   0 close enough to zero, an optimal choice of real
balances is  0 = +1 ( +  ). Substituting this expression into (54) we obtain:

             ( ) =  [                   +1   [+1 ( +  )  0 ] + (1 ¬ )+1 [+1 ( +  )  0 ]] 

Since +1  0,  0 = +1 ( +  ) lies in the interior of the domain of +1 ( 0  0 ) and
+1 ( 0  0 ). These concave functions have right-derivatives at these interior points. Hence,
 ( ) has a right-derivative at zero, i.e., 0 (0+  )  1.
    With this result we establish:

Lemma 7 For all   0, the optimal DM consumption is strictly positive:  ( )  0.
Moreover, for given  2 f0 1g,                             ( )   is continuously di¤erentiable over (0 1) with
 0              0
  ( )   =       [ ( )] = .

   Proof. The …rst result,  ( )  0 for all   0, follows from Lemma 6 according to
which +1 (0+  )  1 and the assumption 0 (0) = 1. For the second result consider some
  0. Since  ( )  0, y ( ) ¬ ( ¬  0 ) is feasible for  0   and close enough to .
Therefore, for such  0 , we have

                                    0                                  ¬ 0
                              (        )            ( ) ¬             +  [ ¬ y ( ) ] 

Subtracting this inequality from the following equality,

                                           ( )    =    [ ( )] +  [ ¬ y ( ) ] 

and dividing both sides by  ¬  0 , we obtain:

                            ( )¬  ( 0  )                [ ( )] ¬ [ ( ) ¬ ( ¬  0 )= ]
                                                                                                         
                                  ¬ 0                                         ¬ 0
Letting  0 ! , we obtain 0 ( ¬ )            0
                                                  [ ( )] = . Since we have already shown in Lemma
               +        0
4 that  (  )          [ ( )] = , and since  ( ) is concave, we obtain that, for all   0,
                                       0             0
   ( ) is di¤erentiable with        ( ) =      [ ( )] = .

Di¤erentiability of the value function
We establish the di¤erentiability of  ( ) and provide an explicit formula for its derivative.
The main di¢ culty is that the Envelope Theorem of Benveniste and Scheinkman does not
apply to our environment, because it requires optimal choices to lie in the interior of the
constraint set –in contrast, in our setting, the constraint  0 may bind. To address this
di¢ culty, Rincón-Zapatero and Santos (2009) have established an Envelope Theorem for

                                                                       43
a broad class of stationary dynamic optimization problems in which optimal choices may
not lie in the interior of the constraint set, but must lie in the interior of the state space.
We apply their results to our environment to establish di¤erentiability. The application is
not immediate however, because two of their maintained assumptions are violated. First,
we consider non-stationary equilibria where +1 is not constant over time. Second, some
optimal choices may not lie in the interior of the state space: namely, when a worker depletes
his money holdings in full in the DM, he enters the following CM with zero money balances.

Maintained assumptions about returns. We make two assumptions on the time-path
of gross rates of return of …at money:

         (A1) There exists some   0 such that, for all      0, +1  .
              P
         (A2) 1 =1
                    
                      (1 ¬ )¬1    
                                   =1   1.

    The …rst assumption rules out hyper-in‡ationary dynamics and the second assumption
helps with the proof that the expected present value of marginal utilities from real balance
is …nite – as required to apply the argument of Rincón-Zapatero and Santos (2009). Note
that both assumptions are satis…ed for the transitional dynamics we analyze in the paper,
whereby  ! 1 as  ! 1.

Bounds on decision variables Next, we establish bounds on decision variables.

Lemma 8 The DM consumption satis…es  ( )             ^() for some continuous, strictly in-
creasing, and time-invariant function, ^(), that satis…es ^(0) = 0 and 0  ^()                for all
  0.

   Proof. Suppose that  ( )  = . Since there is partial depletion, the …rst-order
condition for the DM problem, (55), is
                                                 k k
 0
     [ ( )]   W0 ( ¬ y ( ))¬                   ) [ ¬ y ( )]   0
                                                                                    [ ( )]      k k
                                               ¬ y ( )
                                                                                            (59)
                                          0
Consider now the equation ( ¬ y) () = k k for   0. The left hand side is continuous
and strictly decreasing in , goes to in…nity as  ! 0 and to zero as  ! = . Hence, the
equation has a unique solution ^(), which satis…es 0  ^()  = . Since the equation has
a unique solution and is continuous in ( ), the function ^() is continuous as well. Since
0  ^()   , we can extend the function by continuity at  = 0 by setting ^(0) = 0.
   Clearly, when  ( )   , the inequality (59) implies that  ( ) ^() for all  and
. When  ( ) = = , this inequality is also satis…ed since ^()   .
   The second preliminary result is:

                                                 44
Lemma 9 For all             0, optimal real balances are bounded below by

   Proof. A …rst-order condition for an optimal choice of target is:
                   1             0
                                                                ¬+ 0

                 +1
Since the value function is increasing, this implies that                                    0 [+1 ( 0 )] 1+1 . Since
                                     0                                                     0
     y+1 ( ), we obtain that      () 1+1 . Since                                    () is decreasing, this implies:
                                ¬1            1                      ¬1         1

                                                                                          for all  2 +1 

The result follows from the policy function for real balances in (58).

The main proposition. We now can state our di¤erentiability result:

Proposition 1 The value function,  ( ), is continuously di¤erentiable in , with:
                              "1                                                       #

      where f+ g is a stochastic process for optimal real balances starting from  =  given
      histories of shocks and f+ g is the sequence of employment shocks from  = .

    Proof. We …rst use the Envelope Theorem for optimization problems with parameterized
constraints of Milgrom and Segal (2002, Corollary 5). To see that all the conditions are
satis…ed, we …rst note that, given +1  0, for all  0 there exists  0  0 such that  0 
+1 ( +  ) and  0  +1 ( +  ¬ ). Note as well that the objective function and the
function de…ning the constraint are continuous and concave, and have partial derivatives with
respect to  which are continuous in (  0 ). The Lagrangian associated with the optimization
problem (54) is:
                                          0
           (  0    )   = ¬             +  [ +1 ( 0  0 ) + (1 ¬ )+1 ( 0  0 )]
                                         +1

where  (    ). Let  denote the set of Kuhn-Tucker multipliers and  denote the set
of optima associated with this optimization problem. These sets are non empty and compact
under the stated conditions. Then by the above mentioned Envelope Theorem, we have:

Taking derivatives explicitly and rearranging the resulting …rst-order conditions, we obtain

   Proof of Proposition 4. Provided that the condition for full depletion, (27), holds
we construct a steady-state equilibrium as follows. From (18),

We use (19) to compute the number of periods it takes to reach the target:

obtained from (25).

   Proof of Proposition 5.                       The di¤erence equation (30) has a unique positive …xed
point,
                                                        0¬1   [1 ¬ (1 ¬ )]

Hence, for all  1 there is an equilibrium where  =   and +1 = +1
                                                                       
                                                                            = 1. By market
clearing, and using that the distribution of real balances is degenerate,  (1 + ) =   for
all  1. From (29), and using the de…nition of the …xed point   , 0 (1 + ) =   . Hence,
  0 = 1 and 1 = 1.

    Proof of Proposition 6. The di¤erence equation (34) for                                   2 can be rewritten as:
                                                                                    

                                                              47

there exists an equilibrium that becomes stationary starting at  = 2, with  =   , 1 = ,
and  = 1 for all  2. From (34) evaluated at  = 1 and (33), ( 0  1 ) solves:

                                                            11 + (1 ¬ )1

Substituting 11 = 1  +        0     into (63) and solving for aggregate real balances at  = 1:

                                                       1  + (1 ¬ )1

From (63) the left side of (65) is equal to the right side of (64). Hence, 1 solves (35). The
left side of (35) is increasing in 1 , it is equal to 0 when 1 = 0 and the numerator is equal

there is a unique 1 solution to (35) and it is such that 1  1. Using the expression for

where the inequality on the right is obtained by di¤erentiating 1 de…ned in (35) with respect
to 1 + . It corresponds to (37).
    Individual real balances in  = 1 are 11   and 1    . Hence, there is a mean-
preserving reduction in the distribution of real balances. From the concavity of the value
functions, social welfare increases.

Using that ( ) is concave,             ( ) is decreasing in . Assuming  ¬ 1  0,  ( ) is increasing
in . Moreover,
                                         (0) = [( + )  ¬ ( ¬ 1 )] 

    Proof of Proposition 9. Consider …rst equilibria where  = 1. From (44) market

where, from (39),   =        [ (1 + i= )]. Clearly,  0 = 0 and   0 = 0, which
implies 0 = 0 = 0.
   Consider next equilibria featuring  = 2. From (44) and (45) market tightness solves
           ( + )  ¬ ( )( ¬ 1 )               ¬1
                                   =                     ¬              (  ¬ 0 ) 

as:

    ( + )  ¬ ( )      1 ¬ ¬1   + ( ¬ 1 ) =    1 ¬ ¬1 [ 0 +   (1 ¬ )] 

The left side is strictly convex in and it is increasing when it is positive. The right side is in-
creasing in 0 . Hence,  0  0 and 0  0. Using that  = [(1 ¬ )   + 0 ]
it follows that

   Proof of Proposition 10. Part 1: money growth implemented with lump-sum

market tightness is the unique solution to:

    ( + )  ¬ ( )        1 ¬ ¬1   + ( ¬ 1 ) =  1 ¬ ¬1 [ 0 +   (1 ¬ )] 

where, from (39),   solves

An increase in lowers the right side (which is independent of ) and raises the left side
(which is increasing in when the left side is positive), which leads to a decrease in and
an increase in .

We established above that there is a unique solution to this equation when = 0. Hence,
at the equilibrium value for , the left side intersects the right side by below. See right
panel of Figure 4. From Proposition 8, a small increase of from = 0 raises  if (42)
holds. Hence,    0 for close to 0, which increases the right side of the equation
above. Graphically, the   curve shifts upward. As a result, an increase in raises market
tightness and reduces unemployment,   0 when (42) holds.

   Proof of Proposition 11. From (46)  1  0 and   = 0 since 0 = 1
(where we used that  = 1 ¬ ). Hence, a small increase in 1 raises  and   since
there is no …rst-order e¤ect of  on  when all workers receive the same income. From (44),
market tightness solves:
            ( + )  ¬ ( )( ¬ 1 )                    ¬1
                                    = (1 ¬                  ) f 0 + 1 + (1 ¬ )  g 
                     + ( )
It can be reexpressed as:
                              2          ¬1                                  ¬1
( + )  ¬ ( )  ¬ 1 ¬            (1 ¬        ) 1 + (1 ¬ )  = (1 ¬             ) [ 0 + (1 ¬ )  ] 

The left side is a convex function of which is equal to zero when = 0. The right side is
positive and independent of . Hence, there is a unique solution to this equation. As 1
increases, the left side increases, which implies that decreases (since the left side must be
increasing in when it intersects the right side). Hence,  decreases as 1 increases.
    Neutral Transfer Schemes must be Proportional. To see this, note …rst that
neutrality implies that all agent’s real balances must stay the same: otherwise if an agent
had more real balances after the transfer, then he/she would …nd it optimal to either consume
more or work less, and vice versa with less real balances. By market clearing, identical real
balances imply that the price level grows at the same rate as the money supply, . Let us
denote an agent’s real balances before the injection by , and the real value of the transfer
at pre-injection price by . Then, if the injection is neutral, the post-injection real balances
must equal pre-injection real balances: ( + )(1 + ) = . This immediately imply that
the transfer is proportional: = .

Loecker, Eeckout and Unger (2018), the retail markup is set to 115 percent, i.e., = 215.
    The …ve parameters, (      ), are jointly determined by …ve calibration targets:
the average economy-wide markup, the labor share, the corporate tax rate, the money to
output ratio, and the elasticity of money demand. We guess, and numerically verify later,
that in equilibrium workers fully deplete their money holdings in the DM, and they reach
their targeted real balances in just two periods,  = 2.

                                                52
    The mapping between the parameters, (      ), and the targets, is the following.
Following Berentsen, Menzio and Wright (2011) we take the ratio of the real money supply
to quarterly output to be 0.7. This gives:
              Real Money Supply   Real Money Supply     1     DM sales
      07 =                     =                     =                       
                   Output         DM sales + CM sales     DM sales + CM sales
where the second equality uses the fact that DM sales =           Real Money Supply. We pin
down the relative size of DM to CM sales by making it consistent with the relative markup
in the retail sector relative to the entire economy. Following de Loecker, Eeckout, and Unger
(2018) as above, we take aggregate markup to be 61% and the retail markups to be 115%.
Given that the markup in the CM is zero, this means that
                             DM sales                  DMoverCM
                061 =                       ( ¬ 1) =              115
                         DM sales + CM sales          DMoverCM + 1
which implies that the ratio of DM to CM sales is equal to DMoverCM = 113, which leads
to = 076.
   We set the tax parameter, , to obtain a corporate tax rate of 35 percent, i.e.,
                                                  
                             035 =                             
                                      CM sales + DM sales ¬ 1
where     (1 ¬ ) represents the aggregate output of …rms before taxes. Rearranging,
we obtain that:
                                  CM sales + DM sales     1
                         = 035                       ¬
                                                          
                                                  CM sales + DM sales
                         = 035 (1 ¬ Labor Share)                     
                                                           
To obtain an estimate of (CM sales + DM sales) , we use the relationship:

                               DM sales        DM sales           1
              CM sales =  ¬              =)            =                 
                                                         1= + 1DMoverCM

As a result, we also obtain that:

    CM sales + DM sales   DM sales                     1 + 1DMoverCM
                        =          (1 + 1DMoverCM) =                                  (66)
                                                    1= + 1DMoverCM

Plugging back in the above equation for , we obtain:

                                                     1 + 1DMoverCM
                         = 035 (1 ¬ Labor Share)                   
                                                    1= + 1DMoverCM

                                               53
Given our earlier assumed markup and labor share, and given our estimate of DMoverCM,
we obtain = 016.
   We pick the bargaining weight, , so that the wage, 1 = (1 ¬ + ), is consistent
with the labor share, which can be expressed as
                                                          ¬1
                                 CM sales + DM sales                  
                 Labor Share =                                           
                                                              1¬ +   
The term  is the sum of CM and DM sales net of taxes  . Therefore
                                   CM sales + DM sales
                               = ¬ +
                                             
                                      1 + 1DMoverCM
                               = ¬ +                                                   (67)
                                     1= + 1DMoverCM
This implies that:
                                                                                   ¬1
                             1 + 1DMoverCM                 1 + 1DMoverCM
              = Labor Share                            ¬ +                              
   1¬ +                     1= + 1DMoverCM                1= + 1DMoverCM
Solving for , we obtain = 035.
   From the …rst-order condition for   the scaling parameter of the preferences can be
expressed as:
                                            
                                                   
                                =              1+     

Therefore, to determine  given , we need an estimate for   . The market-clearing con-
dition for the money market is
                         0 + M     1 + M
                               +         + (1 ¬ )  = 
                           1+         1+
We divide both sides by  and obtain that
                                               M     0     1
                 = [(1 ¬ )(1 + )]¬1 (1 + (1 ¬ ))   ¬     ¬     
                                                           
First, M = 1=       DM sales . Second,
      1               CM sales + DM sales                1 + 1DMoverCM
          = Labor Share                     = Labor Share                 
                                                        1= + 1DMoverCM
And third, 0 = uw1 . Taken together,    = 1.
    To determine , we use an estimate of the semi-elasticity of money demand with respect
to nominal rate. The money demand is de…ned as:
                                           M
                                                      
                                  CM sales + DM sales

                                             54
We pick  to match a semi-elasticity of 0.56. We obtain  = 013 and  = 193.
   The last two parameters, ( ), are obtained as follows. We normalize  so that  = 1.
Using (67) and keeping in mind that  = (1 ¬ ), we obtain:

                                             1 + 1DMoverCM
                          =          ¬ +
                               1¬            1= + 1DMoverCM

Thus, the normalization  = 1 leads to  = 068. Finally, the vacancy posting cost is set so
that the free entry condition holds given all other calibrated parameters. This gives  = 020.
   In our calculations so far we have made several guesses that we now verify. First, an
agent who is employed cannot reach the target in just one step:
                                      1 + M
                                              
                                        1+
Second, an agent who is unemployed can reach the target in just two steps:

                                           1                1
                           (0 +    M)              +              
                                          1+            (1 + )2

These conditions are satis…ed given our calibrated parameters. It is necessary and su¢ cient
to verify just one full-depletion condition, for an agent who already holds the target real
balance,   , and who is unemployed:
                                                                               !
                        ¬                                        ¬
             1                    1          1      0 + M
                                                                + (1 ¬ ) 
                             (1 + )(1 + )              (1 + )

Finally, we verify that taxes can …nance unemployment bene…ts,  0  . The surplus
of tax revenue,  ¬ 0 , …nances unproductive government consumption.
