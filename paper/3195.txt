      TIME-SERIES TESTS OF A NON-EXPECTED-UTILITY MODEL OF ASSET PRICING


                                   ABSTRACT


     This paper provides two alternative estimation and testing procedures of a
representative-agent model of asset pricing which relies on a particular
parametrization of non-expected-utility preferences. The first is based on
maximum-likelihood estimates, supplemented with an explicit model of time
varying first and second moments (where the time-variation of second moments in
modelled with an ARCH-Autoregressive Conditionally Heteroskedastic-process);
the second is based on generalized-method-of moments estimates. We perform our
tests on a data set that includes monthly observations of rates of return on US
stock prices and US consumption of nondurables and services. Our results are
directly comparable to a test of the dynamic capital asset pricing model
performed by Hansen and Singleton (1983), and to a recent test of the model
studied here performed by Epstein and Zin (1989).

1      Introduction
A popular model of asset pricing, developed by Lucas (1978) and Breeden (1979) as-
sumes that a single, infinitely-lived, "representative" consumer-investor chooses her
consumption plan and portfolio composition to maximize expected utility. Equilib-
rium returns on individual assets are determined by the covariance of those assets'
payoffs with the marginal rate of substitution in consumption, a function of con-
sumption growth and a taste parameter. The poor empirical performance of this
model' has led researchers to question a number of its assumptions, and—as a
result—to develop a number of alternative theories.
     The specification of preferences is a crucial building block of the representative-
consumer asset pricing model. Typically, preferences are assumed to be of the
time-separable, isoelastic family, characterized by a single parameter. This speci-
fication has been recently criticized mainly on two grounds. First, the property of
time-separability makes the marginal rate of substitution in consumption indepen-
dent of past consumption experiences. By contrast, non-separable utility functions
can induce, in equilibrium, smooth consumption paths that might resemble the
data more closely. Bergman (1985), Sundaresan (1989) and Constantinides (1989)
explore the effects of allowing for non-separable preferences on equilibrium asset
returns.
     A second type of criticism regards the interpretation of the elasticity parameter
in the utility function. In the absence of uncertainty, that parameter represents the
elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption, while in a static, stochas-
tic setting it measures Arrow-Pratt's coefficient of relative risk aversion. In the
    1See, for a recent comprehensive study, Breeden, Gibbons and Litenberger (1989).



                                                2
stochastic and dynamic asset pricing model that parameter is, however, difficult
to interpret: it has been interchangeably labelled risk aversion and intertemporal
substitution. A number of recent papers have helped clarifying this problem. Ep-
stein and Zin (1989a), Farmer (1988) and Well (1988) have developed isoelastic
preferences that separate attitudes towards risk from attitudes towards allocation
of consumption over time, by relaxing the expected-utility restriction. These prefer-
ences generalize the time-separable expected utility functionals originally postulated
in dynamic asset pricing models.
   The purpose of this paper is to test alternative specifications of an asset pricing
model that relies on the isoelastic non-expected-utility preferences developed by
the above-mentioned authors. Since these preferences subsume the standard time-
separable expected utility function applied in earlier statistical tests, we are able to
compare the empirical performance of both specifications of preferences. We apply
the model to monthly US data on consumption and stock returns.
   Our results are directly comparable with two other tests of asset pricing models.
Like Hansen and Singleton (1983) we test the restrictions imposed by the model
on the relation between (conditional) expected returns on individual assets and
their (conditional) covariance with consumption growth, and, given the preference
we postulate, the rate of return on the market portfolio. This test is based on a
time-series extension of the cross-section tests performed by Giovannini and Weil
(1989). We generalize Hansen and Singleton's tests by allowing time variation in
conditional second moments, which we assume follow an Autoregressive Condition-
ally Heteroskedastjc (ARCH) scheme, developed by Engle (1982). In addition, we
also study the general—and less restricted—specification used by Epstein and Zin
(1989b), which exploits the orthogonality restrictions implicit in the first-order con-

                                          3
ditions of the investor's optimal plan.2 In both cases, we are interested to verify
whether the more general specification of non-expected-utility preferences results
in any appreciable improvement in the statistical performance of the asset pricing
model.
    The paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 describe the model and the
data set, respectively. Sections 4 and 5 discuss the results, while section 6 contains
a few concluding remarks.


2     Asset Pricing with Non-Expected-Utility Pref-
      erences

We consider an infinitely-lived consumer-investor, who chooses her consumption and
portfolio composition to maximize utility. There is only one good in the economy,
but N nonreproducible and nondepreciable assets which generate the consump-
tion good stochastically. The shares of the N assets in the investor's portfolio are
a4, i = 1,. . . ,N and are arranged in the vector a. We assume that preferences are
represented by the isoelastic utility function independently proposed by Epstein
and Zin (1989a) and Well (1988). Formally the investor problem is:

                                      maxU[Cg, EV(w,+i,sg+i)J =

                     { (1   —        +8   (E,V(w+j,8÷l))+}'',                                   (1)

   211a11 (1988), Zin (1987) and Attanaeio and Weber (1989) study a similar model, the two-period
'Ordinal Certainty Equivalent' model of Selden (1978).
   3This is a tractable parametrization of the preferences originally developed by Kreps and Porteus
(1979).

                              V(w,, 3*) = max U[C,, E,V(w,+i, s,+i)J

with w, representing the investor's total wealth at the beginning of time t, and s,
the state of the economy at t. C, is consumption at t and R are (1 plus) the rates of
return on the assets. Equation (2) describes the evolution of the investor's wealth,
equation (3) defines the rate of return on the portfolio and equation (4) defines the
portfolio shares.
   The parameter 'y 0 (                1) can be interpreted as the Arrow-Pratt coefficient of
relative risk aversion, while the parameter 1/p 0 (p $ 1) represents the elasticity
of intertemporal substitution, and 6 E (0,1) is the subjective discount factor.4
   The first-order conditions for the problem (1)-(4) are, together with (2)-(4):

Equation (6) has been extensively discussed in the papers we cited above, where
it is stressed that both the rate of growth of consumption and the market rate
of return determine the equilibrium returns on individual assets. We just note,
following Giovannini and Weil (1989), that in this model myopia in consumption-
savings decisions—that is a consumption function that does not depend on expec-
tations of future variables, but is simply a constant times current wealth—is the
result of a unit-elastic intertemporal substitution but that myopia in portfolio al-
location decisions—portfolio allocation rules that depend only on asset returns at
the current time—arises when the coefficient of relative risk aversion is unity, for
any values of p. In other words, the static CAPM arises from unit risk aversion,
and not from offsetting income and substitution effects in the consumption-savings
problem.5 Equations (6) can be exploited in the empirical analysis, once market
equilibrium conditions are solved jointly with the optimal decision rules of the in-
vestor. These conditions state that the representative investor has to consume all
output produced (since the utility functions we adopt displays non-satiation, and
output is perishable) and hold all available assets. Then R,,1, represents the return
on the market portfolio, and the vector a, represents the shares of all assets in
the market portfolio. Hence equations (6) have to be satisfied in equilibrium, and
represent a testable constraint in the joint stochastic process of consumption and
asset returns. These equations have been estimated and tested by Epstein and Zin
(1989b).
           intertemporal substitution equals 1 and asset returns are lognormal, however, equation
(6) becomes:
                             LI   rD    o—(i—'i)l   —   r' fD   D1—(1—'I)

with 'p = (1 — p)w6/(1 — f6) where s is the autoregressive coefficient for the process followed by the
log of R,,1.See Giovannini and Weil (1989) and Giovannini and .lorion (1989).

    As Giovannini and Well (1989) show, additional assumptions allow to solve out
explicitly for equilibrium excess returns. Consider the case where the logarithm
of the return on on the market and Individual assets, as well as the growth of
consumption are—conditionally on information available at time t—jointly normal,

where c denotes   the logarithm of (1 plus) the rate of growth of consumption, and
the subscript t indicates that the moments are conditional on time t information,
while returns are realized at time t + 1. Of course, given the definition of the market
return (3), the assumption of joint log-normality is, strictly speaking, not correct: a
linear combination of log-normal variables is not log-normal. Yet joint log-normality
of returns can hold exactly in continuous time, and might be approximately correct
in discrete time, since returns are numbers that do not deviate much from 1. In
addition, the appropriateness of this approximation can be tested, and we do so in
section 4.
   The first-order condition (6) can now be rewritten, using our distributional
assumption, for any asset I and for the return (at time t + 1) on a riskfree bond,
rf) whose value is known with certainty at time t. The result is:

Equation (9)   is just   a generalization of the one originally estimated by Hansen and
Singleton (1983). If preferences are like those assumed by Hansen and Singleton
the coefficient of relative risk aversion 'y equals the inverse of the elasticity of in-
tertemporal substitution p, and the equilibrium return on an asset depends only on
the riskfree rate, and its covariance with the rate of growth of consumption:

                                  f,, + o-,/2 — r1g = Pic,t

If the coefficient of relative risk aversion equals unity, equation (9) implies

                                  fj,g   + a,/2 —   rj,g =

the standard static asset pricing equation with logarithmic utility. In the more
general model we estimate, both the covariance with the market rate of return and
the covariance with the rate of growth of consumption affect equilibrium returns on
individual assets.


3     The Data
One strong prediction of the model is that first-order conditions and asset pricing
equations hold for any assets available to the consumer-investor. We carry out our
tests on five industry indices computed from stocks listed on the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE), jointly with the value-weighted NYSE market index. These data
are obtained from the Center for Research in Security Prices of the University of
Chicago (CRSP).


                                               8
    The data are monthly and cover the period from January 1953 to December
1987. The value-weighted industry indices are constructed from an exhaustive clas-
sification of the market into five industry groups: primary, manufacturing, tranpor-
tation, trade, finance and services.8 Real returns are measured using the nodurables
consumption price deflator.
   The consumption measure is real per capita consumer expenditure in non-
durables and services (measured in terms of nondurables) from the US National
Income Accounts. Because some of the instruments consist of lagged values, the
estimation starts in April 1953.
    Table I contains summary statistics for our data set. The table reports means,
standard deviations, and autocorrelation coefficients at lags 1 to 12 months of all
series used in the empirical tests. The standard error of the autocorrelation co-
efficients is approximately 0.054 under the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation.
Notice that the first-order autocorrelation coefficient for consumption is negative
and significantly different from zero. This result is similar, but not identical due to
our longer sample, to that reported by Breeden, Gibbons and Litzenberger (1989).
As these authors point out, this evidence is, prima fade, inconsistent with the
presence of time-aggregation biases in the data, and is perhaps suggestive of the
presence of errors in measurement of consumption. Other noteworthy features of
the data include the difference in the standard deviations of consumption and as-
set returns (the standard errors of asset returns are about 10 times the standard
error of consumption growth) and the significantly positive autocorrelation coeffi-
cient of two indices of returns (trade and finance and services). The low volatility

of consumption growth relative to the market rate of return, and relative to the re-
turns of individual portfolios, suggests that the covariance of individual asst returns
with the market could contain valuable information in predicting asset returns, and
hence that models aimed at explaining fluctuations in asset returns in terms of
their covariation with both a market index and consumption could perform better
than models relying exclusively on the covariance with consumption growth. This
conjecture is tested in the following sections.


4     Empirical Tests: Log-Normal Model
Equation (9) implies the following expression for the conditional expectation of the
log of the real return on an asset i:

                         =    —   o/2 +           I      øic,t +
                                                                   1
                                                                       "aii,n.g,   (11)

Substituting on the left-hand side of (ii) the realized value of the log of asset
i's return, amounts to adding a disturbance term on the right-hand side. Since the
disturbance term represents rate-of-return innovations at time t +1, it is orthogonal
to all variables on the right-hand side. We estimate equilibrium returns equations
jointly with a reduced-form equation explaining consumption growth. The general
form of our system is:

                                  = f + Eg÷i, I = 1,..., N,                        (12)

                                  =     f,ng +   E,,÷i                             (13)

                                  =       + €÷i,                                   (14)

The expected returns i, and r,,,, are given by equation (9), which we estimate under
different assumptions on conditional moments. Notice that we impose the same

                                                 10
model on the five industry indices together with the market index which at every
time t is just a weighted average of the industry indices. Since however the weights
vary substantially over time (the market index is value-weighted), it turns out that
the covariance matrix of r•,i = 1,. . . , N,m does not suffer from multicollinearity.
The condition number of the 6 x 6 unconditional covariance matrix computed over
the period from April 1953 to December 1987 is only 4745. As a reference, the
condition number of the 5 x 5 matrix obtained from dropping the first industry is
equal to 3006, which is of the same order of magnitude.
      In order to achieve consistency and maximum efficiency, we apply the maximum
likelihood procedure, and, in particular, we impose that the conditional variances
and covariances in equation (11) are precisely the elements of the covariance matrix
of the estimated residuals in the system (12)—(14).
      Given the above distributional assumptions, the conditional log-likelihood func-
tion for the residuals is

                 t(O)   =
                               TrN+2

The parameters of interest are found by maximizing £ over the parameter space e.
At the maximum, an estimate of the covariance matrix of the estimated parameters
is obtained from the inverse of the sum of the outer product of the score vectors.

4.1      Constant Conditional Second Moments
If second moments are assumed constant over time, the model reduces to

                  rg+i = rfg   —   o/2 + p1 —    +    —   a" + €,i               (16)


                                           11
for I =   1,   ..., N, m and
                                    c4.1   =        + ct+1,                         (17)

where:

Equation (18) displays the stochastic processes we postulate for . The first as-
                                                                                    (18)



sumes that consumption growth is serially uncorrelated, and hence         is a constant;
however, given the evidence reported in Table I—showing significant negative au-
tocorrelation in consumption growth—we also assume that consumption growth
follows a first-order autoregressive process. Notice, using equation (10), that with
constant conditional second moments the fluctuations in expected returns are due
exclusively to fluctuations in the riskfree rate, which in turn fluctuates with the con-
ditional expectation of consumption growth. The implication is that with constant
conditional second moments risk premia are constant and all ex-ante rates of return
are perfectly correlated. When consumption growth is assumed to be uncorrelated
both first and second conditional moments of asset returns are constant.
   When consumption growth is uncorrelated, the parameters to be estimated are
o (or,   equivalently, r1), p,-y, plus the (N + 2)
                                               ((N + 2) + 1)/2 elements of the
covariance matrix of innovations—28 elements with N = 5—for a total of 32 pa-
rameters When consumption growth follows a first-order autoregressive process
the parameters to be estimated are 6,p,i,ao,ai plus the (N + 2) * ((N + 2) + 1)/2
covariance matrix elements, for a total of 33 parameters.
   The estimation results are reported in Table H. The point estimates of both
the reciprocal of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution and of the coefficient
of relative risk aversion are positive. The reciprocal of the elasticity of intertem-


                                               12
poral substitution is equal to 5.7 and 4.9 under the two alternative specifications
for consumption growth, while the coefficient of relative risk aversion is 8.3 and
14.1 in the two different specifications. In all cases the standard errors of the esti-
mates are very high, especially when consumption growth is assumed to be a white
noise process. The inclusion of lagged consumption improves the efficiency of the
estimates dramatically, without much affecting their values. Yet both parameters
are still not significantly different from anything of interest. Not surprisingly, then,
the hypothesis that p = 'y, i.e. the Von-Neumann Morgenstern restriction, is not
rejected in either case: the t statistic for the p — y is in both cases well below 1.
   The restrictions imposed by the model can be tested against an alternative
hypothesis that conditional expectations of returns are unrelated to the elements
of the covariance matrix of disturbances. Under the assumption that conditional
first moments are constant, the unrestricted regressions are just projections on a
constant. The total number of parameters estimated with maximum likelihood is
(N + 2) + (N + 2) * ((N + 2) + 1)/2 =            35   with N =   5.   Under the assumption
that expected returns are time varying, the unrestricted regressions project actual
returns on a constant and the lagged growth rate of consumption. A total of (N +
2) *   2   + (N + 2) * ((N + 2) ÷ 1)/2 =   parameters are estimated. The results of
                                           42

the tests are also reported also in Table II. The cross equation constraints from the
model are in both cases rejected at the 5 percent level, but not at the 1 percent
level.

    The results in Table II are comparable to those obtained by Hansen and Single-
ton (1983) who apply maximum likelihood estimation to a lognormal model which is
a restricted version of ours, with -y = p. They also use monthly data (from February
1959 to December 1978) on consumption of nondurables and services, although they

                                            13
apply their model to individual stock returns, rather than industry indices. Their
estimate of-y =    p   ranges from .507 to 4.106, two values which are of the same order
of magnitude as those we report in Table H. They also reject the cross-equation
restrictions of the model at any conventional significance level.7

4.2        Time-Varying Conditional Second Moments
Given the widespread evidence that conditional variances of asset returns change
over time, the assumption of constant second moments may lead to unwarranted re-
jections of the model. It is therefore important to extend the model to time-varying
second moments. A tractable specification is the Autoregressive Conditional Het-
eroskedastic (ARCH) proposed by Engle (1982), where conditional second moments
are written as a deterministic function of lagged squared innovations and previous
conditional covariances:

                           =                 = r +A•             + B • E,_1,                     (19)

where • indicates element-by-element matrix multiplication. In practice the ma-
trices r, A, B are constrained to be positive definite by estimating their Choleski
factors.
    The model then reduces to:

                          =    tf,g   —   a/2 + p _          +            + cg+i                 (20)

fori=1...,N,m. And
                                                =        +                                       (21)

    7The cross-sectional regressions of Giovannini-Weil (1989), who use average returns and standard
errors on 379 individual stocks over the period January 1959 to May 1987, also yield quite unprecise
estimates of the relative risk aversion coefficient, but lead to a strong rejection of the Von Neumann-
Morgenstern restriction.


                                                    14
where:

                                       ={o+aic,                                               (22)

The riskfree rate of interest, defined in equation (10), is now time-varying both
through the variation of expected consumption growth and the expected return
on the market, and through the variation of conditional variances and covariances.
Furthermore, in this case the variation of conditional second moment induces time-
varying risk premia across all assets.
    When consumption growth is assumed to follow a white noise process, the model
involves a total of 4 + 3 * [(N + 2) * (N + 2 + 1)/2j = 88 parameters (5, p, , plus the
elements of the three matrices in equation (19), r, A and B). When consumption
growth is assumed to follow a first-order autoregressive process, the number of
parameters to estimate increases to 89.
    Table III reports the results from the estimation and test of this model. The
point estimates of the two parameters are of the same order of magnitude as those
obtained assuming conditional homoskedasticity, and here also the Von Neumann-
Morgenstern restriction that the relative risk aversion coefficient equals the recipro-
cal of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is not rejected. Even though the
estimates of the taste parameters are very unprecise,8 the standard errors of the
coefficients are lower than in the case where conditional second moments, indicating
that the assumption of conditionally heteroakedastic returns improves the fit of the
model. This is confirmed by the test of homoskedasticity (a test of the restriction
that the matrices A and B are jointly equal to zero), which shows a strong rejections
under both assumptions for the consumption-growth process.
   5This is consistent with the finding in Giovannini and Jorion (1989), who cannot obtain precise
estimates of the risk aversion parameter in a asset pricing model estimated assuming conditionally-
heteroekedastic returns using weekly data on stock returns and foreign exchange returns.

                                                15
      As above, the model can be tested against a more general alternative. In this
case the alternative allows different cross-sectional means but preserves the type of
time-variation in expected returns induced by second moments specified above:

           r,g+i = k0 +   —       + kia. + k2a,, + k3o',1 + k4oimg + E,+i,        (23)

fori=1,...,N,m. And
                                   cg÷i =        + E+i,                           (24)

where:
                                   ={     o+aicg
                                                                                  (25)

Given our specification of the alternative, the model can be directly tested using a
chi-square statistic. In both cases, the restrictions are rejected strongly.

4.3      Tests of Joint Log-Normality
Finally, we verify the assumption that returns and consumption growth are jointly
(conditionally) log-normally distributed, by performing tests on the estimated resid-
uals of the equations in the models. Table IV reports the results. The table contains
the values of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, which provides a test of the hypoth-
esis that the data are a random sample from a normal distribution, by computing
the largest absolute deviation between the sample and the theoretical cumulative
distributions. The probability of obtaining the observed value under the null is
computed under the Kolmogorov-Smirnov limiting distribution.
   Alternatively, a chi-square goodness-of-fit statistic is obtained as follows. First
the observations are sorted in order of increasing magnitude, and classified into n20
equally sized groups. Knowing the lognormal density function allows to compute
the theoretical number of observations for each group. The goodness of fit between

                                            16
the actual and theoretical distributions is tested by summing the squares of the
differences between the observed and theoretical number of outcomes in each group.
Asymptotically, this test statistic has a x_1 distribution.
    Using both test statistics, and under both the homoskedastic and heteroskedas-
tic specifications of the model, we find that the hypothesis of log-normal residual is
not rejected. This result, consistently with the early findings by Faxna (1976), sug-
gests that with monthly data the log-normality assumption might be a satisfactory
approximation.


5     Empirical Tests: Euler Equations
The maximum-likelihood-based tests reported in the previous section are the most
powerful tests, since they fully exploit all the restrictions the model imposes on the
data, given the maintained hypotheses on the process followed by the forcing vari-
ables (consumption, in our case) and the assumed dynamic structure of conditional
second moments. A less powerful set of tests was recently performed by Epstein
and Zin (1989b). These tests rely on the orthogonality restrictions implicit in the
first-order, necessary conditions for optimization expressed in equation (6).
    In this section we follow the same procedures as Epstein and Zin (1989b) to
verify whether relaxing the assumptions about the time variation of consumption
growth and conditional variances improves the empirical performace of the model
relative to the more restrictive Von Neumann Morgenstern setup. The system
of equations in (6) is estimated jointly using the generalized method of moments
(GMM) developed by Hansen (1982) and Cumby, Huizinga and Obstfeld (1983).
The model is tested by verifying the orthogonality of the instruments in excess of the


                                          17
 parameters to be estimated with the estimated residuals from the equations. The
 test statistic, proposed by Hansen (1982) is c'DE, where D = ZflZ, Z is a matrix
 of instruments, and O is a consistent estimate of fl = Iimr.0,,(l/T)E(Z'u'Z),
 obtained from sample moments. It is distributed as chi-square with degrees of
 freedom equal to the difference between the total number of instruments9 and the
 number of parameters to be estimated.
     The results are reported in Table V. We use four different sets of instruments,
 including:

     • a constant;

    • a constant plus lagged consumption growth and lagged return on the market;

    • a constant plus lagged returns on industry 1 and 2;

    • a constant plus lagged returns on industry 1 to 5.
Our point estimates of risk aversion and intertemporal substitution are similar to
those reported by Epstein and Zin (1989b). They differ, but not significantly,
from those obtained with maximum-likelihood under the log-normality assumption,
where p was generally a lower number, while y was much larger.
    Another interesting difference with the maximum-likelihood estimates is that
the Von Neuma.nn-Morgenstern restriction is rejected in all cases, except when only
a constant is used as an instrument (a case where also the parameter estimates are
very unprecise).
    In the table we report also estimates and tests of the restricted version of the
model, where       =   p.   Notice that whenever the overidentifying restrictions of the
  9When the instruments used in each equation are the same, the number of instruments times the
number of equations.                                                              -




                                              18
model are rejected, they are also rejected in the restricted, Von Neumann Morgen-
stern specification.
    Overall, the maximum likelihood estimation method, especially when allowing
for time-variation in second moments, led to much stronger rejections of the model
than the method of moments, using the same instruments. With the latter method,
rejections only occur with a much larger set of instruments.


6     Concluding Remarks
In this paper we presented two alternative procedures to estimate and test a class
of representative-agent asset pricing models which rely on a specification of pref-
erences that explicitly distinguishes attitudes towards risk from attitudes towards
intertemporal consumption smoothing, and subsumes the standard intertemporal
CAPM as a special case.
    The most important finding was that the relaxation of the constraint that the
coefficient of relative risk aversion equals the inverse of the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution (a constraint imposed by the standard consumption CAPM) does not
improve th fit of the model. In the maximum-likelihood estimates we cannot reject
the hypothesis that the two parameters are equal, but the model is rejected. In the
generalized-method-of-moments estimates we find that whenever we reject the more
general model we also reject the constrained one.
    In general, it appears once again that it is extremely difficult to obtain precise
estimates of the parameters: therefore the estimation of large-scale versions of the
model could be of significant interest.
