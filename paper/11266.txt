                                            ABSTRACT

Many scholars have asked whether British investors benefited from overseas investment investing

in the 19th century and whether this export of capital had negative effects. We re-visit the issue using

modern portfolio theory. We examine the set of investment opportunities available to British

investors, the developments in information transmission technology, and advances in financial and

investment theory at the time. We use mean-variance optimization techniques ot take into account

the risk and return characteristics of domestic and international investments available to a British

investor, and to quantify the beneifts from international diversification. Evidence suggests that

capital export was a consequence of both the opportunity and the understanding of diversification.

foreign assets offered higher rates of return, but equally important, they offered significant

diversification benefits. Even when--by setting expected return on each foreign asset class equal to

that of the corresponding UK asset class--we put foreign assets at a disadvantage, we find that it was

rational for a British investor to include foreign debts and equity in the portfolio.

                                              Introduction

         The vast sums of capital invested by the British in overseas enterprises in the late

19th and early 20th centuries has been the focus of more than a century of economic

discourse. Beginning with J. A. Hobson’s theory of oversavings as the motivation for

capital export and imperialism as its consequence, scholars have long disputed both the

cause and the effects of the unprecedented flow of capital from a single nation into

enterprises beyond its borders. While exact estimates of British overseas investment in

the 19th century vary,          there is general agreement that by 1914 Britain acquired a

historically unprecedented position as a global creditor.1 Between 1865 and 1914 as

much British investment went to Africa, Asia, and Latin America as to the United

Kingdom itself.2 Between 4 to 8 percent of GNP was being sent out of the country by

British investors in the years 1871—1913, a number significantly higher than that for

other developed nations at the time.3

         When a country sends a substantial amount of its financial capital abroad, a

natural question arises whether these capital exports hurt the development of the industry

at home.4 For example, Kennedy argues based on certain assumptions, that a diversion of

capital from overseas to home purposes would have added 25—50 per cent to the British

national income. Crafts, on more restrictive assumptions, made it 25 per cent.5 If this

indeed was the case, then Britain would have enjoyed a higher standard of living had

Victorian investors allocated a larger proportion of their portfolio to domestic issues. To

explain why investment abroad was so large if it was beneficial to invest at home some

scholars laid the blame on the City of London with its perceived propensity to channel

capital abroad. The proponents of this market failure hypothesis argue that London’s

capital markets discriminated against domestic industry in favor of overseas

investments.6 Ripley describes these views and responds to them eloquently:

        “British capital … was being used to develop foreign and colonial
        industries which were to prove serious competitors with the industries of
        Britain, competitive at first in particular areas and then throughout the
        world. … The flow of capital abroad might perhaps have been better
        directed, but a little reflection shows that nothing could have been gained
        in the long run by restricting capital investment to within the home
        country. The development of competing industries abroad would not have
        been prevented. Capital for that purpose would have been forthcoming
        from elsewhere; the trickle might have been slower and thinner, but the
        ultimate result would have been the same.”7

        Thus, in one view, overseas investment hurt Britain by creating a shortage of

capital for the domestic industry. Not being a supporter of any simplified opinion on the

matter of capital exports, Pollard writes:

        “An exactly opposite view is taken by neo-classical theory, which
        assumes, equally dogmatically, that capital exports must have been
        beneficial, since they would not have been undertaken had returns from

        abroad not been higher than expected returns from home investment; thus
        they served to raise total British national income.”8

        There is a closely related literature on the profitability of investment in British

empire. For example, Offer studies the question of whether the British empire was an

asset or a liability.9 The debate is focused on whether the empire produced economic

returns higher than investments in Britain itself and whether these higher returns justified

the cost of maintaining the empire, including the cost of defense. To measure returns,

Offer cites the evidence presented by Edelstein and by Davis and Huttenback that

overseas investment produced a higher risk-adjusted rate of return than British domestic

securities. Offer discusses the costs of British defense at some length and concludes that

these costs, contrary to the beliefs and conclusions of Davis and Huttenback, were not

excessive and can be rationalized. Overall, he concludes that “overseas investment paid

for its defense and left a substantial margin of profit.” When discussing the benefits of the

empire, Offer convincingly argues that the empire was a source of utility from items such

as status goods, the privilege of management and control, and the opportunity for

emigration.10 Although focused on the strategic benefits of investment in the empire,

Offer’s arguments are directly related to consumption smoothing and risk-sharing:

“Canadian wheat stood between Britain and starvation in 1917…”11

        The debate on the costs and benefits of international investing is frequently

focused on the rates of return of domestic and overseas assets. If returns on overseas

investments are expected to be higher than on domestic issues, then a rational investor

would purchase foreign assets. To study this, Edelstein constructs a sample of 566

common and preferred stocks and bonds, domestic, colonial, and foreign, between 1870

and 1913 and computes realized rates of return. He concludes that on average, for the

years 1870—1913, the United Kingdom’s holdings of overseas portfolio investments

realized a higher, price-deflated rate of return than their holdings of domestic portfolio

investments.12 Davis and Huttenback compute rates of return from company accounting

records. These data are taken from the records of 482 British firms, operating either at

home, in the empire, or in the rest of the world. Like Edelstein, they find that overall,

from 1860 to 1912, British firms operating in the empire had higher returns than domestic

enterprises, and also outperformed British companies operating overseas outside the

empire.13

        Edelstein argues that the risk of foreign and domestic assets is not the same and

computes risk-adjusted returns. Using a form of the Capital Asset Pricing Model to adjust

for the co-movement of international stocks with a domestic index, he finds that foreign

equities returned a significant 1.58% per annum more than domestic equities over the

period 1870-1913.14

        An approach that is focused on rates of return, either raw or corrected for

exposure to systematic risk via the CAPM does not use all the information contained in

returns on domestic and foreign assets. Returns also contain information on the degree of

correlation between different investments, and therefore, on the diversification benefits

not account for differences in performance between British and overseas management, especially when the
overseas management managed on its home turf.

available to individual investors. In this paper we explore this important dimension of the

data using Modern Portfolio Theory. Simply put, capital was invested abroad because

many individual investors made a decision to invest in foreign assets. Our goal is to take

into account expected returns, risks, and diversification opportunities simultaneously to

we-revisit the question of whether these decisions were individually rational and if so, to

what extent did the British investor benefited from international investing.15

        The discussion of the benefits of overseas investment and of financial risk sharing

can be enhanced and formalized by using mean-variance optimization techniques of the

MPT. Modern portfolio theory assumes that investor preferences can be represented by a

utility function defined over the expected return and variance of a portfolio return.

Rational investors form portfolios that have the smallest variance for every level of

expected return. In doing so, they take into account expected returns of assets in their

investment opportunity set, as well as asset variances and co-variances between different

investments.

        In this study we use the data on returns on domestic and foreign assets compiled

by Edelstein.16 Our findings, therefore, can be compared to the results obtained by other

researchers whose main focus is on the return characteristics of these data series. We

argue that it is important to bring co-variance between asset classes into the picture. We

document and quantify the benefits of international investments available to British

investors in the late nineteenth century.



15
   Several classic international asset pricing models are focused on the portfolio problem of domestic
investors: Black (1974), Stulz (1981a, 1981b), Errunza and Losq (1985), and Eun and Janakiramanan
(1986). For a corporate finance perspective see Errunza and Senbet (1981), Stulz (1999b), Stulz and
Wasserfallen (1995), Errunza and Miller (2000).

   See the description of annual return series on various asset classes in Edelstein 1982, Chapter 5.


                                                  6
           Our analysis suggests that diversification is an important explanation for British

investors’ overseas investments. Mean variance analysis shows that given expected

returns, variances and co-variances among domestic and foreign assets, rational investors

maximizing expected return for a given level of risk should have taken advantage of the

diversification opportunities and include foreign asset classes in their portfolios.

Estimates of British actual overseas investment, as a percentage of total investment range

from 28 per cent by Hobson (1914) and Feis (1930) to 47.7 per cent by Edelstein (1982),

with an average estimate of approximately 34 per cent.17 Our results for the optimal

portfolio weights from mean-variance analysis are surprisingly close to these. For

example, when we consider eleven UK equity asset classes and four world-wide equity

asset classes, the optimal portfolio given reasonable assumptions about investor risk

aversion includes 38 per cent investment overseas.18

           To highlight the role of diversification, we perform the following experiment. We

maintain the correlation matrix and the standard deviations of all asset classes, but set the

expected return on each foreign asset class equal to that of the corresponding UK asset

class. Since returns on UK asset classes are lower during the time period of study, this

effectively penalizes investment abroad. Even with this penalty, we find that it is still

optimal to include foreign assets in the portfolio and take advantage of the diversification

opportunities that investing overseas offers. A review of the financial literature of the

period also suggests that British investors understood benefits of international

diversification. Overall, evidence suggests that capital export was a consequence of

opportunity and understanding of diversification.

                                   The British Securities Market

British Investment Overseas

         The difficulty of obtaining precise measurements of overseas investment is well

known. Estimates based on new issues made in London may be wrong, because foreign

investors could, and often did, subscribe to issues made in London, and British investors

could, and did, subscribe to issues made in overseas markets. Similar arguments apply to

using nominal or market values of securities quoted in London. To obtain figures for

overseas investment, economic historians supplement the information on securities issued

and quoted in London with funds flow data, and with the estimates of the investment

income derived from overseas. Whatever the method used, there is an agreement that a

substantial amount of capital was sent by British investors to foreign countries during the

period from 1870 to 1913.19 Foreign investment, however, can be traced to earlier days of

international trade and finance.

         From the early days of finance, investors pursued international investments. The

earliest known joint-stock company in Britain was the Russia Company. It was formed in

1553 by a group of London merchants to send an expedition to seek for a North-East

passage to China and Indies.20 The ships reached Archangel, and in 1555 the Company

secured a charter giving it a monopoly of trade in Russia. Investors in the Company were

not making an international investment in the strictest sense, because their capital was not

all deployed abroad. Nonetheless, the risks that the Company faced were international in

nature.

          Another important early example of a chartered company was the East India

Company, also an international trade enterprise. Joint-stock companies were formed for

the colonization of Virginia (1606), Bermuda (1611), Guiana (1619), New England

(1620), and Nova Scotia (1621).21 By 1620 the East India Company had nearly a

thousand shareholders and a subscribed stock of ₤1,629,000.22 The first foreign

government loan was floated in London in 1706 on behalf of the Emperor of Germany

for ₤500,000, secured on the revenues of Silesia and bearing interest at 8 per cent.23 More

financial landmarks followed—The South Sea Company (1711), the establishment of the

Sinking Fund in England (1717), The South Sea Bubble (1720), and The Bubble Act that

made the formation of joint stock companies a difficult and costly matter. In 1802 a new

Stock Exchange was opened in Capel Court.

          The significant flow of British investment overseas began in the years after the

French wars. Three issues of the French “rentes” were placed by Barings in London

between 1815 and 1818. In the early 1820’s Rothschilds issued loans in London for

Prussia and Russia. The republics of Central and South America also borrowed in

London at that time. Between 1822 and 1825, Brazil and Peru each raised three loans;

Mexico and Columbia, two; and Chile, the Argentine and Guatemala, one.24 Greece also

placed a 5 per cent government bond in London at this time. With the exception of Brazil,

all of the South American States soon defaulted. During the next fifteen years most

foreign issues in London were from the United States. The amount of British investment

in the United States around 1840 has been estimated between ₤22 million and ₤40

million.25

        Table 1 lists different types of securities quoted on the London Stock Exchange

in 1843 and their nominal values. Loans to foreign governments represent 11% of the

securities. In addition, there are private companies that can be clearly identified as

international enterprises. Among them, there is the East India Company, the South Sea

Company, and twenty four foreign mining companies.

        Morgan and Thomas estimate that by the mid eighteen-fifties British overseas

investments were over ₤200 million, and during the next twenty years they increased

more than five-fold.26 Between 1860 and 1876 more then a hundred and fifty foreign

government loans were issued in London and British investors are estimated to have

provided ₤320 million in cash to these borrowers. This is more than two-and-a-half times

the nominal amount of all foreign government debt in 1842. In addition, ₤160 million is

estimated to have been invested in India and colonial governments and railways, and

more than ₤230 million in companies operating abroad.27 This was the time of large

outflow of British capital to India. The amount of capital invested in Indian railways

alone from 1858 to 1869 was ₤70.1 million. Indian securities were widely held. On

January 1, 1868 there were 49,690 shareholders and bondholders, practically all of whom

   For comparison, the total value of UK government debt was ₤832 million in 1850 and ₤775 in 1875.
With UK population in 1877 being equal to 33,444,419 UK government debt equaled 23 pounds 5 shillings
per head. Foreign investment by the mid-1870’s reached 29 pounds 18 shillings per person (the figures for
UK population and UK debt are from The Investors’ Monthly Manual).

Britain. Fifty million pounds were loaned between 1860 and 1876 to the governments in

Australasia, mainly for railway construction and other infrastructure projects. Twenty-

five million more were loaned to the governments of Canada and smaller colonies.29

        Investment overseas continued throughout the 1880’s. The amount of capital

raised in 1888 was ₤160 million and another ₤190 million followed in 1890. Much of this

capital went into South American shares, and the shares of mining companies in North

America and Africa. The sum subscribed for mining ventures in 1888 was ₤52.5 million,

and in 1889 ₤41 million.30 According to Ripley, estimated British capital abroad in 1885

stood at ₤1,302,000 and reached ₤1,600 million in 1895.31 Table 2 shows the nominal

value of foreign securities quoted on the London Stock Exchange at the beginning of

1893. Of the total amount ₤1,368 million, foreign government securities represented 38%

and colonial government securities represented 16%. These are the two largest asset

classes. US Railways accounted for 8.8% and railways in India for another 4.75%. All

railway securities accounted for 28.4% of the total investment overseas.

        Another period of phenomenal growth in overseas investment was from 1905 to

1914. Overall, well over ₤2,000 million was invested abroad between 1880 and 1914.32

At the end of 1913, a total of ₤3,715 million was invested in overseas securities.

or wealth, British capital exports moved to unprecedented levels in the late nineteenth

and early twentieth centuries.33

        Where was the money invested? Table 3 displays the geographical distribution of

foreign investment, as well as the distribution of investment among different asset classes

and industries. At the end of 1913, just under half of foreign investment was in the

dominions and colonies, approximately 20% in the United States, and another 20% in

Latin America, and 15% in Europe. U.S. new issues were 21 per cent of total new

overseas issues, 1886—1913. Argentina was another significant importer of capital from

the United Kingdom over the same years. Between 1870 and 1913 Argentina issues

accounted for approximately 8 per cent of total overseas issues placed in the UK.

Between 1870 and 1913 Australian new issues absorbed by the United Kingdom

amounted to ₤325 million, approximately 8 per cent of total new overseas issues in the

UK. Britain’s investment in new Canadian issues totaled 9.7 per cent of the total new

issues taken up by the United Kingdom during 1870—1913.34 Distribution across various

industries is also interesting: 40% of foreign investment was in railway securities, 30%

in loans to foreign governments and municipalities, 5% in public utilities, 10% in mines

and plantations, and about 8% in banks and financial institutions.35



The Investment Opportunity Set

investors faced a rich set of foreign investment opportunities. By no means was this set

approached the British financial market early in their political development. Greece, too,

borrowed in London when funds were needed to support the formation of a new political

regime. Technological changes also affected the investment opportunity set. With the

invention of the telegraph new companies were formed throughout the world laying

telegraph cables and establishing the world-wide telecommunications network. Finally,

infrastructure development placed large demands on the capital markets. British investors

financed railroad construction throughout the world. Tracing the evolution of the

investment opportunity set over several decades shows that foreign securities occupied an

increasingly important role in the portfolio of a British investor, and illustrates that the

investments also came from a wide range of industries and geographical regions, creating

substantial diversification benefits.

           The London Stock Exchange was both the world’s largest before 1914, and the

most international. In 1903, S. S. Pratt, an American, noted that “The bonds of every

Government, the stocks of every country, are traded in London,” and made a comparison

with New York, where “Wall Street confines itself to the securities of the United States.”

Only the Paris Bourse came close to London as an international financial center.

London’s interest was worldwide, whereas Paris tended to trade in the securities of other

European and Mediterranean countries.36

           Integration between the London securities market and those abroad began in the

eighteenth century when British securities were held extensively abroad, especially by the

Dutch. At the beginning of the nineteenth century foreign holdings of British securities

were reduced to small amounts and continued to decline. At the same time, British

                                             13
investors were beginning to hold foreign securities.37 By 1843 a total of ₤1,118 million

(nominal values) of securities was known in London, and of these, at least ₤128 million,

or 11.4%, were foreign (Table 1). By 1853, when the paid-up capital of securities quoted

on the London Stock Exchange was ₤1,215 million, a total of ₤101 million, or 8.3 per

cent, was foreign, with 70% issued by foreign governments and 30% by foreign railroad

companies (Table 5).

           The second half of the nineteenth century there was a significant growth in

internationally held government debt issued by non-European countries. Table 4 lists

government securities traded on the London Stock Exchange in 1869 and in 1890. There

are 196 government bonds listed for 1869 and 250 for 1890. Canada, Brazil, Argentina

and Australia raised funds to finance infrastructure development. In 1863, the nominal

value foreign government securities quoted in London equaled ₤146.7 million, or 9 per

cent of the total (which equaled ₤1,604 million). By 1883, the nominal value of foreign

government securities quoted in London grew to ₤831.5, which equaled 22.8 per cent of

the total of ₤3,641 million. Trading in the debt securities issued by countries such as

Britain, France, Germany and the United States mostly took place on their own principal

exchanges. However, it was not necessary for foreign debt to be exclusively held in

Britain for it to be important from the point of view of a British investor. What was

important was the fact that foreign debt could be purchased with relatively small

transaction costs through a domestic securities exchange in London.

           In addition to government issues, British investors had access to foreign corporate

stocks and bonds (Tables 2 and 5). Securities issued by continental European railways

and US railroad securities were two important asset classes. Depending on the source of

data, in 1893 US railways accounted for 8.8% to 11% of the total nominal value of

securities quoted in London. New issues of railroad securities were made available to

British investors throughout the years. When the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railroad

made a new issue of $88 million 4 per cent bonds in 1896 it allocated 22.7 per cent to

Amsterdam, 29.5 per cent to London and the remainder to New York.38

        In addition to US railroad securities, the issues of railway companies from

numerous other countries were also an important part of the British investors’ investment

opportunity set. For example, 65 per cent of Canadian Pacific Railway shares were held

in Britain. Of the ₤1.5 million loan placed by the Argentine North-Eastern Railway in

1888, investors in Britain accounted for 62.5 per cent.39

        Industries other than railroads were also represented on the London Stock

Exchange by foreign stocks and bonds. These, for example, included securities issued to

finance the development of copper mining in Spain, United States, and the gold-mining

boom in South Africa in the 1890s.40 Other industries included banking, chemical

industry, steel, manufacturing, telegraph (and later, telephone), gas and light, waterworks,

and tramways—the latter five industries jointly often referred to as infrastructure

securities.

        The investment opportunity set continued to expand with the development of

financial markets. Table 3 provides a summary of foreign investment opportunities

available to a British investor at the end of the period of our study, in 1913. By this time

foreign stocks and shares quoted in London had a nominal value of nearly ₤6,800 million,

60% of the value of all quoted securities. Investors had access to securities issued within

the empire, including Canadian, Indian, and Australasian securities. Investors could

purchases stocks and bonds issued by North American and South American governments

and corporations, as well as securities from all European states, the Middle East, Japan,

and China. Overall, the investment opportunity set of a British investor at the end of 1913

is a list of companies that occupies ninety pages of The Investor’s Monthly Manual,

printed in a rather small font. The examination of this list shows that not only were the

investors able to diversify their holding geographically, but they also could invest in

different industries. Apart from government securities issued by colonial and foreign

governments, there were stocks and bonds issued by foreign banks, breweries, canals and

docks, mines, and railroads, as well numerous other industries. For example, the list

contains 187 securities issued by American (US and Mexican) railway companies and

240 by foreign railways (this number does not include Canadian and Indian railways

which are listed separately).

       British investors could invest in individual issues of stocks and bonds floated by

foreign governments and commercial enterprises. The investors could also invest in

overseas assets through investment trusts that acted as financial intermediaries similarly

to today’s mutual funds. Investment trusts allowed smaller investors to hold diversified

portfolios of foreign securities, thereby making investment abroad a more attractive

proposition for British investors.

       The concept of the investment trust company, or a mutual fund, received an

increasing amount of attention and popularity during the last quarter of the nineteenth

century. The Scottish American Investment Co., Ltd., founded in 1873 was an early

success story. Fifteen new investment trust companies were formed in 1888 with a capital

of ₤9,500,000 and another nineteen in the following year, with the capital of ₤25 million.

The total capital invested in investment trust companies at the end of 1889 was

approximately ₤50 million.41 As of the end of 1890, 119 investment trusts were listed in

The Investor’s Monthly Manual, with total capital of ₤60,076,805. Of this amount, the

trusts with names suggesting overseas investments had a total capital of ₤6,366,426, or

10.6 percent.42 There were trusts with the titles such as Colonial Securities, Ltd., Foreign,

American, and General Investment Trust, Foreign and Colonial Government Trust, Ltd.,

South African Gold Trust and Agency, Ltd., and United States and South American

Investment Trust, Ltd.

         British investors had access to securities from many foreign issuers. Henry

Lowenfeld, and English author, in his 1909 book Investment, an Exact Science lists forty

countries with stock markets open to British investors.43 These securities represented

different regions of the world, as well as varied across industries. Investors had access to

bonds, preferred stocks, and ordinary stocks. Investors were also able to invest overseas

through an important group of intermediaries, investment trust companies. Overall, the

ability to trade foreign securities in London was a crucial characteristic of the investment

opportunity set in Britain.

The Information Environment

        Successful development of a financial market requires access to information. If

British investors were to place their capital at risk in remote parts of the world, it is only

natural to expect that they would have had a strong demand for information about their

investments. The emergence of London as the world financial center took place at a time

of revolutionary improvement in information transmission. Britain was at the forefront of

the technological change. Electric telegraph, based on scientific discoveries,

technological innovations, and engineering talent, linked the City of London with most

distant parts of the world.44

        The first electric telegraph line established in Europe for the actual transmission

of messages was between London and Birmingham, in 1838, by Sir Charles Wheatstone

(1802—1875). In France the first line was constructed in 1844 between Paris and Rouen.

The lines between Paris and Orleans, and Paris and Lille were constructed in the years

1847 and 1848. The first line constructed in the United States was put in operation in

June, 1844, between Washington and Baltimore. The next year it was continued to New

York and Boston, and in 1846 to Buffalo and Harrisburg.45

        First telegraph lines used overhead copper wires. As technology improved, it

became possible to lay telegraph lines under water. Prescott wrote in 1860: “The English


44
   Kaukiainen argues that there was a substantial improvement in the speed of world-wide information
transmission even before the introduction of the electric telegraph. He collects data from the Lloyd’s List
and argues that between 1820 and 1860, transmission times dropped substantially, in many cases to a third
or even a fifth and in no case to less than about a half. The median interval in days between dispatch and
receipt between London and St. Petersburg went from 25 days in 1820 to 7 in 1860. For other routes these
numbers are: London and Gibraltar, 21 and 8 days; London and Constantinople, 38 and 10 days; London
and Bombay, 145 and 26 days; London and New York, 32 and 13 days. Kaukiainen, Yrjo, 2001,

were the first to lay submarine cables, and are now far in advance of the rest of the world

in their manufacture, and in machinery for laying them.”46 By 1860, three lines were in

existence between England and the Continent. Submarine cables connected England and

Ireland, and Denmark and Sweden. Nearly one hundred submarine cables totaling more

than 25,000 miles had been laid around the world, uniting about one-half million miles of

land lines in America, Great Britain, Europe, India, Africa, Asia and Russia.47 The

Atlantic cable, connecting Ireland with Newfoundland and New York, and thus

permitting Europe to communicate telegraphically with America, was laid 1858 and the

first public dispatch – that of the Queen to the President of the United States – was

received on August 17. Communications broke down, however, in September. The first

fully successful Atlantic cable was completed in 1866.

        The speed of information transmission through the telegraph system also

improved continuously. In the 1860’s, a telegraphic message could reach London from

India in eight and a half hours.48 “The actual celerity with which correspondence is

transmitted between London and parts of Europe more or less remote, may be judged

from the fact that the Queen’s speech, delivered at the opening of the recent

Parliamentary session, was delivered verbatim, and circulated in Paris and in Berlin,

before her Majesty had left the House of Lords.”49 This was quite an improvement over

the situation merely ten years before, when the fastest form of transport between London

and Paris involved hours of travel, with the closing prices of the Paris Bourse not being

received at the London Stock Exchange until 10 a.m. the following day.50 Kaukiainen

compares overseas dispatch times to London before and after the introduction of

telegraph. The dispatch time between London and Bombay decreased from 145 days by

post in 1820 to 3 days in 1870 by telegraph. These numbers were: London and Hong

Kong 141 days in 1840 and 3 days in 1870; London and Sydney, 140 days (1820) and 4

days (1870).

        The financial community quickly adopted the telegraph. By 1908, there were nine

wires between the London and Paris stock exchanges. London was connected to all

European financial centers, as well as more remote locations—New York (1866),

Melbourne (1872), and Buenos Aires (1874). In 1871, the annual volume of telegrams

between London and New York reached 42,000. Although the most rapid long-distance

telegraph communications existed between the London Stock Exchange and New York,

similar links were established throughout the world through a network of submarine and

land lines.51 Even with the invention of the telephone, in 1876, the telegraph remained an

important channel of communications.52 Telephone service was for a long time quite

limited. And although the line between London and Paris operated since 1891, there was

no transcontinental telephone until 1915.

        These technological developments changed the informational environment of

British investors. By 1870, with the development of the electric telegraph network,

British investors could receive news concerning political events world-wide, economic

in the colonies.



Investment Theories and Diversification

        British investors understood the benefits of international diversification. Perhaps

they were not employing the formal statistical tools and did not analyze the correlations

between various investments. They have clearly understood, however, that they could

achieve better risk and return opportunities by investing part of their portfolio in foreign

securities. The quantitative analysis of international diversification dates at least to Henry

Lowenfeld’s        (1909)   study     of   equal-weighted,       industry-neutral,     international

diversification strategies. In his book, he argues that superior investment performance can

be obtained by spreading capital in equal proportion across a number of geographical

areas and carefully re-balancing back to these proportions on a regular basis.53 This

geographical diversification strategy was apparently a popular one with British and other

European investors during the last quarter of the nineteenth century.54

        To support the recommendation for international diversification, Lowenfeld

postulates that different factors affect securities from different countries. The dominant

factor affecting security returns is the market factor (Market Influence in his terminology)

for that country. In support of this argument, Lowenfeld displays a chart showing the

price movements of twelve British stocks (actually fixed income securities) from the year

1893 to the end of 1906 to argue that there is a large degree of co-movement between

                                                 21
them. Then the author points out that even if an investor holds a mixed assortment of

British stocks he cannot expect the movements in the value of the investments to

counterbalance each other, because all of them are subject to the influence from the home

market-wide risk factor. This logic is similar to modern international asset pricing

theories that show that returns on an asset are a function of the asset’s exposure to the

world market factor, and of the national market factor in the asset’s domestic market.

           To show that this logic applies to financial markets in other countries, Lowenfeld

provides charts of price movements of the stocks of the following countries: Great

Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Canada, Japan, USA, and Argentina

(the figure is reproduced in Appendix A). He concludes that the value of all securities

that come from the same country is influenced by that country’s market factor. At the

same time he points out that securities from different countries do not have the same

degree of co-movement as securities within one country. This observation allows

Lowenfeld to put forward an investment principle which he calls “The Geographical

Distribution of Capital.” According to this principle, an investor spreads his wealth across

securities from different countries, thereby diversifying away country-specific risks:

            “If an investor divides his capital equally among a number of stocks,
           every one of which is under a different trade influence, then each of these
           divisions of his capital will constitute a distinct investment risk, and a true
           system of averaging investment risks is thereby established.”55

           Lowenfeld also observes that when holding a diversified international portfolio an

investor can achieve a higher level of return for the same level of risk compared to the

case when only domestic securities are held in a portfolio:




55
     Lowenfeld, 1907, p. 51.


                                                 22
        “An investor who geographically distributes his capital can, with safety,
        afford to hold stocks which yield a larger income56 than he can hope to
        receive from an Investment List which disregards the important point of
        Geographical Distribution.”57

        Lowenfeld’s book shows that British investors, including the managers of banks,

insurance, and finance companies, as well as large private investors, had a sophisticated

way of thinking about investments. In many ways the views expressed in the book

correspond to the ideas of the Modern Portfolio Theory, which was formally developed

more than fifty years laterg. He advocates, for example, analyzing investments from a

portfolio point of view and explains “the necessity of considering all investments held as

one harmonious whole, of which all the component parts must properly balance each

other.”58

        Lowenfeld also considers how an internationally diversified portfolio should be

constructed for an investor who has limited wealth. He recommends that the first stock

that an investor buys for his portfolio be of “a general international character.”59 In other

words, the first stock should be a stock that represents a world market portfolio. The

second stock should be a British stock. Consistent with the principle of diversification,

the author recommends that the next sum should be invested “in a stock whose trade

influence is most likely to be in diametrical contrast to that of Great Britain.”60 Once

again, he expresses a view consistent with modern financial theory, namely with the

formal statistical result that the lowest variance of a portfolio can be achieved when

assets in the portfolio are negatively correlated.

           In his discussion of The Geographical Distribution of Capital Lowenfeld takes

into account both returns from foreign assets, as well as the risks. But how well did

British investors understand the risks of foreign investment? The short answer is, “Very

well.” Investors in Britain had a sufficiently long history of active involvement in

international financial market to accumulate negative experience and to learn the fact that

placing capital in foreign lands can be risky. “By 1843, British citizens were believed to

hold over ₤120 million of foreign bonds, including those of the American states, but at

least ₤50 million were in default with dividends anything from five to twenty-five years

overdue.”61

           Investors understood the risks, and were familiar with the difficulties that arose

when foreign securities were in default. In 1875 the Government appointed a Select

Committee to investigate the circumstances surrounding many foreign loans and the

reasons for default on such loans. Loans raised by Honduras, San Domingo, Costa Rica,

and Paraguay with the total nominal value of ₤10 million were subject of the inquiry. The

Committee uncovered unsound lending practices on part of the syndicates that were

formed to take portions of the loan at a price considerably below the issue price and re-

sell the loan to the public. Honduras incurred a debt of ₤5,990,000 in the nominal

principal value, and in return for the liability provided security in the form of an

abandoned section of a railway line 53 miles in length for which the builder received

₤689,000. The Committee remarked of San Domingo that “it is clear that the Republic

felt the improvidence of a bargain by which in return for a sum of ₤320,000 it was to

repay in respect of interest and sinking fund annuities amounting to a total sum of

₤1,472,500, or in other words, more than 18 per cent per annum for twenty five years.”
61
     Morgan and Thomas, 1962, pp. 86—87. Their work contains an extensive discussion on early defaults.


                                                    24
Overall, at the end of 1878, 54% of Britain’s loans to foreign governments were in total

or partial default.62

        Another period of crisis, this time resulting from heavy borrowing by Argentina,

were the years 1888 through 1893, and again in 1896. Argentina carried a heavy burden

of external debt, the amount at the beginning of 1890 was approximately ₤22 million,

experienced high inflation, and generally was in poor financial condition. In 1890 it

became evident that the Argentine Government could not meet its obligations and

guarantees on external railway and other loans and prices of Argentine securities fell

dramatically in London.63 The price of the Argentine Government Bond of 1886 fell by

17.5% from the end of 1889 to the end of 1890. The Buenos Ayres 1882 bond fell by

31.5% during the same period.64 A series of renegotiations between a committee of

English creditors chaired by Lord Rothschild and the Argentine Government took place

in 1893 and 1896, and some of the losses of the bondholders were recovered.

        The risks of foreign investments must be considered jointly with returns. And in

many cases investments in foreign government loans gave a very reasonable rate of

return. Writing in 1881, Nash lists approximately 130 foreign government securities with

a total market capitalization of over ₤1,400 million, about half of which were believed to

be in British ownership. For stocks that had been issued that long, he traces the dividend

history back to 1870, finds remarkably few defaults, and reports an average dividend

yield of 5.87%.65 By 1870’s, British investors understood the risks of foreign

diversification, and paid attention to both risk and return when placing capital abroad.

                      Evidence from the Modern Portfolio Theory

Theory

         Let there be N risky assets available to the investors. The investment opportunity

set is described by the vector of expected returns on the N assets, z , and by Σ , the

covariance matrix. Modern portfolio theory assumes that the investors’ preferences can

be represented by a utility function defined over mean (the expected return) and variance

of a portfolio’s return. The assumption is that investors favor higher means and smaller

variances. Minimum-variance portfolios are portfolios that have the smallest variance for

every level of expected returns. In the absence of a risk-less asset the minimum variance

portfolio with expected return µ is the solution w (µ ) to

Vector w is the vector of weights of risky securities in the portfolio. When no positivity

constraints of the form wi ≥ 0 are imposed, unrestricted short sales are permitted. With

no short sale restrictions and no risk-free asset available, in mean-standard deviation

space, with mean return on the y-axis and standard deviation on the x-axis, the set of




                                             26
minimum variance portfolios is a hyperbola, as illustrated in Figure 1.66 When a risk-less

asset is available a Capital Allocation Line (CAL) obtains. It is a straight line which

intersects the y-axis at the risk-free rate and is tangent to the minimum variance frontier

constructed from risky assets. The Capital Asset Pricing Model identifies the tangency

point as the market portfolio. Sharpe ratio, which equals the slope of the CAL,

characterizes the risk-return trade-off of the market portfolio and is computed as

                                                    rp − r f
                                             Sp =              ,
                                                      σp
where rp is the expected return on the market portfolio, r is the risk-free interest rate,

and σ p is the standard deviation of the return on the market portfolio. Portfolios with

higher Sharpe ratios offer more attractive risk-return trade-off.

        Investors frequently face short-sales constraints. The minimum variance frontier

can still be constructed. When no risk-free asset is available, the optimization problem (1)

is modified by adding short sales constraints wi ≥ 0 for all assets, i = 1, K, N . In this case

there is no simple analytical characterization of the frontier, and numerical optimization

methods are required to compute the frontier portfolios. Generally, with positivity

constraints the frontier is not a hyperbola.67 If a risk-free asset is available, it is still

possible to draw a straight line with the intercept equal to the risk-free rate tangent to the

minimum variance frontier. The tangency point is the market portfolio in this case, and its

Sharpe ratio (the slope of the line) characterizes the risk-return trade-off that the investors

in the economy face.

       To evaluate the role of the foreign assets we first construct minimum variance

portfolios with only domestic assets. We then include foreign assets in the investment

opportunity set and construct minimum variance portfolios again. We follow this

procedure to quantify the improvement in the risk-return trade-off due to the inclusion of

foreign investments.



Evidence from Five Broadly Defined Asset Classes

       We begin our minimum-variance analysis by using five broadly defined asset

classes: UK Equity, UK Preferred, UK Debt, Foreign Equity, and Foreign Debt. The asset

classes are defined by Edelstein. Table 6 displays expected annual returns on the five

asset classes, standard deviations, and correlations. Foreign equity has a higher return

than domestic equity, 8.66% compared to 6.61%. Foreign debt has a higher return than

domestic debt, 4.94% and 3.35%, respectively. At the same time, with a standard

deviation of 9.36% foreign equity is riskier than domestic equity, which has a standard

deviation of 7.38%. Foreign debt does not appear to be riskier than domestic debt.

Foreign debt returns have a standard deviation of 2.37% compared to 2.36% for domestic

debt. This, however, can be attributed to the fact that foreign debt asset class includes a

much greater number of securities than the domestic debt asset class. By including a large

number of government and industrial bonds from around the globe, foreign debt already

takes advantage of diversification opportunities. Examination of the correlation matrix

reveals a high correlation between domestic common and preferred shares (0.71). The

correlation between domestic and foreign equity returns is lower at 0.39.




                                            28
       Data from Table 6 is used to construct a mean-variance frontier with only British

asset classes and a frontier that uses all five asset classes. The two frontiers are shown in

Figure 1. No short sale restrictions are imposed. We refer to this case as “unconstrained.”

The figure illustrates a substantial improvement in the risk-return trade-off resulting from

the inclusion of the foreign asset classes. The hyperbola constructed with foreign assets is

located higher and to the left compared to the hyperbola that utilizes domestic assets

only, indicating that any level of expected return µ can be attained with less risk σ when

foreign assets are used. Figure 2 is similar to Figure 1, except that no short sales are

allowed—investments in all assets are constrained to be positive. Inclusion of foreign

assets clearly improves risk-return characteristics of the frontier. The market (tangency)

portfolio constructed with only UK assets has expected return of 5.21%, standard

deviation of 3.89%, and a Sharpe ratio of 0.67. When foreign asset classes are included,

the market portfolio has expected return of 5.02%, substantially less risk (2.40%), and a

Sharpe ratio of 1.01.

       Table 7 shows portfolio characteristics of the market portfolios created with

different mixes of assets. Both the unconstrained and constrained cases are shown.

Without short-sale constraints UK market portfolio has expected return of 7.51%,

standard deviation of 6.99%, and Sharpe ratio of 0.70. When foreign stocks and bonds are

included Sharpe ratio increases to 1.18. The market portfolio has expected return of

7.02% and substantially less risk (3.73%). The analysis suggests that given the risk and

return characteristics of the five asset classes, rational investors maximizing expected

return for a given level of risk should take advantage of the diversification opportunities

and include foreign asset classes in their portfolios.




                                              29
       To highlight the role of diversification, we perform the following experiment. We

maintain the correlation matrix and the standard deviations of all asset classes, but set

expected return on each foreign asset class equal to that of the corresponding UK asset

class. Since returns on UK asset classes are lower, this effectively penalizes investment

abroad. Expected return on foreign equity is now set to 6.61%, down from 8.66%. All the

benefits from investing abroad are now caused by diversification benefits, not by higher

returns offered by foreign assets. The results are presented in Table 8. Without short-sale

constraints, the market portfolio with penalized foreign assets has Sharpe ratio of 0.75,

below the un-penalized value of 1.18, but still higher than the UK-only domestic

portfolio with Sharpe ratio of 0.70. The results are stronger when short-sales are not

allowed. In this case, the penalized market portfolio that includes foreign assets achieves

a higher expected return than the UK-only portfolio (5.32% vs. 5.21%), and has a lower

risk (3.86% vs. 3.89%). Foreign equity is riskier than domestic equity. Foreign debt is

riskier than domestic debt. The returns on foreign and the corresponding domestic assets

are set to be the same. Yet, it is still optimal to include foreign assets in the portfolio and

take advantage of the diversification opportunities that investing overseas offers. The

analysis also gives a benchmark level of investment abroad. Under the realistic

assumption of no short sales and with foreign assets being penalized by setting their

expected returns to the lower values of UK expected returns, the market portfolio still has

14% of wealth invested in foreign equity.

       The benefit of equalizing the mean returns of domestic and foreign asset classes is

that our analysis is robust to a range of assumptions about risk aversion. There is no

implicit trade-off off between mean and variance in a situation in which the expected




                                              30
returns are equal.   The diversification result is thus driven solely by differences in

variance and covariance between domestic and international asset classes.



Analysis of UK and Foreign Equity

       The analysis can be refined in several ways. First, the number of asset classes can

be increased. Instead of simply analyzing UK equity securities as one asset class, it is

possible to include different industries in the study. We consider UK equity securities

from 11 industries. We assume throughout this section that UK investors limited the

number of assets in their portfolios. When investors face fixed transaction costs, such as

brokerage commissions, and have limited funds available, they take transaction costs into

account while forming portfolios. This results in investors not using all assets in the

opportunity set, but only investing in a sub-set of assets. We assume that investors used

seven assets in their portfolios. There are 330 different subsets of seven UK equity

securities assets drawn from eleven. The three sub-sets that result in a market portfolio

with the highest Sharpe ratios are listed in Table 9. In the constrained case the best

combination of seven assets produces market portfolio with Sharpe ratio of 1.055, in the

un-constrained case this number is 1.372.

       Now include four world equity classes in the investment opportunity set. There

are 6,435 different subsets of seven assets drawn from 15 equity asset classes. The three

sub-sets that produce market portfolios with the highest Sharpe ratio are given in Table

10. Including foreign equity improves the best possible case. For the constrained case,

Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio is now 1.149 and 1.50 for the un-constrained case.

When foreign equity is included in the opportunity set the expected return on the market




                                            31
portfolio increases when compared to the UK-only case from 8.79% to 9.28%

(constrained case), and from 12.4% to 13.5% (unconstrained case). Figure 3 shows the

mean-variance frontier constructed with seven best UK-only equity asset classes and with

seven best selected from 15 UK and world equity indices. The figure illustrates the

improvement in the risk-return trade-off that results from the inclusion of the overseas

investments.68 It is important to point out that the positivity constraints used in this

analysis are consistent with real limitations to shorting sector indices and individual

securities on the London market. Although short-selling was certainly practiced through

much of this period, it is unlikely that it would have been used by a long-term investor to

maintain an optimal position in tern of risk and return of the portfolio.



Equity and Debt

         We repeat the previous analysis but now include UK and foreign debt. The

investment opportunity set now includes 19 asset classes: 5 UK Equity indices; 2 UK

Preferred Share indices, 4 UK Debt indices, and 8 foreign asset classes (4 equity and 4

debt). Again, we assume that portfolios contain seven assets. There are 50,388 different

subsets of seven asset classes drawn from nineteen. The sub-sets that produce market

portfolios with the highest Sharpe ratio are given in Table 11. When short-sale

constraints are imposed (Panel A) the best portfolio invests in three foreign asset classes

and produces a Sharpe ratio of 1.278. This may be compared to the best sub-set of 7



68
   The results hold not only for the very best group of 7 assets. In the un-constrained case when groups of 7
assets are ranked by the Sharpe ratio of their market portfolio, all top 200 groups contain at least one
foreign equity asset class. The average optimal investment overseas across these 200 groups is 68%. In the
case of short-sale constraints, when groups of 7 assets are ranked by the Sharpe ratio of their market
portfolio, all top 1,000 groups contain at least one foreign asset class. The average optimal overseas
allocation across these 1,000 groups equals 47%.


                                                    32
assets drawn form 11 UK-only asset classes that produces market portfolio with expected

return of 7.84%, standard deviation of 4.77%, and a lower Sharpe ratio of 1.099 (not

shown in the table).69 Examination of recommended portfolio weights shows that the

constrained optimization procedure suggests that in the best cases, 48 to 52 percent of

wealth should be invested in world railway debt securities. This finding is particularly

remarkable in light of the fact that between 1865 and 1941, at least 41 percent of total

new overseas issues raised on British exchanges went solely for railway plant and

equipment.70

         In the unconstrained case the best subset of 7 assets from 11 UK-only asset

classes produces market portfolio with Sharpe ratio of 1.46. When overseas asset classes

are available, the best subset of 7 from 19 includes 4 foreign asset classes and produces

market portfolio with a significantly higher Sharpe ratio of 1.95. Figure 4 shows mean-

variance frontiers and capital allocation lines constructed with the best sub-sets of seven

asset classes. When foreign assets are included in the opportunity set the Capital

Allocation Line has a higher slope, indicating that a higher expected return can be

obtained for the same level of risk.

         We now take our analysis one step further. For the 19 UK and overseas asset

classes we once again maintain the correlations and the standard deviations of all assets,

but set expected return on each foreign asset class equal to that of the corresponding UK

asset class. As before, this effectively penalizes investment abroad and highlights the role

of diversification. The results are presented in Table 12. In the constrained case (Panel

69
   Benefits from using foreign asset classes are seen not only in the best 3 sub-sets, but also in the best one
thousand. In the case of short-sale constraints when groups of 7 assets are ranked by Sharpe ratio of their
market portfolio, all top 1,000 groups contain at least one foreign asset class. They all beat the UK-only
best case.

A) the best market portfolio has a Sharpe ratio of 1.15, compared to the best UK-only

market portfolio with Sharpe ratio of 1.099. The market portfolio that uses penalized

overseas indices has both higher return (7.99% vs. 7.84%) and lower risk (4.69% vs.

4.77%) than the UK-only portfolio. Three out of seven asset classes in the top performing

portfolios are foreign assets and the total fraction of wealth invested overseas is just

above 20%. Similar results are obtained when short sales are allowed. The Sharpe ratio of

the penalized foreign portfolio equals 1.700, higher than the Sharpe ratio of the UK-only

portfolio of 1.46. Even when foreign assets are penalized with lower expected returns,

they provide substantial improvement to the risk-return trade-off and should be included

in the optimal portfolio.



                                       Conclusion

       Our findings indicate that diversification played an important role in the decision

of British investors to allocate a significant fraction of their portfolio to overseas

securities. Even when — by setting expected return on each foreign asset class equal to

that of the corresponding UK asset class — we put foreign assets at a disadvantage, we

find that it was rational for an investor to include a large proportion of foreign debt and

equity in the portfolio. British investors had access to securities from all over the world.

They also had access to news concerning political and economic events world-wide.

Investors understood the notion of diversification, albeit in a slightly less formally

developed at the time, and followed this principle by allocating a significant portion of

their investments abroad. Our analysis shows that this behavior was consistent with the




                                            34
recommendations obtained by applying Modern Portfolio Theory to the return series of

securities available to the UK investors.

Mean-Variance frontier constructed with UK Assets only (blue) and with UK and Foreign Assets
(red). UK-Only frontier is constructed using three asset classes: UK Equity, UK Preferred, and
UK Debt. UK and Foreign frontier contains three UK asset classes and adds Foreign Equity and
Foreign Debt. Data is from Edelstein, 1982. Returns on the asset classes are given in Edelstein,
Table 5.5, p. 126.

Unconstrained optimization: minimum-variance frontier constructed with the best sub-set of
seven asset classes selected from eleven UK Equity asset classes and the frontier constructed
with the best seven assets selected from eleven UK Equity asset classes and four foreign equity
asset classes. The best subsets are found by selecting the sub-set of 7 out of 11 assets (and 7 out
of 15 assets) that results in the highest Sharpe ratio for the market portfolio.

Unconstrained optimization: minimum-variance frontier constructed with the best sub-set of
seven asset classes selected from eleven UK asset classes (UK Equity, UK Preferred, UK Debt)
and the frontier constructed with the best seven assets selected from nineteen UK and Foreign
asset classes. The best subsets are found by selecting the sub-set of 7 out of 11 assets for the UK-
only case (and 7 out of 19 assets for the UK and Foreign case) that results in the highest Sharpe
ratio for the market portfolio. There are 50,388 possible ways of selecting 7 different asset
classes from 19.
