                                         ABSTRACT


       This paper discusses the recent research on the consumption function
that has attempted to relax the assumption of certainty equivalence. While
there remain many open questions, both theoretical and empirical, it is
clear that the assumption of certainty equivalence can be misleading.
Under more plausible specifcacions of preferences toward risk, uncertainty
levers the level of consumption, increases the expected rate of growth of
consumption, and increases the response of consumption to news about
Income. Moraover changes in the amount of uncertainty are a potentially
leportant source of fluctuations in consumption.

     Twenty years ago, it was standard practice in describing macroeconomic behavior to

build theoretical models assuming all current and future variables were known with

certainty. When models were applied to the data,   the only concession to the presence   of

uncertainty was more often than not the introduction of an unexplained error term in

the regression.

     Ten years ago, under injunctions to 'ftake uncertainty seriously", macroeconomista

started introducing uncertainty explicitly at the model building stage. Much

theoretical and empirical progress has been made, most of it under assumptions yielding

certainty equivalence, or the property that optimal behavior depended only on

expectations of other variables, and not on their higher moments.

     Certainty equivalence yields convenient characterizations of behavior. Assumptions

yielding certainty equivalence, namely that constraints are linear and objective

functions quadratic, are however quite stringent and, in moat contexts, highly

implausible. Recent research has attempted to go beyond certainty equivalence, and to

characterize behavior under more appealing assumptions It is a difficult endeavor,

both theoretically and empirically. In most cases, closed form solutions are

unavailable and one only gets glimpses into the nature of the solution. In most cases

also, the decision rule depends on higher moments of the exogenous variables, about

which little hard evidence is available, making empirical implementation perilous.

Nevertheless, much has been learned; in this paper, we present recent developments on

the consumption front.1



1. Consumption under certainty ec'uivalence

     Consider the decision problem of a consumer who maximizes at time t:


       T- t
     E [X                                                                          (1)
           U(C÷.)IIl
       t=.O


                                              1
subject to

     At++i
                —
                    At+   +    Y+ - C÷; A         given;     A11
                                                                   — 0.

For simplicity, we assume that both the interest rate and the discount rate are equal

to zero.
           At is wealth,        Y labor      income. The only source      of uncertainty is labor   income,

which is random.

     If utility      is quadratic, the set of first order conditions is:


                     —
     E(C+ilIt)            C,   for   i   I       T-t                                                (2)



and the solution to the maximization problem has the familiar form:



           —   (l/(T-t+lfl(     A +ZE[Y         I      ]).                                          (3)


     Consumption is a linear function of initial wealth and the present value of

expected future income. Higher momenta of income do not matter. The marginal propensity

to consume out of total wealth is equal to the inverse of remaining number of years.

     The assumption of quadratic utility is crucial to dertve the "certainty

equivalence" consumption function (3) in the presence ci uncertain labor income. Yet,

quadratic utility is an unappealing way of describing consumera' behavior towards riak.

It implies increasing absolute risk              aversion,       a willingness to pay more to avoid a
                                                                         that this is a
given bet as wealth increases. Introspection and casual evidence suggest

poor description of behavior under uncertainty.

     Simple utility functions with more plausible properties towards risk are

available, of course. Two            such    functions are the exponential and the isoelastic utility

functions. Yet, in the presence of risky labor income, neither yields certainty

                                                                                  to
equivalence. Indeed, they imply systematic effects of uncertainty on consumption,

which we now turn,




                                                             2
2.   The slope and variance of consumption

       If we return to the set of first order conditions of the maximization problem

above, this time without restrictions on utility beyond risk aversion, U' '<0, we get

                      —           for       — 1 to   T-l.
       E[U'(C+JlIJ        U'(C)         i                                                                 (4)

      Uncertainty affects the first order conditions, and thus optimal consumption, only

if it affects expected marginal utility. If the third derivative of the utility

function U''' is positive, as is true of most plausible utility functions, an increase

in uncertainty raises expected marginal utility. Thus to maintain equality in (4),

expected future consumption must increase compared to current consumption. Uncertainty

leads consumers to defer consumption, to be more prudent. The role of the condition

U' ''>0 in generating more prudent behavior in the face of uncertainty was first derived

by Leland (1968) and further analyred by Sandmo              (1970)    and Dreze and Modigliani (1972).

        How strong is the effect of uncertainty on the slope of the consumption path

likely to be?    Kimball (1987) has shown that,            in the same way as the Arrow-Pratt

coefficients of risk aversion help study the effects of uncertainty on expected

utility, coefficients of absolute and relative prudence help study the effects of

uncertainty on expected marginal utility and thus on consumption. In parallel to the

Arrow-Pratt coefficients, the coefficient of absolute prudence is defined as -U'' '/U'

and the coefficient of relative prudence as -U' '            'C/U''.     Constant absolute prudence

implies that the increase in consumption required to keep the same level of expected

marginal utility in the face of a small increase in risk is independent of the initial

level of consumption, and a parallel interpretation applies to the coefficient of

relative prudence.

       In general, there need not be any tight relation between the coefficients of risk

aversion and the coefficients of prudence.               Conveniently     -   -   and perhaps   misleadingly-       -


however, the exponential utility function, U(C)                -(l/-y)    exp(-yC),      exhibits both

constant absolute risk aversion,    -y,     and constant absolute prudence, also equal to                       .
                                                     3
Similarly, the isoelastic utility function U(C)    (l/(l-e))c            exhibits both constant

relative risk aversion,     and constant relative prudence,   (e-+-l).   Thus, under those two

specifications, specifying the degtee of risk aversion also pins down the degree of

prudence.

     Equipped with those definitions, we can take a second order approximation of (4)

around            Rearranging gives:
         U(c).2

                          1/2 a   EI(C+.G)2II]                                            (5)

or, dividing both aides by   c:
                            = 1/2   r E[((CtC)/C)2lI3                                     (6)

where a and r are the coefficients of absolute and relative prudence. Equation (5)

gives a relation between the slope of the consumption path and the variance of the

change in consumption (around zero). Equation (6) gives a relation between the expected

growth rate and its variance.

     While they still only give a relation between two endogenous variables, those two

equations show the basic effects of uncertainty on consumption. Uncertainty, by

increasing the variance of consumption, leads to a more steeply sloped consumption

path. The effect is stronger the larger the coefficient of absolute or relative

prudence. And, as increases in uncertainty do not affect the budget constraint, any

increase the slope of the consumption path implies a decrease in the initial level of

consumption.



3. Uncertainty and the consumption function

     To go beyond equations (5) and (6) requires solving for consumption as a function

of the income process. This is in general difficult.

     The case of exponential utility, of constant absolute prudence, has proven

analytically tractable (Kimball and Mankiw 1987, caballero 1987).          Yet what makes it

tractable however also makes it somewhat unattractive. To aee why, we consider a simple

                                            4                                         -
example, which follows Caballero. Suppose that utility is exponential with exponent             --y,


and that    labor   income follows     a random walk with normally distributed innovations with

standard deviation a. It is easy to verify that optimal consumption satisfies:


                    — C +     a2/2.
       E[C1II)                                                                            (7)

Using the budget constraint, one can show that the level of         C   is given by:

             (l/(T-t+lflA +           - (i(T-t)/4)a2.
       C                                                                                  (8)

       The slope of the expected consumption path, rather than being equal to zero as

under certainty equivalence, is positive and constant;         it depends both on the degree of

absolute prudence,      'y,   and the variance of income changes. This in turn implies that the

consumption function is the same as under certainty equivalence, except for a negative

term which depends on the degree of uncertainty, the degree of prudence, and the

horizon.

       We can use (7) and (8) to get a feel for magnitudes. If we evaluate the expected

rate of growth of consumption at a point where consumption and labor income are roughly

equal, equation (7) implies:


       (E[Ct1II)C)/C                                                                      (9)
                                 (7Ct)(afi2/2.

Using panel data, Hall and Hishkin (1982) found that the standard deviation of the

change in permanent income was about $1200; as median household income was about

$12,000 during the period (1972), this finding suggests a value of a/I of about .1. The

term        is equal to the coefficient of relative risk aversion. If we assume this
       -C
coefficient to be equal to 4, then equation (9) implies an expected growth rate of

consumption of 2 percent.         This number is roughly the same as the growth in aggregate

consumption per capita.         Since the cross-sectional age-consumption profile is upward

sloping, the growth in individual consumption must be at least 2 percent?

       Cumulated over many years, such a tilt in the consumption path implies

substantially lower consumption at the beginning of life, and thus much higher avetage

                                                    5
wealth. Indeed   and thia reveals the unattractive aspect of the assumption of constant

absolute prudence, equation (8) can easily generate negative initial consumption as a

result of uncertainty. Negative consumption is not ruled out by the exponential

utility.

     When we turn to more attractive utility function which do rule out negative

consumption, such as isoelastic utility,   obtaining closed form solutions becomes

generally impossible. But, from some analytical results (Kimball 1987), and from

simulations (Zeldes 1984, Baraky, Mankiw, and Zeldes 1986), we know the consumption

function has the following property.   Under decreasing absolute prudence, the convenient

dichotomy between the effects of expected income and the effects of uncertainty which

is exhibited in (8) disappears.

     On the one hand, the impact of uncertainty on consumption depends on the level of

wealth. At higher levels of wealth,    a larger portion of lifetime income is certain     --


under our assumption of a   constant interest rate -- and the   variance    of the percentage

change in consumption decreases. This in turn implies a flatter consumption path.

Zeldes shows for example that under isoelastic utility, the consumption path is

initially very steep and flattens as wealth accumulates. This effect is very much in

accordance with empirical evidence. Kotlikoff and Summers (1981, Figure 1) for example

show that the annual rate of change of consumption for the cohort born in 1910 was over

3 percent from age 18 to age 50, but was 1 percent thereafter.

     On the other hand,   the marginal propensity to consume depends       on the amount of

uncertainty. An increase in income decreases the need for precautionary savings,

leading to a larger response in consumption than would be the case under certainty

equivalence. As a result, conaumptinn can show what appears as excess aensitivfty to

income movements (Zeldes 1984).
4. Changes in uncertainty and movements in consuztp.tI.tn

      If uncertainty is an important determinant of the level of consumption, changes in

uncertainty can potentially he an important aource of fluctuations in consumption.
                                                                      the typically
Measuring changes in individual income uncertainty is difficult given

short time aeries on individuals in panel data.

      A useful starting point is to look at changes   in aggregate income uncertainty. To

do   so, we computed the standard deviation of n-period ahead forecasts       of ON? by   DRI,


probably a good proxy for the relevant measure of subjective uncertainty. Each month,

in addition to ita main forecast,   DRl issues a set of two or three alternative

forecasts for the next three years. Each forecast is given a probability by DRI. When

we computed DRI's subjective uncertainty, three results stood    out,   (1)   At each date,

the subjective standard deviation increases roughly as rhe square root of the forecast

horizon, indicating that the uncertainty about the future level of output increases

with the horizon.    (2) The subjective standard deviation, three years ahead,      fluctuates

substantially: it varies between 1.14 percent in 1978, and 2.70 percent in 1981. (3)

The level of aggregate uncertainty is small relative to the standard deviation of

income uncertainty facing individuals, roughly 17 percent over three years (based on

Hall and Mishkin).

      This last fact suggests that if all consumers share fluctuations equally,

movements in aggregate uncertainty are unlikely to have a large impact on aggregate

consumption. But if fluctuations fall more hesvily on some individuals, the aggregate

effect can be much larger. If we assume for example that all consumers follow equsrion
                                                                                                 it
(8), mnd that only e fraction m of the consumers is subject to the aggregate shocks,

is easy to show that the effect on aggregate consumption is proportional to I/a. The

more concentrated the effect of aggregate fluctustions, the stronger the impact of

uncertainty on aggregate consumption.

      This impact of changing uncertainty underlies the papers by Bsrsky, Msnkiw,          and
Zeldes and by Kimball and Mankiw, Bath emphasize the deviations ftom Ricardian

equivalence caused by the intetaction between ptecautionary saving and idiosynchratic

income risk.     If taxes vaty with income, incteases in taxes have, in addition to their

direct effect on expected after-tax income, an insurance effect which works in the

opposite direction. Barsky, Mankiw, and Zeldes use simulations to show, assuming

isoelastic utility,    that debt finance--a decrease in taxes today financed by higher

proportional taxes later- -can have a significant impact on consumption. They conclude

that,    for plausible parameter values, the marginal propensity to consume out of a tax

cut is approximately half the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth. Kimball and
Mankiw derive analytic results for the case of exponential utility. They show that, if

individual income is serially correlated, the initial effect of deficit finance on
consumption is    stronger, the larger the anticipated length of time to the eventual tax

increase. The reason is a simple one: the longer the deferral,   the more uncertain
individual income and the higher the insurance effect of future taxes.



5. Conclusion

        While macroeconomists have long understood the behavior of consumers under

certainty equivalence, the behavior of consumers with plausible utility functions

facing uncertain future income has remained largely a mystery.    Recent research has

begun to reveal some the properties of optimal consumer behavior under uncertainty.

Perhaps most important, this research has taught us that,   in many ways,   the assumption

of certainty equivalence can be highly misleading.
