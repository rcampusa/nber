                        Wage Flexibility and Openness



                                   Abstract



     This paper analyzes the degree of short—run, real wage flexibility in a

two—sector economy under floating rates. This is done by deriving optimal

wage indexation in a contracting framework. We find that the more closed the

economy, the lower the degree of wage indexation. As a result, output will

fluctuate less around its desired level in a more closed economy. These

findings further imply that a given unexpected monetary shock will cause a

smaller output shock in a more open economy, whereas a given real shock will

induce a smaller output shock in a more closed economy.

I. Introduction

     Recent experience with flexible exchange rates suggests the existence of

cross—country differences in the flexibility of real wages and in adjustment

pattern to various shocks. For example, changes in the exchange rate appear

to affect the price level in Europe, whereas they affect the level of exports

and imports in the United States. The apparent sensitivity of wages to prices

and exchange rates has led various authors to consider how wage indexation is

related to the underlying economic structure.' Their findings suggest that

different degrees of wage indexation generate different degrees of short—run

real wage rigidity, which in turn implies different adjustment patterns to a

given shock. Thus, understanding the determinants of optimal wage indexation

might explain the existence of cross—country differences in adjustment

patterns.

     The purpose of this paper is to focus attention on the role of openness

in explaining the degree of short—run real wage rigidity. The analysis

investigates how optimal wage Indexation is affected by the degree to which

domestic output is exposed to the prices of internationally traded goods. A

useful analytical simplification is to consider the case of a two—sector

economy in which we dichotomize between traded and non—traded goods. In such

a model, the country is taken as small in the traded sector (i.e. it is a

price taker for traded goods) and large in the non—traded sector. Thus, there

is one relative price determined endogenously——that of traded to non—traded

goods. For a given relative price, the exchange rate sets the price level. A

larger share of traded goods implies a larger exposure to international

prices, diminishing the economic relevance of the endogenous determination of

the relative price of traded to non—traded goods. This paper investigates how

the endogenous determination of the above relative price affects wage

indexation. This is done by applying the wage indexation approach formulated

by Gray [19761. This approach was used by Flood and Marion [19821 in the

context of a one sector open economy, and the present paper extends their

contribution to the case of a two—sector economy.

      Section 2 describes the model. Section 3 derives the optimal wage

indexation and conducts the comparative statics. Section 4 summarizes the

findings, and provides concluding remarks. The Appendix summarizes the

notation used in the paper.



2. The Model

      Let us take a two—sector economy, producing traded and non—traded goods,

under floating rates and perfect capital mobility. Consumers are assumed to

have Identical hoinothetic tastes, generating a price index given by



                              0                 0
(1)        Pt =                   n •               z



where       and           are money prices of traded and non—traded goods at time t,

and 0 and         are the share of non—traded and traded goods. Real output, 1,

is given by:



(2)        Y = (N     •   P             + Z •
                                          t
                                                P         )/P
                                                                t.
            t     t           n,t                   z,t



where N and Z represent the output of non—traded and traded goods. The demand

for non—traded goods is given by



                                   •      • exp(c       —

 (4)
                           (E    I÷i — Pt)/P



 where Et is the conditional expectation operator which corresponds to the use

 of information available at period t. A higher real interest rate discourages

 current consumption, and c is the interest rate semi—elasticity of demand for

 non—traded goods. Throughout the paper it is assumed that the information set

at time t contains the structure of the model and all variables dated t and

earlier.

        The demand for money balances is given by:



(5)                    Pt • exp(—          k.i).



        The country operates under a floating rate regime, and the law of one

price is assumed to hold for traded goods:



(6)          P         = S       •
                 z,t         t       z,t



where St is the exchange rate at time t (domestic money price of one unit of

foreign exchange) and                  is the international price of traded goods. Under

conditions of perfect capital mobility, and the absence of risk aversion, an

arbitrage condition links the domestic and foreign interest rates:



(7)         i —        i    =
                                     S1     —

These authors consider the case of an economy where nominal wage contracts are

negotiated in period t—1, before current prices

expected labor demand to expected labor supply.       But actual employment in

period t is demand—determined, and depends on the realized real wage. These
                                              which may be set according to some
models also allow for partial indexation,

optimizing criteria. For a recent application of the contracting approach in

an open economy see Flood and Marion (1982) and Marston (1982).

        Suppose that the labor supply is given by


                      w
 (8)         L =


where W is money wage. Labor is the only mobile factor, and output is given

 by2

(9)
               =           (L)n • exp v
where L denotes the labor employed in sector x (x = n, z) in period t, and

      is a multiplicative productivity shock. To close the model, let us specify
v
the stochastic structure. Money and foreign prices are given by




(10)         Mt=Ms expm

                   =
(11)                   exp p


        To simplify exposition, let us neglect trends in the variables, assuming

that m, v, i, p are uncorrelated random variables, generated by white noise

processes:


                       2                *   *
(12)         x — N(0, a) for x = m, v, I , p


        As a reference point, let us start with the •non—stochastic equilibrium,'

i.e., the equilibrium in the economy if the value of all the random variables

is zero (m = v = 1 = p = 0). Suppose that prices in such an equilibrium

are given by           =    = S = 1. Let us denote by lower—case variables the

percentage deviation of the upper—case variable from its value in the non—

stochastic equilibrium, i.e., for a variable X, x = (X — X0)/X0 where X0 is

the value of X if all random shocks are zero. To simplify notation, we delete

the time index. Thus (xt, xt÷k) are replaced by (x, x+k). To facilitate

discussion, it is useful to take a log—linear approximation of the model

around    its non—stochastic equilibrium,          writing the model in terms of

percentage
              deviations. This is equivalent to the use of a first order

                                                 —5—
approximation of a Taylor expansion around the equilibrium.3

          From eq. 9 we get that output is given by



                n =            - w) + h.v
(13)                   h(p

          In   a fully flexible economy, w corresponds to the wage that clears the

labor tnarket,i.e., w =                      —   W)/W   where         is the flexible equilibrium

          *
    v = p =     i*    = m =    0.   Under the labor contract, the wage contract for period

t    is   pre—set at time t—1 at its expected money wage level in a fully flexible

regime. Thus, the wage contract is Eti                           .   Under a partial indexation,

actual wage is allowed to adjust in proportion to the cost of living increase:



(15)             log W = log Er_i                + bEP —   pup

or, in terms          of   our shorter notation




(15')           w =    b'p          =



where w is the unexpected wage adjustment, and p is the unexpected infla-

tion. The case of b = 1 corresponds to full indexation, whereas b = 0                        is


where there is no indexation. In the first case we get short—run real wage

rigidity, whereas in the second we get short—run nominal wage rigidity. In



                                                        —6—
general, we expect 0 K b < 1, providing limited flexibility in the contract

scheme. Deriving the optimal degree of wage indexation is the topic of

Section 3. Combining eq. 13—14 and 15'. We get:



(16)        y =   h(l—b)p    ÷ h•v.




       Notice that h(1—b) in eq. 16 corresponds to the Phillips curve slope. A

lower degree of wage indexation enhances the output effects of unexpected

price changes.

       Equilibrium in the non—traded sector implies that:



(17)        n =
                  —a(p
                         —   p)   + y —   c(i   + p)




       Equilibrium in the money market is given by:




(18)       my—k1;                     i=js
       Notice that an unexpected price level rise (p > o) induces an expecta-

tion that prices will fall next period by p, implying that the real interest

rate is i ÷ p .      Eq. 17 and 18 provides the short—run equilibrium conditions

which imply that:



                         — c(i*
(19)        p —   p=              + p*)/(On• c + a + O• h).



       A rise in the foreign interest rate, or a transitory foreign price

increase leads to a higher real interest rate, which reduces current demand

for both goods. The market for non—traded goods clears continuously, thus the



                                                 —7--
relative price of non—traded goods should drop. A larger substitutability of

the two goods in consumption (a) or production (h) reduces the needed

adjustment of relative prices.



3. Optimal Indexation and Openness

       To be able to drive some normative aspects of indexation, it is useful to

consider as a benchmark the real output attained in a fully flexible

economy. Let us denote by x the value of x in a fully flexible economy.

Following Gray we adapt the loss function4:



             L =   E(y   —   y)


       Where E0 stands for the unconditional expectation operator. The loss

function indicates that we wish to choose the wage indexation scheme so as to

minimize deviations from output's fully flexible level (i).

       In   a flexible economy, the labor market clearing condition implies that



(21)



22)
             -
             y =   h•v — h
                             -h   v.




       From eq. 22 and 16 we get that



(23)         L =   ()2 E((w-p)         -   ( - ))2   =
                                                         ()2E0((1-b) p +   v)2.


       Optimal indexation is chosen so as to make the real wage in a contracting

economy "closest" to real wage in a flexible economy. Its value, derived from



                                                —8—
eq. 23, is given by:



(24)         b       =1   —                   where


                                          V                   2V.
                                                                1* +V
                  = (S+h) [h2 +                 + k2(1 —



where            =   c + (a        + 0    .
                                              h)/0     and V denotes the variance of x.



    is the only term that involves the degree of openness. Notice that


                 *             *               *
I,) \        ab               3b
                     > 0,              > 0,   — > 0.
                                   z



        Openness can be measured either by the share of traded goods (0) or by

the substitutability in consumption (a) and production (h) of traded and non—

traded goods. An increase in openness, as measured by any of the above

parameters will increase optimal wage indexation. Thus, we expect a lower

degree of real wage flexibility in a more open economy. Notice also that the

degree of wage indexation decreases with the ratio of productivity variance to

the variance of the other shocks.

        The above results can be interpreted in the following way: There are two

type of shocks with opposing effects on indexation——productivity shocks and

all the other shocks. We would like to increase wages when there is a

positive productivity shock (see eq. 21). When such a shock occurs, it is

associated with a lower price level which accommodates the increase in the

demand for money. In such a case we would like to have a low degree of wage

indexation. We would like to index fully for all the other shocks. Thus,

there are opposing forces at work in setting the desired degree of indexation,



                                                        —9—
which is chosen in such a way as to balance those forces. Any increase in

V /V , V /V.         or V v/V   increases the relative importance of productivity
 V m    V
shocks, enhancing the case for a lower degree of price indexation.

       To understand the role of openness, notice that the real interest rate

 (1 —   it) is   given by



(26)        1* + O(P —           +   *   (j*   + p*) (1 —



       Any increase in either i or p will increase the real interest rate,
causing a drop in demand for both goods. Because the market for non—traded

goods should clear all the time, the implication is that the relative price of

non—traded goods should drop (p —         p < 0) to clear excess supply in non—
traded goods. This adjustment also cushions the initial shock, because it

reduces the real interest rate by O(p —               p).   The force of this cushion

effect is related to the degree of openness. The more closed the economy, the

more significant the above effect.6 This adjustment reduces the economic
                                                              *    *
importance of shocks to foreign prices or the interest rate (1  , p  ), which

in turn increases the relative importance of productivity shocks, thereby

reducing optimal indexation.

       By substituting b* in the loss function, we can verify that




                 z               ah


In a more open economy, higher wage indexation increases real wage rigidity

and deviations in output from its target level. This is consistent with the

notion that endogenous relative price adjustment has stabilizing effects on

output.

                                h(l—b) +   k+l

       Because reduced openness implies lower wage indexation, we can deduce

from eq. 28—29 that closeness dampens the exchange rate and price level

response to monetary, productivity and foreign interest rate shocks.

       Finally, it is of interest to analyze how openness affects output

adjustment to various unexpected shocks. For an unexpected monetary shock (m)

we find that



                      =      h(1—b)        .m
(30)        y —   y
                          h(1—b) + k+1


       Because in a more open economy we get higher wage indexation (b), a

monetary shock will cause higher output deviation from the target level in a

more closed economy. On the other hand, for an unexpected productivity

increase (v). We get



                      —   1+k — (1—b) (1-i-s)            h      —
                                                               • h
(31)                  —
                          1+k — (1—b) (1—h)
                                                  •
                                                        h-hS
                                                                     •    v


       Thus, a productivity shock will cause a smaller output deviation from the

target in a more closed economy. In this sense, the more closed the economy,

the more productivity shocks are cushioned and monetary shocks magnified.

4. Summary and Concluding Remarks

    This paper has analyzed the degree of short—run real wage rigidity for a

two—sector economy under floating rates by deriving optimal wage indexation in

a contracting framework. It has shown that the more closed the economy, the

lower the degree of optimal wage indexation. This occurs because endogenous

adjustment of relative prices mitigates the effects of exogenous real interest

rate shocks. As a result, output will fluctuate less around its desired level

in a more closed economy. In this sense, closeness in the economy increases

the flexibiltiy of its adjustment to various shocKs.7 The extra flexibility

is reflected also in a lower short—run real wage rigidity. This implies also

that a given unexpected monetary shock will cause a smaller output shock in a

more open economy, whereas a given real shock will induce smaller output shock

in a more closed economy.

     The above results should not be interpreted as suggesting that there are

benefits to be derived from policies that reduce openness. Cross—country

differences in openness might be the result of differences in absolute size,

transportation costs to other markets and other exogenously given para-

meters. The welfare effects of endogenous policies that affect openness, like

commercial policies, should be treated explicitly in any framework that wishes

to derive "optimal" openness. This analysis suggests a new dimension in

differentiating a tariff from a quota. For a small country, under certainty,

each tariff rate is equivalent to a certain quota. In the case of uncertainty

and a frictional labor market, a country might prefer a quota to a certainty

equivalent tariff. This is because the imposition of an import quota (in

contrast with the imposition of an import tariff) may be viewed as

transforming a traded good whose relative price is determined in world markets

into a non—traded good whose relative price is determined in the domestic



                                     —12—
market. Consequently, the imposition of a quota instead of a tariff allows a

small country to benefit from the stabilizing effects of endogenous price

adjustments.

1.   See Gray (1976), Flood and Marion (1982) and Marston (1982).

2.   To make the model manageable it is assumed that in the short run,
     output/labor elasticities are equal for both sectors. Allowing for
     different elasticities have no systematic effect on the results.

3.   It is assumed that the variances of the shocks are small enough to make
     such approximations useful.

4.   This is also the loss function applied by Flood and Marion [19821.

5.   This is because we expect the relative price to adjust upward in the next
     period. The role of relative price adjustment for the determination of
     real interest rate has been studied in different contexts by Bruno (1976)
     and Dornbusch (1983).

6.   More closed economy implies d    <   0, resulting with a lower real

     interest   rate response to i + p    (see eq. 26).
7.   The effects of openness on the balance of payments adjustment in a
     managed float model has been studied by Frenkel and Aizenman [19821.
