             The Relative Productivity Hypothesis of Industrialization:

                             The American Case, 1820 to 1850



                                        ABSTRACT



      The American Northeast industrialized
 1850, while the South remained             rapidly from about 1820 to
 Northeast was substantially    agricultural.  Industrialization in the
                             powered during these decades by female and
 child labor, who comprised about 45
 1832. Wherever manufacturing spread of  the manufacturing work force in
                                      in the Northeast, the wages of females
 and children relative to those of adult men increased
 in the agricultural sector which                      greatly from levels
                                  were previously quite low.
      Our hypothesis of early industrialization is that such development
 proceeds first in areas whose
                               agriculture, for various reasons, puts
 a low value on females and children
 the                                 relative to adult men. The lower
     "relative productivity" of females
 agricultural or traditional economy theand   children in the pre—industrial
                                           earlier will manufacturing evolve,
 the Proportionately greater will the relative wages   for females and
 children increase, and   the relatively more manufactured goods will
 economy produce.                                                       the

      A two—sector model which
                                incorporates a difference in "relative
 productivity" between two economies is used
                                              to develop seven propositions
 relating to the process of early industrialization
                                                       Data from two early
 censuses of manufactures, 1832 and 1850, and other sources provide
evidence for our hypothesis,
                              demonstrating, for example, the low relative
productivity of females and children in the
and the increase in relative                  Northeast agricultural sector,
                              wages for these laborers with industrialization.
We conclude that factors with low
were instrumental in the initial relative productivity in agriculture
                                  adoption of the factory system and of
industrialization in general in the U.S., and we believe these results
are applicable to contemporary
                                phenomena in developing countries.

 1.0    Introduction: The Role of Females and Children in Industrial Development
         There are diverse and complex reasons why certain countries have
                                                                          industrial-
 ized   early in their histories and why within countries there has been regional

 variation in industrial development. One contributing factor to the early

 industrial history of the U.S., which appears to have more universal signi-

 ficance, is the productivity of females and of children relative to that of

men within the agricultural sector. The contributions of this factor, which

we term "relative productivity," to the evolution of the factory system and to

regional variation in industrial development have been
                                                          substantially underrated,

although they were clearly recognized by those living at the time.     Our study
focuses on the influence of the single factor "relative productivity," on

the nature and the location of early industrial development in the U.S.

We will show that the labor forces of early manufacturing firms in the U.S.

were comprised largely of females and children, that wages of females and

children relative to adult men rose with industrialization, and that industrial

development seemed to flourish in areas which previously had low relative

productivities of females and children in the agricultural sector.

       In countries having high birth rates, a significant proportion of the total

population will be between ten and twenty-five years (35% in the case of the U.S.

in 1820), and the young will comprise an even larger fraction of the potential
                                      —2—



labor   force. The efficient employment of the young and of women outside their

child-bearing years can make a substantial difference in the standard of living

of the entire populace.      It is thus not surprising that the Industrial Revolu-

tion both in the U.S. and in Great Britain was, at least initially, powered by

these laborers.

      Prior to industrialization the relative productivity within the agri-

cultural sector of the young and of females was low in the hay, wheat, and

dairy regions of the North. But relative productivity was substantially higher

in the cotton, sugar, rice, and tobacco regions of the South, where slavery

had long been established and industrial development lagged behind that of the

Northeast   and differed in form. The ratio of manufacturing and mining output
to that   in agriculture in the non-South was almost nine times that in the           South
in   1860; the ratio of manufacturing and mining output to all commodity output

in the non-South was about five times that in the South.

        During the pre-industrial period, females and children in the Northeast

were typically perceived and described as "redundant" laborers. The introduction

of machinery and    the   factory system radically changed this view. By 1832 about

45% of the industrial work force in the American Northeast was young and female,

although this percentage peaked not soon thereafter. Furthermore a remarkably

high percentage of all young New England women were employed in manufacturing,

even though the factory system was still in its infancy. As the manufacturing

sector expanded, wages for females and the young relative to those for adult males

rose rapidly. But as the century progressed various changes, including the large

Irish immigration, served to increase the supply of unskilled workers and             to   slow

the increase in this wage      relative.
        The period from 1820   to 1850 is   generally viewed as encompassing    the

Industrial Revolution in the U.S. Although         in 1850   the   U.S. population was still
                                          -3-

  primarily   agricultural, the percentage of the labor force in that sector had
  decreased   substantially in the three decades preceding, from 79% in 1820 to

  55% by 1850, and in the North, the primary area of industrial development,

  this percentage decreased even more dramatically, from 75% to 30% over this

 period. Significant changes occurred within industries regarding the nature of

 work and mechanization particularly in
                                            cotton textiles. But many other industries,

  (e.g. iron, glass, paper, shoes), which witnessed far less technical change and

 mechanization, also saw increased scale of firm and division of labor during the

 first half of the nineteenth century.

      Our findings encompass many aspects of early industrial development, but

 central to this more involved tale is
                                          a critical finding about the determinants
 of the location and nature of
                                 industrialization. Within a land rich country
 where, for various reasons, the relative
                                            price of unskilled male labor is high, the
 factory system will locate where it can utilize those individuals least productive

 in agriculture, and it will in general locate where their relative productivity

 is the lowest. This "relative
                                 productivity" hypothesis is the focal point of our
study.

     This hypothesis has important precedents, both in the "surplus labor theory"

of W.A. Lewis (1958) and in the labor-saving technical change literature

stimulated by H.J. Habakkuk's (1962) monograph. 2     But our framework differs
from their's in fundamental
                              ways. We distinguish among laborers in their pro-
ductivity within the agricultural and traditional sectors at full employment.

Our focus is on relative productivity
                                         within the class of laborers, and not on

"cheap" or "dear" labor relative to capital and land.    Our study also differs
from past industry studies (e.g. Ware 1931) by utilizing the manuscripts of

various censuses of manufactures. (See Note at end for descriptive material

on these sources.) We therefore do not focus on a single industry and have a
                                       -4-

 large and diverse enough sample to test hypotheses about the process of early

 industrialization that have previously been unexplored.

       Section 2.0 presents a simple two good (A and M), two factor (Lm and Lf) model

 in which two economies (N and S) differ only as regards the technology used to

produce the A good, thus incorporating a difference in "relative productivity.'t

Such a difference in "relative productivity" between sectors and between coun-

tries is only one of many possible factors determining the degree and nature of

 industrialization. But because we strive to isolate the implications of this one

factor, the construction of our model is sparse, and we have standardized the

two economies in a particular way. In Section 3.1 we justify our assumption

of low initial relative productivity of females and of children in the North with

data from its pre-industrial period. Section 3.2 presents evidence on the effect

 of industrial development on relative wages, labor force participation rates, and

the nature of the manufacturing production process. We summarize our findings

 in Section 4.0 by reviewing the historical evidence we present on the seven

propositions developed in Section 2.0


2.0 A Two-Sector Model of Early Industrialization in America

       Consider two economies (N and 5) facing the same relative output prices

(P    m"a'    and having two inputs of given amounts, male labor (1T) and female

 and child labor (Lf), which are not able to migrate between the economies.

The inherent differences between these two factors may be the result of physical

 strength, dexterity, job experience, maturity, skill, or cultural factors.

 In the pre-industrial economy there is only an agricultural good (A), which is

 relatively male labor intensive in comparison to the as yet unavailable or

unprofitable manufacturing technology (M). Our notion of "relative productivity"

 is   incorporated by assuming that the N economy has an agricultural technology
                                           —5-

     which is more L intensive, at any set of factor prices, than is the agricultural

 technology in the S economy. Each economy has a unique A good technology which

 cannot    be transferred to the other.
         The pre-industrial economies are illustrated in the Lerner-Pearce diagram
 of Figure 1. The isoquants AN and AS represent equal quantities and thus equal

 values of the agricultural good, assumed to be the same in the two economies and

 to be produced with homogeneous of degree one production functions differing

 in factor intensity. Ray OR gives the global factor intensity of the two

 economies, and the intersection at point r on ray OR of the two agricultural

 isoquants implies that the two pre-industria]. economies
                                                                 produce identical
 amounts of the A good at full employment. This
                                                        standardization assumption ensures
 that any difference between the two economies in the industrialization process

 does not arise from an inherent inefficiency of
                                                        one in the production of the A
good.

        The factor price ratio in the pre-industrial N economy, at full employment,

is    given by (Wf/W)
                      N
                       ,
                              .   .                       .
                          and it will be lower than that given by        S
                                                                            for
                                                                  (Wf/W)
the pre-industrial S economy. This difference in relative input prices at full

employment in the pre—industrial economies is precisely what we mean by relative

productivity." It is even possible that                 N
                                               (Wf/W)       will be lower than some


                                                  (w'7), which
reservation wage ratio, say the dashed line                         would imply that the
supply of Lf schedule would have a flat portion of amount (Lf*Lf) at the

reservation wage.

        What happens when a manufacturing sector (M) is available to these traditional

economies? We have assumed that the M sector is, compared to both the N and the

S agricultural sectors, Lf intensive, at all factor prices.
                                                                       Isoquant M0
in   Figure 1 represents a value of M equal at the output price ratio p0 to that

of the A output given by isoquants AN     or   AS. But p0 is insufficient to induce

     either economy to industrialize
                                            Consider a small increase in p, say to
     p1 >   p0, or alternatively, a small change in the manufacturing
                                                                               technology,
     sufficient to yield
                               as the manufacturing isoquant, again with the same
     value of output as those given in the A sector. An increase
                                                                           in p, or a
    Hicks-neutral technical
                                  change in M, shifts isoquant M toward
                                                                            the origin,
    that is it is equivalent
                                  to renumbering the M isoquants.

            These exogenous changes are now sufficient for the N
                                                                        economy to produce the
    M good, but insufficient for the S economy. Thus
                                                                as p increases or as technology
    advances, the N economy industrializes
                                                   first. The new equilibrium for the N
    economy in Figure 1 will be a factor price ratio of (wf/w)N1
                                                                               pro-
    duct ion of         and   ,   and factor intensities given
                                                                           ,



                                                               by Dc in agriculture
    and Ob in manufacturing.
                                  Equilibrium in the S economy will involve the previous
 factor price ratio (wf/w)S0 >
                                        (wf/w)N1.     Therefore during this initial phase,
 when only the N
                       economy industrializes, the factor price ratio in the N
 economy rises, but does not exceed that in the S economy. Indeed,
                                                                    the two
 economies will have the same
                              input price ratio only at the point of speciali-
 zation in M.

        Now consider another

the M isoquant has been shifted to the origin

further increase in p or to further
                                           neutral technical change. These changes
are   now just sufficient to induce the
                                             S economy to produce the manufactured
good. The new equilibrium for the
                                          N economy involves a factor price ratio
of (wf/w)N2, production of AN         and , and      factor intensities of Od in agri-
culture and Oe in
                 manufacturing. The factor price ratio in the S economy
rises to (wf/w)SJ >

price ratio is greater than that for

ratio of (M/A) than the S economy. The factor intensities in the S economy

are Of and 0g. bounded by those in the N economy.

       The following seven propositions summarize our characterization of the

pre--industrial economies and of the general equilibrium impact either of an

increase in the relative price of manufactured goods (o) or of a neutral

technical change inducing the same effect:
                                    •         N          S
       (1) Prior to industrialization (Wf/W) < (WifW)

     (2) As the relative price of manufactured goods rises or as technical change
advances, the N economy industrializes first;

     (3) After the introduction of the M sector in the N economy only, (wf/wm)N
increases but is less than (wf/w)S. After the introduction of the M sector
in both economies (wf/w)N increases further and increases proportionately more
than does (wf/w)S;
     (4) Factor intensities in the S economy are more alike between the two
sectors than are those in the N economy;
       (5) The M sector is relatively Lf intensive, and therefore relatively
more Lf than Lm migrates to it;
       (6) The N economy produces absolutely more   M than does the S economy and
also   produces a higher ratio of (M/A).
 If the ccmplication of a Teservation wage is added: —                           than
       (7)   Before the introduction of the M sector, (Lf/Lm)   is higher in S
in N, but the labor force participation rate of Lf increases in the N economy
with the introduction of the M sector.

       Some further remarks should be made regarding propositions (3) and (6).

These propositions accurately represent the responses in the two economies

when we consider the exogenous shock to have been a small increase in the

relative price of manufactured goods or a small change in technical efficiency

 of M production. If, however, we consider a global change, such as the intro-

 duction of a new technology, further qualifications would be needed. But since

 initial industrial development implies a small change around the point of

 specialization in agriculture, we believe these propositions to be valid

 characterizations of early industrialization

      There are two sets of implications from
                                                our analysis. One concerns dif-
 ferences between two economies that embrace a new sector, and one concerns

 the impact of industrial development within an economy. We focus primarily

 on the latter with respect to the North, but also use our analysis to explore

 the relative absence of industrialization in the South.5 The two-sector model

 summarizes the essential outlines of industrialization
                                                          during the Early Republic.
Industrial development in the U.S. at the turn of the nineteenth century was

fostered by production techniques that utilized new forms of capital equipment

and that employed a greater division of labor and the factory system of

production. The proximate cause of industrialization, though, was the increase

in the relative price of manufactured goods with the cessation of trade during

the Napoleonic Wars and the maintenance of a high relative price with

the imposition of a tariff on manufactured goods. But it was only in the hay,

wheat, and dairy regions of the American Northeast, where the wages of females

and boys relative to those for adult men were initially low, that this industrial

development flourished.

3.0 Relative Wages and the Unskilled Labor Market in Early Industrialization

        3.1 Pre-Industrial Relative Productivities and Employment

       Both relative wages and labor force participation rates for females and

children were low in the pre-industrial Northeast, in apparent contrast to

the general "scarcity of hands" and "dearness of labor" that characterized

the late eighteenth century adult male labor market. As the above quotations

indicate, Hamilton, like many of his contemporaries, looked toward this

under and unemployed segment of the economy to provide industrial labor power.

Both   the low initial relative productivities of females and children and their
related low labor force participation rates were to have profoundly influenced
the    nature of industrial development in the U.S.

        Measures of relative productivity in agriculture during the pre-industrial

Early Republic exist in only fragmentary form, and our understanding of the

sources of such differences is somewhat limited. Our quantitative knowledge

about relative wages in agriculture and in the traditional sector is given

in Table 1, which presents data on the agricultural sectors of the North and

the South at a time when industrial development was very limited and, in the

North, during the period of increasing industrialization. The data from 1808

to 1815 for Massachusetts indicate the very low relative productivity of women

and children (generally defined as less than sixteen years old) in the agri-

cultural sector. Evidence for 1832 pertaining to areas somewhat removed from

industrial development shows the same pattern.

        Several difficulties have arisen in constructing these ratios for the

pre-industrial economies. As industrialization spread, wage ratios in the

agricultural sector rose, and care was taken to ensure that the wage ratios

in agriculture reflected the pre-industrial relative productivities. The com-

putation of all in-kind payments for male laborers working on monthly or yearly

Notes:

(la)     1808, 1811: Carroll Wright, Sixteenth Annual Report of the Commissioner
         of Labor of Massachusetts, (1885). This retrospective of wages and
         prices does not indicate whether or not board is included, but the
         absolute level of wages indicates that it must have been. In 1808 boys
         were given is/day = 16.74:/day and men 5s 0.8d   84.44: per day or about
         $21.70 per month. Adams has found that men were paid $16.50 inclusive
         of board in 1808 in the Brandywine, (Donald Adams, "Workers on the
         Brandywine: The Response to Early Industrialization" Regional Economic
         History Working Paper, 1980, p. 22, Table 5). The figure given for
         female domestics in the Wright report does not appear to include a value
         for board, and one of $1/week has been assumed. 1815: Wright gives 504:/week
         for females with boaitland 86.84:/day for males without board. A six day
         week is assumed, as is $1.00/week board for females. Males with
         board received 564: per day.

(ib) The figure for children is for board only and that excluding a value
      for board is zero. McLane Report (1832)   respondents in New York
      counties almost unanimously stated that children in the agricultural
      sector earned only their board, if that. Typical of their statements
      are the following from the McLane Report, Vol. II ". . . children's
      wages are not worth any thing, but to make cotton goods," (p. 38), and
      "Children, under 16, cannot obtain wages; their board and washing is
      generally considered of about as much value as their labor " (P. 77).

      Butler County Ohio. Female help: wages per week; male labor; daily wages
      times 6. Means of ranges given used. The lower ratio uses the harvest wage.

(2a) Read off Figures 19 and 22 in R.W. Fogel and S.L. Engerman, Time on
      the Cross (1976), Vol. I.   For comparability with the florthern figures,
      only females between 15 and 29 years old have been considered and only
      earnings from field production have been used. The earnings have been
      weighted by the age distribution of females working in the Hamilton
      Mills. Dublin (1979) gives this distribution as: 39% between 15 and 19
      years and 61% between 20 and 29 years. The smaller number uses the
      peak male net hire as the denominator and the larger number uses a
      weighted average of male net hires, 15 years and older where the weights
      are the proportion in each group (Historical Statistics, 1976, p. 17).
      Boys are between 10 and 15 years old for the smaller estimate of (Wb/W );
      boys are defined as 15 year olds for the larger estimate for comparabihty
      with the (2b) series.

 contracts was another problem. Because male laborers on long-term contracts

 frequently received lodging in addition to board, we have constructed esti-

 mates only where we could get daily hires. Finally, some of the most persuasive

 evidence we have gathered on the relative cheapness of female wages in the

 traditional sector was of a qualitative nature and could not be included in

 Table 1.

      Numerous accounts of the early nineteenth century indicate that weekly

 wages for female domestics rose during the first third of the nineteenth

 century (Ware 1931, p. 241) .    Such accounts also indicate that male wages in

 agriculture did not increase over these years, and therefore that relative

wages for females within the agricultural sector rose with increasing industrial-

 ization. Henry Carey (1835), in his comparative study of wages across industrial

nations, noted that in the U.S. case "agricultural labour has not varied

materially ...   in   its money price [from 1793 to 1833] ...   the   wages of men

having been very steadily about nine dollars per month [with board, but]

the wages of ...   females have greatly advanced being nearly double what they

were forty years since (p. 26) ."    Considerable strength is added to our
quantitative evidence on relative wages in agriculture by the commentary of.

those who lived through the period and those who have studied it intensively.

     In sharp contrast to the low relative productivity of females and children

in northern agriculture are the data for the cotton and tobacco growing regions

of the South, where wage ratios were approximately double. There are several

factors that could account for this difference, among them that women in the

North rarely worked in the fields and that the wage rates used for the North

are those of domestics.6 Why females in the North did not work in the fields

or even in dairying tasks is an issue of great complexity, but one which may

be related to our explanation of differences in the agricultural production
                                       -14-


function. Differences in the relative productivity of boys between the

North and the South probably arose from the physical strength required and

the costly supervision needed in the farming chores of the Northeast. Cotton

and tobacco agriculture tended to conserve both on supervision costs and

strength for a number of reasons. Females and children were relatively more

productive in crops requiring extensive cultivation such as cotton and

tobacco, and cotton, in particular, favored the small in harvesting operations.

Furthermore cotton picking allowed a piece rate system of self-supervision

and was not only unaffected by incomplete harvesting, but also required

harvesting over a long period as the boils matured.7

     Because high relative wages for females in the South persisted into the

post-bellum period (see line (2b) Table 1) and exist in cotton regions today

(see line (3)), it does not appear that slavery was the dominant cause

of the ante-belium wage ratio differences. Indeed slavery may have been a

comparatively more profitable labor system in areas whose dominant crops

favored the utilization of the female and younger portions of the labor

force, whose leisure, education, and home production were valued far less

than in a free labor system.8

     Not only were the relative productivities of females and children low

in the Northeast, but their employment also appears to have been below that

considered, in the pre-industrial period, "full." While there are no formal

estimates of pre-industrial labor force participation rates, Hamilton spoke

of manufacturing affording "the employment of persons who would otherwise be

idle (p. 19)," the typical McLane Report respondent referred to the employment

of "females who had little else to do (Vol. I, p. 819)," and the view that

"mill labor was ...   largely   composed of women and children who were otherwise
                                     —15-



 unemployed (Ware 1931, p. 226)" has been accepted by most scholars of the

 Early Republic.

      Regional variation in the process of industrialization has been attributed

 to many factors. Among them the most widely debated for the American case

 have been: capital market imperfections, political and cultural differences,

 and the relative efficiency of slaves in cotton and tobacco production. We

have added another possible reason for the superiority of the North in the

 initial transition. When industrialization first took root in the North, it

was fueled by abundant and relatively cheap female and child labor. The

South may have had a large pool of unskilled labor, but it has no group

whose relative productivity was low within the region.

     The two-sector model has indicated that during the initial phase of in-

dustrialization, female labor would migrate to the industrial sector in a

greater proportion than would male labor. In the North this is precisely

what happened during the 1820 to 1850 period. The daughters of northern farm

families left home to work in factories for relatively brief periods of time.

This use of labor having a low product in agriculture encouraged the industrial-

ization of the Northeast. The impact of manufacturing and the factory system

on relative wage rates and employment of females and children is the topic

we next address.

3.2 The Impact of Industrialization on Relative Wages and on the Unskilled
    Labor Market, 1820 to 1850

     It has long been recognized that women and children played an important

role in the early industrialization of both the U.S. and Great Britain, but

the actual extent of their employment has not been fully appreciated.      Al-

though we have no information on the pre-industrial labor force participation

rates of females, the data that we have amassed, sketchy as they are, highlight

a spectacular change in the labor markets of the Northeast during the period

of early industrialization.

     Over the two decades from about 1810 to 1832, the percentage of young

women (between the ages of 10 and 29) engaged in factory work increased from

near zero to somewhere between 10% and 30%, depending on the location in the
             10                                                   .
Northeast.        In Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the states which industrial-

ized most rapidly and for which we have the most reliable data, about 19% to

27% of all females 10 to 29 years old were reported in manufacturing employ-

ment in 1832. This figure increased in Massachusetts to about 40% by 1837,

if one also includes employment in the home production of palm leaf hats and

other items. Using the same procedures for 1850 results in figures ranging

from 27% to 33% for these states. Thus, at an early date in the nineteenth

century the states of New England were employing a substantial fraction of

their unmarried women in factory work. Because other occupations existed

for young women, e.g. teaching, domestic service, these figures provide a

lower bound to the actual labor force participation rates of this group and

attest to the tightness of this early labor market.

    Another statistic that indicates the importance of non-adult male labor

in the process of industrialization is the percentage of the industrial labor

force composed of women and children. As we pointed out in the introduction,
                                        -17-



  this figure was higher during the early period of industrialization than it

  was after. For the states of the Northeast, about 45% of the industrial

  labor force was comprised of nonadult
                                           males in 1832, but by 1850 this figure
                                   11
 had been reduced to about 33-s.
                                        A decomposition of the sources of the
 relative decline in female workers for Massachusetts over the period 1837

 to 1850 indicates that the sectoral shift
                                               by industry in the total labor force
 was more important than was the decline of the employment of women within

 particular industries.

      The high percentage of the industrial labor force composed of females

 and children during the initial period of industrialization indicates the

 extent to which individual firms substituted
                                                  relatively cheap female and

 young labor for relatively expensive male labor. Traditional historical sources

 on early industrialization have pointed to the existence of different tech-

nologies within a wide range of industries,
                                                 giving entrepreneurs a broad menu
of factor proportions from which to choose. Although the substitution of

unskilled labor and capital for skilled artisans is well known in the case

of cotton textiles, the substitution of females and of children for adult

males was also achieved in boots and shoes
                                               (Hazard 1921), wool (Cole 1926),
glass (Davis 1949), and paper among other industries. The percentage of a

firm's labor force that was composed of females and of children rose sub-

stantially from the small size class of one to five workers, to the intermediate

class from six to fifteen workers. Thus, it was the change from the

artisanal shop to the small factory that was behind the early utilization

of women and children. While some of this substitution involved large

amounts of capital, much involved merely an expanded division of labor, in

the absence of the employment of a new and more capital intensive technology. 12

    The substantial utilization of females and of the young within manu-

facturing and the large percentage of these groups in the population employed

Sources and Notes:

1832a: The estimate of the female to adult male (Wf/Wm)             and boy to adult male
(Wb/Wm) wage ratios are derived from a set of wage regressions estimated over
a sample of 853 manufacturing firms from the McLane Report (1832); See Table 3.
Because these wage ratios vary somewhat across industries, we have given the
ranges in brackets. The average ratios given are the midpoints of the reported
ranges in the case of (wf/wm), and the average of the wage ratios estimated for
the various manufacturing industries in the case of (wb/Wm)

1832b: These ratios utilize the 1832a femal.e and boy wage figures, but are
divided by 1832 wage rates for common laborers. The New England estimates is
Lebergott's (1964, p. 541), adjusted for a value of $1.50/week board.   Lebergott'S
                                                                   too high and
estimate for the 1832 Middle Atlantic common laborer wage appears

were paid higher wages than were the employees of most manufacturing industries,

   by industry suggest that relative
                                       wage ratios may have been radically altered
   by industrialization    We therefore turn to a discussion of how early in—

   dustrialization affected relative
                                       wages, which were initially quite low in
   these regions. Our estimates
                                   of relative wage ratios in manufacturing are
   given in Table 2, where we
                                summarize findings from our more comprehensive
  study of early industrialization
                                     (Goldin and Sokoloff, 1981).
       Albert Gallatin, twice
                                Secretary of the Treasury, noted in 1831 that
  "female labor employed in
                            manufactures appears from the rate of their wages
  to be more productive than
                             if applied to the ordinary occupation of women."3

  Our principal finding confirms this Supposition; wherever
                                                                manufacturing and
  the factory system evolved, the relative wages of females
                                                            and of boys rose.
  The wage data underlying Table 2 have been derived
                                                     primarily from a set of
 wage regressions on firm-level data, of
                                              which that for 1832 is given in
 Table 3. Two wage ratio
                           estimates are presented in Table 2 for each year:
  figure 'a' uses our estimate of
                                  male wages in manufacturing and figure 'b'
  uses estimates of a more uniform
                                   worker's wage, that of a 'common laborer.'
 Estimate 'b', which we prefer, is constructed to standardize
                                                               male workers,
 because industrialization
                           may have widened the wage distribution for adult
 men (Willianson and Lindert,
                              1980) although the majority of men were not
 industrial workers.

over a sample of firms from the Census of
                                          Manufactures for 1850; see Goldin and

                                                           range. The 1850
census did not require manufacturers to
                                        distinguish between adult males and
boys, and thus we are unable to
                                  compute (wb/w). Because of this aggregation
of adult males with boys,
                          we have used wage rates for males only in industries
which employed few boys.

for the male wage.

 The usual assumption of homogeneous labor is a more accurate description of

 the female and child labor force than of adult males.

      Compared to the relative wages in Table 1 those for females in Table 2

 are about 50% greater and indicate an increase in this ratio of about 1.6%

 per annum from 1815 to 1840.14   The relative wage of females in manufacturing

 increased even more later in the nineteenth century, reaching a long term level

 of about 0.58 by 1880, where with only one decline (the early l930's) and

 one large increase (World War II period) it has remained.15 Therefore, in

 the brief period of early industrialization the relative wage of females

 increased at a remarkable rate, achieving a value that was 83% of its long

run figure, as opposed to that of the traditional sector which was only 52%

of it.

     The estimates of (wf/w) in Table 2 may even understate the impact of

industrialization on relative productivities, because they are not fully

adjusted for changes in the composition of the female labor force.     Girls,
that is females below the age of sixteen years, compris1from 20 percent to

25 percent of the total female workforce in manufacturing in 1832, and their

wages were about 60 percent of a full-grown female worker's. But
                                                                     young
girls were rarely hired in the agricultural and traditional seétors since

their absolute wages barely covered their board, and the use of young workers

was reduced considerably in the later periods of manufacturing. The bias

from including girl wages in the 1832 female average is on the order of 10

percent, and thus our best estimate of an adult female wage divided by an

adult male wage increases to about o.so.16

     What accounted for the rise in relative wages in advancing industrialization?

We suggest in Section 2.0 that the explanation could be found in the implications

of a simple two-sector model. The division of labor and adoption of certain
                                        -22-


machinery in the industrial sector enabled both greater substitution of females

(unskilled) for males in manufacturing and relatively greater female (unskilled)

labor intensity. It might also be claimed, particularly during this early

period, that factory labor had to be compensated for harsher conditions, longer

hours, and more days per year than in the agricultural sectors. Although

there may be some truth to this statement, our findings indicate that females

and children were compensated, percentage-wise, to a greater degree than were

adult males, and thus there would still be an unexplained asymmetry.

      Vthile the regressions for 1832 in Table 3 do indicate that female wages

rose with the size of the firm, male wages rose as well and in approximately
                         17              .     .          .
the   same proportion.        The vast majority of these firms, particularly in

textiles, operated the maximum number of hours per day and about 310 days per

year, regardless of size. The increase in wages by size of firm, rather than

capturing a "satanic mill" differential, probably measures compensation for

additional living costs incurred away from home and for the costs of vacation

travel back home. Furthermore, the differential by size of firm is insufficient

to reverse the contention that relative female and child productivity rose

with increasing industrialization.18

       It should also be stressed that farm work was highly demanding, perhaps

requiring even more days per year than did manufacturing employment. Wage

ratios (Wf/Wm) in the agricultural sector closely resembled those in industry,

rising during both this period and at other times throughout the century,

as might be expected in a competitive labor market.19 The fact that relative

wages rose in the agricultural sector is prima facie evidence that the increase

in relative wages observed in manufacturing is not solely accounted for by

various types of compensatory payments to females.
                                       -23-


        Industrialization not only increased relative wages, it also served to

  increase greatly the participation of females and the young in the market

  economy, a factor of perhaps even greater
                                                importance. One would expect,
  therefore, that during the early years of industrialization relative
                                                                          wages
  might have been affected somewhat less,
                                              since labor supply would have been
  rather elastic. In terms of the
                                      two-sector model, the observed movement would
  be from (w) to (wf/w)N1,         thus understating the increase in relative
 productivity at full employment. The decrease in the price of cotton textiles

 and various other, previously
                                 home-produced goods, may have served in addition
 to lower the reservation
                            wage of females. Thus the increase in relative
                                                                                wages
 that we record for the
                          early nineteenth century is even more impressive.
      It should also be noted that wage ratios were somewhat higher in New

 England than in the Middle Atlantic in 1832
                                                 but that by 1850 a noticeable
 erosion had taken place in the
                                  wage ratio for New England, while that for the
 Middle Atlantic continued to rise,    The decline in relative wages for females
 in New England in 1850 appears to have been the result of the large Irish

 immigration to cotton mill towns and the first
                                                   major substitution of boys and
men for young women in various industries.

     We have followed through the
                                     implications of the two-sector model for the
case of the North, and have shown that both
                                                relative wages and labor force
participation rates increased for females and children. The most important

evidence with respect to our hypothesis as applied to the South is that

industrial development was rather limited in that region. We have somewhat

less to report on the form that
                                  industrial employment took in that region

during the Early Republic. Evidence for both regions from the 1850 Census

of Manufactures indicates that factor proportions between the agricultural

and industrial sectors differed more in the North than in the South,
                                                                     as
                                  -24-


predicted by the two-sector model. A precise comparison is hindered by the

fact that global factor proportions differed between the two regions. A re-

lated indicator is the size distribution of firms by industry, since a more

intricate division of labor was frequently accompanied by the use of females

and children. In 1860 average employment in boots and shoes, and cotton

textiles was considerably lower in the South than in the North, but in in-

dustries that rarely used females and children (machinery and lunther) the South

had more laborers per firm (Bateman and Weiss 1981, p. 53). Another indication

of the inherent differences in the regions is that when industrial development

did come to the South in the form of cotton textiles, the family labor system

was utilized as it had been in Great Britain. Thus females and children,

although employed by cotton textiles in the South, formed a smaller percentage

of its labor force than they had done in the North earlier in the century.

 on, for example, relative wages and factor intensities. To
                                                               unify the discussion,
 we summarize the empirical evidence bearing on each of the propositions:

       (1) In the pre—industrial North the relative factor
                                                           price (Wf/W) was quite
 low, ranging from about 0.30 to 0.35, while in the South this ratiowas consider-
 ably higher, with a mean of about 0.58;

      (2) The Northeast industrialized rapidly from 1820 to 1850, while the South
 remained agricultural;

      (3) The relative factor price
                                     (wf/w) rose with industrial development in
 the North, achieving a value of about 0.50 during the early period, but it was
 still less than that in the agricultural South;

      (4) Females and children comprised a large percentage of the northern manu-
facturing labor force, and although their employment was associated with in-
creasing mechanization in certain industries, the adoption of an intricate divi-
sion of labor expanded their employment in many others. itt is therefore important
to note that firms in the industrial sector of the South were considerably smaller
than those in the North;

     (5) Female labor migrated to industry in the North in relatively greater
numbers than did male labor, and they were able to migrate separately from men
because they were young, single women who only temporarily left their rural
families;

     (6) The value of manufacturing output in the North greatly exceeded that in
the South, and the ratio of manufacturing and
                                              mining to agricultural output for
the non-South states was 8.7 times that for the South in 1860; and

      (7) In the industrial countries of New England,
                                                      a surprisingly large
fraction of the potential female labor force was employed in manufacturing,
and such employment substantially increased the participation of females and
children in the market economy.

     One may wonder why these phenomena have gone largely unappreciated. There

are several equally worthy responses. In the first place, they have not been

entirely neglected. Various industry studies, particularly of cotton textiles,
have •hinted at some of our general results. But a paucity of data has hampered
                                 -26-

previous scholars, and none was able to recognize fully the universal nature

of the employment of females and children in the Early Republic. Furthermore,

although the first half of the nineteenth century can well be viewed as the

Industrial Revolution, various aspects of the industrial sector and of unskilled

labor markets were to change so markedly after 1850 that the initial features

we have detailed were to become relatively forgotten ones. Finally, our inter-

pretation of the changes in relative wages and employment by using a two-sector

model of industrialization weaves each of the seven propositions into a more

coherent story of economic change than has previously been suggested. In con-

clusion, factors with low relative productivity in agriculture were instrumental

in the initial adoption of the factory system and of industrialization in

general in the U.S., and we believe these results are applicable to contem-

porary phenomena in developing countries.

 2Habakkuk (1962) hothesjzed that land abundance in the U.S.
                                                             provided the
 critical difference between its industrial development and that of England.

 Simple two-sector, three input models (e.g. Clarke and Summers, 1980) suggest

 that the Habakkuk thesis
                            may be incorrect, since if the demand elasticity for
 agricultural goods is less than one, an increase in land will, under most reason-

able assumptions, decrease the capital to labor ratio in manufacturing. We

differ with both the original Habakkuk
                                          argument and the revision for two reasons:
 (1) other factors such as land ownership and
                                                differential land fertility could

account for intercountry differences in factor returns to farming, and (2) it

is our contention that the employment of women and children in the U.S. was

responsible for some of the observed differences in
                                                      machinery. Habakkuk re-
cognized the importance of female and child labor in his discussion of the nature

of capital (see p. 65 in particular), but this part of his analysis was ignored

in the debate that followed.

3The assumption concerning migration between the two economies is
                                                                  a reasonable
one in the case of the U.S. because of slavery.

4The difference between the A and M sectors in
                                               Lf intensity may be due to a
third factor, capital. Although capital may now be complementary to skilled labor

it appears that capital was a substitute for skilled labor and human strength

in the nineteenth century. This substitution was delayed in agriculture for
various reasons, but when technology did alter agricultural work, it was hoped

that it would raise the relative productivity of boys. Bidwell and Falconer

(1925) note in their post-1840 section that "one of the great benefits anticipated

from the introduction of agricultural machinery was the more complete utilization

of boy labor, for it was thought that the work which formerly required strong men

could then be done by means of machinery and boys (p. 275)."

5Our focus on relative productivity and therefore our standardization of the

two economies direct attention from other possible differences between the two

regions that could also account for their differential development. We ignore

differences in the accumulation of capital and factors which would give the South

an absolute advantage in agricultural production over the North.



6Bidwell and Falconer (1925) summarize their extensive reading of travellers'

reports with the statement that: "In New England only men as a rule were to

be seen in the fields, the women of the family assisting only occasionally

in harvest time (p. 116)." Harriet Martineau, reviewing her wide ranging

travels through the U.S. during 1834 to 1835, states: "The German women

are the only women seen in the fields and gardens in America, except a very

few Dutch, and the slaves in the South" (Vol. 1, p. 299) and "It is not the

custom in America for women (except slaves) to work out of doors" (Vol. II,

p. 54), Society in America (New York, 1837). It is curious that New England

women did not engage in much dairy work, as was the custom in the other dairy

regions in America. On this issue see Bidwell and Falconer (1925), p. 163.

7Metzer's (1975) study of ante-helium southern plantations indicates that

slave children began picking cotton at age five and that "the number of days

in which slaves were engaged in picking declined with age, and females picked

for more days per season than males in each age group (p. 135)." Even though
  males (over age 16) had an absolute advantage over females in cotton picking,

  females had a comparative advantage and
                                               therefore picked a greater percentage
  of the mandays allocated to that task.

  81t should also be noted that because northern women and children
                                                                    may have had
  reservation wages above the full employment" equilibrium (see model in section

  2.0), observed wage relatives are overstated for the N economy in comparison

  to that for S, where all slave labor was employed.


  9Lebergott's (1964, pp. 125-129) perceptive discussion,whjch stresses the

  importance   of female labor and changes in female wage rates in early cotton
 textile factories,is an exception.

 '°These   figures have been computed by dividing total female manufacturing

 employment by the female population 10 to 29 years old. The 10 to 29 year

 old group is used because female workers were almost always unmarried. The

 1832 data are from the McLane Report (1832), the 1837 figures are from the

 1837   Statistics    of Industry in Massachusetts, and all other data are from

 the relevant U.S. Census of Manufactures. Additional information about the

 data can be found in Goldin and Sokoloff (1981).

Where two figures have been given, the larger one includes women in home workshop
production.
11
     The 1832 figure for the Northeast adjusts the McLane Report (1832)

data for the under-enumeration of small firms, given industry mix, but

does not adjust for the possible bias toward industries with large firms.

There was no separate enumeration of boys from all males in 1850. Data

for Massachusetts from its industrial censuses indicate the decline in the

percentage of females occurred after 1837. The data for female and

child workers as a percentage of all workers in manufacturing for the states

of the Northeast are as follows:

                          Females         Boys        Females and Boys

      1832   Northeast     38.2             8.6             46.8
      1850   Northeast     28.3
      1860   Northeast     26.1
      1870   Northeast     2l.1(adults                      27.1
                                 only)



12
     The percentage of a firm's labor force that was female rose from 1.9% (3.7%)

for 1 to 5 workers, to 12.8% (11.9%) for 6 to 15, to 20.2% (32.6%) for > 16 in

1820 (1850, Northeast). The role of a greater division of labor in determining

these percentages is made most forcefully by Davis (1949) in the case of the

glass industry, with regard to boy labor:

             "When window glass was first manufactured in the U.S., it was
             customary not only for the blower to gather his own glass but also to
             blow, cut, and flatten it. In 1820 [larger firms]. . . frequently
             had assistants or apprentices who relieved the blowers of certain
             of the more minor and unskilled steps of the process. In time,
             the division of labor was greatly elaborated. . . (p. 48)"

State Papers and Speeches on the Tariff (1892), p. 129.

14This growth rate uses an estimate of 0.30 for (wf/wffl) in 1815 and one of 0.45

for 1840.
 15Wages in manufacturing are for full-time workers. The 0.58 figure is an

 average of those for 1900 to 1929 and 1955 to 1960. The late nineteenth
                                                                                    century
 data are from Long's reworking of the Aldrich Report, (C. Long, The Labor Force

 Under Changing Income arid Employment, Princeton, 1958). Those for the twentieth

 century splice figures from A. Beney, Wages, Hours, and Employment in the U.S.

 1914-1936, National Industrial Conference Board(l936),Current
                                                                       Population Surveys,
 Series P-60 (1945 to l960),and Lebergott (1964).


 16From Table 2
                    (Wf/W)    0.45, where Wf -
                                                 aWf   ÷ (l-a)wf, and Wf = the wage
 for female children,     Wf = the wage for adult females, and a the percentage of
 all female laborers who are girls. We estimate from the McLane Report that

from 20 percent to 25 percent of all female workers were girls (i.e., a =           0.20
to 0.25) and from the Rhode Island returns of the McLane Report that

                0.60.   Therefore, when Wf = $2.50 per week, and W =
 (Wf /wf )                                                               $5.56,
     c=   $2.72 per week (with a =
Wf                                   0.20) or Wf       $2.78 per week (with a =   0.25).
Thus (wf/w)         0.50 .     the issue of theaages of females working in the

agricultural sector, McLane Report respondents frequently used the age category

sixteen to twenty-four in describing female domestics          (e.g. Vol. II, p. 46),
and generally stated that younger children could barely earn their board.

(See also Notes to Table 1).


17The use of size class dummies indicates that it was primarily the
                                                                    very large
firms ( >100 workers) which had higher female wages, although female
                                                                     wages
did begin to rise with firms having 25 or more workers.
 18
      The implicit argument we are making is that the very large firms whose labor

 forces were overwhelmingly housed in "dormitories" had to pay a premium to all

 workers as compensation for the real costs of moving and for additional board.

 Firms locating in more rural counties, therefore, would have to attract workers

 from further distances and would have higher wages as a result. The Table 3

 female regression, though, appears to indicate that the county urbanization rate

 was unimportant, but this results from the inclusion of indtry dummies and

 the total labor force.          The equation omitting these factors is:

             log (wf) = 4.466 + 0.075 New England dummy - 0.137 log (urbanization rate)
                        (83.6)     (1.44)                         (—5.68)

                                            R2 =   0.83;
                                                     393; "t" statistics in
                                                           N
                                                               parentheses
 Thus there is collinearity between large firms (mainly in textiles) and low

 rates of urbanization (water power sites). It should also be mentioned that

 regressions similar to those in Table 3 for 1850 (see Goldin and Sokoloff, 1981)

 indicate that size of firm was not a determinant of earnings. Migration and

 immigration during the 1840's therefore eliminated the premium we measure

 for 1832.

19D. Adams, "Workers on the Brandywine: The Response to Early Industrial-

ization," (1980) finds nearly identical ratios of (w 1w )
                                                               fm for   agriculture and

manufacturing in the Brandywine area of Delaware, which industrialized quite early

in the nineteenth century. Data on agricultural wages on a rural Ohio farm

(Holmes 1912, p. 16) indicate that the rate of increase of (wf/wm; with board)

from 1836-40 to 1885-91 was about 1.26% average annually. More extensive data

from the early twentieth century show that relative wages in agriculture were

approximately equal to those in manufacturing, e.g. in 1906 (Wf/Wm) = 0.565 in

the North Atlantic states, for hiring by the day, without board (Holmes 1912,

p. 41 and p. 68).

A Note on Our Sources:

   We have relied extensively on two sources: the Documents Relative to the
Statistics of Manufactures in the U.S., known as the 1832 McLane Report, and
the 1850 schedules of the Federal Census of Manufactures, sampled for the
Northeast by Fred •Bateman and Tom Weiss. There was no census of manufactures
in 1830, and the 1832 document contains the answers to an extensive set of
questions circulated to manufacturing firms by the Secretary of the Treasury,
Louis McLane. Various problems exist in using each of these data sets. Most
important among our concerns is that the 1832 data under-represent small firms,
and the information on workers and their wages differs in coverage and defini-
tion from census to census. The McLane Report generally listed adult males
separately from boys less than 17 years old, with females of all ages grouped
together. Wages were typically given as a daily average for each group of
laborers, although coverage and detail varied considerably by state. The 1850
labor force and wage data were given for males of all ages and for females of
all ages separately, with no separate category for children.
