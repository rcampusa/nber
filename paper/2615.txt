        Production and Trade in Services by U.S. Multinational Firms


                                   ABSTRACT


     Direct investment in foreign countries by U.S. goods industries repre-

sents a response to differences in labor costs to   amuch   greater extent than

the more rapidly growing investment by service industries. The latter seem to

be less able to allocate different types of production to different areas of

the world, probably because services are less tradable than goods they must

more often be produced where they are consumed or consumed where they are pro-

duced. Therefore, while direct investment abroad in goods industries represents

an allocation of production that increases the demand for high-skill labor and

for R & D input in the U.S. and decreases the demand for low-skill labor,

direct investment in service industries, while it increases a firm's share of

foreign markets, is likely to have little effect on the firm's demand for labor

in the U.S. or on the composition of its labor force.

                                    Introduction

   Several trends in the U.S. ec-nosy have raised the question of whether

the comparative advantage of the United States has shifted towards service

industries and whether the exports of these industries can help to close the

apparently persistent U.S. trade deficit. One of these trends is the decline

in the competitiveness   of U.S. manufacturing, as reflected in the fall in the

share of the U.S. in world and developed-country exports of manufactured goods

and in the increasing shares of imports in U.S. consumption of manufactured

products. Another is the long—term rise in the importance of service

industries relative to goods-producing   industries, as measured, for example,

by GNP originating, and particularly by employment. One reflection of the

belief in U.S. comparative advantage in service industries is the strong

effort the U.S. has been making to reduce barriers to what is referred to as

trade in services.

             The International Role of Service Industry Multinationals

  pts   and Affiliate Production of Services as Alternatives

    To understand the nature of the international market For services, some

clarifications of its scope may be in order. To begin with, the analogy bet-

ween trade in services, as measured in the balance of payments, and the sore

familiar trade in merchandise, is a very tenuous one    Merchandise trade

involves the passage of goods across international borders, no matter who the

buyers or sellers are. A shipment of goods From the    US   to a Foreign country

is a U.S. export even if the good has been produced by a foreign company

operating in the U.S. and even if it is bought by a U.S     company operating

abroad, A shipment of goods from a foreign country into the U.S. is a U.S.

import even if the good has been produced by a U.S. company abroad and even if

it is purchased by a foreign company operating in the U.S. In contrast, there

is little passage of services across these borders. By some definitions of

services, there is almost none; indeed, services are defined by the fact that

production and consumption take place simultaneously   (see,   for example, Hill,

1987). Service transactions in the balance of payments, unlike goods transsc-

tions, are largely defined'by the residence of the transactors; in most cases

either the producers have moved to the point of consumption or the consumers

have moved to the location of production, but the transaction itself takes

place within one country.   There are some exceptions, in which a service, such

as telecommunications, re—insurance, or some banking activities, is produced

in one country and simultaneously consumed in another country, but these are

not a large part of service production or trade    Both the intangibility of

the services and the fact that the seller often has no information about the

nationality or residence of the buyers, mean that the measurement of many 5cr-
                                    —3—
vice transactions is extremely difficult and the data poor.

   An additional difference between the two sectors is that while goods

exports are generally the product of a country's goods-producing industries,

many service exports, as reported in the balance of payments, have little to

do with domestic service produc'ng industries.   It seems appropriate, there-

fore, to relate merchandise exports to the domestic output of goods-producing

industries but of more limited significance to relate service exports to the

domestic output of service industries.

   The lack of association between 'service exports," in the balance of

payments sense, and U.S. service industries, is illustrated by the content

of U.S. service exports in 1984. Of $131 billion in officially reported

exports of services in that year, $86 billion, or two thirds, consisted of

receipts of income on U.S.   assets abroad (Krueger, 1987). This income was

from capital employed in both goods industries and service industries as well

as from loans to foreign governments and corporations.   Another $6 billion was

receipts of royalty and license fees, mostly paid by foreign manufacturing

affiHates of U.S. companies to manufacturing parents in the U.S. Aside from

government services, the other items, among wnich we might look for some rela-
tion to U.S. service industries, accounted for about $39 billion.   Of this

total, travel, which draws on the U.S. hotel and restaurant industries, among

others, in the service sector, but which is consumed entirely within the U.S.,

was almost a third, at $1U4 billion. Transportation, part of which was

wholly within the United States, accounted for $17 billion.

    There is a good deal of evidence that service exports are underestimated

in the official data. The Office of Technology Assessment has suggested a

range of $69-91 billion for non-factor services in 1984, the middle of which
                                     -4-
is about twice the official Department of Commerce figure in the U.S.

International Transactions accounts (OTA,    1986, p. 38), including travel and

transportation. The major revisions suggested by OTA are outside the travel

and transportation items, and would multiply the estimates for those service

items more than four times.   However, some of the major entries suggested by

OTA, Such as construction, franchising (mainly auto and gasoline dealers), and

licensing, were associated with U.S. companies in industries outside the ser-

vice sector,   In any case, the OTA estimates, excluding capital services,

royalty and license fees, travel, and transportation, ranged from $27 to 43

billion in 1982, or 8 to 12 per cent of the official, presumably underesti-

mated, total of goods and services exports.

    On the import side, capital services again accounted for most of the

"service" trade, $67 billion or over 60 per cent Out of $111 billion.    Of the

remainder of about $44 billion, U.S. travel "imports" consumed entirely Out-

side the U.S., were $15 billion.   The OTA estimates for service imports other

than capital services, royalties and license fees, travel, and transportation,

were about $15 to 29 billion, or about 4 to 8 per cent of goods and services

imports ((U.S. Congress, OTA, 1986, p. 38, and Krueger, 1987)

    Why then the strong current interest in services? That concern can be

understood by looking at the service-industry activities of U.S.     firms

operating overseas.   The total sales of   all U.S. affiliates outside of goods-


producing industries amounted to over $445 billion in 1982, as compared with

$359 billion in manufacturing, and almost $200 billion in petroleum and coal

mining and refining (Appendix Table A).     That figure of $445 billion undoub-

tedly exaggerates the amount of activity in these service industries for

several reasons. One is that it includes wholesale and retail trade, for which
                                    —5-.

much of the input and output is in the form of commodities.   Excluding these,

                                                                         are
although they do also involve a substantial amount of service output, we

left with over $150 billion in service industry sales, still far above the

official estimates of direct service exports. The OTA calculations show affi-

liate sales almost 50 per cent aoove direct exports, and almost three times as

great outside of royalties and license fees, travel, and transportation.

Furthermore, the recent IMF Working Party on the Statistical Discrepancy in

World Balance of Payments Accounts suggested that there was a large degree of

underreporting of foreign investment income of industrial countries (Taylor,

1987). Thus, outside the travel and transportation area, the sale of services

by U.S.   firms to buyers outside the U.S. is performed largely by

U.S.-controlled firms operating in foreign countries. In other words, it is

accomplished through direct investment rather than through trade (on this

point, see also Kravis, 1985, and Lee and Naya, 1986). Not only are direct

service exports considerably smaller tnan sales by U.S. service affiliates in

foreign countries, even by the OTA estisates, but a substantial part of the

direct eports consists of transactlons that take place entirely within the

United States. They are therefore not part of any plans for liberalizating

trade in services. That must be the case for exports of almost all education

and health services and most of travel services, $16 billion out of the OTA

estimate of $80 billion in 1984 service exports.

    Is this large overseas output of U.S.-controlled service-industry   firms a

reflection of U.S. comparative advantage in services? Since the output in

these firms is taking place outside the U.S., it would be wrong to associate

it with U.S. comparative advantage. An increase in U.S. comparative advantage

in service industries would be reflected in an increase in the movement of
                                        -6—
service—industry customers to the US., such as a rise in the number of

foreign tourists in U.S. hotels and restaurants, a rise in the number of

foreign students in U.S. universities, or a rise in the use of U.S. medical

facilities by foreigners, as well as in some increase in direct exports of

services

    Is an increase in service industry activity overseas by U.S. firms then

unrelated to U.S.   comparative   advantage? The extent of such activity reflects

the comparative advantage not of the U.S. but of U.S. firms in the service

industries. As we have pointed out elsewhere in connection with manufacturing

industries (Lipsey and Kravis, 1985 and 1987), the comparative advantage of a

country's firms can be different from, and move differently from, that of the

country itself. The comparative advantages of firms reflect assets that are

mobile across international borders but not from firm to firm even within a

country, while the comparative advantages of countries reflect assets

(endowments) that are immobile across international borders but mobile between

firms within the country. It is possible, of course, that the comparative

advantage of a country's Firms is in the same industries as the country's com-

parative advantage, because the firms have built up their knowledge and skills

from their home operations. We might expect that to be particularly likely in

service industries in which the provider of services must move to the consumer

rather than vice versa.

    In considering the causes and effects of changes in the extent to which

U.S. firms satisfy foreign demands for services, we wish to make a clear

separation between the two methods of meeting the demand, Changes in exports

translate directly into changes in the use of U.S. factors of production, such

as labor. Changes in U.S.-owned production abroad involve changes     in the use
                                      —7—
of internationally mobile U.S.-owned factors of production, such as capital

and technology. The effect on U.S. labor is more ambiguous. The most negative

effect would be displacement, if production is simply moved abroad without any

change in the level.   Lt could, instead, involve increases in the demand for

labor, if production abroad captures large market shares and requires inputs

of components or services from the U.S.

      We begin our attempt to explain the service activities of U.S. multina-

tional firms by describing the types of activities involved and their

growth over the last 35 years or so. The characteristics of the overseas

service activities are then analyzed with a view to relating them to the

characteristics generally associated with U.S. comparative advantage and

with changes in it,

The Scope of the Service Sector

      The definition of the service sector varies among authors who write about

it.   Stigler (1956) excluded transportation, communication, and public utili-

ties from the sector in his book on the service industries as did Victor Fuchs

(1968) and Simon Kuznets (1966),   the last describing the basic feature of ser-

vice industries to be that "none of the activities represents in any significant

way the production of commodities; each renders a product that is intangible

and not easily embodied in a lasting and measurable form" (p. 143).

      The broadest definition of the service sector is that it includes all the

industries not covered in the goods-producing sectors. That would include

government, transportation, communication, and public utilities, as well as

trade, finance, and personal and business services. We will use a broad defi-

nition, but excluding government services, when the data require it, but will

disaggregate the data, where possible, so as to permit comments on narrower
                                         -8-
versions of   the service sector.    We exclude holding companies, where possible,

because they are basically a conduit for U.S. investment rather than a part of

host-country service industries,      They might hold portfolio investments or, if

they control forelan companies,      those would appear under their appropriate

industry categories.      Finance operations in the Netherlands Antilles are also

simpiy conduits, in this case for their parents'              borrowing.

      The shares   of service industries in total activity of            US affiliates in
foreign countries in     1982, by various   definitions of the service Sector            and by

various measures    of activity,   all imperfect, are         shown    below. The   first of   these

definitions of     the service sector is what we will refer to in this paper as the

broad definition. It covers public utilities (including transportation and com-

munication) end construction, as well as trade, finance, and other services (see

Table   1). The second is what we will      refer    to as the narrow definition,

excluding public utilities and construction. The service sector, narrowly

defined, comprises three industry groups: trade, finance, and other services.

    Some of the measures of the size of service sector operations available

directly from the data are assets, sales, employee compensation, employment, and

the amount of direct investment.       Assets reflect only capital input and should

be adjusted for price differences. They have the even worse drawback, as com-

pared to net or gross property, plant, and equipment or depreciation, that the

assets may not be in the same location as the fureign affiliate and may not be

inputs into the affiliate's production,      They may even be in the U.S. in some

cases,     Sales in some industries include large amounts of goods imported by the

foreign affiliate and therefore exaggerate production in the affiliate,

although they are the best measure of market share.         Employment and employee

compensation reflect labor input, and employee compensation has the advantage of

combining crude labor input with a measure of human capital input or the quality

or skill    level   of labor, as will be discussed later.    Employee compensation is

omitted from the table only because the shares are very similar in these aggre-

gates to employment shares.       Direct investment reflects the parents    investment

in the foreign operations hut not the input      of Foreign labor or of investment

by others.     It has the drawbacks of the asset measure as an indicator of total


input, but these are compounded by the omission of assets financed by borrowing

from sources other than the parent company.       Its main advantage is its availabi-

lity over time and for comparison with other Countries.

    From these calculations, we find that the broadly defined service sector

accounted for two thirds of the total assets employed in foreign affiliates, but

for less than half of labor input, sales, and U.S. investment.         A large share of

the assets is in banking and much of it is provided not by U.S.         investors but

by local depositors.       Service industries outside of trade, finance, construction

and public utilities, accounted for under 6 per cent of assets, sales, and
                                       -   10   -



employment.
    Within the service sector, defined to include all except goods production,

banking was a large part, over two thirds of assets, about 20 per cent of sales,

and about 9 per cent of employment (Table 1). Wholesale and retail trade

accounted for only a bit over 10 per Cent measured by assets, but for over half

of service industry sales and employment.           The other services' share is

largest, over 20 per Cent, measured by employment, but was less than 7 per

cent of sales and 4 per cent of assets.

Trends in the Importance of the Service Sector in U.S. Direct Investment

    To follow trends over time in the importance of the service sector, we

must compromise on definitions of both scope and activity, because breakdowns

by detailed service industry of data on assets, sales, and employment were

published in less detail before 1982.      We can follow one measure of the share

of service industries in U.S. firms' operations abroad back to 1929: that is,

their share in the book value of direct investment.           The defects of this

measure were mentioned above, but it is the one for which the historical

record is most readily available.

    Two very different trends are evident: one for public utilities, including

transportation and communication, and the other for the remaining parts of the

broadly defined service sector.     U.S. direct investment in foreign public uti-

lities was concentrated in the 1920s; their share of the investment stock hit

a peak Sometime during the early 1930s and declined rapidly after that. By

1985, their Share was only 2 per cent of the total, something like one tenth

of their earlier importance.

       The share of other service industries, aside from what appears to have been

an aberration in 1943, was      little over 10 per cent of U.S. direct investment

from 1929 through the niid-1950s.      After 1957, it began to grow, doubling by

1985. it is that growth in the importance of the more narrowly defined sector,

trade, finance, and other services, that is the basis for the belief that the

importance of service industries in U.S.          investment has been increasing

rapidly.

       Of the three major components of this narrowly defined Service Sector, the

ones responsible for the Sector's growth after 1950 were trade (largely whole-

sale trade) and finance, especially the latter.           The finance part of the service

sector   grew from   3   per cent of total direct investment to over 15 per cent.

Other nonfinancial services accounted for a very small part of aggregate invest-

ment and even for a small part of investment in the service sector.

    Our rough estimates suggest that the share of the narrowly defined service

sector grew between 1974 and 1985     by    27 per cent in U.S. investment abroad and

39 per Cent in foreign inve8tment in the U.S.           Both are considerably above the

growth in the share of the service sector in U.S. nonagricultural private

employment by 17 per cent, from 54 per cent in 1974 to 63 per Cent              n     1984 (U.S.

Dept. of Commerce, 1985b, pp. 46-48 and later issues of the Survey of Current

Business).   Similarly, the 80 per cent growth of the service share in U.S.

direct investment between 1966 and 1985 was far above the growth in the domestic

employment share of almost 30 per cent. Thus, while                service shares in both

inward and outward investment were lower than in U.S.             domestic employment, they

were growing much more rapidly.

The Importance of Trade and Overseas Activity for   U.S.   Service Industry

Multinationals

     The impact on the U.S. of the activities of service industry parent com-

panies and affiliates is related to the degree to which they engage in trade

in services1 or affect trade in goods. The extent to which service output is

tradable and the extent to which the competitive advantages of service firms

can be exploited outside their home countries determine many of the other

impacts of service industry direct investment.

     Parents in service industries are, on the average, less export-oriented

than those in manufacturing (Table 2). There are exceptions, however.

Companies in wholesale trade, equipment rental, engineering and architectural

services, and construction, all make close to 10 per cent or more of their

sales to foreigners. These service industries, at least,    do not appear to be

confined to their local markets, but most service industry parents do very

little exporting.

     Service industry parents not only trade less than parents in goods

industries but also do far less of their trade with their affiliates

(Table 3). Only about 20 per cent of their exports are to affiliates, as com-

pared with about 45 per cent for goods industries. Thus, direct investment

seems to be much less important as a conduit for the exports of service

industry parents than for the exports of parents in goods industries,

     The lack of connection between investment and trade is evident on the

import side as well; imports from affiliates are less than 1 per cent of ser-

vice industry parent sales, as compared with 4 per cent in goods industries.

One reason for the unimportance of trade with affiliates in the service


   1We define exports here as sales by a parent or affiliate to a buyer in
another country. For goods industries outside of the petroleum sector, this
is close to the amount of goods physically shipped from the exporting firm.
The meaning is much more uncertain for service industries because "shipment"

industries    must be the fact that the service parents have fewer affiliates,

and have affiliates in fewer countries than parents in goods industries. Thus,

the positive relationships between investment in production abroad and exports

from the home country or by the investing firms, usually found for manufac-

turing industries, are likely to be of little importance for service

industries.

       Unlike their parents, affiliates owned by service industry parents are

quite export-oriented. More than 40 per cent of the sales of affiliates of

service industry parents were exported, while the proportion for affiliates of

parents in goods producing industries was about one third (Table 4). The

highest export propensities are in affiliates of parent firms in wholesale

trade, including petroleum trade, and in equipment rental.

       While in most cases the export propensities of affiliates reflect their

parents' industries as well as their own-—that is, the propensities are simi-

lar for affiliates classified by their parents' industries and by their own

industries-—there are exceptions. For example, affiliates in financial ser-

vices are much more export—oriented    than affiliates of financiel service

parents. Affiliates of parents in the equipment rental and public ucilicies

industries are very export—oriented, but affiliates in those industries are

not. On the other hand, affiliates whose parents are in management, con-

sulting, and public relations do relatively little exporting, while affiliates

that are themselves in that industry export more than two thirds of their




cannot be observed and it is not always clear, as has been    mentioned above,
where production has taken place. Thus, it is conceivable,    for example, that
a service "exported" by a finance affiliate to a parent in    the U.S. was
actually "produced" largely in the U.S. by assets owned by    the foreign affi-
liate.

sales,      The inference is that the consulting and management affiliates that

are so export-oriented are owned by parent firms in other industries.

         The relatively high reported export ratios for some finance sectors are

subject to some of the doubts referred to above in the discussion of assets as

a   size measure. Since much of the assets of a Finance affiliate may be located

outside the host country, exports to the U.S. b, a Caribbean     financial   affi-

liate     of a U.S.   firm may in fact originate in the U.S. and never involve any

factors of production located in the host country.

         Aside from financial services   some of the other service industries

appear in the data to be particularly host-country oriented: hotels, adver-

tisirg, health services, and other services all export less than 10 per cent

of their output. Particularly in the case of hotels, there     is good reason to

be suspicious of the reported ratios. The affiliate questionnaire asks for

"sales to persons in affiliate's country of location," a question that would

most likely put sales to many U.S tourists in the category of domestic sales

even though, since the tourists are U.S. residents, the balance of payments cri-

terion would treat the males as exports (see Whichard, 198T).

         Almost all of the exports of U.S. affiliates in goods-producing

industries are goods rather than services, and almost all the exports of affi-

liates in public utilities, finance, and other service industries are services

(Table 5). However, there are some substantial exceptions. Wholesale trade

affiliates, including those in petroleum trade, export goods almost entirely,

as does the construction industry. The wholesale trade affiliates account for

such a large share of service industry exports that the share of goods in

total exports of service industry affiliates is almost 90 per cent.

        Another characteristic of the trade of affiliates of service industry

parents   is that it is less oriented to the United States, and particularly to

the parent companies, than is the trade of affiliates of goods producing com-

panies. Their exports to parents are less than half as large, relative to

their total sales, as those of affiliates of goods producing firms, and their

imports from their parents are only a third as large (Table 5). Thus, while

affiliates of manufacturing firms often appesr to be pert of an integrated

structure of supply for the parent companies' coridwide demand, the affiliates

of service firms seem to be much more free-standing, neither supplying their

parents nor bsing supplied by thea to any great degree,

     The relatively weak trade connections between affiliates of service

parents and the U.S. and between the affiliates and their own parents are

visible also for affiliates that are themselves in service industries.     Their

exports to their parents, in particular, were only a little more than half as

large relative to affiliate sales as those of affiliates in goods industries

(Table 7). However, affiliates in some service industries were very much

oriented to exports to the U.S. and to their parents, particularly those in

non-bank(rg finance and in management, consulting, and P.R.   The strongest

trade ties with parents and with the U.S., it is clear, are between affiliates

in these two industries and parents in other industries, possibly goods

industries. Thus, the cases in which service affiliates are tied into world-

wide intracompany trade networks probably involve parent firms outside the ser-

vice industries.

    For broad industry groups, it is possible to observe differences between

affiliates in industrial countries and those in LOC5 in the extent of their

trade ties with the U.S. Those in LDC's were more closely tied to the U.S. as

a market than those in developed countries.

However, the outstanding cases of export orientation were finance affiliates

in Bermuda and the Netherlands Antilles. The former exported to both the U.S.

and other countries, while the latter dealt mainly with the U.S. These two

countries overwhelmingly dominated the data for the finance sector in LDCs

most of the LDCs had no U.S. finance affiliates at all.

        Service industry multinationals in the U.S. are not only less export—

oriented than U.S. goods producing Firms and less tied to their overseas

operations by trade, but also conduct less of their business overseas than

goods industry firms. There        are   many   criteria that    can be used   to   measure the

degree of    internationalizationof        these firms, and several of them are set out

here,    It should   be stressed that these ratios of foreign to domestic activity

are   not measures of the degree to which each industry operates overseas; firms

with no overseas     operations    are excluded.       The   ratios refer   to firms that do

operate overseas to some degree and are therefore upper bounds to the degree

of    internationalization of     their industries. The degree to which they are

higher    than   ratios for their   industries as a whole must vary from one industry

to another, but it      is   pretty certain that the bias is larger for services than

for goods    industries,     where foreign operations are more common.

        Even with   this   feature,   the data   show that   service   multinationals   outside

of banking have much smaller shares of their capital and labor inputs pro-

ducing overseas than do multinationals in goods industries: physical capital

input in affiliates of service parents is only 8 par cent of parent capital,

while in goods industries it is more than a third,                Labor input     in affiliates   of
service parents is a little under 20 per cent of that of the
                                                             parents while in

goods industries it is close to half (Table 8).              Banks, in sharp contrast to

most other service industries, hold a third of their assets through their

foreign affiliates, although their share of labor input in affiliates is close

to that of other service industries.

    The capital and labor input measures of Table 8 give partial views of the

extent to which these firms operate outside the United States, More comprehen-

sive measures, comparing sales and production inside and outside the U.S.' are

given in Table 9. The difference between the sales and production columns is in

the treatment of parent shipSents to affiliates. The sales column includes affi-

liates' imports from their parents in affiliate sales but not in
                                                                 parents' sales,
hiie     the production estimate treats all parents' sales as
                                                              parents' prcdicton

and subtracts parents' shipments to affiliates from affiliate sales to estimate

affiliate production.

        By both of these measures, parents in goods industries are more inter-
national than those in service industries. There are a few
                                                           exceptionally

international service industries, however, that are close to or even above the

level    of the goods industries, and particularly that of
                                                           manufacturing. The
most international of the service companies are those in banking and oil and

gas field services, but in advertising, engineering and architectural ser-

vices, construction, and wholesale trade, foreign affiliates' sales are at

least   a third of parents' sales. The largest differences between the sales and

production measures are in primary production and manufacturing, because

imports from parents are relatively important as a part of affiliate sales.

     The one respect in   ,ich    service industry multinationals are relatively

international is their exporting. As could be inferred from the fact that

export propensities are higher     fr   service industry affiliates than for

parents in service industries, a large part of service exports is accounted

for by the affiliates. For firms in the service industries, more exports were

made from affiliates than from their parents. That was true also for manufac-

turing, but the margin was larger for services, mainly as the result of the

large exports of finance industry affiliates. Thus, financial service

industries seem to have chosen their affiliates to serve not only host-country

markets, but other markets as well,        including the U.S. As noted earler,

however, these finance affiliates are heavily concentrated in a few Caribbean

and West Indies countries.

     While wholesale trade and financial service firms did more exporting from

abroad than from the J.S.   ,   the same   as    riot   trje For firms in most non-

financial service industries. They did most of their exporting (not verj large

in any case) from the U.S.      However, the proportion of exporting done from

abroad was generally much greater than the share of the foreign affiliates            in


inputs of labor and capital, a fact that is implicit in the higher export

propensities of affiliates relative to parents mentioned above.

              Characteristics of Multinationals           in Service Industries

    Service industries are often described as offering mainly low paid jobs to

workers of little skill, and it is usually assumed that service industries are

more labor intensive than goods producing industries.              In this section we exa—
                                     —

mine the factor intensities of U.S. multinational firms   (ME5)   in the service

industries to see whether they conform to the stereotype.    If they did, and

were characterized by low physical capital and particularly by humsn capital

intensity, it would not be likely thst these industries would be ones in which

U.S. firms would have any comparstive advantage.

itionsandConceta
    The measure of labor input we use in forming ratios of capital or other

inputs to labor is the number of employees. Annual hours of work would be

better, but work hours are available in the benchmark surveys only for produc-

tion workers in manufacturing; these workers account for not much over half of

the manufacturing employment of majority-owned foreign affiliates (U.S.     Dept. of

Commerce, lgSSa, Table II1.F 13) and less than 40 percent of all employment in

majority—owned affiliates (MOFA5) (Table 1II.F 11).   Some inkling of the dif-

ference the use of hours could make is given by the fact that among 32 detailed

manufacturing industries for which hours data are provided, the highest number

of annual hours per worker (averages across host countries) was 27 per cent

abcve the lowest (Table 1II.F 14).

    For the measures of nonhuman capital input, the published reports of the

benchmark surveys offer several varianta of assets, including total assets and

gross and net property, plant and equipment. All three measures are based on

historical coat and are converted from local currencies to U.S. dollars via

exchange ratsm, whereas purchasing power parities for capital goods would be

preferable converters, at least for fixed capital.    "Net property, plant and

equipment" (hereafter "net property"), in addition to the assets named, includes

land, mineral rights, construction in progress, and capitalized tangible and


intangible natural resource exploration and development costs.      Total assets
                                         -   22 —

include current   assets, net property, and other non-current assets including

equity in other enterprises.       In 1982, parents' net property was      34   of total

assets (Table IILK 1) and non-current investments were 22; the corresoonding

MDFA percentages were   28   and   12   (Table I1I.A 3).      Both total assets   aria   net

property are after deduction of depreciation, depletion, and like charges.                  The

published reports give gross figures only for majority-owned affiliated, while

the net property measure is available for au        affiliates, except banks, and the

total assets for all, including banks         For MOFAs in 1982, the value of gross

property was 53 percent higher than that of net property (Table           IILC2i         This

leaves room for large differences between the capital intensities of the various

industries as neasured by the gross and net concepts.            The net concept, for

which data are more available,      is theoretically   true   appropr'ate one, although

the dubious matching    o   declines 10 physical usefulness o' caputal goods and the

bookkeeping entries for depreciator is a draoack to its use.              As betweer total

assets and net propert!, the latter, epreserturg           l1y     physucal things, comes

closer to the Heckscher-Ohlin concept of capital than does total assets with its

inclusion of cash, receivables, and investments.           Toe case for   excuh' g       unsest-

ments is clear; investments in other firms or entities do not represent capta'

employed in the production carried on within the enterprise.            However, bank

accounts and other receivables may also represent capital used outsde the affi-

liate's country and do not necessarily contribute to output in the affiliate's

host country,     The difference between the total asset and net property concepts

is particularly great for financial institutions, for which fixed assets play a

small role in input.

    Our measure of human capital or skill intensity is average compensation per

worker, including fringe benefits as well as wages and salaries. This suffers

                                          23 —

from   the previously mentioned defects of employment as a measure of labor input,

and average compensation per hour would be preferable if it were available. A

further problem is that, where employees of affiliates are concerned, the corn-

pensation, paid mainly in non-dollar currencies, is converted to dollars via

exchange rates. The appropriate converter is the purchasing power of each

currency over labor of different qualities, The exchange rate method understates

the purchasing power of the currencies of low income countries, particularly

ever unskilled labor (Kravis and Lipsey, 1982; Bhagwati, 1984) and thus

understates these labor inputs. Also, the premium for education and skill in

different countries is inversely correlated with the per capita income level,

and employee compensation for different industries may, on this account also, be

influenced by the industry to industry variations in the distribution of      affi
hate employment over countries with different per capita         incomes,

      An alternative approach to human capital would be to measure labor quality

directly by characteristics of the labor force. A difficulty with this procedure

is that such quality indexes have   to be based on proxies, such as years of    edu—

cation completed or school enrollment,     the relation of which to productivity is
not   well established. Furthermore, the indexes would   apply   to a nation's labor

force as a whole rather than to the corkers employed by individual parents

and affiliates or even the aggregate of affiliates in individual countries.2

      The last type of capital input we examine is the input of technology in the

form of research and development. The measure should ideally be in the form of

the return on technological capital plus the depreciation on it or, as in the

case of physical capital, at least the stock of technological capital.

Unfortunately, we must settle for the current investment in such capital in the

form   of research and development expenditures, with the factor input ratio

proxied by R & 0 expenditures per worker.         A mitigating factor is that because P

& 0 investment is much more stable than physical capital investment, a single

years    expenditure gives a better estimate of the long-run rate of expenditure

and of the accumulated stock than would be the case for a single years data on

physical capital investment.

Factor Intensities of Service Sector Multinationals

       Contrary to the common impression, parents in the combination of sectors

we refer to as services operate with higher physical capital intensity than

those in goods production and particularly those in the manufacturing sector.

About half of the service industries are relatively        labor intensive, but there

are a few that are extremely capital intensive, such as petroleum trade and

services, real estate, equipment rental, and transportation and public utili-

ties (see Table 10).

       In general, affiliates outside petroleum-related      industries are less

physical-capital intensive than their parents.         However, because affilate

employment is heavily concentrated in labor intensive industries (Table 12 and

Appendix Table A), the difference was much larger for the service industrHes

as a group   than   for   the    individual   service     industries     (Table   11).   Within

industries, service firms            affiliates are more capital intensive than their

parents in four cases and the uneighted average of ratios of affiliate to

parent capital intensities is 82 per cent, consideraDly above the average

ratio for manufacturing.

     The fact that affiLate physical-capital intensities are closer to those of

parents in most service industries than they are in                    manufacturing     suggests that

in these ind,stries, there is less room tnan 4n manufacturing, either for


adjusting factor proportions to take advantage of ioer wages outside the

U.S. or of splitting up the production process into labor—intensive and capital-

intensive segments and moving the labor-intensvesegments to the developing

countries.

     Despite their        lo    overall physical capital per worfrer relative to service

parents, affiliates of service industry parents are, on the average, as

capital intensive as those of manufacturing parents.                     The affiliates of

petroleum-related parents are particularly capital intensive, but those of

parents in equiprnt rental, engineering, aror                  ecturl      se'-vices,    transpor-

tation, communication, and public utilities are also well above the manufac-

turing average.

Thus, it would be a mistake to view direct investment in services as being con-

fined to labor-intensive activities

    A somewhat different    pict,ire of capital   intensity, involving financial,

in addition to physical, capital, is given by total assets per employee.

With only one exception, the service industries in     which   parents have higher

                                              a1so have hgher parent total
physical capital intensity than manufacturing

assets per worker, but this version of capital intensity produces severa

additional capital intensive service sectors in finance and wholesale trade.

In fact, by this standard, more than half of the service industries were more

                                                  and as a group they were
capital intensive at home than was manufacturing,

th'ee times as capital intensive.

manufacturing affiliates.    The capital-intensive service affiliates were sostly

in the same industries as capital intensive service parents, petroleum related

services, finance, professional services, and utilities.

     A surprising feature of these capital intensities      is the high values for


affiliates in developing countries. In manufacturing, parents are more capital-

intensive than affiliates in developed countries and they, in turn, are more

capital intensive than affiliates in developing countries.3           That is the

ordering one would expect if firms responded to labor costs by adjusting the

capital intensity of production in each location, or allocated their produc-

tion processes among locations according to the capital intensities of the

processes and the prices of labor in different locations. No such allocation

can be observed for service industries.      In many of them,       it is the affi-

liates in developing countries that have the highest assets per worker, even

larger than those of their parents.

    A drawback of this measure of capital intensity, mentioned ebove pege             9)

is that financial assets attributed to an affiliate, unlike plant and equip-

ment, are fairly likely to be located outside the host country, and to

contribute little or nothing to host-country production or employment. Some

evidence for this phenomenon is provided by a comparison between value added

in affiliates and value added in the whole host-country industry, as reported

in national accounts.   Somtimes, as   is the   case   in the Bahamas and Panama,

the estimated value added in U.S. affiliates, particularly for financial sec-

tors, far exceeds the entire value added of the host country industry.           Tne

implication is that almost all the assets of these affiliates are outside the

host country.     They probaoly have little or no impact on the host country's eco-

nomy.     In other words, some of the large direct investment capital movements in

the financial sector are purely paper transactjons, shifting the nomina1

ownership of assets to developing countries, but not increasing the availability

of capital to their businesses, households, or governments.            The cost to   the
U.S. economy, if there is any, may be limited to whatever fees the host govern-

ments can extract for providing the service of registration or incorporation.

Since the service is almost costless to produce, the competition to provide it

is probably keen enough to keep the price charged quite low.

        The average skill level of employees of parent firms in service

industries is, if we judge by average compensation levels, well below that of

employees of parent firms in manufacturing.

There are, however,       a   fair   number of high-skill service sectors, including

those associated with the petroleum industry, public utilities, and construc-

tion.     Within the grouos more usually identified as services, finance other

than banking, real estate, advertising, management, consulting and public

relations, what might be thought of as white—collar service industries, all

have relatively high skill levels among parents.

     Service   industry affiliates, in contrast to their parents, are relatively

high—skill operations. Manufacturing multinationals and all goods producers in

the aggregate apparently go further in allocating their low-skill operations to

developing countries.   This is suggested by      a   comparison between manufacturing

and service industries with respect to average compensation in different

groups of countries.    In manufacturing, average compensation in developing

countries is less than half that in developed countries, and less than a third

of that in parent operations, while in service industries, average compen-

sation in developing countries is only 15 per cent below that in developed

countries, and a little more than 40 per cent below that in the United States.

In fact, in a number of service industries, such as management consulting and

engineering and architectural services, average compensation in developing

countries is even above that of the parents in the United States, and above

that of affiliates in the developed countries (Tables 10 and 13). Thus, there

is little evidence that these industries allocate their activity to take

edvsntsge of low wages in developing countries.

use a far higher   level   of skill than manufacturing affiliates. This was true

not only for the average, but for service industries in general.               Of those

service industries shown separately in Table 13, 16 out of 22 pay higher com-

pensation per employee in developing countries than do manufacturing affi-

liates. This suggests that U.S. service industry multinationals are either

sending highly skilled employees to work in deieloping countries, or are using

or training highly skilled indigenous workers.

     U.S. multinationals in service industries do,               in fact, use a higher pro-


portion of U.S. citizens in their labor forces abroad than do manufacturing

firms, but the numbers are so small relative to total employment that they

could not account for the difference in measured skill levels.

half), holding companies (12 per cent), oil and gas field services (10 per

Cent), and construction (7 per cent).

     The high skill level in service affiliates, particularly those in

developing countries, points up the major difference between direct invest-

ment in services and direct investment in manufacturing mentioned earlier.

The manufacturing operations seem to be more able to take advantage of low

labor Costs fl   developing       countries, perhaps for serving worldwide markets.

The service operations show little evidence of that incentive.
                                                 —    31   —


     A speculation        about   the   implication        for   labor   demand of   this   contrast   bet-

ween goods   industries      and service      industries         might   be that direct investment

abroad by U.S. firms in goods industries is more likely to reduce the demand

for low-skill labor at home then investment by service industries.                            The reason

is that investment in goods industries more frequently represents an alloca-

tion of the firm's worldwide production to take advantage of differences in

labor cost. Foreign affiliates in most service industries, on the other hand,

are apparently more free-standing, independent operations, much less tied to

their parent companies by trade links.                 Aside from finance affiliates in a few

countries, affiliates of a service industry parent are a way for the parent to

exploit its skills in competing in the host country market, and do not compete

with their parents for these markets. If this is the case, the likelihood of

any substitution of host country input for home-country input would seem very

small, and the likelihood of a complementary relationship also slight, except

perhaps for some managerial service, P & 0, and similar central activities.

Factor Intensities and the Provision of Services to Foreign Buyers

    We inferred earlier that the comparison between parent and ffilite

characteristics suggested that firms in goods industries were able to allocate

different parts of their production to different areas of the world, placing

labor-intensive and low—skill operations in LOC5, but that firms in service

industries were less able to do that, probably because the stages of produc-

tion could not be separated.

    In this section we explore the extent to which factors that explain the

exports of American multinationals from the US., and their production (salesl

abroad through foreign affiliates, differ between goods and service industries.

There is a substantial literature on the factors explaining exports by U.S.
                                       -   32 —

goods industries, and particularly manufacturing industries, and some on the

relation of foreign production to exports among and within manufacturing

industries (Baldwin, 1971 and 1979, and Branson and Monoyios, 1977, for the

former issues, and Lipsey and Weiss, 1981 and 1984, and Blomstrdm, Lipsey, and

Kulchycky, 1988,   for the latter),   but little on the service industry sector.

    Some possible determinants of the extent to which production by multina-

tional firms in an industry is carried on outside the United States are exa-

mined in Table 14. The unit of observation here is an industry, not a firm,

In the first four equations, variables representing the usual factor inten-

sities, physical capital per worker and average compensation per worker, in

parent production do not manage to explain any of the differences in the propen—

sity to produce abroad among goods industries or among service industries,

although P & 0 per worker does seem to be positively related to the extent of

overseas production in goods industries. When the ratio of affiliate to parent

average compensation per worker is added to the equations, some of the other

variables become significant, and this variable is related to differences among

goods industries but not to those among service industries,       Among the goods

industries, the lower the average compensation in affilites reative to that in

parents, the larger was affiliate employment relative to parent employment.

    The meaning of that relationship is somewhat ambiguous because the relative

compensation variable combines the effects of any differences in relative wages

for labor of identical quality with the effects of differences in the mix of low

and high income countries in which the affiliates operate and with differences

in the extent to which skill levels differ between parents and affiliates in

particular countries. Since firms in all industries presumably face the same

prices for labor in any given country, the variable is not likely to represent

the relative price of labor encountered by different industries.   A possible

interpretation is the one alluded to earlier:   goods industries, in which firms

can divide up their production into parts requiring different levels of skill

and different capital inteOsities tend to produce more abroad and thus to hire

more of their labor input abroad, and to produce more in low-income countries

abroad.   Given their ability to divide up their production, and to produce in

one country for consumption in another countrj, some goods producers a:'    fire

feasible; firms cannot produce in very different ways in different

world, and there s, therefore, no correlation between average compensation dif-

ferences between parents and affiliates and the extent of overseas production.

    A test of our hypothesis that the firms   in goods producing industries are


more able to allocate employment to low-wage countries than are firms in servce

industries is to ask how much of the interindustry differences in affiliate wage

levels anu affiliate compensation levels relative to parent compensat:on levels

is accounted for by intenindustry differences in the country distribution of

affiliate employment. We estimated what the average affiliate compensation in

each industry would have been if the only differences among industries had been

in the geographical distribution of employment; that is, if each industry had

paid the identical average compensation in each area We then correlated this

estimated compensation level with the actual one and with the actual ratios of

affiliate to parent average compensation, with the following results:
                                      —   34 —

           Percent   of interindustry variance (R2 x 100) accounted for

           Goods industries               46.9
           Service industries             22.3

Interindustry differences in average affiliate compensation and relative

affiliate/parent compensation levels reflected the geographical distribution of

employment to a much greater degree than did those of service industries. It

appears that among goods industries, the greater the opportunity to reduce pro-

duction costs by allocating labor-intensive elements of production to iox-age

countries, the greater the extent of foreign relative to domestic employment.4

    When the factor proportions and R & 0 variables of Table 14 are used to

explain differences in export propensities among goods industries and among ser-

vice industries in Table 15, they do so to a much greater degree than for

foreign employment propensities.   Again, large differences betaeen goods

industries and service industries emerge.        Factor intensities of parent frms do

explain a substantial part of differences in export propensities among goods

industries, but not among service industries. The P & 0 intensity of an industry

is the only statistically significant variable at conventional levels of the


t-ratio, but there is also some suggestion among goods industries of a negative

relationship with physical capital intensity and a positive one with the average

skill levels of employees.

    If we add to these equations a variable for the ratio of parent to aft i-

hate average compensation levels, the results suggest that large gaps in       corn-




   4Since foreign production is labor intensive relative to domestic production,
the allocation of production is not identical to the allocation of employment.

no visible effect on export propensities among goods industries or among service

industries.

Conclusions

       Although service transactions in the balance of payments have clearly been

underestimated, corrections for the understatement would still leave sales by

foreign affiliates as the main channel through which U.S. service sector firms

serve foreign markets, Service sector firms have played a smaller role in U.S.

direct investment abroad and in foreign direct investment in the U.S. than have

firms in goods producing sectors, but the share of the narrowly defined service

sector (excluding construction and public utilities) in investment has been

growing rapidly. The service industries mainly responsible for the growth in

U.S.    investment have been wholesale trade and financial services, including

banking.

       There appear to be major differences in behavior between goods and service

industries. Service sector parents other than those in wholesale trade export

less of their output and, in particular, trade less with their own foreign

fFi]iates. Service industry foreign affiliates, on the other hand, are about as

export-oriented as goods-industry affiliates. However, for some service affi-

liates, particularly those in wholesale trade,   the exports are almost entirely

of goods rather than services. The share of the exports of service affiliates

that goes to their parents is much smaller than for
                                                    goods-industry affiliates.

       Service sector affiliates are more similar to their parents in two respects

than are those in goods industries. One is physical capital intensity and the

other is human capital or skill intensity. It is clear that multinationals in

manufacturing allocete their activities in such a way as to respond to differen-
                                     -   35   -



ces in labor cost by producing labor-intensive products or by using labor-inten-

sive methods of production in countries in which labor is cheap (Lipsey, Kravis,

and Roldan, 1982).   In service industries, there is little sign of such an allo-

cation of production affiliates are more similar to parents in each industry,

and affiliates in LOCs are more similar to those in developed countries.

     Our interpretation of these facts is that in the service sector, it is more

difficult to break down production for a world market into parts adapted to

various countries' factor prices. Partly, this is because of the limited trade-

                                               must be produced where they are
bility of services: the fact that most of them

consumed or consumed where they are produced. The -esult is that service sector

affiliates in foreign countries, to a greater extent than goods affiliates, are

like miniature versions of their parents rathe' than specialized elements in a

worldwide production allocation.

     While this hypothesis stems from the comparisons of characteristics of

                                                      efforts to explain dif-
parents with those of affiliates, it is reinforced by

ferences in the extent of foreign operations and the export propensities of

found that the Importance of foreign employment relative to domestic employment

in a goods industry was significantly associated with the size of the difference

in average compensation between parents       arid   their foreign affiliates. Our

                                                                     but not
interpretation of that result is that goods industry multinationals,

those in service industries, can split their operations into low-skill and high-

skill components and take advantage of low prices for unskilled labor in poor

countries by placing their low-skill operations there. This interpretation is

reinforced by the finding that the proportion of interindustry differences in

affiliate compensation levels and relative affiliate/parent compensation levels
                                      —   37 —

that   is accounted for by differences in the geographical location of affiliate

employment is much greater for goods industries than for service industries.

With respect to exporting, we find that factor proportions explanations of the

pattern of U.S.   exports, particularly the technological intensity of an

industry, works well for goods industries but not for service industries.

       The implication of these results is that foreign investment in goods

industries represents an allocation of production among locations that should

produce an increase in the demand for high-skill labor and for P & U input in

parent companies and a decrease in the demand for low—skill labor.   Investment in

service industries, on the other hand, while it increases the multinationals'

shares in foreign markets, and may be necessary for any share, does not affect

the composition of the parents' production or the parents' demand for different

types of labor.
