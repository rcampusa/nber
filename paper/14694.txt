Even though Australia has experienced frequent and large commodity export price shocks like the
Third World, it seems to have dealt with the volatility better. Why? This paper explores Australian
terms of trade volatility since 1901. It identifies two major price shock episodes before the recent mining-led
boom and bust. It assesses their relative magnitude, their de-industrialization and distributional impact,
and policy responses. In what way has Australia been different from other commodity exporters experiencing
volatile prices?

          Recent research shows that external price volatility -- terms of trade volatility in

particular -- has a negative impact on long run growth (Fatas and Mihov 2006; Blattman,

Hwang and Williamson 2007; Koren and Tenreyro 2007; Poelhekke and van der Ploeg

2007; Williamson 2008).1 Yet, Blattman, Hwang and Williamson (2007) document that

between 1870 and 1940 the negative impact of terms of trade volatility on economic

growth was far greater in commodity dependent Latin America, Africa and Asia than it

was in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, even though in some

cases the magnitude of the price volatility was even larger. Indeed, they find no evidence

to support the view that terms of trade volatility significantly lowered long run growth in

the English-speaking European offshoots at all between 1870 and 1940.

          What are the secrets of this long run success of the English-speaking offshoots?

Was it because their factor markets were better able to respond to external shocks? Was it

because of better policy or better institutions? Was it because their governments had

more stable revenues so as to pursue long run infrastructure investment without

interruption? Was it because the offshoots were better able to diversify (especially in to

manufacturing) and thus to mute the impact of the external price shocks? And what was

the impact of these price shocks on income distribution? These questions await answers.

Not only should the explanations be of interest to economic historians and development

      1
          Blattman et al. (2007) focus on the period 1870 to 1939, and Williamson (2008) on the period
1780-1913, whereas all the other papers cited in the text focus on the post-1960 period. Some of the early
research on the impact of term of trade volatility on long-run growth are Mendoza (1997), Deaton and
Miller (1996), Kose and Reizman (2001), Bleaney and Greenway (2001), and Hadass and Williamson
(2003).

economists, but they may also offer useful lessons for Australian policy makers dealing

with the present mining boom and bust. It may also have implications for economic

development in poor African, Asian and Latin American countries where price volatility

is frequently documented as a fundamental drag on development (Loayza et al., 2007).

        We approach these questions from a country perspective. The paper focuses on

Australian terms of trade history since federation in 1901. It identifies two major price

shock episodes before the recent mining-led episode, and assesses their relative

magnitude, their de-industrialization and distributional impact, factor market responses

and policy behaviour. In doing so, we are able to learn what external price shocks did to

resource allocation, development and distribution in the Australian 20th century, and thus

to understand more about what it might do at the start of the Australian 21st century.

       The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reports the

complete terms of trade time series since 1901. We identify major episodes of shocks in

the net barter terms of trade, as well as in the prices of tradables relative to all

commodities, including non-tradables. We compare average volatility across major

Australian episodes, identify the most volatile episodes, identify which Australian export

commodities had the greatest price volatility, and whether export product concentration

played a role. Furthermore, we compare Australian commodity price volatility with that

of other commodity exporters. Section 3 explores Australian factor market response to

these shocks, primarily the regional impact on employment and migration. The income

distributional impact is explored at length and compared across episodes in Section 4.

Section 5 takes a close look at Australian policy response. In particular, it assesses

government deficits and surpluses, government infrastructure investment, and tariff



                                             3
policy across these episodes. Did Australia use tariffs as a device to offset de-

industrialization forces generated by commodity export price booms? Did Australia

governments use revenue booms to accumulate, and revenue busts to spend? Section 6

concludes.




                  2. A Century of Australian Terms of Trade Shocks




Measuring Price Volatility

       This section starts by comparing Australian experience with export price booms

with one other English-speaking offshoot, the United States, and then with two late

comers, Brazil and Indonesia. We conclude the section by comparing Australian export

price volatility with all Third World primary product exporters.

       When Australian commodity price shocks are compared with other commodity

exporting countries (both rich and poor), two different patterns emerge. First, the

Australian and the United States (which used to be a rich commodity exporter) terms of

trade moved together during the last half of the 19th and the first third of the 20th century

(Figure 1). This correlation continues until the Great Depression when the United States

terms of trade improved and the Australian terms of trade slumped. In addition, Australia

and the United States exhibited quite different behaviour in the two decades after 1980

(Figure 2), and during the Australian mining boom since the late 1990s, when the US

terms of trade shows no rise. Australian terms of trade movements during the second half

of the 19th century and after appear to be similar to the terms of trade movement in Brazil

and Indonesia (Figure 3). The fact that agricultural raw material and foodstuff prices


                                             4
show some co-movement may account for similar terms of trade timing for the three

economies. But here again, the correlation breaks down after 1980. Relatively high but

declining Indonesian terms of trade during the first half of the 1980s following the oil

crisis of the 1970s is not matched by Australia or Brazil (Figure 4). The recent Australian

mining-driven terms of trade boom has not been replicated in Indonesia or Brazil.

          So much for timing. What about comparative magnitudes? Has Australia

undergone greater or less volatility in its export prices and terms of trade than have other

commodity exporters? We know it did not undergo less volatility during the seven

decades before 1940. Blattman et al. (2007) have shown that the average terms of trade

volatility in Australia over the period 1870 to 1939 was greater than all countries in the

European periphery,2 most of Latin America,3 and the majority of countries in Asia and

the Middle East.4 Since 1960, Australian terms of trade volatility, while no longer

greater, has been only marginally less than that of other commodity exporting regions.

During the 1970s, external price volatility in Australia – defined as the standard deviation

of the logarithmic change in terms of trade -- was as much as three-fifths of that of Sub-

Saharan Africa and more than four-fifths of that of Latin America (Table 1), two regions

that the development literature characterizes as greatly disadvantaged by price volatility

(Deaton and Miller 1996). Australian terms of trade volatility was also similar to other

commodity exporting regions in the 1980s, although it was less so in the 1990s. Note

also, that in every decade from the 1960s to the 1990s, Australian terms of trade volatility

and Spain.

       The Latin American exceptions were Brazil, Colombia, and Cuba.

was more than double that of the average for all industrial economies. The Australian

volatility figure for 2000-07 seems less than that of previous decades, but Table 1 only

reports the boom up to 2007; it does not report the recent price collapse in commodity

markets. While Australian base metal prices rose by an immense 321 percent between

1998/99 and the peak in May 2007, by November 2008 it had tumbled to only 47 percent

of that peak. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar collapsed from almost par with the US

dollar (0.96) in June 2008 to 0.67 in October 2008.

Notes: The Australian figures are our own calculation. Figures for other country groups are inferred from
Figure 3 in Loayza et al. (2007), p. 346. Volatility of terms of trade growth is calculated as the standard
deviation of the logarithmic change in terms of trade over each of the four decades 1960–2000.



        Thus, it appears that for more than a century, Australia has experienced about as

volatile a terms of trade as the average commodity exporter. How was it that Australia

seemed to handle these shocks so well?




Identifying Episodes

        Figure 5 reports the Australian net barter terms of trade (PX/PM) between 1890 and

2007. In addition, two other variables are plotted there, PX/PY and PM/PY. The ratio of



                                                    6
export to import prices is the standard measure of the terms of trade. However, in order to

assess the impact of external price shocks on the economy as a whole, the prices of those

two tradables should be related to the prices of non-tradables as well. That is, a

commodity export price boom (or bust) must be expressed relative to all other prices in

the domestic economy in order to assess its impact on resource allocation, output mix and

income distribution. Hence, the external terms of trade does not by itself offer an

adequate measure of export price booms and busts relative to the rest of the economy.

More effective measures are PX/PY and PM/PY where Py is the GDP implicit price deflator.

It makes a difference in what follows.

          Australia has undergone three major external price shock episodes over the past

century. As Table 2 documents, the first half of the 1920s experienced a sharp increase in

Australian export prices and thus in the external terms of trade, PX/PM. What is surprising,




                                                      7
however, is that PX/PY hardly increased at all.5 Note also that the long boom and

subsequent bust in the terms of trade from the late 1890s to the end of World War I

(Figure 5) disappears when PX and PM are deflated by PY. The cycle from World War I to

the mid 1920s is, however, apparent in all three series, and it also coincides with a strong

real GDP growth performance of 6.5 percent per annum (Pope 1987; p. 35). Note also

that the terms of trade bust in the second half of the 1920s coincided with negative GDP

per capita growth, five years before the Great Depression hit. The second major price

shock occurred during the Korean War episode from the late 1940s to the early 1950s,

when PX/PM and PX/PY growth were both double-digit (Table 2). Yet, the price bust seems

to have left no mark on aggregate economic performance: the GDP growth rate was three

times as fast during the 1950-1955 price bust than during the 1945-1950 price boom.

Finally, the third major price shock is what we have seen since 2003 (or even 1998),

when the average GDP growth rate rose again, this time to 2.6 percent per annum. Each

of the two previous export price booms were followed by an equally dramatic price

collapse. Of course, we do not yet know whether the current collapse in commodity

exports will persist, but so far it appears that the recent boom will also be followed by a

dramatic bust. Whether the price bust will drag Australian growth performance down – as

in the late 1920s, or not – as in the early 1950s, is yet to be seen, although a world

recession will certainly obscure those forces.

           What about the magnitudes of these shocks? How large are they when compared

across episodes? During the first boom between 1920 and 1925, the total increase in PX/PY



       5
           Over the period 1921 to 1924, PX/PM rose approximately 94.5 percentage points compared to 4.1
percentage point increase in PX/PY over the same period.



                                                     8
was 4.1 percentage points and the average year to year change was 0.8 percent. During

the Korean War boom up to 1950, the total increase in PX/PY was 80.3 percentage points,

and the annual rate was a huge 16.1 percent. For the year 1949 to 1950 alone, the increase

was over 48.4 percentage points. On the down side between 1950 and 1955, the figure

was a huge annual rate of -10 percent. Without a doubt, the Korean War episode recorded

the largest boom and bust in export prices over the last century (see also Maddock 1987).

The recent export price boom seems pretty modest compared with the Korean episode,

but pretty dramatic compared with the 1920s. Between 2003 and 2007, the annual rate of

increase in PX/PY was 2 percent, compared with 0.8 percent in the early 1920s and 16.1

percent in the late 1940s.

       Were these three Australian price shocks driven by the export price of a

particularly volatile commodity, or by the fortuitous co-movement of many export

commodity prices? To address this question, Figure 6 plots PXW/PY, PXM/PY, and PXA/PY

where Pxw , Pxm , and Pxa are export prices of wool, mining, and agriculture goods

respectively. Table 2 also reports the average growth rates of these three commodity

prices during these episodes. The export price boom between 1920 and 1925 was driven

solely by wool prices. The export price of agriculture goods and mineral prices

underwent no boom at all, but rather a decline. The Korean War commodity price episode

was also driven by wool prices, but on this occasion both mining and agriculture prices

also experienced a sharp increase and subsequent collapse. Like the 1920s, the recent

price boom 2003-2007 was also mainly driven by one set of commodities, minerals, since

the export prices of wool and agriculture actually declined up to 2007. Thus, two things

made the Korean War boom unusual: the magnitude of the price boom was unusually



                                            9
great for all three products; and the co-movement of all three was unusually pronounced.

It appears that there is little that is unusual about the recent commodity export price boom

(and bust): the magnitude of the recent boom in mining product prices exceeded that of

wool in the early 1920s but fell well short of the Korean War boom in the same product;

and the fact that the recent boom involved only one product price (minerals), was also

shared by the early 1920s. Once again, if we are looking for an unusual commodity price

boom and bust over the past Australian century, it is the Korean War, not the current

episode.

           A comparison of export product concentration during the three episodes reveals

that indeed wool was the dominant export commodity during the 1920s. More than 70

percent of Australian exports were primary products with wool making up more than half

of it (Table 3).6 Therefore, the 1920-1925 boom would have been driven by wool prices

even if the relative prices of mining and agricultural products had behaved the same way

(which, of course, they did not). Wool could claim an even more dominant position in the

export product mix by the Korean War, although residual exports (which included

manufactures) gained at the expense of mining and agriculture. However the world

commodity boom led to the expansion of all Australian export sectors, including wool,

mining, and agriculture, even though the wool price boom was much more dramatic than

that of mining and agriculture. In contrast, the recent commodity boom (and bust) has

been dominated by mining and the residual sector. Mining accounts for almost half of


       6
           Bambrick (1973) also documents that the export price index for 1890 to 1930 was dominated by
the major export commodity, wool. Cashin and Mcdermott (2002) show that, in Australia, the wool export
cycle was in synchronization with the business cycle prior to World War I. This link became weaker after
the war.



                                                   10
Australian exports. Wool and agriculture no longer appear to be important export items,

mining prices are doing all the work.

           Furthermore, the residual export category – mainly manufactures – has served to

offset the volatility in the three commodities. Indeed, throughout the 20th century, as

Australia industrialized, the export mix increasingly shifted towards manufactures, from

28.4 percent of the export total in 1920-25 to 48.2 percent in 2003-07. Thus, while export

commodity price volatility is still an Australia attribute, its impact has diminished across

the 20th century due to industrialization and post-industrial forces: first, reducing export

concentration, and raising the manufacturing export share (with more stable prices); and

second, reducing the relative size of agriculture and mining activity in the economy, both

serving to mute the impact of export price volatility in Australian markets.7

                 3. Australian Market Response to the Terms of Trade Shocks

           Having established that the Australian economy experienced three major terms of

trade booms (the early twenties, the Korean War, and the recent mining boom) and three

major busts (the late 1920s and the Great Depression, and the long price bust from 1951

           Martin (1989) shows that, since 1970, Australia’s exports are considerably more diversified and
therefore substantially reduces the variability in terms of trade.

to 1973, and the recent months), how has the Australian market responded? We explore

two responses. First, we look at the impact of these shocks on the structure of the

economy both in terms of employment and output. Is there any evidence of de-

industrialisation during the terms of trade booms, and industrial recovery during the

slumps? We answer this question by constructing an index of structural change and also

by looking at manufacturing employment and output time series. Second, we look at the

impact of these price shocks on factor markets.

       The structural change index is constructed using the formula St = Σi wi |gi,t − gt| ,

where wi are value added weights, gi and g are one year growth rates of individual

industrial sectors and aggregate respectively both in terms of employment and GDP

(Hatton 2007; Hatton and Boyer 2005). These two indices range between zero (when all

sectors grow at the same rate as the aggregate and hence there is no structural change)

and one. The SCHEMP index captures structural change in sectoral employment and the

(SCHGDP) index captures structural change in sectoral output (Data Appendix). The

maximum values of these indices for the corresponding period are presented in Table 4.

With the exception of output during the 1920s and employment during the Korean War

episode, there is very little evidence of significant differences in the rate of structural

change on the upswing versus the downswing during these three price shocks. True,

SCHGDP fell from a high 14 percent in the early 1920s to a somewhat lower 9 percent in

the late 1920s, but there were no such differences on either side of the price peaks in the

other two episodes. Similarly, while SCHEMP fell from a high 16 percent in the late

1940s to a much lower 3 percent in the early 1950s, there were no such differences on

either side of the price peaks in the other two episodes. The current boom has, thus far,



                                            12
exhibited no structural adjustment response at all, at least as measured by SCHGDP or

SCHEMP.

       Figure 7 also plots the deviations from long run trend in the manufacturing

sector’s employment and GDP shares from 1890 to 2007. The manufacturing sector share

exhibits a century-long inverted U reflecting a half century of manufacturing-led growth

(and shrinking agriculture) followed by a half century of service-led growth (and

shrinking manufacturing). The peak approximately coincides with the Korean War

episode. Due to the effect of the secular increase in manufacturing, it appears that the

commodity price shocks had very little impact on deindustrialisation or reindustrialisation

during Australia’s biggest commodity price boom and bust. There are two possible

explanations for this result. The first would lie with the fact that the underlying

development fundamentals – favoring manufacturing -- completely swamped the impact

of the commodity price shocks between 1945 and 1955. The second explanation would

be that factor markets did not play the allocative roles we expect of them. These two

explanations need not be competing. In any case, the same appears to have been true of


                                            13
the recent mining boom and bust. The only exception to this rule appears to have been the

1920s (Figure 7 and Table 4) where there does seem to be evidence of deindustrialisation

on the commodity price upswing and reindustrialisation on the downswing. This

exception is all the more surprising given that the great terms of trade boom and bust in

the 1920s was, as we have seen, much more modest when PX and PM are both deflated by

PY, the GDP implicit price deflator (Table 2).

       What suppressed deindustrialisation during the commodity price booms and

reindustrialisation during the price slumps? To repeat, was it because long run

development fundaments swamped the impact of commodity price booms and busts, or

was it because of factor immobility? Conventional wisdom suggests that there should be

an influx of foreign labour during terms of trade upswings and exodus during

downswings (Hatton and Williamson 1998: Chapter. 4), and that foreign and domestic

migrants should both favour the resource-intensive regions on the upswings and

disfavour them on the downswing. These labour market effects should have been more

pronounced the greater was labour mobility. Was this the case with the three Australian

commodity price episodes across the 20th century? There was an Australian immigration

boom in the 1920s, but it seems to have lagged behind the commodity price boom by a

half decade (compare Tables 1 and Table 5). And while Western Australia, South

Australia and Queensland were more heavily specialized in wool and agriculture, only

Western Australia reported relatively heavy immigration rates compared with the national

average between 1920 and 1925. Furthermore, Western Australia had far higher

immigration rates during the bust in the late 1920s (16.7), than during the boom in the

early 1920s (9.3), and the immigration rates reported for Queensland were hardly




                                            14
different on either side of the price spike (5.9 vs 5.2). Thus, migration did not play the

consistent and powerful role during the first export commodity price event that a mobile

labour market would have predicted. This perverse result was even more notable during

the Korean War period: while Western Australia and South Australia were both above the

national immigration average 1945-50, Queensland was below it; and all three regions

had greater immigration rates during the bust after 1950, than during the boom up to

1950. Similar migration patterns have continued during the current mining boom: while

resource-abundant Queensland underwent much higher immigration rates than the rest of

Australia, and while resource-scarce New South Wales recorded low growth rates, none

of the remaining four states show a significant change between 2000-02 and after. In

short, either labour markets have not responded with sufficient power to create de-

industrialization during the commodity price booms and re-industrialisation during the

slumps, or other forces have offset those forces over the past century.

       Now consider the behaviour of unemployment rates across states. Since Western

Australia, South Australia and Queensland specialised in resource-intensive activities, a

commodity price boom should have generated high employment and low unemployment

rates there compared to Victoria and New South Wales, where more manufacturing was

located, if labour was relatively immobile. If instead labour was very mobile, then

unemployment rates would have been similar across states in level and change. Table 6

reports state unemployment rates for the three episodes of external price shocks. The

immobile labour thesis seems to be confirmed. During the first half of the 1920s, the

unemployment rates in Western Australia and South Australia were well below the

national average, but Queensland was above it. During the price bust 1925-30,

Queensland and Western were still below the national average in spite of the price bust,

but South Australia was above it. This mixed and ambiguous result is also confirmed for

the more industrial states during the boom: employment rates in New South Wales were

above the national average (5.9) but they were below it in Victoria (4.2).

Notes: Unemployment rates are defined as average unemployed per year as a percentage of total
workforce. Data are from Leigh and McLeish (2009).



Similarly, while unemployment rates were lower in Queensland and South Australia

during the commodity export price boom 1945-50, resource-abundant Western Australia


                                             16
was above the Australian average while industrial Victoria was below it. Furthermore, the

unemployment rates show mixed performance between the industrial and resource-

abundant states after the price boom as well.

       To sum up, the Australian labour market response to the external price shocks did

not follow the predictions of conventional theory, at least systematically. We find very

little evidence of structural change and industrial response during these price shocks,

suggesting that long run economic fundamentals were swamping them. In addition, we

find very little evidence that labour markets were responsive to these price shocks: labour

migration during commodity price booms and busts was modest and inconsistent.




          4. Australian Distributional Response to Terms of Trade Shocks




       How did these price shocks influence Australian income distribution?




Distribution Responses since 1921

       Constructing a time series for the complete Australian income distribution from

Federation onwards is impossible due to the paucity of reliable data going back that far.

However, some of the earlier research on long-term trends suggests that while there were

short-run fluctuations in earnings dispersion between 1914 and 1980, they were not very

large nor consistently related to commodity export price experience (Norris, 1977: p. 484;

Maddock et al.1984: p. 19). Thus, any short-run impact of external price shocks on the

earnings distribution must have been brief and very modest. This result would hardly be

surprising if Australia’s export sectors had roughly the same labour and skill intensity as


                                            17
the average of the rest of the economy. Under those circumstances, changes in wage

inequality would be manifested only by regional differences in average annual labour

earnings between those states specialising in resource-intensive exports and the others.

Thus, a weak connection between earnings distribution and export commodity price

shocks might have been expected. Property income and top shares in total income are,

however, another matter entirely.

       Based on Atkinson and Leigh’s (2007) evidence, Figure 8 plots income shares of

the top 1 percent, 0.05 percent and 0.01 percent of the richest Australians since 1921. The

most notable feature there is the long run 20th century decline in this inequality measure,

an event shared by almost all industrial countries (Atkinson and Piketty 2008; see also

Gordon and Dew-Becker 2008). The second notable feature of Figure 8 is the rise in

inequality between the 1970s and 1990s, again a feature shared by most other industrial

economies. There have been, however, two distinct departures from those long-run trends

in Australia: the Korean War commodity price boom and bust, and the recent mining-led

boom, where inequality kept rising after the 1990s, while it levelled out elsewhere. It

seems quite clear that commodity price booms have driven up Australian income shares

at the top, and that the subsequent busts have erased their big gains, at least based on two

of the three commodity price episodes. Unfortunately, the Atkinson and Leigh data only

reach back to 1921. While we do see a sharp decline in the top shares in the late 1920s,

we cannot be sure that the high shares in the early 1920s were, in fact, higher than what

preceded it.




                                            18
Distribution Responses before 1921

       We can, however, fill in the pre-1921 distribution blanks with a useful proxy.

Suppose trends in land rents are a good proxy for income at the top – at least for Australia

before the 1930s when mining and manufacturing activities were relatively modest.

Under these conditions, the ratio of land rents to wages (r/w) ought to be a good index of

pre-1921 trends in the relative incomes of the rich at the top. What, then, ought to be the

connection between the terms of trade and the rental-wage ratio? The relevant theory can

be found in the work done in the 1970s by Max Corden and Fred Gruen (1970), Bob

Gregory (1976), and Ronald Jones (1979). The models are simple, but they isolate what

should be important. An increase in the price of the land-intensive export commodity (PX)

shifts its isoprice curve outwards, land rents rise, and labour is pulled out of labour-

intensive manufacturing to work in the export sector. The rental-wage ratio and,

presumably, the top income shares, rise.

       We can be a little more precise. Suppose the commodity export sector uses mobile

labour, earning the wage w as before, and sector-specific land (R), earning the rent r as

before. Suppose further that the manufacturing sector uses mobile labour and sector-

specific capital (K), the latter earning a profit rate i. Now, introduce a commodity price

shock to the economy by raising its terms of trade, PX/PM. It must follow that

                              r* > PX* > w* > PM* > i*,

where Z* refers to the rate of change in Z. The inequality states that changes in the

returns to the sector-specific factors (land and capital) are much more pronounced than

the return to the mobile factor (labour), a formal result that makes good intuitive sense.

After all, while a mobile factor can emigrate from a sector absorbing a bad price shock,




                                            19
an immobile sector-specific factor (like arable land, mineral resources or industrial

capital) cannot. Furthermore, the rental-wage ratio responds as

                               (r* - w*) = Δ (PX* - PM*)

where then size of Δ > 1 depends, among other things, on the relative size of the

commodity export sector. When it was big in the late 19th and early 20th century, Δ was

also big; when it is small a century later in the current boom, Δ is also small.

       So much for theory. What about fact? The prices of commodity exports

underwent great volatility but generally boomed up to 1914, and so did the terms of trade

of those countries which specialized in those products, including Australia (Williamson

2008). Furthermore, the rental-wage ratio was highly correlated with those terms of trade

movements. Indeed, when the determinants of r/w are estimated in a 19-country sample

1870-1940 using country fixed effects, the coefficient (Δ) on PX/PM is +1.78 for the

English-speaking European overseas countries (significant at 5%: Williamson 2002:

Table 5). If changes in the rental-wage ratio are a good proxy for changes in the top

income share pre-1921, then the data in Table 7 imply the following: the top shares did

rise to peaks in the mid 1920s from a low in 1920, but the top shares were probably even

bigger during the war years when the terms of trade was also higher.

       There is one final complication to consider. Is it changes in industrial (and service

sector) profits (iK) or agricultural or mining rents (rR) that are likely to dominate changes

in the top shares? The answer depends, of course, on the structure of the economy. Where

the commodity export sector is a big share in GDP and manufacturing (and modern

services) is small, rR/iK will also be big, and so changes rR will dominate changes in the

top shares. We think this was likely before the 1930s when the primary sector was big.




                                             20
Symmetrically, where rR/iK is small, changes in rR will have a smaller impact on

changes in the top shares. This has certainly been true for the early 21st century, as

Australia has become a post-industrial society. We also think it was true of the 1940s and

1950s when the industrial sector was at its peak.

          Unfortunately, we do not have the relevant data which could exactly track rR/iK

over time. However, we can certainly measure the relative importance of the primary

sector, the manufacturing sector, and the service sector. Such evidence can at least serve

as an indirect test of our conjectures about the evolution of rR/iK across the 20th century.

In 1925, the manufacturing sector was only half the size of the primary sector8 (Vamplew

1987: 133), while by 1956 manufacturing’s share in GDP had increased to 28 percent and

the primary sector had fallen to 18.2 percent (Maddock and McLean 1987: 19), or one

and a half times the size of the primary sector. This structural transformation over just

three decades was spectacular. After the 1970s, the primary sector share stabilized at


      8
          The primary sector is defined as the sum of agriculture and mining.



                                                     21
about 10 percent, and the service sector share had reached 41 percent, evidence which

certainly supports the view that Australia became a post-industrial society by the late 20th

century.9

                   5. Australian Policy Response to Terms of Trade Shocks




          How did Australian policy react to these terms of trade shocks? Were higher

tariffs used to protect Australian industry during the commodity price booms? Was the

additional revenue generated by price booms used for infrastructure investments in the

more industrial states? Did the commonwealth government tackle regional imbalance by

subsidising slumping states with revenues generated by booming states? If so, were these

subsidies and bounties big as a share in total revenue?

          The time series in Figure 9 shows that there was a sharp increase in tariffs during

and following the great Australian tariff debates in the early 1920s (Coleman and Tyers

2005) when commodity export prices boomed. Lloyd (2008) documents that the 1921

Customs or Greene Tariff increased rates on industries that had grown during World War

I: the tariffs met with very little resistance as the proponents of protectionism used

defence and national pride in the young manufacturing sector as additional justifications

for protection (Anderson 1987). We suspect that it also got votes from the export-

booming states by appealing to fairness. Tariffs were raised still further during the years

leading up to depression, and after the commodity price bust, following Brigden’s (1925)

proposition that protection raises real wages, labor’s living standards, and the share of the

workforce employed in high wage jobs. Brigden’s supporters favoured using protection

as a redistributive policy instrument over directly taxing land rents – which had been

booming from the Great War to the mid 1920s (Table 7) -- as they thought the latter

would have been politically infeasible (Anderson 1987).

       During the Korean War period, there was one brief but very big increase in

average duties between 1951 and 1952 amounting to 11 percentage points (Figure 9).

However, Lloyd (2008) argues that this tariff rate increase was because of an increase in

imports of dutiable goods relative to free imports and not because of an increase in tariff

rates. These increases in imports were paid for by the massive increase in demand for

Australian commodity exports. They were also followed by a sharp fall as the boom

terminated.

       As Australia entered its post-industrial stage of development, the need for

protection declined, with or without a commodity price boom. As the service sector

became more and more important both in terms of employment and GDP shares, the

support for protecting manufacturing jobs to maintain high living standards faded. There

was across-the-board cut in tariff rates in 1973 and the trend continued till the current

boom (Lloyd 2008).

       In summary, the federal government responded to the terms of trade shocks by

raising tariffs to prevent deindustrialization and manufacturing unemployment only when

politicians thought it mattered. This was certainly the case during the early 1920s when a

vibrant manufacturing sector was closely associated with national defence, national pride

and fairness. Protectionist policies also served the government well as a redistribution

instrument during the depression. The need for such policies diminished when

manufacturing underwent its post-war boom and more recently when services became the



                                            23
dominant sector.

           Table 8 confirms that the Australian government enjoyed big revenue gains

during export commodity booms. The average growth rate of revenue during the first half

of the 1920s was 6.8 percent, a half a percentage point higher than the previous decade

(not shown). Payment to the states as a share of total government expenditure was 9

percent. Revenue growth slumped to 4.5 percent during the commodity price bust across

the late 1920s.10 But note that revenues did not fall during the bust, suggesting that the

federal government’s income sources were sufficiently diverse to mute the impact of the

commodity price slump. Also, both the shares of payment to the states and subsidies

increased during this time, suggesting an effort to smooth the regional impact on the

downside of the price cycle. The revenue growth rate during the Korean War almost

doubled from 6.9 to 12.3 percent on either side of 1950, showing how unimportant

commodity prices were as a determinant of government revenues by mid-century. State

transfers also increased, but it appears unlikely that they were driven by a response to the

price cycle.

           It slumped even more, of course, during the Great Depression.

The revenue increase during the recent boom was 6.6 percent, only two thirds of the

growth experienced during the Korean War, but almost equal to the early 1920s. The

share of transfer to the states also increased significantly compared to previous episodes.

True, this resulted in large part from the introduction of the GST (Goods and Services

Tax) by the Howard Government in July 2000, phasing out several state and territory

taxes, stamp duties and levies with a promise that the commonwealth would return a

proportion of that revenue to the states through the Council of Australian Governments

(COAG) mechanism. Thus, the big state redistributive share may not be the result of a

conscious redistribution policy driven by commodity export price shocks, but it is

certainly consistent with it.

        Table 9 reports the growth rate of government gross capital formation during the

terms of trade shocks. During the upside of the 1920s price shock, government

investment grew at an average rate of 4.4 percent, which was less than revenue growth,

suggesting an expenditure smoothing policy. Yet, government investment in

infrastructure projects such as posts and telegraph, roads, railways, and educational bricks

and mortar collapsed during the slump in the late 1920s. Indeed, when revenue growth

fell from 6.8 to 4.5 percent per annum, government investment growth became negative.

This hardly can be viewed as a stabilization policy, but rather the contrary. Thus, there is

very little evidence that the federation government used investment as an expenditure

smoothing device during the price and revenue cycle in the 1920s. The Korean War

episode generated a similar policy response. The overall growth in government

investment between 1945 and 1950 was a spectacular 22.3 percent per annum, more than

six times that of the 1920s boom. Posts and telegraph, roads, and railways all experienced


                                            25
very rapid growth but the growth of government investment in housing and education

were unmatched in Australian modern history.

commodity price bust, government investment growth fell by half, although the recorded

12.7 percent per annum was still a very big number.

        In contrast, the recent commodity price boom coincides with a drop in aggregate

government investment. This break with the past can be explained, of course, by an

ideological shift in the role of government, not by some change in views regarding how

to smooth expenditures over commodity price cycles. Perhaps the government response

to the ongoing collapse of base metal prices will reveal more about the historical

persistence of Australian policy response to these external price shocks.




                                   6. Concluding Remarks




        This paper has focused on Australian terms of trade history since Federation in



                                                26
1901. It identifies two major price shock episodes before the recent mining-led episode,

and assesses their relative magnitude, their de-industrialization and distributional impact,

factor market responses and policy behaviour. In doing so, we are able to learn what

external price shocks did to resource allocation, development and distribution in the

Australian 20th century, and thus to understand more about what it might do at the start of

the Australian 21st century.

       In spite of great commodity price volatility that matched most of the primary-

product exporting Third World, these price shocks never caused the same great volatility

in the Australia economy either in aggregates like GDP or unemployment, or in sectoral

and regional performance. Why? Was it because factor markets were better able to

respond to external shocks? Apparently not. Was it because the Australian government

had more stable revenues so as to pursue long run infrastructure investment without

interruption, that is, to stabilize? Yes and no. Yes, revenues came from fairly diverse

sources so that commodity price volatility did not produce as great revenue volatility. No,

since the federal government made little effort to use countercyclical investment policy.

Was it because Australia was better able to diversify and thus to mute the impact of the

external price shocks? We think it was (is) diversification that made (makes) the

difference – a big and growing industrial sector before about 1970, and a big and growing

service sector after about 1970. More efficient factor markets and better institutions

didn’t seem to matter much at all.

SCHGDP: Structural Change in GDP. Source: Defined as St = Si wi |gi,t - gt| , where wi are the Value
added share weights, gi and g are one year growth rates of individual industrial sectors and the GDP
respectively. This index ranges between zero (when all sectors grow at the same rate as the GDP and hence
there is no structural change) and one. Calculated on 13 sectors (pastoral, agriculture, mining, dairying
forestry fisheries, manufacturing, construction, private water transport, public business undertakings,
government services, finance, distribution, other services, house rent) for the period 1900-1939 using
Vamplew (1987), p. 133 data. Index for the period 1949 to 1960 is constructed by using Haig (1966). This
is calculated on 8 sectors (Primary industry, mining and quarrying, manufacturing, building and
construction, gas water and electricity, trade and transport, finance and property, other industries). Index for
the period 1963 to 1974 is constructed by using p. 199 of Norton, W. and P. Kennedy. (1985). This is


                                                        34
calculated on 10 sectors (agriculture, mining, manufacturing, construction, gas water and electricity,
wholesale and retail trade, transport, finance, public administration and entertainment, ownership of
dwellings). 1975 to 1995 is from RBA Historical Statistics, Table 5-10. This is calculated on 18 sectors
(agriculture, mining, manufacturing, construction, electricity gas and water, wholesale trade, retail trade,
accommodation, transport and storage, communication, finance and insurance, property business services,
government administration, education, health and community services, cultural recreational services,
personal and other services, ownership of dwellings). Finally, 1996 to 2007 is from ABS data (cat no.
5204.0) - Australian System of National Accounts, Table 9. Industry Gross Value Added: Chain Volume
Measure in $m(a). This is calculated on 18 sectors (agriculture forestry and fishing, mining, manufacturing,
construction, electricity gas and water, wholesale trade, retail trade, accommodation cafes and restaurants,
transport and storage, communication services, finance and insurance, property and business services,
government administration and defence, education, health and community services, cultural recreational
services, personal and other services, ownership of dwellings).

SCHEMP: Structural Change in Employment. Source: Defined as St = Si wi |gi,t - gt| , where wi are the
employment share weights, gi and g are one year growth rates of employment in individual industrial
sectors and the economy respectively. This index ranges between zero (when employment in all sectors
grow at the same rate as the aggregate and hence there is no structural change) and one. Calculated on 7
sectors (rural, mining, manufacturing, gas electricity and water, building and construction, trade and
transport, finance property and others) for the period 1911-1980 using Withers et al. (1985) data. Index for
the period 1981 to 1997 is constructed by using RBA Historical Statistics Table 4-10. This is calculated on
6 sectors (agriculture, mining, manufacturing, construction, trade and transport, finance and others).
Finally, index for the period 1998 to 2007 is constructed by using ABS data (cat no. 6291.0.55.033) -
Labour force, Australia, Detailed, Quarterly, May 2008, Table 04. Quarterly data coverted to annual by
averaging. This is calculated on 7 sectors (agriculture, mining, manufacturing, gas electricity and water,
construction, trade and transport, finance and others).
