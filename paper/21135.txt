                                             ABSTRACT

We examine the impact of a temporary price shock on the attainment of undocumented college students
enrolled in a large urban college system. In spring 2002, the City University of New York reversed
its policy of charging in-state tuition to undocumented students. By fall 2002, the state legislature
restored in-state rates. Using a differences-in-differences identification strategy, we estimate impacts
on reenrollment, credits, grades, and degree completion. The price shock led to an immediate 8 percent
decrease in senior college students' enrollment. Senior college students who entered college the semester
prior to the price shock experienced lasting reductions in attainment, including a 22 percent decrease
in degree receipt. Conversely, among senior college students who been enrolled for at least a year,
the price shock only affected the timing of exit.

1     Introduction

The share of high school graduates who enroll in college in the United States has grown substantially in

recent decades, yet college completion rates have declined, especially among low-income students (Bound,

Lovenheim and Turner, 2010; Bailey and Dynarski, 2011). A large body of research provides evidence that

reducing the price of college can increase college attendance (e.g., Deming and Dynarski, 2010), yet far less is

known about the effect of price on enrolled students’ ultimate degree attainment. In this paper, we estimate

the impact of an unanticipated and temporary tuition increase on the attainment of undocumented college

students within a major urban university system. Focusing on undocumented students - the majority of

whom are low-income and ineligible for federal and state financial aid - provides an opportunity to evaluate

the effect of price changes on the attainment of enrolled students with limited financial resources.

    Undocumented youth who migrate to the US as children are also a centerpiece of federal immigration

reform proposals and recent higher education policies in many states. Although federal efforts to pass

legislation extending legal status and other federal benefits to undocumented youth have been unsuccessful,

18 states now provide in-state tuition benefits to undocumented youth who received their secondary schooling

in the state. This subsidy represents a substantial reduction in postsecondary costs given that out-of-state

tuition rates are typically more than twice the in-state rates (Hemelt and Marcotte, 2011).

    We estimate the effect of a temporary removal of this in-state subsidy on the outcomes of undocumented

students enrolled in New York City’s public university system, the City University of New York (CUNY). For

a single semester, CUNY reversed its long-standing policy of charging in-state tuition rates to undocumented

students from New York. Students enrolled in one of CUNY’s “senior” colleges (institutions that offer both

bachelor’s and associate’s degrees) experienced a 123 percent price increase, while associate’s degree-seeking

community college students experienced a 23 percent increase.1 This one-semester price shock provides a

natural experiment for examining the effect of tuition on undocumented students’ attainment, measured by

their reenrollment, credit accumulation, grades, and degree receipt.

    To identify impacts on short-run attainment, we use a generalized differences-in-differences identification

strategy that compares changes in undocumented students’ outcomes before and after the tuition hike to

differences in the outcomes of documented noncitizens (93 percent of whom are permanent residents), a

group unaffected by the policy change. The elimination of the in-state tuition subsidy substantially decreased

undocumented senior college students’ short-run attainment, with reenrollment falling by 8 percent in the
   1 Though postsecondary institutions are typically classified as “four-year” or “two-year”, we use the CUNY System’s label of

“senior” college (as opposed to “four-year” college) because approximately 40 percent of CUNY’s senior college students start
out in an associate’s degree program and these students face the same tuition charges as senior college students enrolled in a
bachelor’s degree program. Thus, the magnitude of the price change is specific to the institution, not the degree. We elaborate
on this point in Section 2.

semester of the price increase. Among undocumented community college students, the price increase had no

effect on reenrollment, but decreased credits earned by approximately 8 percent. We can rule out all but

very small impacts on grades for both senior and community college students, and provide evidence that

senior college students induced to leave school by the price shock were not negatively selected, on average.

    We estimate that over half of the senior college students induced to dropout by the spring 2002 price

shock would not have successfully maintained enrollment in the following semesters, even in the absence of

any price increase. For these inframarginal students, the price shock affected the timing of college exit but

not long-run attainment. Inframarginal exits occur primarily among students who spent at least one year in

college before the price increase. Conversely, senior college students who enrolled in fall 2001 - the semester

immediately prior to the tuition increase - experienced lasting reductions in attainment. One interpretation

of this finding is that as college students gain more experience, they are better able to predict their long-run

success. As a result, price shocks close to college entry are more likely to affect marginal students who would

have ultimately been successful to dropout.

    To evaluate the long-run impacts of the price shock, we compare the outcomes of undocumented students

in the the 2000 and 2001 entry cohorts to those of undocumented students who started college in 1999,

again using differences in documented noncitizens’ outcomes by entry cohort to generate a counterfactual.

We estimate that the price shock experienced by undocumented senior college students from the 2001 entry

cohort resulted in a 22 percent decrease in degree receipt within eight years of entry. We find no evidence of

long-run impacts on community college students’ outcomes.

    Our paper contributes to research and policy concerning the effect of college prices on human capital

acquisition. Research reviewed by Deming and Dynarski (2010) points to significant increases in college-

going among students who experience an exogenous drop in price due to policy changes. However, there is

less evidence on the impact of price changes on the postsecondary attainment of students after they have

already spent time in college. Although gaps in college entry by family income have shrunk in recent years,

low-income students’ graduation rates remain low (Bailey and Dynarski, 2011), suggesting that the effects

of financial need on attainment persist beyond the enrollment margin. A handful of studies suggest that

increases in need-based grants can boost the attainment of enrolled students when such increases are not

offset by reductions in other aid.2 Bettinger (2004) provides evidence that Pell Grant aid increases Ohio

public college students’ persistence rates between the first to the second year of college.3 Similarly,Goldrick-

Rab et al. (2012) find higher first- to second-year persistence rates among Pell Grant recipients in Wisconsin
   2 A related topic is the role of credit constraints in students’ postsecondary decisions. In a setting where students faced no

direct tuition charges, Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2008) find that most dropouts do not face credit constraints, suggesting
a potentially large role for non-financial factors in students’ persistence decisions.
   3 Estimates suggest that an additional $1,000 in Pell Grant aid increases reenrollment by 3 to 4 percentage points, although

these estimates are not robust to controlling for institution fixed-effects.



                                                               3
colleges who were randomly-selected to receive an additional $1,000 in aid. Illustrating the importance

of accounting for loan crowd-out, Marx and Turner (2015) estimate that Pell Grant aid does not increase

persistence or attainment in a setting where additional grant aid reduces aid from federal loans. Castleman

and Long (2013) estimate the impact of state need-based grant aid on Florida high school graduates’ college

enrollment and attainment and impacts on both initial enrollment and degree receipt. However, the positive

effect of grant eligibility on enrollment makes it is difficult to determine whether grant aid eligibility increased

attainment above and beyond its impacts on college attendance. Addressing concerns of both selection into

college and crowd-out of federal and institutional grant aid, Angrist et al. (2014) examine the impact of a

need- and merit-based scholarship in Nebraska. They find substantial impacts on the persistence of nonwhite

students, but estimate that overall, at least 80 percent of funds were spent on students whose behavior was

not affected by the grant.4

    We contribute to research on the effect of prices on enrolled students’ attainment in several ways. First,

we estimate both short- and long-run impacts of a price shock, focusing on semester to semester reenrollment

as well as degree receipt. Second, our context allows us to isolate the impact of price increases on student

outcomes because undocumented students are unable to easily offset the price shock with additional grant

aid or borrowing. Finally, to our knowledge, ours is the first study that provides suggestive evidence that

students early in their college careers are more vulnerable to price increases than more experienced students.

    Our findings also contribute to research examining the effect of state, local, and institutional policies

aimed at making college more accessible to undocumented students. Four prior studies use national survey

data and a standard difference-in-difference framework to estimate the effects of in-state tuition subsidies on

undocumented students’ college enrollment decisions. Kaushal (2008), Chin and Juhn (2011), and Darolia

and Potochnick (2014) estimate the average effects of in-state tuition across all states with such policies,

while Flores (2010) focuses on the impact of Texas’ in-state tuition subsidy. All four studies rely on data

from the Current Population Survey (CPS) or the American Community Survey (ACS) and proxy for

undocumented status with Mexican (or Hispanic) students who are not citizens. Three of the four studies

find positive impacts of eligibility for the in-state tuition subsidy on college enrollment of 2 to 6 percentage-
   4 A related body of research explores the role of monetary incentives tied to other supports (such as mentors) or requirements

(such as a minimum course load or grade point average) on enrolled students’ effort and degree completion. Dynarski (2008)
estimates positive impacts of state merit-based aid on persistence and graduation with larger effects among female students.
Scott-Clayton (2011) studies West Virginia’s PROMISE scholarship and finds positive impacts only during years in which
aid was tied to performance. Results from the Student Achievement and Retention Project, an experimental study that
randomly-assigned students in a Canadian university to receive financial aid (tied to grades), support services, or both, suggests
higher levels of merit aid coupled with support services increased female (but not male) students’ grade point average and
persistence(Angrist, Lang and Oreopoulos, 2009). However, a follow-up study that involved stronger incentives found smaller
impacts on attainment (Angrist, Oreopoulos and Williams, forthcoming). Finally, a series of papers examine the impact of
randomly assigned student incentives and find evidence of small, but significant impacts on attainment (e.g., Patel and Rudd,
2012; Barrow et al., forthcoming). Although most studies examining student incentives in higher education find positive impacts
on enrolled students’ attainment, assistance is based on performance and often involves both monetary and additional supports.
Our study focuses exclusively on the estimation of tuition price effects.



                                                                4
points (Kaushal, 2008; Flores, 2010; Darolia and Potochnick, 2014). Our study builds on this prior work

by estimating the effect of these subsidies on students’ retention and ultimate degree receipt. In addition

to informing sub-national policies, evaluations of price effects on both college-going and degree attainment

inform federal immigration reform proposals aimed at providing undocumented youth with a pathway to

citizenship through college attendance and completion.

    The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: in Section 2, we describe the CUNY System and

provide background information on undocumented young adults. We discuss our data and sample in Section

3 and describe our empirical approach in Section 4. In Section 5, we present estimates of the impact of the

price increase on undocumented students’ attainment during the semester of the policy change and in the

immediately following semesters. Section 6 presents our estimates of the impact of the tuition increase on

longer-run outcomes, including degree receipt, while Section 7 concludes.



2     The CUNY System and Undocumented Students

As an established immigrant gateway, New York is home to approximately three million foreign-born res-

idents, an estimated 625,000 of whom are undocumented (American Community Survey, 2010; Passel and

Cohn, 2010). In fall 2013, approximately 8,300 undocumented students were enrolled in New York state col-

leges, with 80 percent residing in New York City and attending one of the CUNY System schools (DiNapoli

and Bleiwas, 2014).5

    In the period we examine, the CUNY System included 11 senior colleges and 6 community colleges. We

label CUNY schools as senior or community colleges instead of using the standard labels of two- or four-

year institutions because four of the 11 senior CUNY colleges offer both associate’s and bachelor’s degree

programs.6 In addition, CUNY senior college students who are enrolled in an associate’s degree program

face the same tuition rates as those in a bachelor’s degree program. In 2001, nominal in-state tuition

for a full-time student was $3,200 per year at senior colleges and $2,500 per year at community colleges.

Nominal out-of-state rates faced by full-time senior and community college students were $6,800 and $3,076,

respectively.

    Our identification strategy relies on unanticipated shocks to undocumented students’ eligibility for in-state

rates. In 1989, long before any state considered granting in-state tuition to undocumented students, New

York City Mayor Edward Koch issued an executive order that extended in-state prices to CUNY students
   5 An additional 18 percent of undocumented students were enrolled in a SUNY institution in one of the five counties sur-

rounding New York City, and the remaining 2 percent attended a SUNY institution elsewhere in the state.
   6 This practice is not unique to the CUNY System. According to data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data

System (IPEDS), in 2013, 60 percent of public institutions categorized as “four-year” schools also offered certificate or associate’s
degree programs.



                                                                 5
who lacked documentation but who could demonstrate that they graduated from a New York high school

or received a GED from the state (Rincón, 2008). Yet in the fall of 2001, shortly after the terrorist attacks

of September 11, the CUNY Chancellor overturned this policy and announced that starting in the spring

2002 semester, CUNY would charge undocumented students who had previously qualified for the in-state

subsidy out-of-state tuition rates.7 Although no changes to the new pricing policy were anticipated at the

beginning of the semester, by April 2002, Governor George Pataki announced his support for legislation

offering in-state tuition to undocumented students with ties to New York State.8 In the summer of 2002,

the state legislature passed a law that restored in-state tuition benefits for eligible undocumented students.

Thus, for the spring 2002 semester only, tuition rates for undocumented students at senior colleges more

than doubled (from $133 to $283 per credit). With a full-course load of 12 credits, this represented a price

increase of $1,800 for the semester. The price increase faced by undocumented community college students

was smaller (from $104 to $128 per credit), with full-time students facing an approximately $300 (23 percent)

increase for the semester.


2.1     Characteristics and outcomes of undocumented students

The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that there are approximately 1.7 million undocumented immigrants

under the age of 31 who migrated to the US at before they were 16 (Passel and Lopez, 2012). The proposed

Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act would provide eligible youth with a

pathway to permanent residency status and access to federal benefits, such as aid for college.9 Congress voted

against the DREAM Act in 2001, 2007 and 2010. In an effort to jump-start reforms targeting undocumented

youth, in 2012, the Obama administration announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)

program - an executive order that shields eligible undocumented immigrants from deportation and provides

them with temporary work authorization. President Obama attempted to expand the DACA program to

other undocumented residents in November 2014; however, a federal court order has suspended that action.

In the meantime, several states, Boards of Regents, and individual institutions have opted to extend in-state

tuition benefits to undocumented college students enrolled in public institutions. As of 2014, most of the top

immigrant-receiving states (including California, New York, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, and Illinois) have

granted the subsidy to eligible undocumented youth.

   9 In addition to removing the threat of deportation and the opportunity for legal employment, the bill encourages college

enrollment by offering a pathway to legalization for students who obtain a college degree.

   Despite the ample policy attention given to undocumented college students, there are few large-scale

analyses of their outcomes because federally-sponsored surveys and other administrative data sources are

prohibited from asking respondents to state their immigration status. Several qualitative studies of undocu-

mented college students identified through non-probabilistic sampling methods find that students who lack

documentation face substantial barriers to college success (Abrego, 2006; Contreras, 2009; Perez, 2009; Gon-

zales, 2011; Muñoz and Maldonado, 2012). Most undocumented students come from families with limited

financial resources and parents who are themselves undocumented and unable to provide guidance and sup-

port in navigating US institutions. Thus, undocumented students face many of the same hurdles encountered

by other low-income, first generation, college students. Their lack of documentation poses greater challenges

to normal college pursuits, such as obtaining driver’s licenses, places to live, student identification cards, and

employment both on and off campus (Contreras, 2009; Muñoz and Maldonado, 2012).

   At the same time, these studies suggest that undocumented youth demonstrate a high level of ambition

and resilience. Consistent with this anecdotal evidence, Conger and Chellman (2013) show that undocu-

mented CUNY students’ academic outcomes resemble those of other noncitizen immigrant groups (namely

permanent residents and visa holders), all of whom earn higher GPAs and complete more credits than US

citizens. These findings are in line with research on immigrant students in the K-12 education system, which

often finds that they are a positively-selected group who outperform native-born students with observably-

similar race and class profiles (e.g., Kao and Tienda, 1995; Schwartz and Stiefel, 2006).

   In short, many undocumented college students appear to fall in the category of high-ability, low-income

students. As low-income students, they should be highly responsive to tuition shocks. Furthermore, they

are ineligible for most other sources of financial aid and are less able to compensate for tuition increases

with anything other than employment in the informal labor market or loans from family members or other

informal sources. Following the news that tuition will increase in the next semester, we predict that some

undocumented students will exit college, reduce their credit-load, and/or devote less time to their school

work. These negative impacts may continue in later semesters even when the in-state rates are restored if

students face costs associated with switching between working and attending college or expect to face other

tuition increases in the future.10
  10 While some students can also choose to lower their consumption, two-thirds of students enrolled in the

CUNY System already live with their parents or guardians making reductions in housing consumption less of
an option for lowering the cost of attendance.          See CUNY’s “2012 Student Experience Survey,” available at:

September 2014).

3     Data and Sample

Our analyses rely on administrative data from the CUNY System, which includes information on first-time,

degree-seeking students’ demographic characteristics and academic outcomes. Crucially, CUNY records

students’ citizenship and immigration status for the purpose of tuition determination. Upon enrollment,

students are asked to identify themselves as US citizens, permanent residents, student or temporary visa

holders, asylees or refugees, or undocumented.11 Students must submit documentation to validate their self-

reported status and those who either report that they are undocumented or who fail to provide documentation

(e.g., current visa, temporary authorizations to live and work in the US) are recorded as undocumented. To

qualify for in-state tuition, undocumented students are required to submit a notarized affidavit stating that

they plan to legalize their status as soon as they are eligible. These students also must demonstrate that

they received their secondary schooling in New York State, either from a New York high school or GED

program.

    Our main sample consists of the 17,915 noncitizen students who obtained a high school diploma or GED

from New York State and entered an associate’s or bachelor’s degree program between fall 1999 and fall

2001.12 The characteristics of these students and the 43,159 citizens who earned a high school degree or

GED from New York State and entered college between fall 1999 and fall 2001 are displayed in the first

three columns of Table 1. Of the 61,074 students in these entry cohorts, 29 percent are noncitizens and

approximately 3 percent are undocumented.

    Compared to noncitizens, CUNY students with US citizenship are younger, more likely to be Hispanic

or White and less likely to be Asian. Citizens are also more likely to be classified as disabled at college

entry and less likely to have graduated from a New York City high school or be GED recipients. Although

citizens enter CUNY with lower high school achievement, as measured by the CUNY college admissions

average (a standardized measure of high school GPA ranging from 0 to 100), they are less likely to require

remedial classes compared to noncitizens. Finally, citizens are more likely to enter college in a bachelor’s
  11 A US citizen is an individual who either was born in the US or obtained citizenship through the process of naturaliza-

tion. Permanent residents (also known as a green card holders) are defined by the US Citizenship and Immigration Ser-
vices as “any person not a citizen of the United States who is residing the in the U.S. under legally recognized and lawfully
recorded permanent residence as an immigrant” (see the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Glossary, available at:
http://www.uscis.gov/tools/glossary). Visa holders are individuals who reside in the U.S. temporarily for a specific purpose,
typically to work or attend school. Finally, an undocumented immigrant is one who does not have legal authority to live or
work in the US. This status is achieved either by entering the country illegally, or by violating the terms of a legal visa. US
citizens and permanent residents are eligible for all forms of aid and loans from governmental and private sources. Most visa
holders are ineligible for these sources of aid, with the one exception being Cuban and Haitian entrants.
  12 Among the 83,041 degree-seeking students in these entry cohorts, we drop 5,033 (6 percent) with missing citizenship or

documentation information and an additional 455 (less than 1 percent) missing age at entry. Additionally, restricting our sample
to students who earned their high school diploma or GED in New York State excludes 375 (17 percent) undocumented students
and 8,553 (35 percent) documented noncitizens. We impose this restriction to ensure that undocumented students in our
sample were eligible for in-state tuition prior to Fall 2001 and to increase the comparability of documented and undocumented
noncitizens. Among citizens, 7,555 (15 percent) are excluded due to this restriction.




                                                               8
degree program and are less likely to initially enroll in a nonselective institution.13

    Documented and undocumented noncitizens also differ by their racial/ethnic backgrounds; undocumented

students are more likely to be Black and less likely to be White or Asian than their documented classmates.

Undocumented students are the least likely of the three groups to pursue a bachelor’s degree at entry, and

enter less selective CUNY institutions than documented noncitizens. Finally, undocumented students are

more likely to be GED recipients and less likely to be graduates of New York City high schools compared to

documented noncitizen students.

    The final three columns of Table 1 display p-values from tests of the equality of the characteristics

of citizen versus noncitizen students, undocumented versus documented noncitizens, and all three groups,

respectively. Although many of the differences in characteristics across groups are statistically significant, by

in large, these differences are small in magnitude, especially when comparing documented and undocumented

noncitizens. Appendix Tables A.1 and A.2 display the characteristics of senior and community college

students, respectively; after conditioning on college type, we find even fewer significant differences in the

characteristics of documented and undocumented noncitizen students.

    Table 1 also highlights one of the unique features of our study location. New York City is the largest

city in the US and contains a diverse student population (of both natives and immigrants). Undocumented

youth living in New York City come from all over the world, not just from Latin and South America as

is common in other regions. Thus, the responses of CUNY undocumented students to tuition shocks may

not resemble the responses of other undocumented students across the nation. We address concerns over

the generalizability of our estimates in Section 5.4 by examining whether the impact of the tuition increase

varies by race/ethnicity.



4     Empirical Framework

Our data and setting provide several advantages for estimating effects of price shocks on undocumented

students’ outcomes. First, the decision to eliminate the in-state tuition subsidy for undocumented students

appears to have been made in reaction to 9/11 and not to any patterns observed among undocumented or

documented noncitizens before fall 2001 (Rincón, 2008). Thus, there is no reason to expect undocumented

students were experiencing changes in any relevant drivers of attainment, such as financial need, courses,

institutions, or grades, relative to their documented counterparts who were not exposed to the price shock.
  13 We classify institutions’ selectivity using the Barron’s Guide, which places the following colleges in each rank: “Very

Competitive” includes Baruch; “Competitive” includes Brooklyn, City, Hunter, John Jay, and Queens; Less “Competitive”
includes Lehman; “Noncompetitive” includes City Tech, Medgar Evers, New York City College of Technology, Staten Island,
and York; “Nonselective” includes Borough of Manhattan Community College and Bronx, Hostos, Kingsborough, LaGuardia,

Second, undocumented students are ineligible for most federal, state, and private grants and loans, making

it difficult for these students to buffer the tuition hike with increased financial support from other sources.14

In addition, no exceptions to the elimination of the in-state tuition subsidy appear to have been granted, or

additional supports made available, rendering all previously-eligible undocumented students subject to the

same price increase. These unique circumstances means that our estimates will more closely measure the

theoretical effects of price shocks on postsecondary attainment than studies that examine the effect of a spe-

cific subsidy (e.g., Pell Grant aid) on the outcomes of students who have access to other potentially offsetting

resources (e.g., federal loans). Third, most surveys do not request that respondents state their immigration

status or provide documentation to validate their responses. Thus, studies that rely federal data sources,

such as the ACS or the CPS, code both undocumented students and other noncitizen immigrants (namely,

permanent residents and those with legal visas) as treatment group members, leading to measurement error

in students’ exposure to changes in tuition. Our unique data set allows us to more accurately identify the

undocumented, thereby reducing measurement error and allowing us to difference out non-price impacts on

attainment by using documented noncitizens as the control group.15

   To estimate the effects of the price shock, we focus on the three semesters surrounding the policy change

and the semester of the price shock: fall 2000 through fall 2004 (with spring 2002 at the center of the

series).16 We estimate generalized differences-in-differences models, where we allow the impact of the policy

change on attainment to have persistent effects after in-state rates were restored to undocumented students:



               Yisct = β1 T reatt × U ndoci + β2 P ostt × U ndoci + γXi + δsc + δt + τ × δc + isct                      (1)


In equation (1), Yisct is one of several attainment outcomes in semester t for student i who initially entered

college s as a member of cohort c. U ndoci is set to one if the student is undocumented and Xi is a

vector of student covariates measured in the first semester of college including indicators for documentation

status (permanent resident, student visa holder, or asylee/refugee), initial degree program (associate’s versus

bachelor’s degree), high school GPA, high school type (NYC public, NYC private, GED, or other New York

state school), need for remedial courses, disability, age, gender, race/ethnicity (Black, Hispanic, White,

or other), and single parent status. We include semester and college by cohort fixed effects, δt and δsc ,

respectively, and cohort-specific linear trends τ × δc , where τ = t − c represents semesters since entry.

Finally, under the identifying assumption that the outcomes of undocumented and documented noncitizen
  14 Undocumented students are ineligible for all federal sources of aid and loans, including the Pell and Stafford programs.

They are also ineligible for the New York Tuition Assistance Program (TAP), the New York State funded grant to low-income
students of up to $5,000.
  15 For instance, we can account for the removal of the subsidy leading noncitizens to feel unwelcome in the CUNY System.

In other settings, such “chilling effects” have been shown to alter documented noncitizens’ behavior (e.g., Watson, 2014).
  16 In Section 5.2, we show that our results are robust to larger and smaller windows.




                                                             10
students would have followed similar trends in the absence of the price increase, isct represents a random

error component. We estimate separate models for students enrolled in senior and community colleges.

Student-semester observations are dropped following degree receipt.17 Standard errors are clustered at the

cohort by college level.

    The coefficient on the interaction between the indicator for the semester of the price increase (T reatt )

and undocumented status, β1 , represents the change in attainment during the semester of the tuition hike

on the outcomes of undocumented students relative to documented noncitizens. Additionally, β2 represents

the change in outcomes for undocumented students in the semesters after the tuition hike (compared to the

semesters before the increase) relative to the same change for documented noncitizens.18

    The main identifying assumption underlying our research design is that, in the absence of the tuition

increase, the outcomes of documented noncitizen and undocumented students in the spring 2002 and the

following semesters would have followed similar trends. A possible violation of this assumption would be

underlying trends in the outcome variables that are correlated with the policy change. Examination of the

pre-policy trends in attainment, discussed in the following section, suggests that prior to the policy change,

outcomes of documented and undocumented noncitizens followed similar paths.

    In this case, an additional potential violation comes from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

These attacks had a major impact on New York City residents and institutions and may have uniquely

influenced the schooling choices of immigrant students. If the undocumented students felt disproportionately

impacted, perhaps reducing their schooling investments due to a decrease in morale or increased fear of

deportation, then observed changes in spring 2002 could be due to the terrorist attack and not to the change

in the tuition policy. Though we are unable to directly examine the academic response to 9/11, we can test

whether the policy change led to reductions in attainment among documented noncitizens relative to US

citizens. Documented noncitizens at CUNY were not subject to the new tuition policy, but they were exposed

to the post 9/11 environment and may have felt a similar level of hostility and reduction in attachment to

US institutions. As discussed in the following section, trends before and after 9/11 reveal no evidence that

documented noncitizens’ enrollment or attainment differed from that of US citizens.



5     The Impact of Tuition Increase on Attainment

To illustrate our identification strategy and preview our main results, we plot average average reenrollment

(Figure 1), credits attempted (Figure 2), and credits earned (Figure 3) of citizens, documented noncitizens,
  17 Only 2 percent of student by semester observations are dropped due to this restriction.
  18 Main effects for T reatt and P ostt are subsumed by the vector of semester fixed effects while the main effect for U ndoci is
included in Xi .



                                                               11
and undocumented students over the seven semesters surrounding the policy change.19 In each figure,

the solid black line represents the average outcomes of undocumented students, the dashed dark gray line

represents the average outcomes of documented noncitizens, and the solid light gray line represents the

average outcomes of citizens. Differences between the black and dashed gray lines before and after the policy

change will approximate our differences-in-differences estimates. In each figure, the sample in Panel A is

limited to students who initially enrolled in a CUNY senior college between fall 1999 and fall 2001, while

Panel B is limited to community college students.

    Prior to spring 2002, both documented and undocumented noncitizens who initially entered a senior

college were more likely to reenroll relative to citizens (Figure 1, Panel A). The decline in mean reenrollment

for all groups reflects decreases in persistence over time. Reenrollment rates for documented noncitizen and

undocumented senior college students are quite similar prior to spring 2002, while in spring of 2002, when

undocumented students’ tuition rates doubled, their reenrollment drops substantially. Following spring 2002,

reenrollment continues to monotonically decline for all three groups. Relative to documented noncitizens

and citizens, decreases in undocumented students’ reenrollment slow slightly after in-state tuition rates were

restored. Trends in community college students’ reenrollment - shown in Panel B - suggest that the price

shock did not alter undocumented community college students’ reenrollment relative to their documented or

citizen peers.

    Figures 2 and 3 display trends in credits attempted and credits earned, respectively. Since we do not con-

dition on enrollment, changes in credits attempted and earned will represent a combination of intensive (e.g.,

course load reductions or less effort devoted to courses) and extensive margin (e.g., dropout) responses. Doc-

umented and undocumented noncitizens attempt and earn more credits than citizens. Among senior college

students, trends in credits attempted and earned are similar for documented and undocumented noncitizens

before spring 2002. In the semester of the price increase, undocumented senior college students’ attempt and

earn fewer credits relative to documented noncitizens, suggesting that the policy change reduced both credits

attempted and earned. Following spring 2002, undocumented senior college students’ credit accumulation re-

bounds slightly, but remains lower than in the pre-spring 2002 semesters. Among undocumented community

college students, pre-spring 2002 trends in credit accumulation do not track documented noncitizens’ trends

as well as in the case of senior college students. Additionally, there is little evidence of significant decreases

in credits attempted or earned by undocumented community college students relative to their documented

peers except in the spring 2002 semester.

    The pre- and post-policy trends of US citizens and documented noncitizens reveal no substantial differ-
  19 Note that we use the term “reenrollment” as opposed to “enrollment” as the latter is typically used to refer to the decision

to pursue a degree. We also do not use the term “persistence” because we focus here on reenrollment that is not conditional on
the previous semester (later, we examine persistence rates where reenrollment in time t is conditional on enrollment in t − 1).



                                                               12
ences between these two groups in any of the figures. The absence of a difference indicates that documented

noncitizens appear not to have reacted to the tuition hike (via a chilling effect) or to the terrorist attacks of

9/11. Although the absence of a reaction to 9/11 among documented noncitizens (relative to citizens) does

not entirely rule out 9/11 as an explanation for undocumented students’ attainment decreases, it suggests

that 9/11 is unlikely to be the major cause of the changes we observe.


5.1     Impacts on reenrollment, credits attempted, and credits earned

Table 2 reports the coefficients and standard errors on the interaction of undocumented status and indicators

for the semester of the price increase (spring 2002) and semesters following the price increase (post-spring

2002) from estimation of Equation (1). We examine impacts on reenrollment (Panel A), credits attempted

(Panel B), and credits earned (Panel C). We test the equality of the estimated parameters on the interaction of

undocumented and spring 2002 and the interaction of undocumented and post-spring 2002, which provides

a test of whether the initial impacts of the price increase led to persistent reductions in undocumented

students’ attainment even after in-state prices were restored.

    The price shock led to a 7 percentage point decrease in undocumented senior college students’ reenroll-

ment, an 8 percent decline relative to fall 2001 reenrollment rates. The price shock resulted in smaller,

but significant impacts on senior college students’ reenrollment in the semesters after the tuition hike was

reversed, leading to a 3 percentage point (3 percent) decrease. The difference between the immediate and

medium-run impacts of the tuition hike on senior college students’ reenrollment suggests that either students

induced to leave college in spring 2002 by the price shock returned to school after in-state tuition rates were

restored or that approximately half of the students who initially dropped out in response to the price shock

would have left in the following semesters even in the absence of the policy change. We distinguish between

these explanations by examining whether the the probability of returning to a CUNY institution, conditional

on having dropped-out, increased among undocumented students in the post-spring 2002 semesters. We find

no evidence that undocumented senior college students who left CUNY in spring 2002 or earlier were more

likely return to college once in-state tuition rates were restored.20

    Among undocumented community college students, we find small and insignificant impacts of the price

increase on reenrollment in spring 2002 and later semesters.21 Our estimates imply a price elasticity of enroll-

ment equal to -0.06 for senior college students and -0.08 for community college students. Thus, even though

the estimated impact of the price shock on community college students’ reenrollment is substantially smaller
  20 Our point estimates, although insignificant, suggest that undocumented senior college students were 3.4 percentage points

(14 percent) less likely to return to a CUNY institution after spring 2002 (full results available upon request).
  21 We can reject the equality of the estimated impact of the price increase in spring 2002 for community versus senior college

students (p = 0.005), but the difference in the estimated impact of the price change after spring 2002 is not statistically
significant (p = 0.291).


                                                              13
than that of senior college students, because the price increase undocumented community college students

were exposed to was also small, our estimates imply a slightly larger (albeit not statistically distinguishable

from zero) price elasticity.

    Undocumented students from both senior and community colleges attempted and earned fewer credits

in spring 2002 (Table 2, Panels B and C).22 Again, we do not condition on enrollment when estimating

impacts on credits attempted and earned, therefore, our point estimates represent the combined impact

of the price increase on intensive and extensive margin responses. Undocumented senior college students

attempted 0.9 fewer credits in spring 2002 (a 10 percent decrease relative to fall 2001) and earned 0.8 (9

percent) fewer credits. Undocumented community college students attempted and earned 0.4 fewer credits in

spring 2002, representing 7 and 8 percent declines from baseline attainment, respectively. Both community

and senior college students continued to earn fewer credits even after in-state tuition rates were restored.23

The similarities between impacts on credits attempted and earned, as well as the trends shown in Figures

2 and 3, suggest that observed decreases in credit accumulation are largely driven by decreases in credits

attempted, rather than declines in course pass rates. Thus, we focus on estimating impacts on credits earned

in the remaining analyses. Estimated impacts on credits attempted quite similar (available upon request).24

    In Figures 4 and 5, we display point estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals from a

modified version of equation (1), where T reatt × U ndoci and P ostt × U ndoci are replaced with interactions

between U ndoci and a set of indicators for semesters before and after the price increase. Fall 2001 (the

semester immediately prior to the price shock) serves as the omitted category. These event study models

serve two purposes. First, we can test for differences in the trends in documented and undocumented

students’ outcomes prior to the price shock. Second, we can test how the impact of the price shock changes

in each semester after spring 2002.

    Differences in reenrollment rates between documented and undocumented senior college students are not

statistically significant before the price shock (Figure 4, Panel A). However, undocumented senior college stu-

dents are more than 5 percentage points less likely to reenroll in spring 2002 and around 3 percentage points

less likely to reenroll in fall 2002. After fall 2002, impacts on undocumented senior college students’ reenroll-

ment remain negative but are no longer statistically significant at the 5 percent level. Conversely, we find

no evidence of statistically significant decreases in enrollment of undocumented community college students
  22 We can reject the equality of the estimated impact of the price shock on credits attempted by senior versus community

college students in spring 2002 with p = 0.032. Differences in estimated impacts on credits earned in spring 2002 are not
statistically significant (p = 0.103).
  23 Impacts on credits attempted and earned in the semesters after spring 2002 are not statistically distinguishable between

senior and community college students (p = 0.400 and p = 0.520 for credits attempted and earned, respectively).
  24 We also investigate whether the impact of the price increase on senior college students differed by students initial degree

program, since some senior colleges contain both bachelor’s and associate’s degree seeking students. As shown in Appendix
Table A.3 , none of the differences in the estimated impact of the price increase by degree program are statistically significant.




                                                               14
in spring 2002 or later semesters relative to their documented peers (Panel B). Differences in reenrollment

three semesters prior to the price shock are statistically significant, suggesting that among community col-

lege students, trends in documented noncitizens’ outcomes may not provide as good a counterfactual for

undocumented students as in the case of senior college students.

   Trends in credits earned for documented and undocumented senior college students prior to the price

shock are also not statistically distinguishable (Figure 5, Panel A). Although the drop in credits earned

by undocumented senior college students relative to their documented counterparts is largest in spring

2002, statistically significant differences in credit accumulation persist for at least two semesters following

the restoration of in-state rates. Among undocumented community college students, only the spring 2002

difference in credit accumulation is statistically significant at the 95 percent level (Panel B).


5.2    Robustness tests

Tables 3 and 4 display estimated impacts on reenrollment and credits earned from additional robustness

tests. Column 1 includes estimates from models that include student fixed effects. Column 2 contains

estimates from models that use a larger window around the policy change (4 semesters) and column 3

contains estimates from models that use a smaller window (2 semesters).

   Including student fixed effects will account for student-specific time-invariant characteristics. To the

extent that students’ time-invariant unobservable characteristics are correlated with both their attainment

and exposure to the policy change, our main estimates will suffer from omitted variables bias. Conversely,

our fixed effects models use students’ own pre-treatment outcomes as their counterfactual outcome in the

absence of the policy change. In this case, documented noncitizens only allow us to identify cohort by school

and semester fixed effects, since these students experience no change in their exposure to the tuition increase.

The disadvantage of using student fixed effects is that attenuation bias due to classical measurement error

in the “treatment” variables will be exacerbated, biasing our estimates towards zero. Even if documentation

status contains minimal measurement error, our “treatment” variable will contain measurement error by

construction. This is because not all students are still enrolled in spring 2002, but we treat all students

as being affected by the price increase. The second and third robustness tests vary the size of the window

around the policy change that we use to define our sample, to show that our results are not driven by the

three semester window we use in our main specification.

   We estimate similar impacts of the price increase on undocumented students’ reenrollment using these

alternative models (Table 3). Including a larger or smaller window of semesters around the price increase

results in estimates that are quite similar to our main results. Impacts on undocumented community college



                                                       15
students’ reenrollment are insignificant in every specification. The estimated impacts of the policy change

on credits earned are also robust to these alternative specifications (Table 4). Among senior college students,

the estimates suggest that the price increase led to an 8 to 9 percent decrease in credits earned in spring 2002,

and a 5 to 6 percent decrease after the in-state subsidy was restored. Among community college students,

estimates suggest that the price increase resulted in an 5 to 8 percent decrease in credits earned in spring

2002 and a 2 to 7 percent decrease in credits earned in the following semesters.

   Finally, Fitterman Hall, part of the Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) campus, was

destroyed in the attacks, leading to a loss of one-third of BMCC’s classroom space. This shock to college

quality may have exacerbated the negative impact of the spring 2002 price increase on undocumented stu-

dents. However, in Appendix Tables A.4 and A.5, we show that our main estimates are robust to excluding

BMCC students.


5.3    Disentangling extensive and intensive margin responses to the price shock

To better understand how much of the reduction in credits earned by senior college students was driven by

decreases in reenrollment, we estimate a second set of models that condition on enrollment. We first examine

whether the policy change affected the hazard of reenrollment, defined as the probability of reenrolling in

semester t conditional on semester t − 1 enrollment (Table 5, Panel A). Consistent with the estimates

displayed in Table 2, undocumented senior college students experienced a a 7 percentage point (7 percent)

decrease in persistence in spring 2002. Among community college students, our estimates suggest that the

price increase led to an insignificant 2 percentage point (2 percent) decrease in persistence. Unlike our

unconditional reenrollment estimates in Table 2, we find no evidence of impacts on undocumented students’

persistence after spring 2002. This is to be expected since most of the reduced rates of reenrollment in the

post-spring 2002 semesters is driven by exits that occurred in spring 2002. In other words, we would not

expect students who remained enrolled in the semester of the tuition hike to be more likely to leave school

once the subsidy was reinstated.

   Next, we examine the impact of the price increase on credits earned by enrolled students (Table 5, Panel

B).25 The price increase led to an insignificant 0.2 (2 percent) decrease in credits earned by senior college

students during spring 2002. This point estimate is 23 percent of the size of the estimated impact when

we do not condition on reenrollment, suggesting that the price increase primarily reduced senior college

students’ attainment by inducing students to leave school. In the semesters after spring 2002, enrolled senior

students earned 0.3 (3 percent) fewer credits. Compared to senior college students, undocumented student

enrolled in community colleges experienced larger reductions in credit accumulation, including a 0.6 credit
 25 Separate   estimates for senior college students by initial degree program are contained in Appendix Table A.6.


                                                               16
(7 percent) decrease in spring 2002 and later semesters.26 The reductions in attainment that persist after in-

state tuition rates were restored to undocumented students could stem from several channels. First, affected

undocumented students could respond to the price increase by increasing their non-school work investments

(and lowering their course loads). Alternatively, undocumented students who reenroll following the price

increase could also be negatively selected, and thus, would have earned fewer credits even in the absence of

the policy change. We find no effect of the price shock on enrolled students’ GPA (Table 5, Panel C).27 Our

95 percent confidence intervals rule out impacts larger than a -0.13 point decrease and a 0.05 point increase

in enrolled senior college students’ GPAs and a -0.07 point decrease and 0.10 point increase in enrolled

community college students’ GPAs in spring 2002.

    The estimated impacts on credits earned and GPA capture both the effect of the policy change on

attainment and effects driven through selection into the sample of enrolled students. We use student fixed-

effects models to disentangle these two potentially offsetting effects. By including a student fixed effect

in equation (1), our results will represent within-student variation in outcomes in spring 2002 and later

semesters and exclude any contamination due to differential selection into persistence following the price

shock. As shown in Appendix Table A.7, estimates impacts on credits earned and GPA from student fixed-

effects models are quite similar to those displayed in Table 5, suggesting that the price shock had no effect

on undocumented students’ grades or credits attempted by senior college students.

    We further explore selection into reenrollment in the semester of the price shock by comparing undocu-

mented students who exited college in spring 2002 to those who exited in earlier semesters, with documented

noncitizens again serving as a counterfactual. We focus on total credits earned and cumulative GPA in

the semester before exit and limit our sample to senior college students, as we find no effect of the price

shock on undocumented community college students’ exit rates. As shown in Appendix Table A.8, relative

to documented noncitizens, undocumented students who left college in spring 2002 had higher cumulative

GPAs and had earned significantly more credits than those who left college prior to the price shock. If

anything, these results suggest that senior college students induced to leave college due to the price shock

were positively selected, on average.
  26 The difference in the estimated impact of the price increase on credits earned by initial degree program is marginally

significant (p = 0.083).
  27 We lose a small number of student by semester observations that are missing GPA (49 senior college students and 14

community college students). We find no relationship between the probability of having a missing GPA in a semester in which
the student is classified as being enrolled and the interaction between undocumented status and spring 2002 or post-spring 2002
(available upon request).




                                                              17
5.4     Heterogeneity by gender and race/ethnicity

Prior research suggests greater sensitivity to tuition supports among female compared to male bachelor’s

degree-seeking students (e.g., Dynarski, 2008; Angrist, Lang and Oreopoulos, 2009). To determine whether

the price increase had larger impacts on female undocumented students’ attainment, we estimate equation (1)

separately for male and female students. We find no evidence of heterogeneous impacts of the price change

on senior college students’ outcomes by gender (Table 6). However, among community college students, we

find marginally significant heterogeneity in the impact of the price increase on spring 2002 reenrollment by

gender. While the price increase did not significantly affect female undocumented students’ reenrollment

decisions, our estimates suggest that it led to a 5 percentage point decrease in male students’ probability

of reenrollment in spring 2002. We can reject the hypothesis that the interaction between undocumented

status and Spring 2002 is equal for male and female students with p = 0.032. However, in the semesters after

spring 2002, when in-state rates were restored, impacts on reenrollment for male versus female community

college students are not significant at conventional levels (p = 0.113). Additionally, among community college

students, we find no evidence that the price shock had differential impacts on credits earned by gender.

    Next, we test for differences in the impact of the price increase on Hispanic versus non-Hispanic stu-

dents. Undocumented students in New York City are less likely to be Hispanic than undocumented students

elsewhere in the US, therefore, this exercise allows us to determine how generalizable our results are to un-

documented students outside of the CUNY System. Again, we estimate equation (1) separately for Hispanic

and non-Hispanic students; results are displayed in Table 7. Among both community and senior college stu-

dents, undocumented Hispanic students’ experienced the largest reduction in enrollment and credits earned

in spring 2002. In the case of senior college students, differences in the impact of the price increase on credit

accumulation between Hispanic and non-Hispanic students are statistically significant (p = 0.025).28


5.5     Heterogeneity by entry cohort

Finally, we test for heterogeneous impacts of the price increase by entry cohort, separately examining students

who entered a CUNY institution in 1999, 2000, and 2001.29 Earlier cohorts potentially were able to gain

experience with college and have a better idea of whether they ultimately would be successful when the price

shock hit. Conversely, undocumented students in earlier cohorts may have exhausted more of their personal

or family resources, leaving them more vulnerable to the unexpected price shock.

    As shown in Table 8, which displays point estimates for the sample of senior college students, we find
  28 In Appendix Table A.9, we display results from models that separate non-Hispanic students into three additional categories:

Black, Asian, and White.
  29 We group students by academic rather than calendar year. Thus, students entering a CUNY institution in spring 2000 are

classified as entering college in 1999 and students who enter in spring 2001 are classified as 2000 entrants.



                                                              18
evidence of heterogeneous responses by the length of time undocumented students had potentially been

enrolled when the price shock occurred. For undocumented students who entered a senior college in 1999 or

2000, the price shock led to a 3 to 7 percentage point (5 to 7 percent) reenrollment decline in spring 2002.

However, students in these entry cohorts - who potentially had been enrolled for at least a year when the

price shock hit - experienced no lasting declines in reenrollment. The estimated impacts of the price shock

in the semesters after spring 2002 are small and insignificant. In other words, all of the students in the 1999

and 2000 entry cohorts induced to leave school due to the price shock were inframarginal. For 2001 entrants,

the immediate impact of the price shock on reenrollment - an 8 percentage point (8 percent) decrease - was

not statistically distinguishable from that experienced by earlier cohorts (p = 0.132). However, 2001 entrants

also experienced lasting declines in reenrollment. Specifically, the probability of reenrollment after spring

2001 fell by 7 percentage points (7 percent), suggesting that close to 90 percent of the students induced to

leave school by the price shock in the 2001 cohort were marginal, and would have persisted for several more

semesters had they not been exposed to the tuition increase. We can reject the equality of post-spring 2002

effects across entry cohorts with p = 0.013. We find similar patterns across entry cohorts when examining

impacts on credit accumulation. We can’t reject the hypothesis that the price shock had similar impacts on

credit accumulation in spring 2001 across entry cohorts (p = 0.224), and after the in-state tuition subsidy

was restored, only 2001 entrants experience lasting reductions in credits earned in a given semester.

   In contrast to the patterns we observe among undocumented senior college students, we find no evidence

of heterogeneous impacts of the price increase on undocumented community college students’ outcomes

across different entry cohorts (Table 9). Across all three entry cohorts, impacts on reenrollment are small

and insignificant, while impacts on credits earned are significant (or marginally significant) and of a similar

magnitude.

   To further illustrate differences in the impact of the price shock on short- and longer-run attainment,

we estimate event-study models in which we replace T reatt × U ndoci and P ostt × U ndoci in equation (1)

with interactions between U ndoci and a set of indicators for the semesters before and after the price increase

(again, fall 2001 is the omitted category). In this case, we examine impacts on total credits earned (rather

than credits earned in a given semester) up to 12 semesters (6 years) after the price shock. We graph

these coefficients and 95 percent confidence intervals for senior and community college students separately in

Figure 6. The black markers represent point estimates specific to the 2001 cohort, the hollow gray markers

represent estimated impacts for 2000 entrants, and the light gray “X” markers represent point estimates for

students in the 1999 entering cohort. The shaded areas represent the values contained by the 95 percent

confidence intervals for each set of point estimates.

   Prior to the price shock, there are no differences in cumulative credits earned between documented and

undocumented students in community or senior colleges. As shown in Panel A, undocumented students in

the 1999 entry cohort experience a small reduction in cumulative credits in spring 2001, but their credit accu-

mulation is never statistically distinguishable from credits earned by documented students. Undocumented

students belonging to the 2000 entry cohort do experience a statistically significant reduction in cumulative

credits earned relative to their documented counterparts for several semesters during and following the price

shock. However, differences in cumulative credits earned are no longer significant once five semesters after

the tuition hike have passed. Finally, students who entered college in fall 2001 experience immediate and

lasting reductions in cumulative credits earned starting in spring 2001. Even 12 semesters later, these stu-

dents have earned 6 fewer credits in total than their documented peers. As shown in Panel B, we find no

evidence of immediate or lasting impacts of the price shock on undocumented community college students’

attainment.



6     Longer-Run Outcomes and Degree Receipt

In the previous section, we show that only senior college students belonging to the 2001 entry cohort experi-

enced persistent declines in attainment following the price shock. We build upon these patterns to estimate

impacts of the tuition hike on undocumented senior college students’ long-run attainment, including cumu-

lative credits earned and degree receipt eight years after entry. To do so, we compare differences in the

outcomes of undocumented students who entered college in 1999 relative to cohorts that entered in 2000

and 2001, again using differences in documented noncitizens outcomes across entry cohorts to generate a

counterfactual:


       Yisc = α2000 U ndoci × 1 [cohort = 2000] + α2001 U ndoci × 1 [cohort = 2001] + ηXi + ψsc + νisc     (2)


Here, Yics is cumulative credits, associate’s degree receipt, and bachelor’s degree receipt eight years after

entry for student i who initially enrolled in college s as a member of cohort c. U ndoci indicates whether a

student is undocumented. The interaction between U ndoci and indicators for belonging to the 2000 or 2001

entry cohort represents the treatment we are interested in estimating, with corresponding coefficients α2000

and α2001 . The vector Xi includes the same set of controls as in our main equation and we also control for

school by cohort fixed effects, ψsc . Each observation represents a unique student and standard errors are

clustered at the school by cohort level. We limit our sample to senior college students; results pertaining to

community college students are reported in Appendix Tables A.10 and A.11.

    Our identifying assumption rules out unobservable differences between students entering college in 1999



                                                      20
and those entering in 2000 and 2001 that vary with documentation status and affect long-run attainment.

Although this assumption is fundamentally untestable, we test whether there are differences in observ-

able characteristics along these dimensions; estimates are displayed in Table 10. We find no evidence of

statistically significant changes in the observable characteristics of students by entry cohort that vary by

undocumented status and entry and we do not reject the hypothesis that the estimates are jointly insignifi-

cant (p = 0.731 for the 2000 cohort and p = 0.274 for the 2001 cohort). Finally, this approach relies on the

assumption that undocumented students who entered a senior college in 1999 were only affected by the price

shock in the short-run. If some students in this entry cohort also experienced declines in long-run attainment,

our estimates provide a lower bound of the true impacts of the price shock on long-run outcomes.

    Table 11 provides estimates from equation (2) for three samples: Panel A for all senior college students;

Panel B for senior college students who initially entered college in a bachelor’s degree program, and Panel C

for those that initially entered an associate’s degree program. Consistent with the results displayed in Panel

A of Figure (6), only undocumented students who entered college in fall 2001 accumulated fewer credits over

the long-run. Relative to undocumented students who entered college in 1999, 2001 entrants earned 7 fewer

credits (a 9 percent decrease). These impacts are driven by bachelor’s degree seeking students, who earned

8 fewer credits (a 10 percent decrease).

    The second through fourth columns present estimated impacts on degree receipt within eight years

of entry. Column 2 present estimated impacts of the price shock on receipt of any credential (including

certificates), while columns 3 and 4 focus on receipt of associate of arts or science (AA/AS) and bachelor

of arts or science (BA/BS) degrees, respectively. Again, only undocumented students who entered college

in fall 2001 experienced a reduction in long-run degree receipt. However, these impacts are substantial and

include a 10 percentage point (22 percent) reduction in receipt of any degree and a marginally significant 9

percentage point (22 percent) reduction in bachelor’s degree receipt. Impacts on bachelor’s degree receipt are

driven by bachelor’s degree-seeking students, who experienced a 12 percentage point (23 percent) reduction,

while associate’s degree-seeking senior college students were 12 percentage points (46 percent) less likely to

earn an associate’s degree within eight years of entry.



7     Conclusions

Our results suggest that CUNY’s decision to temporarily remove in-state tuition benefits reduced undocu-

mented students’ short-run attainment. Senior college students were less likely to reenroll while community

college students attempted and earned fewer credits. Senior college students who entered college the semester

prior to the price shock experienced lasting reductions in credit accumulation and degree receipt.


                                                      21
   The one semester policy change represented an $1,800 (123 percent) tuition increase for full-time senior

college students. During the semester of the price shock, senior college students’ reenrollment rates fell by

6.5 percentage points, which translates into an 8 percent decrease from the fall 2001 reenrollment rate. The

magnitude of this effect is at the upper end of recent estimates from Goldrick-Rab et al. (2012) who find

that a $1,000 increase in financial aid to Pell-eligible students increases their persistence rates by roughly 2

to 4 percentage points.

   Furthermore, undocumented students who entered a senior college the semester before the price shock

also experienced reductions in long-run attainment, including a 9 percent decrease in cumulative credits

earned and a 22 percent decrease in degree receipt eight years after entry. The latter effect implies a price

elasticity of degree receipt equal to -0.18. Although we find evidence that the tuition increase led to a

reduction in community college students’ credit accumulation in spring 2002, we find no evidence of long-run

reductions in their attainment. It is possible that the one-semester $300 price increase (which represented

only a 23 percent tuition hike) did not have lasting impacts on community college students’ ability to regain

their the credits lost in spring 2002 and graduate. Finally, we find no evidence that the tuition hike affected

undocumented students’ grades.

   While our findings suggest that the $1,800 in-state tuition subsidy substantially increases educational

attainment for highly-constrained students with limited college experience, the benefit-to-cost ratio of this

subsidy is very difficult to calculate. On the benefits side, a major question concerns the labor market returns

to a college diploma for undocumented youth who currently have no permanent legal authority to live and

work in the US. Even students who are enrolled in the DACA program have only temporary authorization

and it is unclear whether this program will become permanent legislation. While returns to a year of college

have been estimated at roughly 10 percent for an average student (e.g., Kane and Rouse 1995; Card, 1999),

undocumented college graduates may experience substantially lower returns. Though the immigration policy

regime may change in the future, the benefits of increasing the college attainment of undocumented are likely

to accrue in non-market realms. For instance, undocumented youth who obtain college diplomas may be

more civically engaged, clearly not as voters, but as consumers and participants in the informal civic and

political context (e.g., Dee 2004; Milligan, Moretti and Oreopoulos 2004). In addition, assuming these

undocumented youth are not deported, many are likely to have children who will be US citizens and who

will benefit from having college-educated parents (e.g., Currie and Moretti 2003). In sum, the subsidy is

likely to be welfare-enhancing, yet the most substantial private benefits are uncertain given these students’

lack of access to formal labor markets.

Source: CUNY administrative data. Notes: Sample includes first-time CUNY noncitizen undergraduate degree-seeking students
who belonged to the Fall 1999 through Fall 2002 entering cohorts and earned a high school diploma or GED from New York
State. Spring 2002 is represented by “0”. Each marker represents the point estimate from a modified version of equation (1),
where an indicator for undocumented status is interacted with indicators for semesters before/after spring 2002 (with fall 2001
serving as the omitted category) and the sample is limited to students who entered college in the specified semester. The thin
dashed line and shaded area represents corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals. The sample in Panel A (B) is limited to
students who initially enrolled in a senior (community) college.

Each column within a panel represents a separate regression. Clustered standard errors (institution by cohort) in parentheses;
** p<0.01, * p<0.05, + p<0.1. Reported coefficients are interactions between an indicator for whether a student is an
undocumented noncitizen at college entry and Spring 2002 and undocumented status with post-Spring 2002. All regressions
also include controls for age at entry, high school GPA (set to zero if missing), an indicator for whether a student’s high
school GPA is missing, indicators for race/ethnicity (Black, Hispanic, or White) and gender, an indicator for initial degree
program (associate’s versus bachelor’s degree), indicators for whether the student was a single parent, needed remediation,
was undocumented, or was disabled at entry, semester fixed effects, institution by cohort fixed effects, and cohort-specific time
trends. The sample of senior college students includes those who initially enrolled in Baruch, Brooklyn, City, Hunter, John
Jay, Queens, Lehman, City College of Technology, Staten Island, or York Colleges. The sample of community college students
include those who initially enrolled in Borough of Manhattan, Bronx, Hostos, Kingsborough, LaGuardia, or Queensborough
Community Colleges. Student by semester observations are dropped following degree receipt.

from New York belonging to the Fall 1999 through Fall 2002 entering cohorts who initially enrolled in Baruch, Brooklyn, City,
Hunter, John Jay, Queens, Lehman, City College of Technology, Staten Island, or York Colleges. Each column within a panel
represents a separate regression. Clustered standard errors (institution by cohort) in parentheses; ** p<0.01, * p<0.05, +
p<0.1. Reported coefficients are interactions between an indicator for whether a student is an undocumented noncitizen at
college entry and Spring 2002 and undocumented status with post-Spring 2002. See Table 2 notes for additional details.
