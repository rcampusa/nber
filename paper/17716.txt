Revolutionary transformations of industry and trade occurred from 1985 to the late-1990s – the regionalisation
of supply chains. Before 1985, successful industrialisation meant building a domestic supply chain.
Today, industrialisers join supply chains and grow rapidly because offshored production brings elements
that took Korea and Taiwan decades to develop domestically. These changes have not been fully reflected
in “high development theory” – a lacuna that may lead to misinterpretation of data and inattention
to important policy questions.

1.     INTRODUCTION
For most of the 19th and 20th centuries, “industrialized” and “rich” were synonymous. No
surprise then that development economists have long theorised about industrialization and the
role of trade in fostering it. Recent work by Rodrik (2011a, b) focuses the development
spotlight even more tightly on manufacturing.
Lindauer and Prichett (2002) distinguish three generations of development/industrialization
theories – or “Big Ideas” as they call them. The first Big Idea (1945 to 1982) was that
governments should drive industrialization; dirigiste policies are needed to get past
coordination failures created by the lumpiness of industry. Trade was necessary for importing
key inputs but relying on export markets was questionable. Export pessimism ruled the day.
The widespread failure of ‘import-substitution industrialization’ – or ISI to cognoscenti – was
brought home by the 1980s debt crises. The second-generation Big Idea – the ‘Washington
Consensus’ (1982-2002) – pursued the same goal (creating lumpy industry) with different
tactics. Governments still mattered but market forces were also critical and exports were
central to achieving scale. Import-competition was critical to ensuring market discipline.
By 2002, the second-generation Big Idea was past its sell-by-date, according to Lindauer and
Prichett. Many developing nations had followed its precepts only to see slowing or negative
growth. The good news, which Lindauer and Prichett call “puzzling”, was the roaring success
of Asia, especially China. To explain this, Paul Krugman called for a counter-counter-
revolution in “high development theory” (Krugman 1992). The world is still waiting.
As Dani Rodrik wrote: “Maybe the right approach is to give up looking for ‘big ideas’
altogether,” (Rodrik 2005); there is one “economics”, but many ways to apply it (Rodrik
2008). However, as Lindauer and Prichett pointed out: “The current nostrum of one size
doesn’t fit all is not itself a big idea, but a way of expressing the absence of any big ideas."
This paper does not propose a new Big Idea. Rather it argues that the quest for one may have
failed because high development theory overlooked the radical change in globalization that
occurred from the mid-1980s.

1.1. Globalization’s transformation
High development theorists are making the common mistake of viewing globalization as
driven by the gradual lowering of natural and man-made trade costs. This is a serious
misunderstanding. Globalization has been driven by advances in two very different
connective technologies: transportation and transmission.i
From the steam revolution till the mid or late 1980s, globalization was mostly about falling
trade costs; this was globalisation’s 1st unbundling. Since 1980, trade costs changed little but
the ICT revolution radically lowered transmission costs; this was globalisation’s 2nd
unbundling. The difference in outcomes is startling.
Figure 1 shows that up to the late 1980s, globalization was associated with rising G7 shares
of world income (left panel).ii The radical reversal since 1988 suggests that globalization is
no longer working as it was when the Big Ideas were formulated. An equally stark turnaround
was seen in the G7’s world trade share (middle panel). These G7 facts reflect a reversal of
fortunes rather than some structural break in global trends (right panel).iii

Figure 1: Globalization changed: G7 share of world income and exports

Figure 2 (left panel) shows that global manufacturing was also transformed. Until the mid-
1980s, ‘industrialized nations’ meant ‘high-wage nations’. Since then, some low-wage
nations are industrializing faster than high-wage nations.iv But the share-winners are few. Just
seven have gained more than one percentage point of world manufacturing GDP since 1970 -
- China, Korea, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Turkey, and Poland. All of the G7 are share-losers
over this period.v Apart from India, all of their manufacturing sectors are heavily involved in
the international supply chains of Japan (the East Asians) or Germany (Poland and Turkey).

Figure 2: Global manufacturing shares and trade cost trends.

The right panel of Figure 2 suggests that the standard culprit in globalization stories –
changes in trade costs – is unlikely to be guilty for the reversals. Estimated trade costs –

which encompass trade barriers and transport cost – plummeted from 1870 to 1910. They
rose till the 1940s and plummeted again up to 1980. Since then they have stabilised.
These figures make the prima facia case that globalization has changed. Baldwin (2006)
argues that globalization driven by lower ICT costs is fundamentally different than
globalization driven by lower trade costs. In the 1st unbundling (pre 1980s), international
competition occurred mainly at the level of sectors (say Japanese versus Thai cars). In the 2nd
unbundling (post-1985), international competition occurs at a finer degree of resolution – the
level of production stages (Thai cars may contain Japanese components and vice versa).
But has the changed nature of globalization impacted developing nations’ trade and
industrialization outcomes? Figure 3 shows that something seems to have changed here as
well. The left panel of Figure 3 looks at the shares of manufactures in developing nations’
exports – focusing on non-tiny nations, i.e. those with populations at least as large as a big
city like Paris.vi The bars (one per nation) show the decadal changes in the nations’ share of
exports in manufacturing (in percentage points). Here the 1985 to 1995 period stands out as
extraordinarily positive – even more so than the initial push that came during the
decolonisation period (1965-1974). The changes in manufactured export shares both before
and since have been modest by contrast.

Figure 3: The evolution of developing nations’ manufactured export shares.

The right panel focuses on the big share-winners – namely nations that had manufactured
export shares below 50% in 1970 but above 50% in 2007 (the last year before the Great
Trade Collapse).vii The 1980s to mid-1990s period was a time of ‘take-offs’ for most of these.
Another clue comes from the geography of shifting export compositions. If we again look at
nations that are not tiny and rely on manufactured exports (manufactures accounting for more
than 50% of exports in 2007-08) then a very clear pattern emerges. Some of these nations
saw their manufacturing export shares rise and others saw them fall during globalisation’s 2nd
unbundling. The winners and losers, however, are remarkably clustered geographically
around the nations that dominated world manufacturing until the second unbundling – the
US, Japan and Germany. There seems to be one group of low-wage share-winners and high-
wage share-losers around Germany, another around the US, and a third around Japan. India

Source: Lopez-Gonzales and Holmes (2011).viii

The final bit of prima facie evidence comes from the link between income levels and
participation in supply-chain trade. Lopez-Gonzales and Holmes (2011) shows empirically
that the pattern of sourcing (importing) from international supply chains are quite different
than selling intermediates (exporting) to them. The sourcing share rises up to about $25,000
                                                                                                                 5
and then declines (Figure 5, left panel). Selling intermediates falls for low income levels but
rises beyond a point near $15,000 (right panel). Combining the two measures, a nation’s total
involvement in supply-chain is tilde shaped.
While this research is very recent and need further testing, the top-line message is very
intuitive. When a nation like China moved up from making clothing to assembling electronics
and machinery, the import content of its exports rises, but at the other extreme, a nation like
Finland has all but exited from the fabrication end of manufacturing, so domestic value added
content of its exports tends to be higher.
These charts paint a picture of two transformations: one in globalization itself, and one in
developing nations’ experiences with industrial exports. The next task is to suggest how the
two might be connected.

1.2. Building versus joining a supply chain
When ISI policies worked – as they did for the US, Germany, Japan, etc. (Clemens and
Williamson 2004) – industrialization meant building the whole supply chain at home. This
took decades due to learning-by-doing in creating and coordinating the vast array of
necessary competencies. Given the simple communication technology available at the time,
extreme proximity was essential to coordinating sophisticated manufacturing processes. All
the stages of production had to be inside a single factory or industrial district. Most of the
necessary competencies had to exist domestically; no nation could be competitive without
building a broad and deep industrial base – a hurdle that precious few nations could
surmount.
The radical change in globalization – globalization’s 2nd unbundling – upended this
touchstone fact. The ICT revolution made it feasible to spatially separate some stages of
production without much loss in efficiency or timeliness. Once feasible, scale economies and
comparative advantage made separation inevitable – especially unskilled labour-intensive
stages given the vast international wage differences. In 1985, for example, Japanese wages
were 40 times higher than Chinese wages even though Shanghai was close to Japan’s
automobile hub – just a few days by sea and a few hours by air.
The top-line implications for trade and industrialization are threefold.
      First, with globalization operating at the level of production stages rather than at the
       level of sectors, industrialization became less lumpy and thus easier.
Nations could industrialize by joining a supply chain.
      Second, as firms with advanced manufacturing know-how offshored some stages,
       they moved their know-how along with the production.
Managerial and technical know-how became more internationally mobile. After all, the off-
shored stages of production had to mesh seamlessly and evolve in tandem with the rest of the
production network. This ‘technology lending’ – which is very different from the 1970s
‘technology transfer’ – could create advanced manufacturing activity in a developing nation
in a matter of months. Developing nations no longer had to follow Korea’s decade-long slog
up the value chain (a feat that dozens of developing nations tried and failed before the 2nd
unbundling).
      Third, distance matters more in supply chains (Gamberoni et al 2010).
Even with today’s ICT, coordinating a production network involves some face-to-face and
face-to-machine interactions. Technicians and managers must travel from the advance-
                                                                                                  6
technology headquarter nations to the developing host nation. And this must be quick; if
something goes wrong, the whole production network may suffer until the failing node is
back on line. This is perhaps one reason why we see most production networks concentrated
in low-wage nations that are near, or even contiguous with high-technology nations,
especially the US, Japan and Germany (Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzales 2012).

1.2.1. Big-Ideas development theory and international supply chains
Given these stylised facts and widespread discussion of international supply-chains, it is
surprising that supply-chains have not played a greater role in ‘high development’ theory.
Take, for example, the Spence Growth Commission (2008). The Commission’s factual basis
rests on 13 success stories. Every single case started well before globalization’s 2nd
unbundling in the mid-1980s. The Report’s lessons are all very sensible – good governance,
judicious use of domestic and global markets, etc. – but it seems rather brave to suggest that
lessons from Japan’s and Korea’s industrialization in the 1970s and 1980s can be applied to
the world of international value chains (Cattaneo et al 2011).ix Specifically, leading
development models continue to view industry as purely national. They assume that national
production is a package containing only the nation’s productive factors and technology.x As it
turns out, it is rather easy to integrate globalization’s 2nd unbundling into a simple version of
the canonical high development frameworks.
High development theory starts from the presumption that something is stuck (Harrison and
Rodrigues-Clare 2010). A nation has not developed modern industry but could, so market
forces must be supplemented by direct government action (first Big Ideas like Big Push and
ISI), or by removing the barriers that had hereto prevented otherwise profitable
industrialization (Washington Consensus). The deep economic logic in both cases turns on
multiple-equilibrium economics.
                                                 nd
       Successful development policy before the 2     unbundling
To fix ideas, consider the simplest general equilibrium model with multiple equilibriums (the
model here is a simplified version of the one in Harrison and Clare-Rodrigues 2009). Assume
a small open economy with a single productive factor and two sectors, one of which is
marked by external economies of scale (EES). The perfectly competitive, numeraire sector
(call it A), produces under constant returns. The perfectly competitive manufacturing sector
(call it M) produces one unit of output with aM units of labour, but aM falls as total
employment in the sector rises due to EES. Thus:
                                LM         2
                         QM       ; aM      ,            Q A  L  LM
                                aM        LM                                                 (1)
                         SVMPLM  pLM /  ,            VMPLA  1
Where QM , LM and aM are output, labour employed and the unit labour input coefficient in M;
 (a mnemonic for Marshallian) is the EES parameter and  (a mnemonic for backwardness)
governs the nation’s native comparative advantage in M (units are choose so the unit input
coefficient of A is unity). SVMPLM and p are the ‘social’ value of the marginal product of
labour (i.e. including EES) and the domestic relative price of M, respectively. VMPLA is the
value of the marginal product of labour in A.
The model can be solved graphically with the help of Figure 6. The state variable is LM and
the left figure shows the tendency of labour to move between the two sectors assuming the
migration of the Krugman (1991) type. When LM is below L’M, competitive wages are higher
in the A sector so the equilibrium is at point A and LM=0. If LM is above L’M, wages are
higher in manufacturing so the equilibrium is at M. Liebenstien (1957) calls the unstable
                                                                                            7
equilibrium U the ‘critical minimum effort’; L’M measures the lumpiness of industry and thus
the difficulty of industrializing.
Real incomes are higher in M, so the goal of development/industrialization policy would be
to shift to point M, a nation that is stuck at point A. For instance, temporary protection that
raised p and thus SVMPLM above VMPLA at LM=0 (dashed line) would shift labour to M.
Once LM passes the critical minimum effort, protection can be removed; the market will
complete the nation’s industrialization. This is how ISI was supposed to work.
In trade terms, this is a Ricardian model with an endogenous aM. Under A and M
equilibriums, the nation’s comparative advantages are in A and M respectively. This is shown
with the ‘private’ (i.e. ignoring EES) production possibility frontiers (PPFs) in the right
panel.

The very intuitive condition for multiple equilibriums to exist – and thus for ISI succeed – is
that SVMPLM is above VMPLA at LM = L, namely:
                                                   p
                                                        L 1                                          (2)
                                               
This requires that that nation’s native comparative advantage (as measured by p/w) is not
too bad, and/or that Marshallian spillovers (as measured by ) are sufficiently important, and
the nation is not too small (as measured by L) to realize sufficient EES.
        2nd unbundling: Making industry less lumpy and industrialization easier
This approach pushes the Marshallian spillovers into a black box – a reasonable modelling
strategy before globalization’s 2nd unbundling. To allow for international supply chains, we
introduce intermediate goods in a way that mimics the previous model as closely as possible.
Specifically, we maintain all the assumptions except those concerning the M-sector
technology. Now M is produced from differentiated varieties with an Either-style, CES
production function, and the market structure is Dixit-Stigliz monopolistic competition.
                                          
                                               1
Specifically QM  n D x1D1 /   n F x1F1 /  11 /  where the subscripts denote domestic, D, and
foreign, F, varieties (number, n, and quantity, x) and  > 1 is the elasticity of substitution.
Using the well-known Dixit-Stiglitz properties, it is easy to show that:



                                                                                                        8

                                  2F                  
where F is the Dixit-Stiglitz fixed cost and  > 0 is a collection of parameters related to the
optimal mix of varieties. It is easy to show that if  = 2 and nF = 0 (i.e. no unbundling of
production), this model is identical to the previous one with  = 1/F.
The impact of allowing international supply chains is immediately obvious from the formula
for SVMPLM. The ability to employ foreign varieties in the domestic production processes
(i.e. nF > 0) raises the social value of labour’s marginal product in manufacturing. Looking at
Figure 6, we see this lowers the ‘critical minimum effort’ (i.e. the U equilibrium shifts left).
What this means in practice is that industry is less lumpy and industrialization is easier.
       Additional considerations
For simplicity’s sake, we’ve assumed that the developing nation’s comparative advantage in
every variety is identical. Given the range of factor intensities in various production stages, it
seems quite likely that the developing nation has a greater comparative advantage in some
varieties. Before production unbundling, what mattered was the average comparative
advantage across all varieties so assuming them all equal entailed no loss in clarity. After
unbundling, however, the nation can specialise in varieties where its technological
disadvantage is least marked, so the symmetry misses an important gateway to
industrialization.
Hereto we have been agnostic as to whether M is a final good or simply one component of a
larger production process. If we added more structure, say M being a final good that involves
two components, unbundling can even further reduce the ‘minimum critical effort’ since now
the nation could industrialize by making only one of the components and exporting it into an
international supply chain. Before unbundling, the nation had to make both. If the unbundling
of production stages goes far enough, the minimum critical effort might be so low as to be
within the reach of individual firms from advanced technology nations.
Finally, the ICT revolution made it safer for firms with sophisticated know-how to combine
their competencies with low-cost labour in a developing nation. For example, if the
developing nation does join an international supply chain, the advanced technology firm
behind the network has an incentive to lower its costs by combining advanced technology
with developing nation labour, i.e. lowering the parameter  and thus make industrialization
even less lumpy by shifting equilibrium U to the left.
Distance may matter more in a slight extension of this set up. As mentioned above, even with
today’s ICT, coordinating a production network still involves some face-to-face and face-to-
machine interactions that require technicians and managers to travel from the advance-
technology home nation to the developing host nation. This is perhaps one reason we see
most production networks concentrated in low-wage nations that are near high-technology
nations US, Japan and Germany (Johnson and Noguera 2012, Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzalez
2012).

1.3. Why the difference matters
The role of governments, trade, and multinationals is completely different when a nation
joins a supply chain. Two points:
      Industrialization is easier and faster; but
      Industrialization is less meaningful.
                                                                                                   9
It became faster and easier since the supply chain makes industry less lumpy and less
interconnected domestically; it became less meaningful for the same reasons. That Korea
could export domestically-designed car engines was a testimony to its rich-nation status.
Now, exporting sophisticated manufactured goods is no longer the hallmark of having
arrived. It may simply reflect a nation’s position in an international supply chain.
Moreover the challenges facing policy makers are quite different. Under the 20th century
view of industry, a deep industrial base was a prerequisite for export success, but a large
market was necessary to support the industrial base. The search for markets was thus a key
element of trade and industrialization policy. With international supply-chains, however,
demand is easy to find. Instead, policy makers face many new questions: Which supply
chains should be joined? Should nations strive to set up their own international production
networks? What is the optimal technology policy (intellectual property rights, etc.)? What is
the role of size; can smaller nations do what China has done on forced technology transfer?
Different nations are trying different things without guidance from formal models that
explicitly incorporate supply chains.
This lacuna at least partly accounts for why Big Ideas don’t fit all cases. It is easy to see how
a comparison between Brazil and China is puzzling when one ignores supply chains.
        China – which is physically in the middle of ‘Factory Asia’ – is not using Chinese
         factors of production, Chinese technology, or relying on Chinese policy for most of
         Chinese exports.
        The Chinese content of its ‘processing exports’ is less than 20% (Ma and Van Assche
         2010), and this type of trade accounts for more than half of the nation’s boom in
         manufactured trade.
Of course China-specific factors also matter, but if you want to fully understand Chinese
export success, you have to look at the productive factors, technology, and government
policies of Japan, Korea, Taipei, and ASEAN nations – that is where many of the critical
components, and most of the design, marketing, and management expertise lie.
        Brazil is too far from ‘Factory North America’ and ‘Factory Europe’ to enjoy such a
         free ride.
Most goods Brazil exports depend solely on Brazilian inputs, technology and policies.

1.4. Plan of the paper
The next section briefly recalls the main outlines of globalization’s 1st and 2nd unbundlings to
set the stage for an illustrative case study (autos) in Section 3. Section 4 seeks to crystallise
the economic logic linking trade and industry when industrialization meant building a supply
chain. Section 5 extends the framework to allow explicit consideration of supply chains, their
internationalization, and the role of multinationals. The penultimate section explores why the
difference between building and joining a supply chain matters. Section 7 looks at the
implications for multilateral cooperation and the last section presents the concluding remarks.

2.       GLOBALIZATION AS TWO UNBUNDLINGS
Globalization is not a smooth process driven by lower natural and manmade trade costs.
Globalization made a giant leap when steam power slashed shipping costs; and advanced in
the post-war period when trade barriers erected in the inter-war years were reduced. It made
another when ICT decimated coordination costs. The implications of the two are dramatically
different; understanding why requires a bit of background.xi
                                                                                            10
2.1. Steam revolution and the 1st unbundling
When clippers and stage coaches were high-tech, few items could be profitability shipped
internationally. This forced the geographical bundling of production and consumption; each
village had to make most of what it consumed (central illustration in Figure 7). Steam power
changed this by radically lowering transport costs (Figure 8, left panel).
         Railroads and steamships made it feasible to spatially separate production and
          consumption.
         Once the separation was feasible, scale economies and comparative advantage made it
          inevitable.
This was globalization’s 1st unbundling. Trade theory was developed to understand its
economic impact.
The 1st unbundling created what might seem to be a paradox – production clustered into
factories and industrial districts even as it dispersed internationally (Figure 7). The paradox is
resolved with three points: i) cheap transport favoured large-scale production, ii) such
production is very complex, and iii) close proximity lowers the cost of coordinating
complexity. Consumption clustered in cities for reasons that do not concern this paper.

Thoughtful readers will have already guessed what the 2nd unbundling involves. To set the
scene, however, consider the forces that produced the local clustering of production.

ICT revolution and the 2nd unbundling
Why does the production of goods and services cluster within buildings and factories? Think
of a stylized factory with the production stages as schematically illustrated in Figure 7.
Coordinating the manufacturing process demands continuous, two-way flows among the bays
of goods, people, training, investment, and information (double-headed arrows). As
productivity-enhancing exchanges keep the process in flux, the flows never die down.
Plainly some of proximity’s cost-savings are related to communications. As
telecommunications became cheap, reliable, and widespread from the mid-1980s, the
‘coordination glue’ began to loosen. Telecom advances united with vast strides in computing
power, transmission capacities, and software to create the information and communication
technology (ICT) revolution.xii
       It became increasingly economical to geographically separate manufacturing stages –
        to unbundle the factories.
       Once the separation was feasible, scale economies and comparative advantage made it
        inevitable.
This is the globalization’s 2nd unbundling; production stages previously performed in close
proximity are dispersed to reduce production costs. Theories to understand its implications
are only now emerging.xiii

The unbundling, however, is not global. It is regional. Take for example the North American
auto industry. “During the 1950s, three-quarters of all auto parts were made in or near
Michigan, whereas the state is now responsible for only one-quarter” (Klier and Rubenstein
2008). Figure 9 shows that today many parts plants are no longer in Michigan but they are
clustered within a 1000 kilometres radius. The plants further afield, for example in Mexico,
                                                                                              12
are themselves clustered. This is one of the clues on why distance is so important in
international supply chains.
The timing of the 2nd unbundling has not been definitively identified. The right panel of
Figure 8 shows ICT indicators that suggest the shock that created it unrolled from say, 1985
to the late 1990s; I take 1985 to 1995 to be concrete. Transport costs jumped around a bit
during this period (oil prices), but were on average unchanged since the mid 1970s (left
panel, Figure 8).

2.2. Transformed international commerce
The 2nd unbundling transformed trade for a very simple reason. Production dispersion did not
end the need to coordinate production stages – it internationalized it (rightmost illustration in
Figure 7). This gave rise to 21st century trade – the heart of which might be called the trade-
investment-services-intellectual property (IP) nexus (Baldwin 2011). Specifically, the nexus
reflects the intertwining of: i) trade in parts and components, ii) international movement of
investment in production facilities, personnel training, technology, and long-term business
relationships, and iii) services to coordinate the dispersed production, especially
infrastructure services such as telecoms, internet, express parcel delivery, air cargo, trade-
related finance, customs clearance, etc.
The most radical change in terms of theory and outcomes was the way the 2nd unbundling
made it easy for rich-nation firms to combine the high technology they developed at home
with low-wage workers abroad. The first examples came in 1985 across the US-Mexico
border (Hanson and Feenstra 1997) and within East Asia (Ando and Kimura 2005). This
created an important distinction – what might be called 20th versus 21st century trade.
      20th century trade is the selling of goods made in factories in one nation to customers
       in another; the trade system is largely about demand, i.e. selling things.
In this world, goods are ‘packages’ of a single nation’s productive factors, technology, social
capital, governance capacity, etc. Of course, 20th century trade is still with us.
      21st century trade involves continuous, two-way flows of things, people, training,
       investment, and information that used to take place within factories and offices; the
       trade system is also about supply, i.e. making things.
Goods are ‘packages’ of a many nations’ productive factors, technology, social capital, and
governance capacity; a nation’s trade pattern is inseparable from its position in the supply
chain. Comparative advantage shifted from a very national concept to a much more regional
concept as predicted by the analysis of Deardorff (2005).

2.3. Transformed industrialization
The 2nd unbundling also transformed industrialization. Before the ICT revolution and the 2nd
unbundling, the nation needed all three Figure 7 production bays inside the country. After the
2nd unbundling, advanced-nation firms offshored labour-intensive segments of their supply
chain to developing nations.
This completely changed the industrialization process in the developing nations that received
these offshored stages. Stage B arrived with everything needed to export – world-class
technology, management, quality control, a ready-made market, etc. All the developing
nation had to add was reasonably reliable workers, a hospitable business environment, and
proximity to an advanced technology nation willing to offshore some of its factories. Note
that proximity matters greatly since key personnel must still visit the offshored factory, so

                                                                                               13
being within an easy day’s travel is a tremendous advantage (Figure 9).
At first this was limited to export processing zones (EPZs) and ‘triangle trade’ (e.g. Japan
ships computer parts for assembly to China which ships the final good to Europe). As cost
pressure led to growing specialisation and scale, multiple developing nations were folded into
the supply chain. This is clearest in East Asia where it can be seen in the 1985 versus 2000
Asian Input-Output tables constructed by Japan’s IDE-JETRO (Table 1). Each element shows
the column-nation’s share of manufactured intermediates that is purchased from the
corresponding row-nation.

In 1985, the matrix was simple. Most developing East Asian nations supplied most of their
own intermediates (diagonal of top panel). The rest was imported from advanced nations (the
shaded rows). By 2000, the diagonal elements were way down; cross-country reliance was
way up. Countries like Thailand and China were supplying lots of intermediates to fellow
developing nations. This is ‘Factory Asia’ (Baldwin 2008).

3.      SUGGESTIVE CASE STUDY: THE AUTO INDUSTRY
To bring down the level of abstraction, this section turns to examine a case study: how the 2nd
unbundling transformed trade and industrialization in East Asia’s auto sector.

3.1. Import substitution in autos
Development economists’ first big idea – import substitution – was commonly viewed as
                                                                                                            14
having an easy bit and a hard bit. The easy bit was to generate production of ‘light’
manufactures, such as clothing and shoes. It was easy in the sense that Liebenstien’s ‘critical
minimum effort’ was low enough for even small nations to get past. The hard bit was moving
up to ‘heavy’ industry like chemicals and machinery (Balassa 1981, Essay 1). Among the
favourite second-stage import substitution targets was the automobile industry. This is odd.
Even in the 1970s, making an automobile required a massively complex network of suppliers,
and a broad array of advanced technologies, advanced management capacities, and a skilled
workforce – exactly the wrong entry-level industry one might think. Why then was it such a
favourite among development planners?
The answer is that the advanced-nation car producers helped them contrive the appearance of
an auto industry. The trick is so-called complete knock-down kits, often shortened to CKD.
“Nearly all kits come from home country plants, where the parts are taken off the assembly
line and ‘consolidated’ in shipping containers for transport to CKD assembly plants,”
(Sturgeon 1998). The assembly plant then puts together the pieces and presto! The nation can
pretend it has a car industry. The developing nation’s assembler was almost always a joint
venture with the advanced-nation kit producer.xiv

Assembly, of course, was only meant to be the first step. According to ISI theory, local
assembly would create local demand for auto parts and this world create local parts suppliers.
The developing nations would build the whole supply chain working from downstream to
upstream. Local content requirements were designed to encourage this. Given the
sophistication of the components and lack of local competency, firms typically met local
content restrictions by repeating the charade for components (local content rules were
typically defined in gross cost, not value added).
Importantly, the whole system was rigged to prevent the infant industry from growing up.
The advance-nation partner companies had no interest in creating new competitors.
Malaysia’s first national car, the Proton Saga, bore a striking resemblance to the Mitsubishi
Lancer Fiore (Figure 10), was built on the Lancer platform, and contained a Lancer engine
(Rosli 2006). It is easy to see why Mitsubishi had little interest in the Saga becoming an
export success.

3.2. Korean success story
Of all the developing nations that played this game, only Korea managed to build its own
supply chain, introduce original models, and become competitive in world markets. The story
has been told many times.xv From 1962, the Ministry of Trade and Industry used all the tools
of industrial policy – subsidised loans, tax breaks, distorted tariff schedules, import bans, etc.
– to develop a car industry via import substitution.
                                                                                                15
Korea started with assembly, but multinationals were forced to accept weaker positions than
usual; control was handed to chaebols – family-owned conglomerates (Amsden 2001). Four
firms were established in the first big push: Shinjin, Hyundai, Asia Motors, and Kia. The second
big push came as part of the Heavy and Chemical Industries Project (1973). This required the
companies to submit plans for a low-cost car whose specifications, timetable, and costs were
laid down by the government. The result was Korea’s first home-designed car – Hyundai’s
Pony – and a Mazda-designed car by Kia called “Brisa”. Local content of these reached 85%,
but major components were still imported (Green 1992).
Hyundai’s Pony enjoyed huge success at home, selling almost 300,000 units by 1982; it also
achieved limited success abroad (about 15% of production was exported, Ravenhill 2001).
Industry output rose more than tenfold by the end of the decade. On the back of this success,
another big push came in 1978. Massively ambitious government-set production goals
encouraged Korean firms to make big new investments, but the global 1980-83 recession
hindered these plans and brought the companies near to bankruptcy. The Ministry of Trade
and Industry led a restructuring and reorientation of the industry; scale was to be achieved by
exporting to the US (the only market that was big enough and open enough). The Ministry
also targeted quality upgrading and Korean companies invested heavily in new production
facilities. They negotiated new alliances with major automobile and automobile parts makers
for plant layout, body design, the supply of major components, and access to marketing
channels. Hyundai also set up its own dealer network in the US and Canada. Most of this was
debt financed.xvi

With this high-volume, Korean automakers pushed further up the supply chain. By the early
1990s, they were producing engines, transmissions, chassis, and brakes with their own
technology. Two other highly sophisticated components where brought into the local supply
chain in 1996 (the Engine Control Unit, and the Transmission Control Unit).
The nature of this success story was completely transformed by the 1997 Asian crisis. From
the mid-1980s until the end of the 1990s, Korean exports were dominated by cars (left panel,
                                                                                                                       16
Figure 11). Now however the Korean auto industry is a full-fledged participant in the
international supply chains. Yet because they built a supply chain before the 2nd unbundling,
Korea is a headquarter economy rather than a factory economy. As Figure 11 shows, its
exports of cars and car parts are booming, along with its imports of parts. For example, Korea
is an important exporter of engines, but an important importer of the ignition wiring sets used
in those engines (right panel).

3.3. Malaysia’s failure and Thailand’s success
Until 1982, Malaysian auto industrialization focused on kit assembly. The already small
market was shared by more than a dozen assemblers. “The resulting market fragmentation
made it difficult for components producers to achieve economies of scales, thus, the locally
produced parts and components were expensive. This hindered the further localization;: in
1979, the average local content achieved was merely 8 per cent” (Fuangkajonsak 2006).
Policy became radically more state-directed under Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed. In
1981, he established the government-owned Heavy Industries Corporation of Malaysia
(HICOM) which aimed to establish a Japanese-like fully integrated automobile industry, i.e.
to build the whole supply chain. A ‘national car project’ – Proton – was launched as joint
venture with Mitsubishi (HICOM held 70% of the shares).
Unfortunately, the first fruit of this effort (the Saga, Figure 10) appeared in 1985 – the year
the 2nd unbundling started to destroy the economic foundations of single-nation automobile
production.xvii Tariffs and taxes meant that the Saga was 20-30% cheaper than similar models
domestically (Fujita 1999); its market share rose to 73% (Uzir Mahidin and Kanageswary,
2004). Exports started in 1989, mostly to Britain under the GSP scheme which allowed in up
to 14,000 units duty free; these were sold below the Malaysian domestic price (Wad and
Chandra 2011 p.166).
Proton upgraded from assembling imported key components and parts to manufacturing them
locally. Localization efforts, however, did not go smoothly. Saga continued to rely on
Mitsubishi for technology and design. Despite its local and export success, Proton’s sale-
volumes remained small by industry standards (under 100,000 units per year for all models).
A second big push came in the 1990s as Proton introduced new models and produced them
with varying engine sizes;. Malaysian production more than doubled from 1990 to 1997.
Proton’s plans, however, were even more ambitious. It announced a new project, ‘Proton
City’, which would become an integrated automobile manufacturing city with a production
capacity rising to 250,000 units in 2003. During this Proton expansion, a second national car
company was set up (Perodua a joint venture with Daihatsu that produced a modified
Daihatsu Mira called the Kancil).
For many governments, the 1997 Crisis was the moment they realized that the ISI dream was
over. Building a supply chain, like Japan and Korea had done, was not optimal and indeed
not possible after the 2nd unbundling. Quite simply, offshoring had killed import substitution.
The Malaysian government, however, persisted in pursuing its 1980-era strategy as far as
possible. Perodua was sold to its Japanese partner, but Proton was re-nationalised in 2000 and
the new, highly advanced plant was completed (Tanjung Malim, with a production capacity
of 500,000 vehicles per year).
Proton introduced the first Malaysian-designed car – the Waja (Impian in Britain) – with the
help of technology it acquired when it bought the British car company Lotus. Proton moved
up the value chain to manufacturing its own engine in 2002. Given the high costs of parts
production, Proton’s domestic market share continues to fall into 2010. Much of its
production capacity is idle. The government is looking for a foreign partner for Proton.
                                                                                           17
After four decades of import substitution, Malaysian auto sector employment was about
50,000 – 70% of whom are working for Proton or Perodua, and about 80% are unskilled
labourers (Wad and Chandra 2011).

3.3.1. Thailand
Thailand’s 1960s auto-industrialization plan also aimed for the whole supply chain, starting
with CKD assembly. The Thai Board of Investment provided incentives that attracted
automakers from the US, Japan, and Europe (Fujita 1999). Thailand raised local content
requirements and effective rates of protection progressively. Japanese part suppliers
established production in Thailand at the request of Japanese assemblers, thus recreating the
close corporate ties that had long existed in Japan. Japanese assemblers also developed their
own Thai supplier networks by helping local part firms raise their quality via technical
assistance (Techakanont 2008).
The economic slowdown and the progressive raising of the local content led GM, Ford, and
Fiat to withdraw in the early 1980s just before Thailand’s GDP growth took off. The
booming domestic vehicle sales from 1987 came just as Japanese auto companies embraced
the 2nd unbundling. Unlike Malaysia, Thailand abandoned the old wave to ride the new wave.

Trade and ownership restrictions were relaxed, but some local content rules were tightened.
For example, the Engine Production Promotion Scheme required engine assemblers to use
only engine parts that had undergone specific local processing.xviii Given the small market for
each producer compared to the minimum efficient scale, various Japanese joint ventures
collaborated on the local production of the five compulsory parts (Techakanont 2008). The
implementation of advanced technology in local factories enhanced Thai industrial capacities.
Another unique policy move was the concentration on one market segment – light pickup
trucks and vans. Domestic taxes shifted domestic demand heavily towards these (more than
60% sales inside in Thailand) and this was mirrored in Japanese FDI patterns, and later in
export patterns.
The next step was exporting – a goal that the Thai government had embraced since the mid-
1980s. However rather than intervening directly, the government sought to convince Japanese
companies that it would avoid the sort of techno-nationalism policy that hindered FDI in
Malaysia. The 1993 ‘Export Promotion Project’ also provided incentives for assembling
                                                                                                                                                                                                      18
automobiles for export (tariff exemptions on parts, an 8-year tax holiday, etc.). Local content
restrictions were eliminated in 1998 and tariffs and excise taxes were liberalised in 1999. The
Thaksin government introduced a bevy of incentives aimed at creating the ‘Detroit of the
East’. This worked.

3.4. Comparison of outcomes
Differences in results only show up dramatically after the 1997 Crisis (Wad 2009); Figure 12.
           Thailand embraced the 2nd unbundling and strove to become part of the global supply
            chains of as many giant auto firms as it could;
           Malaysia persisted with its 1980s strategy of emulating what Korea did in the 1980s
            and Japan did in the 1970s.
Figure 12 and Figure 13 show which strategy worked best. Malaysia is running a wide and
growing deficit in both vehicles and parts; Thailand has a large surplus in vehicles and
approximate balance in parts (Figure 13).
The results in terms of employment are equally stark. By the mid-2000s, there were over
180,000 workers in the Thai auto industry compared to 47,000 in Malaysia (Wad and
Chandra 2011).

4.          TRADE, INDUSTRIALIZATION & THE 1ST UNBUNDLING
Having argued that trade and industrialization were transformed, it is time to be more
specific, to lay out a model where the logical relationships can be understood in their entirety.
The first step is to present a framework that captures the basic elements of traditional ISI
thinking (this section). The framework is then extended to consider supply chains (Section 5).

4.1. Industrialization before the 2nd unbundling
When coordination costs were high enough to keep manufacturing bundled into factories;
theorists could safely ignore supply chains. The focus was on lumpiness and complexity (e.g.
Clare-Rodriguez 1996, and Rodrik 1995). Their basic points can be made graphically.

4.1.1. Great Britain versus the rest
Lumpiness of industry comes with external economies of scale and we capture complexity by
                                                                                                                            19
assuming that the external economies are linked to the nation’s range of industrial
competencies.xix Nations are not endowed with competencies; creating a new competency
requires a fixed investment of labour. The diagram (Figure 14) reflects these keystone
assumptions. The salient points are: i) industry’s marginal-cost curve is downward sloped
(external economies mean that the broader is a nation’s range of competencies the lower is its
marginal cost); ii) traditional manufacturing techniques (cottage industry) are not subject to
scale economies of any kind, so its marginal cost is flat (second to top line).

Figure 14: 20th century industrialization.

The world price of industrial goods is shown as pzw, but this is not the price of imports inside
the nation as two wedges intervene: the natural trade costs captured by  (a mnemonic for
transport costs), and the domestic tariff factor, Tz. (NB: when transport is costless  = 1; when
tariffs are zero, Tz = 1.) The domestic price is thus the highest line (we assume the nation has
tariffs high enough to make cottage industry profitable). Natural and manmade barriers also
lessen the attractiveness of exporting, hence the net price received by exporters (the bottom
line) shows the world price divided by  and Tz* (1 plus the foreign tariff).
The two price lines partition the horizontal axis three ways. From left to right:
       Poverty trap: here steady-state competencies are so low that domestic modern firms
        cannot compete with domestic cottage industries.
       Stagnant infant: The supply of competencies allows modern industry to out-compete
        handicrafts, but domestic industry cannot compete abroad.
       Export success: The supply of competencies is high enough to make exporting
        worthwhile.
Before the 1st unbundling really got going, only Britain was in the third box; Germany and
India were in the middle range; many were in the poverty trap.
The question within the diagram – and a linchpin issue facing developing country
policymakers – is: What determines a nation’s steady-state range of competency? The market
alone cannot answer this; lumpiness and complexity create multiple equilibriums.
                                                                                        20
Industrial competencies are demanded by industry, so if there is no industry, there is no
demand, and thus no supply of competencies (“poverty trap”). In the second partition,
demand for a nation’s competencies is, so to speak, limited by the extent of the market – the
domestic market that is. Big nations will have big protected industries and thus a wide range
of competencies. Small nations will remain uncompetitive. In the third partition, the nation’s
industry has become “the workshop of the world”. Demand for its competencies is large,
almost boundless since it is linked to world consumption, not domestic consumption, and
this, in turn, supports the large supply of competencies.
This means that there are two bifurcations that might require a big push to get past. No
industry to some modern industry, and domestic sales only to exporting. A complete model
will require a full description of the dynamic process that creates competencies, but here we
stick with more informal analysis.

4.1.2. The 1st unbundling
The steam revolution shifts the two price lines toward each other (dashed red lines in Figure
14) by lower . This widens the first and third partitions at the expense of the second. Some
of the nations, like Germany, become export-competitive.xx Others, like India, now found
themselves in the poverty trap.
For the winners, like Germany, the extra demand for competencies generated by export sales
boosted demand for and thus supply of competencies. The opposite happened to India. This
was the beginning of the big divergence (see Krugman and Venables 1995 for the static
economic geography version; Baldwin, Martin and Ottaviano 2001 for a formal growth
model of take-off and divergence).

4.1.3. Big Push, failed ISI, outward orientation, Dutch Disease, etc.
Trade policy’s role in traditional development thinking jumps right out of the diagram.
Getting from the first partition to the second requires i) investment in competencies starting
without demand, ii) demand without any local capacity to satisfy it, or iii) coordinated
appearance of the two. Getting past this was the focus of so-called Big Push development
strategies. When the world was like this, import-substitution industrialization could make
sense for sufficiently large nations. Indeed, in the 1960s and 1970s, it often worked for light
industries. Colonialism (captive markets), and the push of the 1960s for South-South free
trade agreements can be seen as trying to boost domestic market size for nations in the middle
partition.
First generation Big-Push-ISI theorists wrongly assumed that moving from the first partition
to the second would launch a self-sustaining dynamo of rising output and accumulating
competencies that would eventually lead to the third partition (export competitiveness).
Revelation of this fallacy accounted for much of the dissatisfaction with the theory. Second
generation theorists turned their focus to the second bifurcation (transition from second to
third partition).
Getting over the second bifurcation required a second big-push that involves: i) exporting at a
loss initially, ii) investment in competencies for which there is not yet any demand, or iii) the
coordination appearance of export demand and extra competencies.xxi The Korean and
Malaysian auto experiences – as well as many others – embodied efforts to select option iii).
The diagram is useful for organising thinking on many development chestnuts. The Dutch
Disease can be seen here. The marginal cost curve depends upon local wages. For nations in
the second partition (modern, but uncompetitive industry), the non-industrial sector will

                                                                                              21
typically set the reservation wage and this, plus some industrial premium, determines the
modern-sector wage. A boom in commodity prices, or improved productivity in the non-
industrial sector would raise the industrial marginal cost curve and thus harm the
competitiveness of the national industry for any given range of competencies. Depending
upon the nation’s initial position and shock size, the nation may de-industrialize (shift into
partition one from two, or two from three).
Big exchange rate devaluations are like the Dutch Disease in reverse and thus can potentially
shift a nation from partition one to two, or two to three. Of course, it need not work this way.
If the nation’s initial comparative advantage is poor (it is far from the second bifurcation), the
devaluation may only produce a transitory boost in sales but no permanent increase in
industrial competency.

5.         TRADE, INDUSTRIALIZATION & THE 2ND UNBUNDLING
To think carefully about things like Malaysia’s versus Thailand’s autos policies, we need to
get away from the black box view of industry – the 20th century view that a nation’s output is
made only with its own factors employing its own technology. We introduce the framework
assuming 2nd unbundling has not yet happened.

5.1. Industry with a supply chain
The key assumptions of the expanded framework are: i) production of the final good requires
intermediate inputs (parts); ii) the parts range from simple to highly sophisticated – the more
sophisticated ones are more intensive in their use of competencies; and iii) to reflect
developing nation realities, Home is least competitive in the most sophisticated parts. More
sophisticated parts are more expensive for Home (the developing nation) to make (Figure 15).
A judicious choice of units let us compare marginal costs and prices across intermediates.xxii
Finally, we assume trade in parts is costly; in addition to transportation and tariffs,
coordination costs are added when parts and final goods are manufactured in different
nations.

competencies – denoted by ‘n’ (competencies range from zero to n) – is embedded in the
position of the marginal cost curve for intermediates (MC Intermediates in the diagram). A
nation with a wider range of competencies would, all else equal, have a lower MC
Intermediates curve. Observe that final-good production is pushed into the background to
focus on the supply chain.
Figure 15 is drawn assuming that the final good is produced in Home (without downstream
production there would be no demand for Home intermediates and thus no production or
importation of intermediates). Although it does not appear directly, the chicken-and the-egg
lumpiness of industry is still here. If Home does not produce a sufficiently broad array of
intermediates, it will not be competitive in the downstream good. Given prices, the nation
produces all parts up to a threshold level of sophistication (left partition of the x-axis); it
imports the rest (right partition). ICT costs are high to start with, so no parts are exported.
Where are our three cases from Figure 14? For example, suppose Home protects the
downstream industry in order to create a demand for upstream intermediates, hoping that
their supply would be forthcoming. If this works, the nation gets modern industry, which here
means downstream production and production of some intermediates but no exports. The
third possibility is that the domestic market is so small that nothing works. Protection of the
downstream goods creates no modern production of parts or final goods (poverty trap). Such
a situation is depicted in Figure 16; Home’s marginal cost of producing intermediates is
everywhere above the import price; there is no modern production downstream or upstream.

5.2. 2nd unbundling without multinationals
Now the ICT revolution happens and this brings down coordination costs, . How does this
change the diagram? To answer this, we have to address the role of multinationals.
Multinational corporations have been thoroughly involved in the internationalization of
supply chains, often playing a dominant role. However, before considering the implications
                                                                                              23
of multinationals’ involvement, it is instructive to think about a ‘pure’ 2nd unbundling – one
without MNCs. This allows us to motivate the rather obvious observation that the 2nd
unbundling makes industry less ‘lumpy’ and thus makes industrialization easier and quicker,
even without multinationals. This distinction also helps separate out two very different
implications of the ICT revolution. It facilitates geographical separation of production stages,
and it heightens the rewards to and need for combining rich-nation high-tech with poor-
nation low wages.
Starting from the Figure 15 case (only domestic sales), we lower  so the price lines get
closer together as shown (just as falling transport costs narrow the gap Figure 14). The new,
dashed price-lines now partition the range of intermediates into three segments. The
rightmost segment represents the intermediates Home imports (Home marginal cost is above
the import price). The middle segment defines the intermediates Home produces but does not
export (Home marginal cost is low enough to beat imports but not low enough to be
competitive abroad). The leftmost segment is new. It depicts a range of intermediates where
Home is now competitive in world markets.
We immediately see two first-order effects of the ICT revolution: 1) the range of
intermediates produced at Home shrinks, and 2) trade in intermediates rises – both imports
and exports (as in Figure 11 and Figure 13).
The first effect stems from the fact that at the high end of the range, imports displace
domestic production of intermediates. While bad news for any specific factors involved in the
newly uncompetitive intermediates, this is good news for downstream competitiveness. Since
the imports are cheaper, downstream competitiveness is improved. More local downstream
production is good news for intermediate producers in the middle segment. The second effect
stems from the way that lower coordination costs allow Home to export the parts where it has
the greatest comparative advantage (leftmost segment).

5.2.1. Informal dynamics: Existing industry case
We can use this framework to think about the impact of the 2nd unbundling on a nation, say
Korea, which had a broad and deep industrial base before the 2nd unbundling. As far as total
demand for competencies is concerned, there are two positive effects and one negative effect.
The negative channel is the displacement of locally produced high-end intermediates with
imports. The positive channel is the extra production of low-end parts for export, and the
improved competitiveness of the downstream product which may promote additional
domestic and/or export sales.
If the overall effect is positive and large enough, overall demand for competencies will rise –
it is due to the new demand arising from the newly export-competitive intermediates, but also
possibly from the extra final-good exports caused by the lower cost of intermediates.xxiii As
usual, this will induce fresh investment in competencies. The knock-on effect of expanding
the competency range will be a lowering of the MC Intermediates curve as shown in Figure
17. This in turn induces what could be called “moving up the value chain”. Both thresholds –
the one for domestic production and the one for exporting – shift to the right implying that
the nation exports more sophisticated goods. This would create something like the famous
‘flying geese’ development pattern.xxiv
Notice that something like New Economic Geography’s cost-linked circular causality, i.e.
cluster economics – is going on here. The new exports create a demand and thus supply of
competencies that lower the nation’s marginal cost and thus lead to a second round of new
exports which in turn create new demand/supply of competencies. The process eventually

                                                                                              24
arrives as a steady state as ‘n’ stops rising and the thresholds stabilise. In the meantime,
however, it would look like export-led growth involving an above-normal rate of
savings/investment and a rapid expansion of production and employment in industry.
Moreover, the nation would be expanding the range of products it exports.

The framework can also be used to think about development of a nation that initially has no
domestic production of the final good – say, the Philippines in autos. In this case, there is no
local demand for intermediates and the top price line in Figure 17 is irrelevant (as is the
corresponding threshold). After the 2nd unbundling, the nation starts to export industrial
goods but only intermediates (those in the leftmost segment). The cost-linked circular
causality starts as before and the nation “moves up the value chain”, exporting increasingly
sophisticated parts as its range of competencies widens.

5.3. Multinationals and the 2nd unbundling
A critical aspect of global value chains is the cross-border application of advanced know-how
(product and process technologies, finance, management, marketing, design, etc.). There is a
good reason for this. As manufacturers from advanced economies seek to produce certain
parts, or complete certain manufacturing stages more cheaply, they move production facilities
abroad. However the output of these new factories must continue to mesh seamlessly with the
continually evolving production processes located in other nations. The factories are thus
often owned, controlled, or in long-term relations with the parent company. What’s more,
combing high technology and low wages is profitable – or at least very cost effective and
essential to maintaining competitiveness if everyone else is doing it.
This suggests that the analysis so far missed a critical element of the 2nd unbundling – the
application of firm-specific, advanced-nation technology in developing nation factories. This
has important implications for the connections between trade and industrialization – the sort
of thing that explains how Thailand or Vietnam could so rapidly expand its exports of
vehicles and parts.

                                                                                                25
To study these new implications, we modify the workhorse diagram to allow for very specific
forms of cross-border movement of technology. We do not use the standard moniker –
technology transfer – since it is entirely inadequate to today’s realities in at least two ways.
First, the internationalization of supply chains involves cross-border applications of very
specific slices of the parent company’s know-how. This is not the diffusion of a broad range
of productivity enhancing techniques that is typically assumed in a growth model. A Japanese
auto maker, for example, might help a Philippine company learn to sew leather seats onto a
frame made in Japan, so they can sell Lexus’s for less. There would be little or no Filipino
learning, however, about the design and construction of the seat frames and embedded
electronics. Second, if the company can manage it, there will be no transfer of technology at
all. Corporations take great care to reduce the dissemination of know-how to the local
economy.
As such, this cross-border deployment of technology should be thought of more as
‘technology lending’. If the multinational decides to switch the production of the particular
part from, say China to Vietnam, the producer in China may not be able to continue
producing the same part.
To capture these aspects in the framework, we start from a situation where the developing
nation is not making the downstream product (say, cars). We begin, in other words, from the
situation depicted in Figure 15 where there is no intermediates production initially. From this
initial condition, the multinational ‘lends’ a narrow range of technology to a producer located
in the developing nation with the aim of getting the offshoring part produced at the lowest
possible cost for the requisite quality. An example would be Nokia teaching a Malaysian firm
to produce and fasten the plastic screen cover to one of its handsets.
In the diagram, this shows up as downward jump in Home’s marginal costs but only for the
particular part that is offshored. This is illustrated in Figure 18. The key is that with the help
of the technology-lending, Home switches from a zero-indigenous-industry situation to being
a globally competitive exporter of a particular part.
Two implications follow immediately from the case at hand.
      First, industry can appear extremely quickly.
There is no need for the time-consuming nurturing of an industrial base and investment in a
broad range of technical competencies. The multinational arrives and production starts in
little more than the time it takes to build the factory.
      Second, this industrialization process bears very little resemblance to the successful
       import substitution policies followed by, say, the US, or even Korea and Taiwan.
This industrialization looks like a big success from the perspective of exporting. After all, the
nation is now exporting what shows up as advanced industry goods in the trade statistics. If
the analyst is still viewing the world with 20th century industrialization theory in mind, this is
a very good sign. By the time Korea and Taiwan got to the stage of exporting such things,
they were firmly on the road to being rich nations. However from the perspective of 21st
century trade and industry, exporting a good tells us much less about the exporting nation’s
capacities. There may be only one factory in the whole country that resembles modern
industry. This is sometimes call enclave industrialization.

The preceding example is akin to the ‘trade in tasks’ discussed by Grossman and Rossi-
Hansberg (2008) where offshoring involves no two-way trade in goods. While such forms of
production sharing do exist, they are not the only kind. In many industries, so-called
reexporting trade is prevalent. This is where the developing nation imports sophisticated
parts, adds some value, and reexports the output. This is also called outward processing trade.
We can easily capture this type of trade by re-interpreting Figure 18.
The diagram focuses on the intermediates; the downstream good is in the background. To
capture outward processing trade, we assume that the downstream good (typically a
component rather than a final consumer good) is being produced in the developing nation
under consideration (in this case an intermediate good itself rather than a final good.
As a consequence, production of the downstream good requires the full range of
intermediates arranged along the horizontal axes of Figure 18. Home production is
competitive only in a narrow range of intermediates – the range where technology lending
occurred. All other intermediates are imported.
In this case, the industrialization becomes associated with the rapid emergence of both
imports and exports of parts. All this would be associated with long-term foreign involvement
with the newly created industry. Here the story has been told in a way that makes it look very
much like the sort of industry that grew rapidly in export-processing zones in the 1990s.

5.4. How the 2nd unbundling killed import substitution
Before moving to policy issues, it is worth pointing out that the demise of 20th century
industrialization strategies may have been caused by 2nd unbundling industrialization.
We start by noting that import substitution seems to have disappeared as a viable
development strategy at approximately the same time as the 2nd unbundling got going in
manufacturing. For example, countries in East Asia followed dual-track industrialization
strategies since the 1970s. On one hand, they pursued import substitution in an effort to
create industries via import protection. On the other hand, they encouraged export platforms
that employed their workers to produce goods (usually components) for export – often
employed directly or indirectly by multinationals.
                                                                                           27
As the 1980s and 1990s proceeded, the classic import substitution track failed increasingly
while the export-oriented track increasingly succeeded. Eventually, many of these nations
embraced policies that turned their whole country into what can be thought of as one great
big export processing zone.
An unintended result of all this offshore-friendly policy was that it boosted the
competitiveness of advanced-nation manufacturing firms. Before offshoring, expensive
Japanese labour had to be used for almost all aspects of making Toyotas. In this way, high
labour costs partly offset Japan’s technology edge making it easy for, say, Malaysian-made
Proton cars to compete with Japanese cars inside Malaysia. By allowing, say, Toyota, to
combine its high-technology with cheap East Asian labour, offshoring enhanced Toyota’s
cost edge over Proton. The key point is that offshoring does not allow Proton to borrow
Japan’s technology when making Protons, but it does allow Toyota to borrow developing
nations’ low-wage labour.
Note the important distinction here between the competitiveness of advanced-nation
manufacturing firms and competitiveness of advanced-nation industry workers. The
offshoring allows the combination of advanced-nation technology with developing nation
labour. This clearly makes the offshoring company’s products more competitive, but it tells
us nothing directly about how it changes incentives to create jobs in the advanced nation.

6.       WHY DOES IT MATTER?
The Lindauer-Prichett first two generations of ‘high development theory’ disagreed on how
best to overcome the chicken-and-egg lumpiness of 20th century industry. They share,
however, the goal of building the whole domestic supply chain.xxv What Lindauer and
Prichett (2002) call third generation theories stress diversity, but they continue to use a 20th
century view of trade and industry.xxvi There are at least two issues that arise when the third-
generation development models ignore the supply chain.
        Misinterpretation of the data, and
        Inattention to certain policy questions.

6.1. Misinterpreting the data
Using a 20th century view of industry to interpret 21st century data can lead to incorrect
inferences. The 20th century view is that a nation’s exports embody the nation’s technology,
labour, capital, etc. – the inclusion of foreign factors or technology is a second order issue. As
such, a nation’s exports tell us something about that nation’s technology, labour, capital, etc.
This approach fails, however, for products and nations where international supply chains are
important. Product characteristics may tell us something about the embodied factors and
technology, but very little about the nationality of those factors and technologies. To take a
well-known example, China’s IPod exports tell us more about the US industry than it does
about Chinese industry. The factor and technology content of a nation’s exports will depend
upon the nation’s position in the international supply chain as well as upon its own supply of
factors and technology.
The same problem becomes more severe when the considering periods, countries, and
producers where the 2nd unbundling has advanced rapidly. As we saw in Table 1, the local
content in ‘Factory Asia’ shifted massively from 1985 to 2000.
To make the point more precisely, consider the widely cited Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik
(2007) model (HHR henceforth). The message-in-the model is that nations should search for
                                                                                               28
their own nation-specific comparative advantage and modify this comparative advantage by
shifting into more sophisticated goods. The 20th century concept of industry is baked into
their model when they assume industry can be modelled as a black box linking national
factors and technology to national output; the nation’s production contains only its own
productive factors and technology. Nothing like Thailand’s export of pickup trucks and
engine parts, or China’s processing trade is possible.
When they get to empirics, they use the 20th century view of industry to link country
characteristics to goods; exports of poor nations must be technology-poor in the sense of
being products where a nation’s labour is especially low. With our simple framework in
mind, we can immediately see a problem with this. The good exported may embody a large
amount of foreign-nation factors and technology, so the product-country link is tenuous. In
the Figure 18 case of ‘technology lending’, the product-country link may be entirely spurious
as the developing nation is using advance-nation technology even in the segment of the value
chain it has.
The growth implications could also be misinterpreted. We suppose a particular camera is
made in Japan and thus associated with a high measured productivity – what HHR call
PRODY – and then Sony offshores assembly to China. However suppose that in contrast to
the HHR model, the productivity of Chinese assembly workers is the same in cameras, cotton
shirts, or anything else. In this world, we might see an association between China’s exports of
things Japan used to export and Chinese growth, but it would have nothing to do with the
HHR message-in-the-model. The creation of any assembly job that draws a worker out of
agriculture raises Chinese output since labour productivity is higher in assembly than
agriculture. Thus we would see an association between a rise in China’s export sophistication
index and its growth, but it has nothing to do with the sophistication of its export mix. If
HHR are right, nations might want to target the production of high-tech goods. If the
alternative view is right, all that matters is getting more assembly jobs.

6.2. Different policy questions
High development theory generally ignores or skips over the changed nature of
industrialization. For example, Rodrik (2011a) argues that: “continued rapid growth in the
developing world will require pro-active policies that foster structural transformation and
spawn new industries - the kind of policies that today's advanced economies employed
themselves on the way to becoming rich.” This, of course, assumes that building a supply
chain – which is what advanced economies did – is the same as joining a supply chain –
which is the main option faced by a growing number of developing nations today.
With the lack of focus on supply chains, one may also miss policy issues raised by the new
path to industrialization. There are really two sets of questions. The first concerns issues
faced by nations that are trying to join a supply chain. The second concerns issues faced by
nations like Korea – who industrialized in the old fashioned way and now are facing a
‘hollowing out’ of their industry.

6.2.1. New industrializers
New policy issues that arise can be highlighted with an example. The Sinos Valley in
southern Brazil had a cluster of small shoe-manufacturers in the 1960s producing for the
domestic market. In the 1980s, buyers from the US arrived and integrated Brazilian firms into
the US footwear value chain (Humphrey and Schmitz 2002). This facilitated upgrading as the
“US buyers studied the market, developed models and specified product, helped producers in
the choice of technology, and organized production, inspected quality on site, and organized

                                                                                               29
transport and payment. (Humphrey and Schmitz 2002)” Process efficiency and product
quality rose. The author also noted: “the danger of this strategy became evident when
Chinese producers undercut Brazilian products in the US market in the early 1990s, and
Brazilian producers were faced with sharply declining prices.”
The largest local firms upgraded in terms of production process but not in terms of design and
marketing. Local business associations promulgated plans for raising the image of Brazil’s
footwear and reinforcing design capabilities, but these came to nought. Should the Brazilian
government have been active in encouraging a diversification of buyers, or an upgrading to
more niche products? Should it have encouraged firms to do more design and marketing in
Brazil?
This touches on a whole set of issues concerning the most appropriate complementary
policies. Once new industrial jobs start appearing, what should be done to ensure raising
productivity and sustainability of the production? Should a government activity diversify the
nationality of the supply chains its workers are joining? What sort of implications does this
sort of fast-and-easy industrialization have for education and training policies? Should
foreign language skills be emphasised more? If so, which languages? Is the encouragement of
labour unions a good idea for the development strategy?
Of course, these questions are not entirely new – they are related to the localization struggle
of ISI polices in the 1970s and the early 1980s. However, as the Thai versus Malay auto
sector experiences showed, thinking about localization policies without putting global value
chains at the heart of the economic logic can lead to some very misguided policies. Today’s
nations might do better to look at Thailand starting from the late 1980s, rather than Korea and
Taiwan from 1970 to 1997.
Another example concerns the contrast between Thailand’s and the Philippine’s joining
“strategies”. Thailand has very successfully attracted a great deal of industry activity in the
automobile sector. The Philippines, by contrast, engages in outward processing production in
a wide range of products and few final vehicles. How should we evaluate these outcomes and
the policy choices that fostered them? What should we recommend to the next supply-chain
joiner, say Vietnam or Cambodia?
Some nations, such as China, have explicit policies of encouraging the replacement of
imported intermediates with local production. They also actively encourage local
manufacturers to imitate foreign producers who are selling to the local market. This is plainly
a twist on the old import-substitution policies, and it seems to be working. But is it the right
policy? Should other developing nations try to emulate them, or is it only working because of
China’s enormous internal market?
Consider the Figure 18 example where the developing nation gets a narrow slice of
intermediate production. Should its policy makers try to expand this range? If yes, should
they try to fill in below (produce less sophisticated products), or try to build up (produce
more sophisticated products)?
Issues of geography are clearly more important for joining a supply chain, but they are not
well understood - in part because high-level development theory ignores supply chains. One
hypothesis is that geography matters because 21st century trade – the trade-investment-
services nexus – requires technicians and managers to travel among production facilities.
While the price of air tickets has fall, the opportunity cost of time has not. This is probably
why supply chains are regionalised rather than globalized: Factory Asia, Factory North
America, and Factory Europe, for example.

                                                                                               30
These considerations give rise to additional sets of policy concerns. As geography seems to
be so important, it would seem critical to distinguish between policies that might work in the
neighbourhood of an existing supply chain and policies that might be needed in faraway
nations. Surely, we should develop a different set of policy advice for, say, Vietnam, and,
say, South Africa, or Argentina.
A much larger question concerns the ultimate destination of offshoring-led industrialization.
Right now, the world seems is dividing into headquarter economies and factory economies
(Baldwin 2006). The factory economies have lots of industry and rapidly growing exports of
manufactured goods, but how to they ensure their place in the supply chain is not supplanted
by the next low-wage country to get its governance problems under control? Ultimately, how
do factory economies become headquarter economies, or is that whole notion an
anachronism?
The development nations that industrialized before the 2nd unbundling (e.g. Korea, Taiwan,
and India, South Africa and Brazil to a certain extent) face a very different set of policy
challenges. Should they encourage their industrial companies to join the supply chains of US
and Japanese companies? Should they encourage or discourage their manufacturing firms
from offshoring certain segments of the production? If so, which segments? Should their
governments institute complementary policies that help their firms continue up the value
chain? Should they try to prevent nations like China from moving up the value chain?

7.     WHAT IT MEANS FOR MULTILATERAL COOPERATION
Since globalization’s 2nd unbundling, international commerce involves a richer, more
complex, more interconnected set of cross-border flows. This changed nature of trade
transformed policy making globally, first by creating new supply and new demand for deeper
disciplines, and second by creating a bond among various strands of policy making – some of
which were always viewed as international but many are traditionally viewed as domestic
policy issues. This section, which draws on Baldwin (2012), considers the implications for
multilateral trade cooperation.

7.1. The nexus: More interconnected policy
The complexity and interconnectedness of supply-chain trade shifted world trade governance
towards regionalism. As is so often the case, there is nothing really new here. The basic
challenge of supply-chain trade and the basic response of deeper, regional disciplines has
been a feature of global governance for a half century.
Before the 2nd unbundling, most trade was simple and could be governed by the simple rules
of GATT 1947. GATT rules, however, were not sufficient to underpin the complex cross-
border relations implied by supply chains that arose among rich nations in the 1960s and
1970s. To fill this governance gap, North Atlantic nations set up deeper disciplines. Since the
trade was regional rather than multilateral, the deeper disciplines were placed in regional
trade agreements. One important example was the 1965 US-Canada Auto Pact, which
regulated trade and investment in the auto sector.xxvii
The history lesson here is simple. Complex cross-border flows demand complex rules. Since
most supply-chain trade is regional, there is a strong tendency to establish the necessary
complex rules at a regional rather than multilateral level. Multilateral rules would almost
surely have been more efficient, but negotiating them in the GATT would have been too
cumbersome and slow; most GATT members were not involved in this type of international
commerce.
                                                                                            31
7.1.1. Which new disciplines are needed?
21st century trade creates a need for two new types of disciplines. These correspond to the
two new elements of the associated international commerce.
      Supply-chain trade often involves producing abroad, either directly or via long-term
       relationships with independent suppliers.
This is basically the investment and intellectual property part – setting up business abroad is
an essential part of 21st century trade. This means that barriers to doing business abroad are
now trade barriers. Likewise, much of the internationalization of supply chains involves
overseas application of a firm’s advanced know-how. A lack of IP protection therefore
becomes a barrier to trade. International supply chains in the 1960s and 1970s were mostly
among developed nations whose domestic laws provided reasonable guarantees. As supply
chains spread to developing nations with weaker domestic institutions, embedding such
disciplines in international agreements became more important.
      Production among the facilities must be coordinated and this involves the two-way
       flow of goods, services, people, capital, and training.
Barriers to these flows are now barriers to trade. Note that traditional trade barriers are part of
this, but the list is much longer as the cross-border flows are more complex (express mail, air
cargo, trade financing and insurance, business mobility, etc.). One good source listing the
necessary disciplines are the deep regional trade agreements that have been signed among
nations where the trade-investment-services-IP nexus trade is important.xxviii

7.2. The 2nd unbundling and erosion of WTO centricity
Globalization’s 2nd unbundling created a new type of win-win situation in international
commerce. The old type was ‘my market for yours’; the new type is ‘my factories for your
reform’. This spawned massive demand for new disciplines from ‘headquarter economy’
firms and a massive supply of new disciplines from ‘factory economy’ governments (i.e.
developing nations seeking industrialize by joining international supply chains).
As the WTO was occupied with the Doha Round and its emphasis on 20th century issues
(tariffs and agriculture), supply met demand in regional trade agreements – just as it did in
the 1960s. More precisely, the supply-chain governance gap was filled by uncoordinated
developments in deep regional trade agreements, bilateral investment treaties, and
autonomous reforms in emerging economies. The resulting package of deeper disciplines is
what I have called 21st century regionalism (Baldwin 2011) – a theme taken up in the WTO’s
2011 World Trade Report (WTO 2011).

        7.2.1. Going forward
When it comes to 20th century trade and 20th trade issues, the WTO is in rude health. The
basic WTO rules are almost universal respected, WTO’s court decisions are almost
universally accepted, and nations – even big nations like Russia – seem willing to pay a high
political price to join the organisation. In short, the WTO is alive and well when it comes to
the types of trade and trade barriers it was designed to govern (the sale of goods made in
factories in one nation to customers in another).
The 21st century regionalism that has arisen from developing nations’ quest for offshored
factories and jobs is a threat to the WTO’s centrality in multilateral trade governance, but not
in the way that 20th century bilateralism was. It is not useful to think of 21st century
regionalism using the analytic frameworks established by last-century thinkers like Jagdish
Bhagwati when regionalism was mostly about tariff preferences (Baldwin 2011). 21st century
                                                                                              32
regionalism is not primarily about preferential market access as WTO (2011 Chapter B)
demonstrated convincingly. 21st century regionalism is about disciplines that underpin the
supply-chain industrialization.
Where the WTO’s future seems cloudy is on the 21st century trade front. The demands for
new rules and disciplines governing the trade-investment-services-IP nexus are being
formulated outside the WTO. Developing nations are rushing to unilaterally lower their
tariffs (especially on intermediate goods) and unilaterally reduce behind the border barriers to
the trade-investment-services-IP nexus. All of this has markedly eroded the WTO centrality
in the global trade system.
The implication of this is clear. The WTO’s future will either be to stay on the 20th century
side-track on to which it has been shunted, or to engage constructively and creatively in the
new range of disciplines necessary to underpin 21st century trade.

8.     CONCLUDING REMARKS
Some nations got rich without industrializing – but not many. This is why ‘high development
theory’ – as Paul Krugman calls it – focuses on industrial development and trade’s roles in
fostering it. Recent empirical explorations led by Dani Rodrik continue to find evidence that
manufacturing is critical. The current generation of high-development thinking, however,
eschews big ideas since yesteryear’s big ideas fail to account for the facts. Some nations are
booming while others are stagnating, but there seems to be little correlation between
outcomes and the old Big Ideas (ISI), or their replacement (Washington Consensus).
One part of the weak correlation might be due to the revolutionary transformation of industry
and trade that occurred from 1985 to the late-1990s but which has not been incorporated into
development theory. Starting in 1985, with an important acceleration in the late 1990s, most
successful developing-nation industrializers joined the supply chains of firms from high-tech
nations, especially the manufacturing giants of the 1980s – the US, Japan and Germany. As
mentioned in the introduction, joining a supply chain made industrialization radically less
complex and radically faster because supply-chain industry is less lumpy and less
interconnected domestically.
The ICT revolution lowered the cost of coordinating complex activities at distance and this
made the geographical dispersion of supply chains feasible and profitable. Rich-nation firms
offshored segments of their value chains to developing nations. As the output had to mesh
seamlessly with continually evolving production processes in other nations, the multinational
typically deployed its firm-specific technology in the foreign factory – especially since this
combination of rich-nation technology and low-wage labour could be very profitable.
This ‘technology lending’ could revolutionize the output of a developing nation’s industry
almost overnight. Offshored factories arrived with everything needed to export. Much of this
was regional as key personnel still had to travel among factories. Oversimplifying to make
the point, all the developing nation had to do was be located near the US, Japan or Germany,
provide reliable workers, and establish a hospitable business environment.
But easier and faster does not necessarily mean better. As mentioned in the introduction, the
2nd unbundling made industrialization less meaningful. Before the 2nd unbundling, a nation
had to have a deep and wide industrial base before it could export, e.g. car engines. Exporting
engines was a sign of victory. Now it is a sign that the nation is located along a particular
segment of an international value chain.

                                                                                                33
The key development struggle is to continue to reach new equilibriums, thus deepening the
exploitation of external economies. Large developing nations like China and India can use
their massive internal markets as both carrot and stick in forcing advance technology firms to
transfer more technology. The lessons from China in particular have little relevance for
smaller developing nations. Thailand’s success in becoming the Detroit of Southeast Asia
shows supply-chain industrialization can work even without muscular technology transfer
policies.
In closing, I am not sure that a full understanding of the 2nd unbundling’s development
implications will eventually lead to new Big Ideas. I am sure, however, that ignoring such
implications will guarantee continuing puzzlement. Global supply chains are now a fixed
point in the typology of developing-nation industrial planners; no winning industrialization
effort in the past 20 years has been able to ignore them. The goal of this paper is to make the
prima facie argument that incorporation of such considerations into development theory may
yield important insights.

 New Economic Geography forces probably explains much this. As Krugman and Venables (1995) argued, the
Home Market Effect – reinforced by expenditure shifting – meant that lower trade costs favoured location in
economically large nations.

 The rise in export growth in the 2000s was largely due to trade created by internationalised supply chains; see
Yi (2003).

 Although most G7 manufacturing sectors grew in absolute terms, the output of 7 emerging markets grew

   The Lopez-Gonzales and Holmes (2011) measures indicate the share of gross exports accounted for by
intermediate imported (sourcing), and the share of exports used as inputs into other nations’ exports (sales). The
measures are bilateral and direction-specific, so each point in the graph corresponds to a single bilateral measure
of sales or sourcing supply-chain trade for each year from 1995 to 2007.

  Of course, supply chains are mentioned, but one reads analysis such as: “It should also be said that the global
supply chains that run through countries like China and India represent a significant opportunity and not just a
threat” (p.94). No systemic lessons are drawn.
x See for example, Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik (2007), Hausmann, and Klinger (2007), Lederman and
Maloney (2007), Klinger and Lederman (2007), and Brambilla, Ledermann and Porto (2010). Rodrik (2011a, b)
continue the tradition.
xi The section draws on Baldwin (2006, 2008).
xii Email, editable files (*.xls, *.doc, etc), and more specialised web-based coordination software packages
revolutionized peoples’ ability to manage multifaceted procedures across great distances. Working methods and
product designs shifted to make production more modular.
xiii Blinder (2006), Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2006, 2008), Markusen (2005), Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud
(2007) are recent contributions. See Jones and Kierzkowski (1988), Deardorff (2001a,b), and Venables (1999
for the seminal work.
xiv Consolidating and shipping are expensive. Sturgeon (1998) writes that “one automaker manager in Vietnam
said that the cars assembled in Vietnam cost the parent company twice what they cost in the home country
(because of low plant and equipment utilization rates; assembly costs were said to be five times that of the home
country).” Sturgeon reports that a Toyota Corolla that went for $14,000 in the US cost $26,000 in Vietnam.
xv See e.g. Amdensen (1989), Amdensen and Kim (1989), Ravenhill (2005), Amsden (2001), or Green (1992).
xvi Timing was fortuitous. The US imposed Voluntary Export Restrictions on Japanese cars in 1981, cutting out
Korea’s main competitor in its chosen segment.
xvii Moreover much of the experience gained in the 1960s and 1970s was lost when the government excluded
the Chinese-Malaysian firms that had done most of the assembly.
xviii “Engine manufacturers had to increase local content every year from 20% in 1989 to 70% in 1998. From
1994, engine manufacturers had to use local cylinder blocks (casting), and local connecting rods (forging) and
camshaft (casting)from 1996, cylinder head (casting) from 1997, and crank shaft (forging) from 1998”
Techakanont (2008).
xix We think of these as specialised training, producer services, etc. For example, Amsden (2001 p.4) lists 3
generic capabilities needed for industry: production capabilities (e.g. production management, production
engineering, logistics, finance, etc.), project execution capabilities (personnel training, undertaking feasibility
studies, project execution, project engineering, procurement, etc.), and innovation capabilities (pure science,

                                                                                                                      37
basic research, applied research, advanced development, etc.)
xx Irwin (2003), for example, notes that the US became a net exporter of manufactures in 1910.
xxi Of course, the steady state range of competencies will be the collective outcome of investment decisions, so
for some nations, the multiple equilibrium analysis is not relevant – their cost of creating competencies is so
high that even with the whole world as their market, the steady state would be in the first partition.
xxii For example if intermediate good number 1 has a price of $1 per kilogram, and good 12 has a price of
$1000 per kilogram, we measure 1 in kilos and 12 in grams, so both have a price of $1. This makes marginal
costs comparable across intermediates.
xxiii Technically, the opening shifts the production mix towards a less competency intensive range of
intermediates, so a simple rise in total production may not raise overall demand for competencies.
xxiv The original ideas are in Akamatsu (1962); the model in Kojima (2000).
xxv The simple framework skipped over all the bread-and-butter of development advice that Lindauer and
Pritchett (2007) say define the first and second generation – things like, the role of governments, capital
accumulation, trade, etc. This omission is not meant to suggest that these are unimportant – they are important.
The omission was intended to illustrate common foundations of traditional thinking on industrialisation, and to
show that this thinking is rooted in 19th and 20th century experiences where supply chains could only be
internationalised to a limited extent and then only between advanced nations like the US and Canada, or
Germany and France.
xxvi See for example, Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik (2007), Hausmann, and Klinger (2007), Lederman and
Maloney (2007), Klinger and Lederman (2007), Brambilla, Ledermann and Porto (2010) which stress the
importance of the composition of a nation’s export portfolio.

    Following a procedure established by Horn, Mavroidis and Sapir (2009), the WTO recently created a
database of deeper disciplines in all the RTAs announced to the WTO by 2010 (WTO 2011).
