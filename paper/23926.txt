                                           ABSTRACT

We study how physicians respond to financial incentives imposed by episode-based bundled
payment (EBP), which encourages lower spending and improved quality for an entire episode of
care. Specifically, we study the impact of the Arkansas Health Care Payment Improvement
Initiative, a multi-payer program that requires providers in the state to enter into EBP
arrangements for perinatal care. Because of its multi-payer nature and the requirement that
providers participate, the program covers the vast majority of births in the state. Unlike fee-for-
service reimbursement, EBP holds physicians responsible for all care within a discrete clinical
episode, rewarding physicians not only for efficient use of their own services but also for efficient
management of other health care inputs. In a difference-in-differences analysis of commercial
claims, we find that perinatal spending decreased by 3.8% overall in Arkansas after the
introduction of EBP, compared to surrounding states. We find that the decrease was driven by
reduced spending on non-physician health care inputs, specifically the prices paid for inpatient
facility care, and that our results are robust to a number of sensitivity and placebo tests. We
additionally find that EBP was associated with a limited improvement in quality of care.

1       Introduction

Understanding how physicians respond to financial incentives is a central issue in health
economics. Compensation structures can improve efficiency in markets for physician ser-
vices, addressing principal-agent problems that arise from informational asymmetries and
non-contractible quality (McGuire, 2000). There is broad consensus that fee-for-service
(FFS) reimbursement distorts care provision away from the social optimum and incentivizes
overtreatment.1 Recent debate over how to restructure physicians’ financial incentives has
included proposals to bundle related services into broader payments. Episode-based bun-
dled payment (EBP) pays a case rate for an entire episode of care, imposing supply-side cost
sharing for spending outside of a target range. Because EBP combines physician fees with
payments to all other providers involved in the episode, EBP not only rewards physicians
for efficient use of their own services, but also for efficient management of other health care
inputs that have traditionally been separately reimbursed.
    The influence of payment systems on physician behavior is widely recognized and has
generated a robust theoretical and empirical literature.2 Most empirical work is focused on
capitation and salary contracts (Ho and Pakes, 2014; Jensen, 2014; Hennig-Schmidt et al.,
2011; Dusheiko et al., 2006; Barro and Beaulieu, 2003; Gaynor and Gertler, 1995) and rel-
atively little is known about how physicians respond to EBP. Existing studies of EBP are
generally limited to observational evidence from small demonstration projects (Navathe et al.,
2017; Dummitt et al., 2016; CMS, 2013; Casale et al., 2007; Cromwell et al., 1997), mostly
in the Medicare market. This literature concludes that EBP is associated with efficiency
gains, especially through improved management of non-physician health care inputs such
as medical devices, post acute care and inpatient facility care. However, concerns about
provider selection into these programs make causal inferences difficult. Moreover, the mag-
nitude of physician responses to efficiency incentives is important, and the small scale of
these demonstration projects limit the generalizability of the findings.
    In this paper, we study physician responses to EBP in the context of the Arkansas
Health Care Payment Improvement Initiative (APII), a state-wide program with mandatory
provider participation. Implemented in 2013, the APII is among the most extensive EBP
models in use and, to the best of our knowledge, the only large-scale EBP program that is
obligatory for providers. The APII is built on a partnership of payers in the state, most
notably Medicaid and Arkansas Blue Cross Blue Shield (AR BCBS), which accounts for
    1
     More precisely, fees above marginal cost create incentives for oversupply; fees below marginal cost can
create incentives for underprovision (McGuire, 2011).

80% of the state’s large group market (KFF, 2014b).3 Under EBP, insurers set episode-level
spending targets and hold a Principal Accountable Provider (PAP) responsible for a portion
of any excess spending. EBP in Arkansas initially covered five episodes: Perinatal, Attention
Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Hip and Knee Replacement, Congestive Heart Failure, and
Upper Respiratory Infection. Like many modern EBP programs, the APII employs a FFS
model with reconciliation, rather than prospective EBP, which imposes a single, up-front
payment to be shared by all providers involved in episode care.
    The APII presents a novel opportunity to study the effects of EBP in the commercial
market and to understand its impact at a system level. We study the effects of EBP on
perinatal care in Arkansas. Studying EBP in the context of perinatal care has several
advantages. First, because Medicare has such a small role in covering perinatal care, the
partnership of Medicaid and commercial insurers covers the vast majority of births in the
state and impedes physician selection into different payment systems. Second, spending
on perinatal care in the United States is substantial and associated with large variations
in episode costs, suggesting that savings under EBP are potentially large (Xu et al., 2015;
Glantz, 2012; Main et al., 2012). Third, incentivizing provider coordination is important
in the context of perinatal care, which typically occurs across a variety of clinical settings
and involves management of multiple health care inputs. Lastly, perinatal care is well-suited
to episode level bundling. From the physician’s perspective, the total number of perinatal
episodes is fixed, minimizing concerns about endogenous episode volume.4 Moreover, episode
spending accounts for a large share of total annual spending for this population, suggesting
that efficiency gains to broader bundled-payments would be small.5
    Our study makes several contributions to the literature. First, we develop a stylized
model of physician behavior under FFS with episode-based reconciliation. We show that
this EBP structure creates two broad incentives: (1) it discourages overprovision of services
that PAPs deliver directly and are compensated for with FFS payments (e.g., performing
a cesarean section) and (2) it incentivizes improved management of health care inputs that
   3
     QualChoice Arkansas (QCA) also participates in EBP, but provider participation is voluntary (ACHI,
2016). QCA held 7% of the large group market in 2014.
   4
     Under EBP, physicians are responsible for spending once an episode occurs, but are not held responsible
for the frequency of episodes. Physicians therefore benefit financially from a high number of episodes as
long as the case-rate is sufficiently high. These observations suggest that EBP is less appropriate in clinical
areas where the volume of episodes is endogenous to physician effort, either through prevention or through
“upcoding” (Dafny, 2005) related clinical conditions to appear as episodes.
   5
     Capitated payments, for example, would cover more services but would require substantial integration
across providers. Further, if capitated payments targeted primary care physicians, as is typical, patient-level
bundling could introduce a new agency problem into care provision. In particular, informational asymmetries
arise if primary care physicians know less about treatment options for perinatal care than the obstetricians
they refer patients to.



                                                      3
PAPs influence indirectly but are not compensated for through the FFS system (e.g., referrals
to teaching hospitals). We further argue that building EBP on top of the existing FFS
reimbursement system mutes incentives to adjust provision of direct services, relative to
indirect services. Second, we provide the first empirical evidence on physician responses to
mandatory EBP and assess the potential for such payment reforms to influence spending on
a large scale. We separately estimate the effect of EBP on PAPs’ direct service provision and
on PAPs’ use of other health care inputs, testing the predictions of our conceptual model.
Third, we contribute evidence about the effect of EBP in the commercial market, where
payment reforms must contend with inefficiencies in prices (Cooper et al., 2015b) as well as
utilization patterns.6
    We estimate the effects of perinatal EBP using a difference-in-differences (DD) analysis of
commercial claims, comparing Arkansas to its neighboring states after conducting extensive
validity tests of the DD design. We find that total episode spending declined in Arkansas
by 3.8% in the first year of full program implementation, relative to surrounding states, and
that the decrease was driven by a change in indirect service provision. In particular, we
estimate a 6.6% savings on inpatient facility spending and qualitatively smaller, statistically
insignificant savings on professional inpatient spending and outpatient spending. We pursue
a variety of sensitivity tests and find that these results are robust to alternative control
groups, covariate selection, and sample restrictions.
    We further explore the spending reductions under EBP by decomposing changes into
quantity and price components. In the inpatient setting, we find little evidence of changes in
utilization patterns, including cesarean section rates and lengths of hospital stays. Instead,
we find that the reduction in inpatient facility spending was largely driven by the price
of care. This conclusion is robust to placebo tests that repeat our analyses using services
that were not subject to EBP incentives. In the outpatient setting, we study utilization
of screening tests identified by Arkansas as markers of quality. We find only a modest
improvement in the quality of perinatal care in Arkansas; out of six screening tests, we find
increases in utilization of one under EBP.
    Lastly, we identify two broad mechanisms that could underlie the decreases in episode
spending under EBP, specifically the change in inpatient facility prices. Reductions in the
price of care could reflect (1) referral patterns favoring low price facilities or (2) lower ne-
gotiated rates at a given facility. We develop indirect tests of these mechanisms and find
preliminary evidence that a change in referral patterns is more likely.
   6
     In early demonstration projects, for example, Medicare achieved spending reductions largely by imposing
lower hospital payment rates, not through improvements in care efficiency (CMS, 2013; Cromwell et al., 1997).
The ability of commercial payers to negotiate lower prices will depend heavily on local market structure and
this avenue of spending reduction may only be feasible in pockets of the commercial market.

   The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background on perinatal EBP in
Arkansas. Section 3 lays out our conceptual model. Section 4 describes the data. Section
5 discusses our empirical strategy. Section 6 describes the spending, utilization and price
results. Section 7 describes our robustness tests. Section 8 explores the mechanism behind
the decline in inpatient facility prices and Section 9 concludes.


2       Perinatal EBP in Arkansas

2.1      Perinatal Episode Design
Under EBP in Arkansas, the perinatal episode is triggered by a live birth and includes all care
associated with the delivery of the infant, prenatal care in the 40 weeks prior to the birth,
and postpartum care in the 60 days after. One PAP is assigned responsibility for all episode
spending. In the perinatal episode for AR BCBS, the PAP is the provider that oversees
the delivery.7 Episode spending is risk-adjusted based on documented patient comorbidities;
PAPs can therefore mitigate financial risk by more thoroughly reporting patients’ clinical
conditions, analogous to “upcoding” under Medicare’s Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) sys-
tem (Dafny, 2005). Further details about the risk adjustment algorithm, for example which
comorbidities trigger risk adjustment, have not been released by AR BCBS.
    In addition to risk adjustment, certain comorbidities exclude episodes from EBP spend-
ing targets. These comorbidities are known publicly and include conditions such as type
I diabetes and severe pre-eclampsia (AR BCBS, 2014).8 Spending on valid (non-excluded)
episodes determines gain- and risk-sharing amounts for each PAP. While episode exclusion
protects PAPs against financial risk, it also raises concerns about gaming of exclusion criteria.
In particular, by shifting expensive episodes to the excluded group, PAPs can lower spend-
ing on valid episodes, potentially earning gainsharing dividends (or avoiding risk-sharing
penalties) with no real change in total episode spending.
    PAPs receive quarterly reports that track their risk-adjusted spending, utilization pat-
terns and quality of care. Each year, commercial insurers calculate a risk-adjusted spending
average among valid episodes for every PAP, then assign gainsharing dividends or risk-sharing
penalties to PAPs that have overseen at least five episodes. PAPs’ spending averages are
deemed Acceptable, Unacceptable, or Commendable according to pre-determined spending
thresholds that are based on historical spending in Arkansas. PAPs with Unacceptable
    7
     Under Medicaid perinatal EBP, the hospital where the delivery occurred can be the PAP, although this
has not been common.
   8
     Episodes can also be excluded for non-clinical reasons, for example if the delivering provider did not
perform the majority of prenatal care. Because our ability to observe these disqualifications is limited, we
do not pursue analyses of non-clinical exclusions.

spending are responsible for 50% of the excess spending beyond the Acceptable threshold
and PAPs with Commendable spending can share in 50% of the savings. Acceptable spend-
ing thresholds appear relatively generous. Of the 134 PAPs overseeing AR BCBS episodes
in 2012, 92 had Commendable spending averages and only 12 had Unacceptable spending
averages (ACHI, 2015).9 PAPs are disqualified from gainsharing if they do not meet certain
quality metrics but are not otherwise penalized or rewarded based on quality. In the perinatal
episode, quality metrics are outpatient process measures; PAPs satisfy quality requirements
with 80% screening rates for group B strep, chlamydia and HIV.


2.2     EBP Program Diffusion
Perinatal EBP enjoys nearly universal participation in Arkansas. In 2013, Medicaid ac-
counted for 67% of births in the state and implemented EBP for all beneficiaries, except for
those also covered by Medicare (Allison, 2013).10 In the private market in 2013, perinatal
EBP applied to all AR BCBS fully-insured groups, 17% of AR BCBS self-insured mem-
bers, AR BCBS employees, and Baptist Health employees; QualChoice Arkansas (QCA),
the state’s third largest commercial insurer, implemented EBP on a voluntary basis for
providers. Thus, in 2013 the vast majority of births were covered by EBP, with the ma-
jor exception being self-insured groups covered by AR BCBS. To the extent that providers
cared for a mix of publicly and privately insured patients, however, the substantial Medicaid
market share created an avenue for spillover effects (Glied and Zivin, 2002; Newhouse and
Marquis, 1978). In 2014, AR BCBS expanded perinatal EBP to all self-insured groups. By
2014, therefore, almost all births were covered by EBP; the only major payer excluded from
EBP in Arkansas was Medicare, which covers only a small fraction of births.11


2.3     Financial Incentives Before and After EBP
Under FFS, physicians receive a global maternity fee that covers all inpatient intrapartum
professional care, as well as routine outpatient professional services provided during the pre-
natal and postpartum periods.12 Physicians are separately reimbursed for certain outpatient
   9
     In October 2012, the draft Acceptable spending category ranged from $8,650 to $10,100 per episode.
  10
     Medicaid appears to have faced implementation challenges in 2013 and functionally applied EBP to
a fraction of covered births (ACHI, 2015). Given that PAPs likely could not foresee these challenges, we
assume that Medicaid EBP exerted pressure on spending in 2013.
  11
     Medicare might cover a pregnancy if a beneficiary is eligible through disability or end-stage renal disease,
as opposed to age.
  12
     We use intrapartum care to mean services rendered during the childbirth hospitalization. This use of
intrapartum departs from the clinical definition, which begins at the onset of labor and concludes with the
delivery of the placenta.



                                                       6
procedures, such as laboratory work. Hospitals and other facilities are reimbursed separately
for services rendered in those settings. Thus, while physicians decide on the intensity of facil-
ity spending, they do not stand to gain or lose financially from these management decisions.13
Inpatient facility services are reimbursed via DRG-level bundled payments; DRG rates are
higher for cesarean sections and for clinically complex patients. In the commercial market,
inpatient facility payments also vary within a DRG type across hospitals.
    Under EBP, physicians have a financial stake in all services provided in the episode win-
dow. The perinatal bundle maintains the underlying FFS structure, but sets an Acceptable
spending range to cover the global maternity fee, any other professional fees and all facil-
ity fees. PAPs can reduce direct spending on their own services by decreasing professional
inpatient spending, for example via cesarean section rates, or by decreasing spending on
outpatient services that fall outside the global fee. Notably, EBP also creates a counteract-
ing incentive to increase spending on outpatient services if it allows PAPs to meet quality
requirements. PAPs can reduce indirect spending on other health care inputs by decreasing
facility spending, for example by referring patients to low price hospitals or by adjusting
hospitalization lengths; although length of stay (LOS) does not generally affect spending un-
der a DRG system, facility reimbursements are higher if LOS exceeds a high trim threshold
and lower if LOS is below a low trim threshold.14 Cesarean section rate reductions will also
reduce indirect spending via lower DRG payments. Lastly, PAPs can decrease both direct
and indirect spending by documenting patient comorbidities such that expensive episodes
are excluded from EBP incentives.15
    Financial incentives under EBP are potentially strong for obstetricians. Inpatient facility
spending for commercial perinatal care is substantial, suggesting a meaningful change in
financial incentives under EBP (Truven, 2013). Additionally, the majority of OBGYNs are
self employed and generate income from direct patient care, especially overseeing pregnancies
and childbirths (ACOG, 2011).


3        Conceptual Model

In this paper, we are interested in how physicians adjust their treatment intensity in response
to payment reform. We begin with a physician utility model in the style of Ellis and McGuire
(1986), where PAPs maximize utility over profits and patient well-being. We extend the
    13
     Examples include decision making around length of stay or referring patients to high or low price hos-
pitals.
  14
     Medicaid reimburses hospitals for perinatal care on a per-diem basis, causing incentives under EBP to
diverge across payers.
  15
     Relatedly, increased documentation of patient comorbidities will decrease episode spending via risk
adjustment even if the episode is ultimately subject to EBP incentives.


                                                    7
model by relaxing the assumption that PAPs bear the full cost of treatment decisions. In
particular, our model allows PAPs to influence the provision of other health care inputs, for
example referrals to teaching hospitals, without facing the cost and revenue consequences of
those decisions. Under FFS, PAPs maximize utility as follows:


                           U F F S (qd , qi ; β) = π F F S (qd ) + αB(qd , qi ; β)
                                               = R(qd ) − C(qd ) + αB(qd , qi ; β)

where π is the PAP’s profit, B is patient benefit and both functions are concave in treatment
intensity. Patients vary only by their sickness level β and physicians have preferences over
profit and patient benefit according to an agency parameter α ≥ 0. PAPs provide two
types of services: direct services qd that are delivered personally by the PAP, and indirect
services qi that are influenced by the PAP but delivered by a separate provider. Patient
benefit depends on both types of services, but PAP profits depend only on revenues and
costs associated with direct services. Revenues and costs derived from indirect services,
R̂(i) and Ĉ(i), accrue to the provider that renders the treatment, for example a hospital
providing bed days. For simplicity of exposition, we assume that direct and indirect services
are independent in production (Bdi = 0) and that PAP referrals to indirect services are
costless. Utility maximization under FFS yields the following first order conditions:

                                       UdF F S = Rd − Cd + αBd = 0


                                              UiF F S = αBi = 0

where Cd is the marginal resource cost of providing direct services; marginal reimbursement
for direct services, Rd , is driven by fees paid for physician services. These fees are generally
not set by individual physicians. More often, they are dictated by payers who scale Medicare
prices to create fee schedules in the commercial market (McGuire, 2011).16 Because physician
fees are set to cover fixed practice costs, fees are generally above short run marginal cost.
    FFS reimbursement tends to incentivize overprovision of both direct and indirect services.
Because PAPs do not profit from referrals to indirect services, they will choose qi to maximize
patient benefit (Bi = 0), as long as α > 0. Socially optimal provision, in contrast, requires
PAPs to weigh the benefit of treatment against the cost. In the case of direct services, PAPs
will set qd to maximize patient benefit in the special case of economically neutral fees. If fees
are above marginal cost, PAPs may provide services past the point of maximizing patient
 16
      Large physician groups sometimes negotiate fees with payers.

                                                         8
benefit. Taken together, these observations suggest that patient care under the FFS system
is both too high and produced inefficiently ( BBdi = 0 6= CĈdi ).
    The Arkansas EBP model is structured as FFS with reconciliation and effectively makes
two broad adjustments to the FFS model. First, it reduces the marginal reimbursement for
direct services. Second, it imposes partial financial responsibility for indirect care, imposing
negative fees for those services.

                U AR (qd , qi , β̃; β) = π AR (qd , qi , β̃; ∆, Amin , Amax ) + αB(qd , qi ; β)

where Amax and Amin are the maximum and minimum values of the Acceptable spending
range. β̃ is the risk adjustment parameter for the episode. β̃ is driven by documentation
of comorbidities and is therefore a choice variable for the PAP.17 We take β̃ as given in our
model, however, because the risk adjustment algorithm is unknown to us and to providers.
    After payment reform, PAPs generate profits from direct services as before and addition-
ally have a financial stake, ∆, in total (risk-adjusted) episode spending. Importantly, total
episode spending reflects the revenue generated from direct services, R(qd ), and indirect ser-
vices, R̂(qi ). While revenue from indirect services continues to accrue to the provider that
delivers the services, PAPs are held responsible for a portion of the spending via gain- or
risk-sharing. When total spending falls outside of the Acceptable range, PAPs share in 50%
of the savings or excess spending and ∆ = −0.5; otherwise, the profit function simplifies to
its FFS form (∆ = 0).
    Although EBP in Arkansas exhibits discontinuous incentives around the Acceptable
spending thresholds, we treat the PAPs optimization problem as continuous for two reasons.
First, PAPs do not know where their average spending will be relative to these thresholds
at the end of the performance period. Second, the risk adjustment algorithm is unknown
to PAPs, so they do not know with certainty whether adjusted episode spending will fall
outside the Acceptable range. We therefore assume that PAPs maximize utility over an
expectation of ∆ and face a smooth optimization problem characterized by the following
first order conditions:
 17
    We assume that documentation has revenue consequences through risk adjustment but is costless for
PAPs.

                                       UiAR = ∆β̃ R̂i + αBi = 0

Our model has two core predictions. First, EBP creates incentives to reduce provision of
both direct and indirect services. Second, incentives to reduce indirect care are greater than
those to reduce direct care. We derive comparative statics, ∂q         ∂∆
                                                                         d      ∂qi
                                                                           and ∂∆   , formally in the
Appendix. Intuitively, given the continuation of FFS reimbursement under Arkansas EBP, a
decrease in qd will weakly increase profits by reducing the risk-sharing penalty (or increasing
the gainsharing dividend), but this gain will offset by forgone marginal reimbursement for the
direct service, πdF F S . Thus, unless penalties are sufficiently large, reductions in direct service
provision can decrease PAP profits under EBP, even in the Unacceptable and Commend-
able spending ranges. In contrast, reducing the quantity of indirect services unambiguously
increases profits in the Unacceptable and Commendable spending ranges.18,19
    While Arkansas EBP addresses care intensity, it does not necessarily improve productive
efficiency. A formal exposition is included in the Appendix. Intuitively, because financial in-
centives to provide direct and indirect services diverge under FFS, payment reform generally
cannot incentivize productive efficiency by applying one penalty parameter to both types of
services. This result stands in contrast to the incentives for productive efficiency created by
prospective EBP (Ellis and McGuire, 1986).20


4        Data

4.1       Data and Covariates
We use Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters data. The database
is a convenience sample of enrollees in commercial health plans and large self-insured firms.
The Truven data confer several advantages. First, the data include enrollee identifiers,
allowing us to follow patients across time and clinical settings. Second, the data contain
information on actual payments to providers, rather than charges. Third, each observation
    18
      Assuming quality targets are satisfied.
    19
      If we relax our assumption about the independence of service types in production, our model is more
complex. Optimal changes in qd and qi will depend on whether the services are substitutes or complements.
In unreported comparative statics, we show that increases in PAP financial responsibility for care (d∆ < 0)
lead to lower treatment intensity of both direct and indirect services unless the service types are highly
substitutable in production.
   20
      Total patient benefit under EBP may be too high or too low, depending on α, but it will be produced
efficiently.


                                                    10
in the Truven data corresponds to a line in an Explanation of Benefits form, allowing us to
categorize spending into service areas and to distinguish between professional and facility
spending. Lastly, the data include enrollee characteristics such as age, clinical characteristics
and health plan identifiers.
    We use Truven claims data from 2009-2014 to construct the perinatal episodes that
determined PAP performance under EBP in 2013 and 2014, and group perinatal care into
episodes in the pre-intervention period as if EBP had been in effect. We first identify all
live births that occurred between 2010 and 2014, then track the mothers across time and
flag all other claims in the relevant prenatal and postpartum periods. To form our analytic
dataset, we collapse the claims into an episode-level database. We divide episodes into pre-
and post-EBP years according to the date of the birth, following the assignment rule imposed
by payers in Arkansas. Our main analytic sample excludes outlier episodes, namely those
with high-outlier spending, although we test the robustness of our results to this exclusion.
More detail about our sample construction is included in the Appendix.
    For each episode, we construct measures of aggregate spending. Total episode spending is
defined as the sum of all payments during the episode window. We further measure spending
in the following categories: intrapartum inpatient facility (hereafter intrapartum facility),
intrapartum inpatient professional (hereafter intrapartum professional), other inpatient and
total outpatient.21
    We additionally construct measures of utilization for each episode. In the inpatient set-
ting, we measure cesarean section rates and intrapartum LOS. Since LOS outlier definitions
vary by payer and are not observable in the data, we examine intrapartum LOS as an indirect
test of movement around LOS trim points. In the outpatient setting, we identify the three
quality metrics linked to gainsharing and additionally measure screening rates for asymp-
tomatic bacteriuria, hepatitis B and gestational diabetes, which are tracked in the quarterly
reports but not linked to gainsharing. Lastly, we classify episodes as valid or excluded based
on clinical criteria. We categorize an episode as clinically excluded if a disqualifying diagnosis
appears anywhere in a patient’s claims during the episode window.
    The data have several limitations. First, it is not possible to identify payers and we do
not know if perinatal episodes in our sample were covered by AR BCBS or other EBP par-
ticipants. Given the widespread implementation of perinatal EBP in the state, however, we
expect that the program influenced care even among enrollees covered by non-participant in-
surers through spillover effects. That said, to the extent that the Arkansas perinatal episodes
  21
    We could not reliably separate outpatient facility and outpatient professional payments in the Truven
data. Regarding other inpatient spending, we do not know whether the PAP delivers the professional
component of this care (direct service provision), or if the care is delivered by an on call attending physician
(indirect service provision).


                                                      11
in our sample were associated with non-participant insurers, our estimates of the effect of
EBP are likely attenuated. Second, we cannot reliably track providers in the Truven data.
As a result, we cannot link episodes to PAPs nor to the hospital where the childbirth took
place. Relatedly, we cannot characterize PAP responses to EBP according to the proximity
of their pre-EBP spending to Acceptable spending thresholds. Given these limitations, we
focus our analysis on the impact of EBP at the system level rather than the provider level.


5        Methods

We use a DD approach that compares perinatal episodes in Arkansas to episodes in neighbor-
ing states over three pre-implementation years, 2010 to 2012, and two post-implementation
years, 2013 and 2014. While full implementation of perinatal EBP in the commercial market
was not achieved until 2014, we begin our post period in 2013 to capture the effect of partial
implementation and to allow for spillover effects of the Medicaid launch. Since we expect
the effect of EBP in the commercial market to be substantively different in 2013 and 2014,
we estimate the effect of EBP in Arkansas separately for each post-implementation year.
    Our control group is drawn from states in the South Central Census Divisions.22 From
this initial pool of states, we first exclude Tennessee as a potential control based on con-
temporaneous changes in its reimbursement methods for perinatal care and recent volatility
in its insurance markets (Gaither, 2015). We additionally exclude Texas based on its sub-
stantial share of urban hospitals relative to Arkansas.23 Differences in treatment patterns
across rural and urban areas have been well documented (ASPE, 2016). Moreover, many
Texas hospitals are located in large urban centers that have no equivalent in Arkansas. For
each remaining state in the South Central Divisions, we then compare pre-EBP trends in
total episode spending to trends in Arkansas (Table A1). Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana and
Oklahoma have statistically similar trends and are included in the control group, though we
test the robustness of our results to different sets of control states (Table 6).
    We estimate the impact of EBP using the following equation:


                           Ye,s,t = β0 + β1 ARs ∗ 2013t + β2 ARs ∗ 2014t
                                                                                                     (1)
                                       + δXe,s,t + τt + γs + e,s,t

where Ye,s,t measures spending, utilization or exclusion for episode e in state s in quarter t.
    22
    West South Central: Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas. East South Central: Alabama, Kentucky,
Mississippi, Tennessee.
 23
    73% of Texas hospitals and 25% of Arkansas hospitals are categorized as urban (THA, 2017; AHA, 2010).

ARs is an indicator for Arkansas residence. The coefficients of interest, β1 and β2 , measure
the impact of payment reform in 2013 and 2014, respectively. γs and τt are state of residence
and year-quarter fixed effects. Xe,s,t is a vector of covariates including MSA fixed effects,
maternal age bins (under 25, 25-29, 30-34, 35+), clinical characteristics (multiple gestation,
previous cesarean, fetal malpresentation, fetal distress, preterm birth), plan type (HMO,
PPO, POS, HDHP),24 percent cost sharing quartile bins, fixed effects for the state where
the birth took place,25 and maternal policy holder status (policy holder, spouse, dependent).
To determine cost sharing, we calculate each enrollee’s percent contribution to intrapartum
spending, which accounts for the majority of expenditure, and take an average across all
enrollees within a plan; in the Truven data, plan indicates a unique benefit design issued by
a particular insurer, rather than a unique insurer.26
    Following Buntin and Zaslavsky (2004), we model episode spending using a one part
generalized linear model (GLM) with a log link function.27 We apply a modified Park test
(Park, 1966) to determine the variance structure and find that the Gamma distribution is
most appropriate. Binary variables, namely cesarean section rates, outpatient screening rates
and episode exclusion, are estimated using logit models. Intrapartum LOS is estimated using
a Poisson distribution, truncated at zero since LOS is positive by definition. Standard errors
are clustered at the MSA level, allowing for separate clustering within non-metropolitan
areas in each state. Although reimbursement policy varies across states, clustering errors at
the state level could bias our standard errors toward zero given the small number of states
in our analysis (Bertrand et al., 2004).
    We pursue a variety of robustness checks. First, we repeat our analyses using four
alternate control groups, dropping each control state in turn. Second, we test whether our
results are sensitive to our choice of covariates. Third, we re-estimate our models including
high-cost outlier episodes in the sample. Fourth, we assess the possibility that our results
are affected by the contemporaneous implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in
2014. Lastly, we run placebo tests using claims from the study period that were not subject
to EBP incentives.

     The abbreviations are as follows: HMO - health maintenance organization, PPO - preferred provider
organization, POS - point of service, HDHP - high deductible health plan
  25
     The majority of women give birth at a hospital located in their state of residence. In a sensitivity test, we
define an alternative treatment group based on location of the childbirth; our results are largely unaffected
(Table A2).
  26
     When our sample includes only one beneficiary per plan, we necessarily use individual percent cost
sharing as a control, rather than the plan average.
  27
     Total episode spending is positive by definition, as is intrapartum spending. For these spending outcomes,
therefore, the GLM must contend with skewness but not with a mass of zeros.

6     Results

6.1    Descriptive Statistics and Validity of Study Design
Table 1 summarizes characteristics of enrollees in Arkansas and the control states, before
and after EBP implementation. Differences in enrollee characteristics across the treatment
and control groups are small in the pre-EBP period. Prior to EBP, enrollees in Arkansas
are slightly younger, less likely to be the holder of their insurance policies, more likely to
live in a rural area and more likely to have a POS or HD health plan. There is little
evidence of differential changes in enrollee characteristics across EBP implementation. The
gap in maternal age grows in the post-implementation period, and there is a convergence in
the prevalence of HD health plans. The magnitudes of these differences are small and we
otherwise find that enrollee characteristics developed similarly over time.
    The key assumption underlying the DD approach is that the treatment and control groups
would have evolved similarly if not for the implementation of EBP. Although this assumption
cannot be tested, we follow recent empirical literature (Antwi et al., 2015; Kolstad and
Kowalski, 2012; Miller, 2012) and analyze pre-implementation trends to assess the validity
of our design. Figures 1 and 2 plot unadjusted annual means of all spending and utilization
variables, respectively, in Arkansas and the control states. While there is some variation over
time in the pre-EBP period, visual inspection suggests that our outcome variables followed
similar pre-reform trends across Arkansas and the control states.
    We formally analyze pre-implementation trends in Table 2. Using only data from the pre-
EBP period, we test for differential linear trends in all dependent variables. Our specification
follows the main model, but the parameter of interest is an interaction term between an
indicator for Arkansas residence and a linear time trend. The first panel of Table 2 tests for
differential pre-EBP trends in all spending variables. By design, there is no trend difference
in total episode spending between the treatment and control groups. For all other spending
outcomes, we find that Arkansas and the control states exhibit statistically similar trends.
Pre-implementation trends in inpatient utilization, likewise, are similar across the treatment
and control groups. Of the six outpatient quality measures in our study, we find a statistically
significant trend difference only for HIV screening. Based on this difference, we do not pursue
an analysis of HIV screening rates. Overall, the results of our pre-trend test support our
identification strategy.




                                              14
6.2     Effect of EBP on Episode Spending
We begin by considering the effect of EBP on total spending, the primary target of reform.
Regression estimates of Equation 1 are displayed in Table 3. In the first full year of EBP
implementation, we find that total episode spending decreased by 3.8%, or $403, in Arkansas
relative to the control states; we find a smaller, statistically insignificant decrease in total
episode spending during 2013, consistent with attenuated results under partial program
implementation (column 1). Figure 1 shows that these savings were driven by slower spending
growth in Arkansas after EBP implementation, relative to consistent spending growth in the
control states. In columns 2 and 3, we find similar patterns of spending decline among both
valid and excluded episodes. Additionally, we find no evidence of differential changes in the
rate of episode exclusion after the introduction of EBP (column 4), suggesting that gaming
of EBP via episode exclusion was limited.28
    To understand what is driving the decrease in total episode spending, we further estimate
the effect of EBP on episode spending across service categories (Table 3). Consistent with the
predictions of our conceptual model, we find that our results are largely driven by declines
in indirect care, specifically intrapartum facility spending. By 2014, intrapartum facility
spending decreased by 6.6%, or $329, accounting for over 80% of the overall savings (column
5). In columns 6 and 8, we estimate smaller, statistically insignificant decreases of 1.5%
and 1.7% in intrapartum professional spending and outpatient spending, respectively. Our
estimates of the effect of EBP on inpatient spending in the prenatal and postpartum periods
suggest an increase, but the estimates are imprecise (column 7).


6.3     Effect of EBP on Utilization
In Table 4, we study the effect of EBP on utilization patterns. In the inpatient setting,
we find little evidence of changes in treatment patterns. In column 1, we estimate a small,
statistically insignificant decline in the cesarean section rate. We additionally estimate a
negative but statistically insignificant change in intrapartum LOS, consistent with muted
incentives under the DRG system (column 2). Given the reductions in intrapartum facility
spending described previously, the stability of utilization patterns suggests that the spending
reductions are driven by a price effect. We explore this pattern further in the following
section.
    In the outpatient setting, we find that EBP had only modest effects on utilization patterns
(Table 4). While the rate of chlamydia screening increased significantly under EBP, we
  28
     We calculate exclusion rates only for single births because multiple gestation is itself a disqualifying
clinical condition.


                                                     15
find no evidence of changes in screening rates for the other quality measures (columns 3
through 7). These results are unsurprising given the pre-EBP screening rates for each of these
tests. The baseline screening rate for chlamydia was significantly lower than the gainsharing
threshold in the pre-EBP period, incentivizing PAPs to increase their testing rates. Screening
rates for the other four tests were already high relative to the gainsharing threshold in the
pre-EBP period, limiting potential financial gains from increases.


6.4       Intrapartum Facility Care: Price versus Quantity
In Table 5, we decompose the decrease in intrapartum facility spending into price and quan-
tity components. To isolate the price-effect, we modify Equation 1 by adding a fixed effect
for each childbirth DRG.29 The DD estimates from this model are therefore identified off
of variation within a DRG across hospitals. To estimate quantity changes, we standardize
intrapartum facility claims to their median DRG payment, thereby holding prices constant,
and estimate changes using Equation 1. Consistent with our analysis of inpatient utilization,
we find that the decline in intrapartum facility spending is largely a price effect. In column
1, we show that the decline in intrapartum facility spending is mostly unaffected by the
addition of DRG fixed effects, and estimate a price decrease of 6.1%. In column 2, we show
that there was no meaningful change in price-standardized spending under EBP.


7        Robustness Checks

7.1       Total Episode Spending and Inpatient Facility Spending
In this section, we assess the robustness of our results by pursuing a variety of specification
checks, focusing on total episode spending and intrapartum facility spending. We describe
four sets of robustness checks in the main text (Table 6) and include additional checks in the
Appendix (Table A2). First, we explore the sensitivity of our results to the choice of control
group. We construct four alternative control groups by dropping each of the control states in
sequence. In columns 1 through 4, we find that our results are not sensitive to the choice of
controls. All estimated spending reductions are statistically significant, ranging from 3.1%
to 4.2% for total episode spending and 5.6% to 7.7% for intrapartum facility spending.
    29
    The relevant DRGs include: 765 Cesarean Section with complication or comorbidity (CC)/major compli-
cation or comorbidity (MCC); 766 Cesarean Section without CC/MCC; 767 Vaginal Delivery with Steriliza-
tion and/or Dilation and Curettage (D&C); 768 Vaginal Delivery with O.R. Procedure Except Sterilization
and/or D&C; 774 Vaginal Delivery with Complicating Diagnoses; 775 Vaginal Delivery without Complicating
Diagnoses.




                                                  16
    Second, we test whether our results are sensitive to our choice of clinical covariates.
One concern about including clinical covariates is that these measures are endogenous to
physician effort and coding, both of which may be influenced by EBP. Conversely, our
results could be affected by the clinical controls if they are not sufficient to account for
differential changes in enrollee characteristics over time. We address these concerns with
two specification tests. First, we drop all maternal characteristics from our covariate list.
Second, we include an expanded list of maternal covariates, adding anemia, gestational
diabetes, hemorrhage, hypertension and hydraminios. The results of these tests are displayed
in columns 5 and 6. We find that adjusting the clinical controls does not meaningfully change
our results.
    Third, we investigate the impact of excluding episodes with high-outlier spending from
our analytic sample. The purpose of the high-outlier restriction, defined following AR BCBS
guidelines as episodes exceeding three standard deviations above mean spending in a state-
half year cell, is to exclude episodes that fall outside a reasonable scope for EBP incentives
due to severe health complications. We expect that including these episodes in the analytic
sample will attenuate our results. To test the importance of the high-outlier exclusion,
we re-estimate our main model, adding high-outliers back into the analytic sample. The
results are displayed in column 7. When we include high-outliers, we estimate a statistically
insignificant decrease in total episode spending of 2.6% and a statistically significant decrease
of 6.5% in intrapartum facility spending.
    Lastly, we assess the possibility that our results are affected by the contemporaneous
implementation of the ACA in 2014. Since our analysis focuses on the large group market,
the most pressing concern is that large employers in Arkansas were more likely to drop
coverage under the ACA than employers in the control states. We present two pieces of
evidence that suggest employer coverage declines are not a large factor in our analysis.
First, data from the Kaiser Family Foundation show that employer shares in the commercial
insurance market in Arkansas remained stable across ACA implementation, suggesting little
scope for changes in employer insurance offers (KFF, 2014a). Second, our analytic sample
relies on a stable subset of employers and the number of deliveries in our sample remains
stable throughout the study period (Figure A2); we would expect to see a decrease in covered
deliveries over time if employer coverage offers were changing.


7.2    Intrapartum Facility Prices
Next, we test the robustness of our estimated change in intrapartum facility prices. One
concern with our analysis is that we are picking up the effects of a general price decrease in


                                               17
Arkansas relative to the control states, rather than a reduction in perinatal facility prices
more specifically. To address this concern, we estimate a series of placebo regressions. We
construct a sample of surgical inpatient admissions that fell outside of EBP incentives and
randomly select DRGs until we have at least 40,472 observations, matching our main analytic
sample.30 We then estimate the change in inpatient facility prices among these placebo
DRGs, testing the hypothesis that EBP had no effect in 2014. We repeat this procedure a
thousand times, generating a p-value for each iteration. The results of our placebo tests are
plotted in Figure 3. The dashed vertical line denotes a p-value of 0.05 and the solid vertical
line denotes the p-value from our analysis of perinatal inpatient facility prices (0.005). In
approximately 96% of the placebo DRG samples, the change in intrapartum facility prices is
not significant at traditional levels, consistent with a correct null hypothesis and uniformly
distributed p-values. Likewise, about 99% of the placebo tests yield a p-value larger than
the p-value associated with the intrapartum facility price change. Overall, the placebo tests
support the validity of our empirical strategy.


8        Understanding the Decline in Intrapartum Facility Prices

In this section, we explore the mechanism behind the decline in intrapartum facility prices.
A price decrease in this setting is consistent with two broad patterns of change: (1) a shift
in referral patterns favoring low-price hospitals and (2) a decrease in negotiated rates for
inpatient perinatal care in Arkansas relative to the control states. Given the limitations of
the provider identifiers in the Truven data, we are unable to test either of these mechanisms
directly. Discussions with AR BCBS likewise did not point definitively to either explanation.
With these limitations in mind, we develop indirect tests of the two potential mechanisms.
The findings from these tests are consistent with a shift in referral patterns but not lower
negotiated hospital rates.


8.1       Referral Patterns
In the context of perinatal care and intrapartum facility prices, a change in referral patterns
amounts to PAPs delivering more babies at low-price hospitals. A volume shift of this kind
could occur if (1) PAPs changed their hospital affiliations to low-price facilities or (2) PAPs
with existing affiliations at low-price facilities expanded their practice, stealing volume from
    30
   We drop all maternity related admissions in addition to surgical admissions that were subject to their
own EBP program.




                                                   18
neighboring hospitals.31 In either case, a change in referral patterns requires that a market
has multiple hospitals for PAPs and patients to choose from.32
    If price decreases are driven by changing referral patterns, we would expect to find larger
effects in multi-hospital markets. We test this prediction, defining markets based on MSA,
the smallest geography available in the Truven data. Within Arkansas, MSAs surrounding
Little Rock, Fayetteville, Fort Smith and Jonesboro qualify as multi-hospital markets (ADH,
2015; CMS, 2015).33 Because MSAs are geographically larger than Hospital Service Areas
(HSA), our definition of multi-hospital markets overstates the number of enrollees that truly
have multiple hospitals available to them. To the extent that we include enrollees from single
hospital HSAs in multi-hospital MSAs, our estimates of the price change in multi-hospital
markets will be attenuated.
    Table 7 presents price change estimates within single- and multi-hospital markets. To
generate these results, we split the Arkansas episodes into separate treatment groups ac-
cording to market type and estimate price changes relative to the full control group in two
regressions. Consistent with a change in referral patterns, we find that intrapartum facil-
ity prices fell by 8.7% in multi-hospital Arkansas markets, relative to prices in surrounding
states, and that there was little change in single-hospital MSAs.
    Next, we consider the magnitude of referral changes necessary to generate the price
decreases in our analysis. Health Care Pricing Project data on the Little Rock Hospital
Referral Region (HRR) shows that the price of perinatal inpatient care is approximately
$3,000 higher at the most expensive hospital in the market compared to the least expensive
hospital (Cooper et al., 2015a).34 This price difference holds within both vaginal and cesarean
deliveries. If PAPs can save $3,000 by shifting patients from the highest-priced hospital in a
market to the lowest-priced hospital, back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that referring
approximately 15% of patients in this manner would account for an 8.7% savings on inpatient
facility spending.35
  31
     It is relatively common for OBGYNs to have multiple hospital affiliations. In 2014 CMS Physician
Compare data, approximately 40% of obstetricians in Arkansas had more than one hospital affiliation.
  32
     We assume that cross-market movement in this setting is minimal. Given the clinical acuity of childbirth,
we expect that patients travel across markets only if they have specific medical needs.
  33
     Multi-hospital markets include the following MSAs: Little Rock-North Little Rock-Conway, Hot Springs,
Pine Bluff, Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers, Fort Smith and Jonesboro. We exclude the Memphis and
Texarkana MSAs from the multi-hospital group. Although these MSAs contain multiple hospitals, they
do not contain multiple hospitals in Arkansas. We expect movement of hospital affiliations across state lines
to be limited, since such movement requires separate medical licenses for each state.
  34
     Data are from 2008-2011. Pricing information for other Arkansas HRRs and for HSAs is not public.
  35
     Data from the Health Care Utilization Project Network show that there were 13,198 commercially insured
deliveries in Arkansas in 2012. Our analysis of the Truven data finds that inpatient facility spending on
commercially insured births is $4,999 on average, implying that an 8.7% savings amounts to approximately
$5.7 million. Thus, an 8.7% savings can be achieved by shifting approximately 1,913 deliveries from the

    Our back-of-the-envelope calculations rely on several assumptions. First, we assume that
hospital price variation is similar across multi-hospital HRRs. Second, we assume that the
highest price hospital provides care to at least 15% of patients, and that these patients can
be accommodated at the lowest price hospital. Regarding this second assumption, we note
that there is significant variation in prices beyond differences between the highest and lowest
price hospitals; savings via referral pattern changes need not be driven by shifts from the
most to least expensive hospital, although these savings are by definition the largest.


8.2     Negotiated Hospital Rates
Next, we test whether our results are consistent with a decrease in negotiated rates for
inpatient intrapartum care in Arkansas.36 During our study period, AR BCBS negotiated a
single base rate for each hospital in Arkansas and used Medicare Severity-DRG (MS-DRG)
weights to dictate the spread of prices across clinical conditions.37 Given this structure
of AR BCBS-hospital negotiations, lower negotiated rates for perinatal care would have
necessarily been accompanied by broader, hospital-level price changes. Our placebo tests
find no evidence of an across-the-board price decrease in Arkansas; moreover, AR BCBS
confirmed that hospitals did not accept lower rates from the insurer in 2014. Our findings
thus suggest that lower negotiated hospital rates are unlikely.


9     Discussion

In this paper, we study physician responses to bundled payment incentives relative to FFS
reimbursement. We study a mandatory EBP program in Arkansas that covered the vast
majority of births in the state and evaluate physician responses in the commercial market.
We find that EBP in Arkansas led to a 3.8% decline in total episode spending, driven by
a change in physician management of hospital care. In particular, we estimate that spend-
ing on intrapartum facility services decreased by 6.6% in Arkansas, relative to surrounding
states, and find that the reduction was largely a price effect. Outside of intrapartum facility
spending, we find little evidence of changes in care under EBP. We estimate statistically
insignificant reductions in inpatient professional spending and outpatient spending. In anal-
yses of inpatient utilization patterns, we find no statistically significant changes in cesarean
section rates or in LOS. Out of five outpatient quality measures, we find evidence of improve-
highest price to lowest price hospital.
  36
     Although relatively large price changes in multi-hospital MSAs are consistent with referral shifts, they
do not rule out changes in negotiated rates.
  37
     Thank you to AR BCBS for clarification on this point.

ment in only one, chlamydia screening rates, where baseline performance was low. Extensive
sensitivity tests support our main conclusions.
    As payers continue to debate the expansion of bundled payment, our analysis suggests
that EBP can be successful on a large scale. The magnitude of our results, however, indi-
cates that system-wide bundled payment may have a modest impact compared to effects seen
within smaller, voluntary programs. At 3.8% savings overall, our estimates are comparable
to evaluations of the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative that include all par-
ticipants (Dummitt et al., 2016) and results from large population-based payment programs
such as Accountable Care Organizations (McWilliams et al., 2015) and early implementation
of the Alternative Quality Contract (Song et al., 2012, 2011). Our results are significantly
smaller than savings achieved by small, selected groups of providers (Navathe et al., 2017;
Casale et al., 2007; Cromwell et al., 1997). More generally, our results contribute to a growing
empirical literature on physician agency and basis of payment, showing that such financial
incentives affect physician behavior (Jensen, 2014; Schmitz, 2013; Hennig-Schmidt et al.,
2011; Barro and Beaulieu, 2003).
    Our results have several implications for efforts to expand bundled payment reforms.
First, our work suggests that EBP arrangements can improve management of health care
inputs. These results are generally consistent with literature documenting the effect of
physician payment reform on hospital referral patterns (Alexander, 2016; Ho and Pakes, 2014;
Dusheiko et al., 2006) and with studies of bundled payment demonstrations that observe
changes in the use of medical devices (Navathe et al., 2017) and post acute care (Dummitt
et al., 2016), rather than changes in direct care provision by the accountable provider. While
we identify a change in spending driven by inpatient facility prices, we are unable to test
directly for an underlying mechanism. We provide preliminary evidence that a change in
referral patterns is a likely cause and encourage future work to consider the intersection of
EBP reforms and provider market share.
    Second, our work argues that modern EBP structures, namely FFS with reconciliation,
impose different incentives than prospective EBP. In particular, the continuation of FFS
reimbursement creates differential incentives for accountable providers to reduce direct care
provision and to manage other health care inputs. From an implementation standpoint, this
observation suggests that the designation of the accountable provider will influence the types
of savings achieved.
    Third, our results highlight potential challenges to coordinating compensation reform
across payers. While multi-payer reforms can avoid the “free-rider” problem, designing
meaningful incentives can be difficult if there are large differences in treatment patterns
across insurance markets. For example, if commercially insured patients receive high quality


                                              21
care relative to Medicaid patients, then applying the same quality incentives across both
populations places a higher burden of change on providers with a large Medicaid patient
panel and does little to improve quality in the commercial market, although it minimizes
administrative burden on providers.38 Moreover, EBP in the commercial market incentivizes
physicians to adjust both the quantity and price of care, causing incentives to diverge from
an identically designed EBP program in a public insurance market.
    Our analysis has several limitations and suggests potential avenues for future work. First,
we focus on the effect of EBP in one clinical area and the results may not be applicable to
EBP more generally. Perinatal care centers around an acute hospitalization, is typically
under the direction of one provider and has a high and stable volume of episodes. The
effect of EBP and challenges surrounding implementation will likely be different for chronic
conditions, especially those that are predominantly outpatient based. Second, we are not
able to identify providers or health plans in the Truven data; it will be useful for future work
to address this gap and examine the effects of EBP at the provider level. Third, our analysis
of quality is limited to outpatient process measures. Future work can expand upon these
results by studying the effect of EBP on patient outcomes. Lastly, like all DD studies, our
results rely on specific assumptions about the absence of unobserved shocks. We address
this concern with a number of sensitivity analyses and our results are robust, but caution in
interpreting any single study is warranted.
    Growing discontent with the FFS system raises important questions about which payment
reforms are most appropriate and how well those payment reforms will work. We present
evidence that EBP can be effective in reducing spending on perinatal care. While our results
are from a specific clinical context, our paper highlights benefits and challenges to bundled
payment reform that are more general. Understanding if EBP incentives can be appropriately
designed and implemented across diverse clinical settings and heterogeneous provider groups
is a natural avenue for future research.




  38
     Relatedly, EBP programs must balance imposing meaningful incentives for change with provider buy-in
(Hussey et al., 2011). The quality incentives included in the final version of EBP in Arkansas were scaled
back from initial discussions due to concerns in the provider community (APII, 2011). While a redesign of
incentives could more meaningfully address quality of care in the commercial market, such a change would
likely face similar challenges.

     coefficients with standard errors in parentheses. Standard errors are clustered on MSA. Control states include Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana and
     Oklahoma. Covariates include maternal characteristics, plan characteristics, and state and MSA fixed effects. Spending variables are modeled using
     a one part GLM with a log link and a gamma distribution. Episode exclusion, cesarean section rates and outpatient screening metrics are estimated
     using logit functions. LOS is modeled as a Poisson truncated at zero. Episode exclusion is based on clinical criteria among episodes with single births;
     multiple gestation is sufficient to exclude episodes from EBP incentives. Intrapartum refers to the entire childbirth hospitalization. To estimate trends
     in other inpatient spending, we forced model convergence after 50 iterations and the results should be interpreted with caution. Screening rates for
     group B strep, chlamydia and HIV are linked to gainsharing. * p<.05; ** p<.01; *** p<0.001

     Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana and Oklahoma and (2) covariates include maternal characteristics, plan characteristics, and state and MSA fixed
     effects, where maternal clinical characteristics include multiple gestation, previous cesarean, fetal malpresentation, fetal distress, and preterm birth.
     In columns 1 to 4, we drop each control state in sequence. In column 5, expanded clinical controls include anemia, gestational diabetes, hemorrhage,
     hypertension and hydrominios. In column 6, we drop all maternal clinical characteristics from the model. In column 7, we include high outliers in
     our sample, defined as episodes with total spending more than three standard deviations above the mean within a state-half year cell. * p<.05; **

Appendix

A1     Sample Construction

As described in the main text, we construct perinatal episodes using Truven claims data
from 2009-2014. We identify all live births between 2010 and 2014 and combine all claims
in the prenatal and postpartum periods for each birth. Episodes triggered by births in the
last two months of 2014 have partial coverage of the postpartum period. Likewise, episodes
triggered by births in the first 9 months of 2010 have partial coverage of the prenatal period
if the enrollee appears in the Truven data in 2010 but not 2009 (e.g., because their employer
began contributing data in 2010).
     Our episode construction process mirrors the AR BCBS algorithm except for four devia-
tions. First, for a live birth to trigger an episode, AR BCBS requires both a relevant Current
Procedural Terminology (CPT) code for physician services and a relevant DRG code for fa-
cility services. We relax this restriction and allow a relevant DRG code to trigger an episode,
even when a relevant CPT code is not present. Second, in the prenatal and postpartum pe-
riods, the AR BCBS episode includes all inpatient and outpatient claims with a pregnancy
classification according to the Episode Treatment Grouper algorithm. We do not have access
to this grouper and instead include all claims in the relevant episode window. Third, the
AR BCBS episode includes pharmacy claims and we chose to exclude this spending from
the analysis. The Truven databases do not include information about potential rebates for
drug payments and the prices are likely overstated. Fourth, AR BCBS counts screening
tests toward quality metrics if they are conducted during the prenatal period. We calculate
screening rates based on tests conducted in the outpatient setting at any time in the episode
window.
     Because Truven provides a convenience sample of claims that varies across years, our
analysis requires several data restrictions to make our episode sample comparable over time.
In particular, we subset the database to records from Truven’s employer clients that contin-
uously contributed their data between 2010 and 2014. As shown in Figure A1, the volume
of Arkansas episodes from non-continuous Truven clients drops in 2013 and 2014, making it
impossible to distinguish the effect of EBP from the effect of the changing sample. Among
the continuous contributors, Truven advised us to include data from employer clients only.
As demonstrated in Figure A1, health plan clients can add or subtract customers from their
contribution over time and still be labeled continuous contributors by Truven.
     From the continuous employer contributors, we obtain our main sample by removing
episodes based on the following criteria: (1) maternal age less than 10 or greater than


                                              37
55, (2) negative spending in any location-service category, (3) zero professional or facility
spending during the intrapartum period, (4) more than one episode trigger during any day
in the sample, (5) missing plan type information and (6) overlapping episode timelines, i.e.,
beneficiaries with pregnancies less than 11 months apart. Episode counts from our main
sample are displayed in Figure A2.


A2     Control Group Selection

To select our control group, we compare pre-period spending trends in Arkansas to a pool
of candidate control states and select the states where there was no statistical difference
in the trends. Our specification follows the main model, but our parameter of interest is
an interaction between a linear time trend and a vector of indicator variables for residence
in each potential control state. Of our five candidate states, all but Mississippi passed the
differential trends test (Table A1).


A3     Additional Robustness Tests

To build on the robustness checks described in the main text, we test the sensitivity of our
spending estimates to additional modeling choices (Table A2). First, we test if our spending
estimates are sensitive to covariate selection outside of maternal clinical characteristics. We
find that our estimates are largely unaffected when we drop plan characteristics as covariates
(column 1) and when we drop MSA fixed effects (column 2).
    Second, we test if our results are sensitive to functional form. In columns 3 and 4, we
run two OLS models, with untransformed spending and log transformed spending as the
dependent variables, respectively. Our total spending estimates range from a statistically
insignificant decline of 2.8%, using log transformed spending, to a statistically significant
decline of 6.4% using untransformed spending. For inpatient facility spending, we find sta-
tistically significant decreases in both specifications.
    Third, we test the sensitivity of our results to our definition of treatment exposure. In
our main sample, we assign enrollees to treatment according to their state of residence. To
the extent that Arkansas residents gave birth at out of state hospitals, where EBP incentives
are less salient, our analysis underestimates the effect of EBP. Likewise, if control group
residents gave birth at Arkansas hospitals and were exposed to the policy treatment, our
estimates are biased toward the null. To address this concern, we re-run our analysis using
a subset of enrollees where treatment and control assignment is unambiguous: those that
gave birth at an in-state hospital. Our results are displayed in column 5. We find that our


                                              38
results are not meaningfully changed.
    Next, we test whether our inpatient facility price analysis is confounded by contempo-
raneous changes in DRG weights over time. Given that AR BCBS employs the MS-DRG
system (AR BCBS 2014), changes in DRG weights will affect our analysis if two conditions
hold: (1) payers in the control states did not employ the MS-DRG weight system and (2)
the weights for perinatal care changed differentially across systems over time. We find little
evidence that these conditions hold. First, we do not find evidence that commercial payers
in the control states used other DRG systems available in the market, namely the All Patient
or All Patient Refined DRG systems (3M, 2016). Second, we do not find that changes in
MS-DRG weights during our study period align with our estimated price decreases. Specifi-
cally, MS-DRG weights decreased in 2014 only for cesarean deliveries. We analyze the effect
of EBP on the price of natural births and continue to find evidence of a price reduction
(Table A3).
    Lastly, we assess the possibility that our results are confounded by a contemporaneous
growth in a low-price insurer in Arkansas or by the closure of high-price hospitals. We
find little evidence of such market changes in Arkansas. Examining trends in the large group
insurance market, we find that payers like AR BCBS, United and QCA maintained relatively
steady shares in Arkansas during our study period (KFF, 2014b).39 In the hospital market,
we find evidence of only one hospital closure in Arkansas under EBP, and it did not close
until September 2014 (Brantley, 2014).


A4      Conceptual Model

In this section, we consider the PAP’s utility maximization problem under Arkansas pay-
ment reform in more detail. Following Ellis and McGuire (1986), PAPs maximize utility
over profits and patient benefit according to an agency parameter α. Recall the first order
conditions for utility maximization under Arkansas EBP:

                                  UdAR = πdF F S + ∆β̃Rd + αBd = 0


                                       UiAR = ∆β̃ R̂i + αBi = 0
  39
    With two exceptions, the large group market was relatively stable in the control states during our study
period. In Kentucky, Wellpoint increased their market share from 60% in 2011 to 69% in 2014. In Louisiana,
Aetna increased their market share in 2014, replacing Coventry as the market’s third largest payer. Since
our results are driven by changes in Arkansas, rather than the control states, we do not think that these
market share changes are driving our results.




                                                    39
To predict how optimal qd and qi change under FFS with reconciliation, we fully differentiate
the first order conditions with respect to ∆. Recalling that ∆ = 0 at baseline, we derive the
following comparative statics:

                                     ∂qd     −β̃Rd
                                         = FFS     AR
                                     ∂∆   πdd + αBdd

                                         ∂qi   −β̃ R̂i
                                             =
                                         ∂∆    αBiiAR
where concavity implies that second own derivatives are negative, and marginal reimburse-
ment for care is positive. Thus we find that ∂q   d
                                                 ∂∆
                                                          ∂qi
                                                     and ∂∆   are unambiguously positive, con-
firming an intuitive result that a reduction in ∆ (increase in the risk-sharing penalty) will
reduce care provision. As discussed in the main text, the optimal change in care provision
differs across direct and indirect services because of the continuation of FFS reimbursement.
                                                                            FFS
In particular, the incentive to change qd is muted by the presence of πdd       in the denomi-
               ∂qd      ∂qi
nator. Both ∂∆ and ∂∆ grow with marginal reimbursement levels (reflecting the fact that
savings from service reductions are larger if those services are expensive) and are restrained
by changes in patient benefit that accompany adjustments to care provision.
    Relatedly, we find that FFS with reconciliation will not generally incentivize efficient care
provision. From the first order conditions, we can characterize equilibrium care provision as
follows:

                                 Bi      −∆β̃ R̂i    Ĉi
                                    =             6=
                                 Bd     F F S
                                      −πd − ∆β̃Rd    Cd
Under FFS with reconciliation, treatment is provided such that the ratio of the marginal ben-
efit functions equals the ratio of marginal reimbursements; productive efficiency, in contrast,
requires equivalence with the ratio of marginal costs.
