                                              ABSTRACT

We propose a Bayesian factor analysis model as an alternative to the Human Development Index (HDI).
Our model provides methodology which can either augment or build additional indices. In addition
to addressing potential issues of the HDI, we estimate human development with three auxiliary variables
capturing environmental health and sustainability, income inequality, and satellite observed nightlight.
We also use our method to build a Millennium Development Goals (MDG) index as an example of
constructing a more complex index. We find the “living standard” dimension provides a greater contribution
to human development than the official HDI suggests, while the “longevity” dimension provides a
lower proportional contribution. Our results also show considerable levels of disagreement relative
to the ranks of official HDI. We report the sensitivity of our method to different specifications of spatial
correlation, cardinal-to-ordinal data transforms, and data imputation procedures, along with the results
of a simulated data exercise.

1. Introduction

Designed as a ranking system to track global human development, the Human Development Index

(HDI) was first introduced in 1990 by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in

their now annual series of annual Human Development Reports (HDR’s). Prior to the HDI’s initial

publication, GDP, GDP per capita, and GNP had long served as the primary indicators of

development for academics, policymakers, and other interested parties; but each lacked something

the UNDP saw as vital to fully understanding global development - the human factor. Defined by

the first HDR as, “…the process of enlarging people’s choices” (UNDP, 1990), human

development is simply any method by which nations expand or strengthen their citizens’ access to

human capital building resources. Human development theory places emphasis on people being

the beneficiaries of development rather than simply a means to an end. Based on this notion, the

HDI formulates its national ranks using three key indicators which are believed to reflect a

country’s human development level: longevity, education, and decency of living standards.2

      In the decades since its introduction, the HDI has come to serve as the standard for government

agencies, private industry professionals, development groups, and academic researchers interested

in studying and comparing national levels of human development. During a session in 2006, the

National Congress of Indonesian Human Development restated their use of HDI as an economic

indicator of development outcomes and the satisfaction of basic human living needs (Fattah and

Muji, 2012). The government of Ireland also provides more development aid to countries classified

as being “low human development” by the HDI (O’Neill, 2005; Wolff et al., 2011). In private

industry, the pharmaceutical company Merck sells drugs at a significant discount to nearly all



2
    For a more detailed account of the rationale behind the design of the first HDI, see Anand and Sen (1994).

                                                            2
countries categorized as “low human development” (Petersen and Rother, 2001; Wolff et al.,

2011). Additionally, there have been proposals when designing international climate change policy

that each country’s HDI ranking should be factored into their reduction obligations for greenhouse

gas emissions (Hu, 2009; Wolff et al., 2011). In research, the HDI is widely used as an alternative

to traditional economic indicators when evaluating a nation’s relative level of human development

(Anand and Ravallion, 1993; Easterlin, 2000). Furthermore, the HDI is not only heavily utilized

by economists and other social scientists, but a broad range of academic disciplines including the

medical research community.3

    With the HDI’s position as a top index now solidified through time and use, it serves as a

worthwhile exercise to reevaluate its formulation. When studied critically, the HDI has several

technical issues which we seek to address. For example, the three indicators used to calculate the

official HDI are assigned deterministic weights relating to the proportional contribution they are

assumed to provide towards a nation’s human development level. This deterministic weighting is

not informed by available data, but rather by expert opinion regarding potential effects.

Additionally, the HDI does not provide a measure of uncertainty in their rankings; implying that

each published list of the official HDI is only one subset of many possible rankings. A considerable

number of previous studies have attempted to address these concerns as well as others with

methods to correct for deterministic weights across dimensions (Ravallion, 2012), and lack of

uncertainty from measurement error, index structure, and formula volatility (Noorbakhsh, 1998;

Morse, 2003a; Wolff et al., 2009). Abayomi and Pizarro (2013) utilize a Bayesian framework to



3
  For instance, the relationship between the HDI and health has been studied extensively in topics such as: cancer
(Bray et al., 2012), infant and maternal death (Lee et al., 1997), depressive episodes (Cifuentes et al., 2008), kidney
cancer incidents and incident-to-mortality rates (Patel et al., 2012), suicide (Shah, 2009), and prevalence of physical
inactivity (Dumith et al., 2011).


                                                          3
generate confidence intervals for the HDI with the goal of incorporating uncertainty by first

assuming prior distributions for both the underlying data and variable weights, and then examining

the posterior replicates. In an even more relevant study to our paper, Hoyland et al. (2012) also

adopt a Bayesian factor analysis model; but it differs from our methodology in that they allow for

correlations among indicators by first assuming correlations among the factor loadings of the

HDI’s four manifest variables.

    This paper adopts a Bayesian factor analysis model which was initially developed to address

many of the same concerns present in the Material Deprivation Index (Hogan and Tchernis, 2004).4

The model assumes an underlying latent variable, a factor representing the level of human

development, which manifests in the observed measures. Theory suggests which observed

variables the factor influences, but data inform the degree of relative influence human development

has on each variable as opposed to expert opinion. We summarize the results of our model by

computing the posterior distribution of ranks for all countries which we then present with

confidence intervals. These confidence intervals give a more holistic view of a nation’s standing

relative to its peers given the inherent uncertainty of the estimation process. To alter the uncertainty

of our estimation, we also include measures of spatial correlation and national population. Spatial

correlation is often used in the related literature as it allows for the incorporation of potential

spillover effects from other factors which are highly correlated with HDI (Eberhardt et al., 2013;

Ertur and Koch, 2011; Conley and Ligon, 2002; Keller, 2002).5 Country populations enter the

  The same model has also been used to measure county health rankings for Wisconsin and Texas (Courtemanche et
al., 2015).
5
  The spatial dependence of HDI is based on existing empirical and theoretical literatures. Research and development
or long-run economic growth, both of which could be correlated with each factor of the index, has the documented
potential for international spillovers (Eberhardt et al., 2013; Ertur and Koch, 2011; Conley and Ligon, 2002; Keller,
2002). Additionally, Malczewski (2010) shows that there are statistically significant geographical groups of high and
low life expectancies in Poland.

                                                         4
model in a way which reflects the a priori assumption that the data of more highly populated

nations harbor less uncertainty relative to less populous nations.

       Finally, one of the HDI’s primary limitations concerns its inability to add or remove

variables without fundamentally altering the measure. Given that different sets of variables may

capture different dimensions of human development, the official HDI’s rigidity hinders its ability

to evaluate performance under various theoretical considerations.6 We illustrate the flexibility of

our model to the inclusion of additional data and theory in two ways. First, we include three new

variables capturing a nation’s level of environmental health and sustainability, income inequality,

and satellite observed nightlight. By including each of these three variables, we capture dimensions

of human development which current theory believes to be important but the official HDI does not

account for. Second, our general method is also easily utilized when trying to construct new indices.

To illustrate the process of formulating an entirely new index, we construct an “MDG index” using

data from the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG).7 Since the MDG’s primary

purpose was to track international progress in human development across time, we can consider it

as an alternative measure of human development to the HDI. Furthermore, since the MDG’s

variables more directly relate to the human development outcomes of developing countries, our

index provides valuable information regarding the relative performance of low development level

nations which the official HDI’s observed variables may not capture. Given the complex and

decentralized nature of the MDG’s design, a considerable quantity of prior research also attempts




6
  An example of the need to evaluate different specifications of human development can be seen in UNDP (2010),
where an inequality adjusted HDI, gender inequality index, and multidimensional poverty index must each be derived
separately using the general framework of the official HDI.

2. Methods

2.1 Methods of the official HDI

Before discussing our methods, we first summarize the methodology used by the UNDP to

calculate the official HDI. Since 2010, the HDI has constructed its three development indicators

using four manifest variables: life expectancy at birth (𝐿𝐸), mean years of schooling (𝑀𝑌𝑆),

expected years of schooling (𝐸𝑌𝑆), and purchasing power-adjusted real Gross National Income

(GNI) per capita (𝐺𝑁𝐼𝑝𝑐).8

    First, the development indicators are calculated and normalized using the HDI’s four observed

variables. The indicators are the Life Expectancy Index (𝐿𝐸𝐼), Education Index (𝐸𝐼), and Income

Index (𝐼𝐼). Each indicator is measured using the following method:

                                                                          𝐿𝐸 − 20

                                                                          85 − 20
                                                                  𝑀𝑌𝑆𝐼 + 𝐸𝑌𝑆𝐼
                                  𝐸𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥(𝐸𝐼) =
                                                                       2
                                                                                                                 (2)
                                             𝑀𝑌𝑆                      𝐸𝑌𝑆
                                      𝑀𝑌𝑆𝐼 =     ,             𝐸𝑌𝑆𝐼 =

8
 Following its introduction in 1990, the HDI has seen several alterations to its formulation. Some changes have been
minor, but a considerable revision occurred in 2010. Prior to 2010, the four variables used to construct HDI were life
expectancy at birth (longevity), adult literacy rate (education), combined educational enrollment (education), and
purchasing power-adjusted real GDP per capita (living standard). We refer interested readers to UNDP (2010) for
more information regarding the change.

After calculating the three development indicators, the geometric mean of each country’s

indicators constitutes its official HDI score using the formula below:

                                              3
                                      𝐻𝐷𝐼 = √𝐿𝐸𝐼 ∗ 𝐸𝐼 ∗ 𝐼𝐼

   With this method, each HDI score ranges from 0 to 1. Following the designation of each

nation’s raw HDI score, countries are ranked and categorized into one of the following four

development tiers: “very high development” (HDI ≥0.8), “high development” (HDI 0.7-0.8),

“medium development” (HDI 0.55-0.7), and “low development” (HDI <0.55).




2.2 Proposed model

The official HDI harbors several technical issues which we seek to address, including: the use of

ad hoc factor weightings, having no convenient way to include different sets of observed variables,

no measure of uncertainty in rankings, no measure of spatial correlation between nations, and no

way to account for the effect of country population differences. Alternatively, our hierarchical

factor analysis model with spatial correlation address each of these technical issues.

   Before adding either spatial correlation or population, our basic factor analysis model is

specified as:


                                       𝑌𝑖𝑗 = 𝜇𝑗 + 𝜆𝑗 𝛿𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗                                   (4)


where 𝑌𝑖𝑗 represents observed manifest variable 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝐽 of country 𝑖 = 1, . . , 𝑁 ; 𝜇𝑗 is the

average across countries of manifest variable 𝑗; 𝛿𝑖 is a latent factor representing a country’s level

                                                  7
of human development, and therefore our model based index values; 𝜆𝑗 is the factor loading for

variable 𝑗, and represents the covariance between the latent development measure, 𝛿𝑖 , and the

manifest variable 𝑌𝑖𝑗 ; and finally 𝜀𝑖𝑗 ~𝑁(0, 𝜎𝑗2 ) is the model’s normally distributed idiosyncratic

error term.


    The model relies on the assumption that 𝜀𝑖𝑗 ’s be both independently and identically distributed,

implying that all manifest variables, 𝑌𝑖𝑗 , are correlated with one another only through the nation’s

latent development factor, 𝛿𝑖 . As spoken to in the initial 1990 Human Development Report (UNDP

1990), each of the variables used to calculate the official HDI are supposedly outcomes which are

directly determined by a country’s level of human development. If each manifest variable is indeed

a reflection of human development, our method is justified in assuming that the shared covariance

between a country’s manifest variables can be used to estimate their level of human development.

The basic factor analysis model also assumes factor scores to be normally distributed,

𝛿𝑖 ~𝑁(0, 1 ).9

    The next step in developing our full model is incorporating spatial correlation. We use a

Conditionally Autoregressive (CAR) model which specifies the relationship between factor scores

for both a country, 𝑖, and its neighbors. While “neighbors” can be defined in many ways, our

primary results use a simple specification based on adjacency in terms of either a land or maritime

connection. 10 We define the set of neighbors for country 𝑖 as ℛ𝑖 , and specify the conditional

distribution of the country’s factor score in the following way:



9
  A potential alternative to the assumption that 𝛿𝑖 be normally distributed involves estimation using a mixture factor
analysis model. Such a model is presented in Wall et al. (2012), but the authors find that both the standard and mixture
factor analysis models produce minimally biased results when using continuous manifest variables in a simulated data
exercise.
10
   We also estimate our model using a different specification of spatial correlation built using trade between countries
to identify neighbors in Section 5.

                                                           8
                                                                                                      (5)
                                              𝛿𝑖 |𝛿𝑗 ~𝑁 ( ∑ 𝜔𝛿𝑗 , 𝜈)
                                                           𝑗∈ℛ𝑖


where 𝜔 measures the degree of spatial correlation, and the conditional variance, 𝜈, captures any

residual variation.

       The addition of spatial correlation has two attractive properties. First, it intuitively defines the

relationship between neighboring countries through the distribution mean of factor scores;

implying that the average development level of a country’s geographic neighbors partially

determines its own level of development. Alternative models could include additional levels of

dependence through both the conditional mean and conditional variance, but these are not

statistically identified within a factor analysis model.11 Second, by setting the conditional variance

such that 𝜈 = 1, our conditional specification results in a simple marginal distribution for the

vector of factor scores:


                                               𝛿~N(0, (𝐼 − 𝜔𝑊)−1 )                                    (6)


where 𝑊 is an 𝑁 × 𝑁 “neighbor matrix” such that 𝑊𝑖𝑘 = 𝑊𝑘𝑖 = 1 if a country 𝑘 is adjacent to

country 𝑖 in terms of either land or maritime connections, and 𝑊𝑖𝑘 = 0 otherwise. Additionally,

𝑊𝑖𝑖 = 0. It is also important to note that since the covariance matrix of 𝛿 is a full matrix under this

specification, all countries are correlated with one another even if they do not share a common

border. Additionally, given that 𝑊 determines the covariance matrix for 𝛿, it is required to be

symmetric. Even though 𝑊 is a symmetric matrix, however, the estimated impacts of spatial



11
     For a more detailed discussion of this, see Hogan and Tchernis (2004).

                                                           9
correlation for two countries sharing a border are not necessarily the same.12 For example, the

contribution of spatial correlation for each country is partially determined by their total number of

neighbors.

       For the last step of model development, we introduce population into both the inverse variance

of the error terms and factor scores. The intuition behind accounting for population this way is that

a priori we are less uncertain regarding the amount of noise in the manifest variables and factor

scores for countries with larger populations compared to countries with smaller populations.

      The final model, in vector notation, is now presented as:


                                             𝑌|𝛿~𝑁(𝜇 + 𝛬𝛿, 𝑀−1 ⨂𝛴)

                                                𝛿~𝑁(0, 𝑀         2 𝝍𝑀 2 )

      To estimate the model, we must also specify the prior distributions of our parameters. For our

main results using the observed variables of official HDI, we specify a set of conjugate non-

informative priors which simplify the derivation of the posterior distributions without providing

much information. This specification implies that the posterior distributions are informed almost

entirely by the data and not the prior distribution assumptions. Alternatively, a strength of our

Bayesian model is its ability to incorporate a priori theory into the model’s estimation through

informative prior distributions. We illustrate the use of priors to incorporate theory in Section 4 by

placing an informative prior distribution on the factor loading of our manifest variable representing

income inequality. We cover the details of our main result’s prior specifications more formally in

Appendix A.

      Following Hogan and Tchernis (2004), we work with the variance stabilizing square root
                                                                                1
transformation of the original variables, such that 𝑌𝑖𝑗 = (𝑆𝑖𝑗 ) , where 𝑆𝑖𝑗 ’s are the HDI’s non-
                                                                                2



transformed variables. 13 This implies that 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑌𝑖𝑗 ) is inversely proportionate to the country’s

population, 𝑚𝑖 (Cressie and Chan, 1989; Hogan and Tchernis, 2004).

      Our model is estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, specifically the

Metropolis-Hastings algorithm within a Gibbs Sampler. The method’s primary goal is to produce

a summary of the distribution of ranks for each country. In all iterations of the sampler, for which

we run 4,000 total iterations after the initial convergence phase of 500 iterations, we rank the draws

from the posterior distribution of the factor scores, allowing us to produce samples from the

posterior distribution of the countries’ ranks. A more detailed description of the estimation process

can be found in Appendix A.

      From a purely technical standpoint, our model has several advantages over the official HDI.

First, our model based ranks are a function of the weighted manifest variables conditional on the

observed data. While variable selection is decided by theory, using a data-driven model implies

that the data inform the relative contribution of each manifest variable on human development as

opposed to expert opinion. Second, we do not constrain our model to a specific set of variables.

Instead, different variables can be included or excluded without fundamentally altering the

     𝑆𝑖𝑗 is already in a “per-capita” form (e.g. GNI per capita, population mean years of schooling, etc.).

estimation process. Third, our model provides a summary of uncertainty through variance in the

ranking distributions, giving a more holistic view of relative performance. Fourth, information

regarding each country’s rank comes from data for both the specific country and any potential

spillover effects resulting from spatial correlation across countries. Finally, we incorporate

additional information contained in a country’s population, leading to lower uncertainty for more

populous nations a priori. Even though our model provides a flexible structure for the estimation

of human development ranks, there are some potential sensitivity issues which we address in

Section 5.

     Using the methodology outlined in this section, we estimate several sets of human development

rankings including: rankings using only data from the official HDI, rankings using the official HDI

manifest variables combined with additional variables related to human development according to

current theory, and the ranks for our MDG index which uses a comprehensive set of variables

found in the MDG data. The next section explains the sources of our data as well as information

regarding variable selection.




3. Data

3.1 Data for model based HDI and alternative specifications

For our primary results, we rely on the data used to construct 2010’s official HDI.14 Data for each

of the 195 countries are publicly available on the UNDP’s website.15 From the full dataset, we

exclude 8 of the 195 countries from our estimation due to missing data as they are also removed


14
   All official HDI scores used in this study are calculated by the authors in order to avoid potential data irregularities
between the UNDP’s public use data files and the data used to calculate the HDI scores published in UNDP (2010).
15
   The data were downloaded on 07/01/2017 from http://hdr.undp.org/en/data.

                                                           12
from the estimation of official HDI. The four manifest variables used to calculate official HDI are:

years of life expectancy at birth, mean years of schooling for adults, expected years of schooling

for children, and GNI per capita. The measure of spatial correlation for our primary results uses

both land and maritime borders to construct the “neighbor matrix” 𝑊 . 16 We gather country

population measures for 2010 from the World Bank’s total population midyear estimates.17

     To illustrate our method’s flexibility in incorporating different sets of variables or structural

alterations to reflect theory, we also estimate our model based HDI rankings under a variety of

alternative specifications. First, we estimate our model using the official HDI manifest variables

along with different combinations of three new variables: the Environmental Performance Index

(EPI), Income Quintile Ratios (QR’s), and Satellite Observed Light (SOL).18 The EPI is an index

which measures a country’s level of environmental health and sustainability using ten different
                            19
observable variables.            The relationship between environmental stewardship and human

development is an increasingly pressing topic as discussed in the 2007 HDR (UNDP 2007). QR is

a simple representation of a country’s income inequality level measured by the ratio of income

held by the richest 20% of its population relative to the poorest 20%. 20 Some theoretical

justifications for the use of inequality when measuring human development are discussed in the

2010 HDR where the authors also propose an Inequality Adjusted HDI, Gender Inequality Index,

and Multidimensional Poverty Index (UNDP 2010). Lastly, SOL represents a country’s level of

night light which is thought to be related to human development through economic activity and

electrification (Elvidge et al., 2012; Ghosh et al., 2013).21 While there does not seem to be adequate

consensus in the literature regarding which variables an index should include to “best” capture

human development, we believe that combining the official HDI variables, which represent

longevity, education, and living standard, with manifest variables representing environmental

stewardship, income inequality, and night light covers many dimensions thought to be important

in the existing theory.22 Second, as an alternative to shared land or maritime borders, we estimate

our model under a measure of spatial correlation using trade relationships between nations to

construct our “neighbor matrix” 𝑊, the results of which are discussed in Section 5.23 Defining

spatial correlation based on trade captures potential spillover effects in human development

between countries that may or may not share a geographic border. This alternative specification of

spatial correlation is also supported by human development theory. For example, UNDP (2010)

claims that a large amount of the change in human development during recent years has been

determined by the flow of ideas and technology across countries.




3.2 Data for the Millennium Development Goals index

Aside from incorporating new variables into an existing index, our method also applies to the

creation of new, and more complex, indices. We illustrate this application by designing a novel

index for measuring human development using the United Nation’s Millennium Development

Goals (MDG). The MDG includes eight broad primary goals with a total of 80 indicator variables

   Data regarding SOL are collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National
Centers for Environmental Information website: https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/download.html.

   Any missing data for EPI, QR, or SOL is imputed using the predictive mean matching (PMM) method covered in
Section 3.2.
23
    Data regarding country trade are collected from the World Integrated Trade Solution website:
http://wits.worldbank.org. Additionally, trade data are missing for five nations (Liechtenstein, Montenegro, Romania,
Serbia, and Timor-Leste) so they are excluded from our estimation using trade-based spatial correlation.

used to track their progress. As spoken to in Anand and Sen (1994), different sets of variables may

explain differing amounts of variation in human development across the distribution of

development levels. Given that the MDG variables focus more heavily on the outcomes of

developing countries, our MDG index is also likely to provide valuable insight regarding the

relative performance of low-development level countries not captured by the official HDI.

     Data for each MDG variable are collected directly from the UNDP.24 While primary target data

are available for 234 countries and comparable areas, there is a considerable quantity of missing

observations in the UNDP’s dataset. Of the 80 potential MDG indicator variables available to us,

we select the 11 which have the least missing data across countries to serve as our MDG index’s

manifest variables.25 Considering the substantial number of MDG variables we choose to include

in the estimation, our model has an inherent advantage over traditional methods in that we can skip

the deterministic assignment of factor weights as they are a direct product of our estimation.

Additionally, we can ignore assumptions regarding variable groupings, allowing us to avoid a high

quantity of extra correlation parameters. Using our model, correlations between variables,

regardless of their dimensions, are fully captured by the spatial correlation structure embedded in

the latent factor. Comparing data across time, we also find 2010 to be the year with the most

complete collection of data for the greatest number of countries. To help ensure accurate post-

analysis comparisons between the HDI and our new MDG index, we also restrict the selection of

observations for our MDG data to the same 187 countries ranked by the official HDI.

  The 11 manifest variables are: (1) “maternal morality ratio per 100,000 live births” (MMR), (2) “children under five
mortality rate per 1,000 live births” (U5MR), (3) “population undernourished, percentage” (PU), (4) “total net
enrolment ratio in primary education, both sexes” (NER), (5) “gender parity index in primary level enrolment” (GPI),
(6) “tuberculosis prevalence rate per 100,000 population (mid-point)” (TB), (7) “proportion of the population using
improved drinking water sources” (WATER), (8) “people living with HIV, 15-49 years old, percentage” (HIV), (9)
“fixed-telephone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants” (TELE), (10) “employment-to-population ratio, both sexes,
percentage” (ETP), and (11) “adolescent birth rate, per 1,000 women” (ABR).

   After selecting our MDG manifest variables, we impute values for the missing data using two

methods. The first method is a naïve imputation process for which we impute missing data for

each variable in order from the variable with the highest number of non-missing observations to

the variable with the lowest. Table 1 presents summary statistics for the 11 manifest variables both

before and after naïve imputation. As our summary statistics show, the number of missing

observations among variables differs considerably, but the change in variable means and standard

deviations following the naïve imputation is relatively small.

   The specific technique used for our naïve imputation is a “univariate imputation using

predictive mean matching” (PMM). PMM is a combination of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

regression prediction and the nearest-neighbor imputation methods. First, PMM produces linear

predictions for all data, missing and observed, using a traditional OLS regression. We then


                                                16
compare predicted values to one another across countries. For each missing observation, the

imputed value used is the value of the non-missing observation which has the closest predicted

value, known as the missing observation’s “nearest neighbor.” With PMM, we honor existing

bounds in the non-imputed portion of the data while also preserving the observed data’s

distribution (Little, 1988). All PMM imputation procedures are performed using Stata’s PMM

syntax.

   The second imputation method comes from the posterior imputation process embedded in our

model. Posterior imputation replaces the naïvely imputed values with observations sampled from

the distributions of missing data. This replacement allows us to take the potential uncertainty

inherent in missing data into better account during our estimation (Rubin, 1976; Little and Rubin,

2002; Daniels and Hogan, 2008). We address posterior imputation more fully, along with the

sensitivity of our results to the choice of imputation process, in Section 5.




4. Results

4.1 Model based ranks vs. official HDI ranks

The rankings of official HDI fail to account for either uncertainty, spatial correlation, or

population. Alternatively, we estimate our index ranks in terms of distributions, which provides a

measure of uncertainty. Since factor weightings differ between our model based index and the

official HDI, there must be some discordance between our posterior mean ranks and the official

HDI ranks. We graphically compare the two rankings, including information regarding the 99%

confidence interval of the posterior ranks, in Figure 1.



                                                 17
   For Figure 1 and subsequent figures of the same design, the dashed grid lines partition the 0%-

20% (1st), 20%-40% (2nd), 40%-60% (3rd), 60%-80% (4th), and 80%-100% (5th) quintiles of ranks,

respectively. Solid dots show the locations of both posterior mean ranks and official HDI ranks.

The solid horizontal lines across each dot represent a 99% confidence interval for a country’s

posterior rank under our model. The numbers in Figure 1 correspond to individual country

identifiers, which are assigned alphabetically and listed in Appendix B.

   Figure 1 shows that our model’s rankings harbor a considerable level of uncertainty for certain

countries, with several confidence intervals reaching across multiple quintiles. Interestingly, this

uncertainty persists in various degrees along the entire distribution of ranks as opposed to being

constrained to only certain levels of development. As an example, Bhutan, a low-development

level country, has a posterior 99% confidence interval of (137, 164), implying that their rank could

fall into either the 4th or the 5th quintile of human development. Comparable results are also found

for more highly developed nations like Qatar, which has a posterior 99% confidence interval of

(15, 56), implying that its rank could fall into either the 1st or 2nd quintile. While Bhutan and Qatar

represent more extreme cases, it is not uncommon for the confidence interval of certain nations to

reach across quintiles of human development under our model.

   The relationship between a country’s rank and its level of uncertainty is an inverted U-shape,

with levels of uncertainty decreasing for the most and least developed countries. This relationship

is likely due to several factors. First, countries ranked at the top (bottom) have the highest (lowest)

values for each manifest variable. Second, countries away from the distribution's center often tend

to be the most highly populated, implying that they produce a lower degree of uncertainty in our

model. Third, these countries are also closer to one another on average geographically, leading to

a reduction in uncertainty through spatial smoothing. This result with spatial correlation mirrors

                                                  18
the geographical clustering often observed in human development, i.e. having many low-

development level countries in sub-Saharan Africa or many high-development level countries in

Europe. Finally, the relationship between development and uncertainty is also partially determined

by the truncation of variable values from either above or below for the most and least developed

countries.

   Figure 1 also illustrates the discordance between our model based ranks and those of the official

HDI. The greater the distance between solid dots and the 45o line, the greater the disagreement

between our model based ranks and the ranks of official HDI. While the results of both models are

well correlated, for only eleven countries are the model based and official HDI ranks identical. For

72 countries, the absolute value of the difference between both two ranks is less than five. For 53

countries, however, the absolute value of the difference is larger than 10.

 Figure 1. Posterior Mean and 99% CI of Model Based HDI Ranks vs. Official HDI Ranks



4.2 Discordance between model based and official HDI ranks

Table 2(a) shows the ten countries which have the largest differences between their official HDI

rankings and their rankings as determined by our model. As an example, Mongolia is ranked 101

using the official HDI but is assigned a posterior mean rank of 70 by our model with a 99%

confidence interval of (62, 76). Therefore, Mongolia’s posterior confidence interval fails to even

cover the range of its official HDI rank. It is reasonable to conclude from our results that the official

HDI may underestimate Mongolia’s level of human development. Alternatively, Mexico, which

                                                   20
has an official HDI rank of 73, has posterior mean rank of 94 in our model with a 99% confidence

interval of (89, 100). So, in an opposite pattern to Mongolia, the official HDI may overestimate

the human development level of Mexico under the assumptions of our model. Since many of the

highly discordant countries shown in Table 2(a) have relatively small populations, we also present

the seven nations with large populations (over fifty million) which also have an absolute

difference-in-ranks between their model based and official HDI rankings greater than 10 in Table

2(b).

   The most plausible reason behind the discordances in rank is the difference in factor weights

between the official HDI and our model based index. As we discuss in the following section, our

model based index assigns a greater proportional contribution to the “living standard” dimension

and a lower proportional contribution to the “longevity” dimension. This difference implies that

countries with either outstanding or dismal performance in those two dimensions see a

considerable amount of movement between the two models. Furthermore, incorporating

population also alters the total level of uncertainty in a country’s rank, and therefore the size of the

absolute difference in rankings produced by both models. Additionally, the discordance between

official HDI and our model may be partially determined by spatial correlation if either positive or

negative spillover effects in development are sufficiently influencing each country’s distribution

of ranks. Since the official HDI is a direct measurement built on observable variables, one could

interpret our results under the assumption that the HDI is a “correct” measure. Assuming that the

HDI is “correct”, we find that the posterior mean ranks of our model and the official HDI correlate

well on average. Alternatively, we also evaluate the level of discordance between the official HDI

and our model under the opposite assumption using simulated data where our model identifies the

correct data generating process in Section 5.

4.3 Squared correlation coefficients

Due to differences in methodology, there is no simple way to compare the estimated contributions

of each manifest variable on the official HDI’s measure of human development or the latent factor

in our model. To calculate a general measure of comparability, we follow Ravallion (2012) who


                                                  22
suggests calculating the marginal weights of each variable in the official HDI as the partial

derivative of the official HDI with respect to each observable variable. Following this approach,

we obtain the marginal weights of each variable in the official HDI by regressing standardized

HDI scores on standardized manifest variables.

   To summarize each variable’s contribution to the latent development factor of our model, we

apply the method of Hogan and Tchernis (2004) and present normalized “squared correlation

coefficients.” The squared correlation coefficient of each manifest variable 𝑗 is specified as:


                                                        𝜆𝑗2
                                           𝜌𝑗2 =
                                                   𝜆𝑗2 + 𝜎𝑗2


   Each squared correlation coefficient corresponds to the proportion of variation in the manifest

variable, 𝑗, that is explained by the latent human development factor. In Table 3, we compare the

normalized marginal weights of each manifest variable from the official HDI to the normalized

squared correlation coefficients produced by our model.

                Variable                      HDI Weights (95% CI)               𝛒𝟐 (95% CI)
         Life Expectancy at Birth               0.35 (0.31, 0.39)              0.18 (0.17, 0.20)
        Mean Years of Schooling                 0.30 (0.26, 0.34)              0.27 (0.27, 0.28)
       Expected Years of Schooling              0.28 (0.24, 0.33)              0.29 (0.28, 0.30)
              GNI per capita                    0.18 (0.16, 0.21)              0.25 (0.25, 0.25)




   Concerning our results, we find that the “longevity” dimension offers a smaller contribution to

human development than the weights of official HDI would suggest. As Anand and Sen (1994)

                                                   23
discuss, differences in the HDI ranks of high development level countries are largely driven by

minor changes in relative life expectancy as their values for the other inputs are largely similar. In

turn, the increased importance of life expectancy at the higher end of the distribution may inflate

the relative weight placed on the “longevity” dimension by official HDI. Our model also attributes

a much greater contribution to the “living standard” dimension when compared to official HDI.

Additionally, while the official HDI assigns a greater proportional contribution to “mean years of

schooling” than “expected years of schooling,” our model estimates that the opposite is true.

Therefore, under the assumptions of our model, these results suggest that the available data may

not support the deterministic weights used to calculate official HDI. If this is indeed the case, the

HDI’s rankings may bias our understanding of relative human development levels across countries,

which in turn could impact both international and national level policies targeting human

development. On the other hand, we find that each of the official HDI’s manifest variables provides

considerable contributions to human development, indicating that the human development theory

guiding the variable selection process is supported by both models.




4.4 The most and least developed countries

One of the HDI’s primary purposes is identifying countries with both the highest and lowest levels

of human development. Distinguishing countries with best practices establishes role models for

other nations while identifying the least developed countries has significant economic and policy

implications for nations with lower levels of human development. Since comparing relative

performance is so important, it again becomes a potential concern that the official HDI offers only

a single rank for each country as opposed to a plausible range of values. The lack of uncertainty

can be especially detrimental to countries falling just outside the lowest levels of human

                                                 24
development, as it may disqualify them from participating in beneficial international assistance

programs if their official HDI rank does not meet a program’s requirements. Given that our method

produces distributions of ranks, we can estimate and assign probabilities for each country to be

within the most and least developed groups.

   In Figure 2 we present the estimated likelihood of certain countries being among the ten most

developed countries using our model along with their official HDI rankings. Of the 187 countries,

17 have non-zero probabilities of being included in our model’s “Top 10.” Of these 17 countries,

seven are not among the “Top 10” according to their official HDI ranks, implying that they may

be overlooked when evaluating the successful actions of role model nations. In Figure 3 we present

the likelihood of certain countries being among the ten least developed countries using our model

along with their official HDI rankings. Of the 13 countries which have non-zero probabilities

associated with being included in our model’s “Bottom 10,” five are not listed among the “Bottom

10” according to official HDI. Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Burundi, all

of which are members of the official HDI’s “Bottom 10,” have zero probability of being in the

“Bottom 10” produced by our model. Properly identifying countries with the lowest levels of

human development is especially relevant to the policymakers and government officials tasked

with making foreign aid distribution decisions regarding at-need nations.

4.5 Alternative variables specifications

Given the ease with which variables can be interchanged in our model, we now present estimations

of human development using the four manifest variables of official HDI in combination with three

additional variables: The Environmental Performance Index (EPI), Income Quintile Ratios (QR’s),

and Satellite Observed Light (SOL). These three new variables are meant to represent dimensions

of human development that current theory believes to be relevant but the official HDI may not

capture. 26 More specifically, EPI accounts for a nation’s level of environmental health and

sustainability, QR represents income inequality, and SOL provides an objective measure of night

light. In combination with the official HDI’s manifest variables, we first estimate our model with

each new variable added separately, and then combined within a single model. As an additional

way of incorporating human development theory into our model, we also place a negative and

informative prior distribution on the factor loading of QR. Under our Bayesian specification,

having a negative and informative prior on the relationship between QR and human development

captures the a priori theoretical assumption that higher income inequality should negatively reflect

a country’s level of human development. While estimation with either the informative or non-

informative prior produces a negative factor loading for QR, with the informative prior distribution

of 𝜆𝑄𝑅 ~𝑁(−10,0.1), we pull the posterior mean and standard deviation of our estimated factor

loading to -0.24 and 0.06 respectively, compared to the posterior mean and standard deviation of

-0.04 and 0.04 which we find when using a conjugate non-informative prior.27 Prior distributions

on the factor loadings of EPI and SOL remain non-informative, and both are estimated to positively



26
   See UNDP (2007), UNDP (2010), Elvidge et al. (2012), and Ghosh et al. (2013) and the studies they discuss for
information regarding the relationship between environmental stewardship, inequality, and night light with human
development, respectively.
27
   A more extreme approach to incorporating prior theoretical beliefs into our model is restricting parameters to fall
only within a certain range of values, but we do not illustrate this in our study.

                                                         27
reflect human development, implying that better environmental stewardship and more satellite

observed night light correspond to higher levels of human development.

   Comparisons between human development rankings using the official HDI and our model with

EPI, QR, and SOL, are shown in Figures C.1(a), C.1(b), and C.1(c) of Appendix C, respectively.

Figure C.2 of Appendix C compares the official HDI ranks to the results of our model when

including the four HDI manifest variables and all three alternative variables simultaneously. As

Figures C.1 and C.2 show, there is relatively little visible movement in the mean ranks or

confidence intervals for each country between model specifications.

   Table C.1 of Appendix C provides a comparison of each variable’s weight under the official

HDI and the normalized squared correlation coefficients produced by our model across all four

alternative specifications. As the squared correlation coefficients show, our model estimates that

the four manifest variables used by the official HDI capture the greatest proportion of variation in

human development across alternative specifications. When added separately, EPI accounts for

roughly 9% of the variation in human development, while QR and SOL are both estimated to

account for 4%. Interestingly, the squared correlation coefficient on LE varies with the addition of

EPI, but not with QR or SOL. This relationship seems intuitive when considering that both LE and

EPI are meant to directly capture aspects of health, while QR and SOL are less likely to do so.

Including QR in the model leads to a decrease in the squared correlation coefficients of both

education variables, but not GNIpc. This change implies that the variation in human development

captured by QR (but not GNIpc) is potentially related to the relative contribution of education

when income inequality varies. Including SOL decreases the effect of MYS, EYS, and GNIpc

when added into the model separately, supporting the assumption that night light may represent

features related to the shared relationship between electrification, education, and econonomic

                                                28
activity. When included simultaneously, our model estimates that EPI, QR, and SOL account for

roughly 16% of the total variation in human development, while LE, MYS, EYS, and GNIpc

account for the remaining 84%. While 16% is a nontrivial share, the four manifest variables used

to calculate official HDI identify the majority of a country’s human development level. Therefore,

the issue regarding human development’s measurement may be one of estimation method more so

than variable selection. Comparing the level of discordance between the results of our base model

and those of our model including EPI, QR, and SOL shows that only one country (Kiribati) has an

absolute difference in rank greater than five.




4.6 Results for MDG index

We now present the results of our model estimated using manifest variables from the Millenium

Development Goals (MDG). Initially, we construct our MDG index using a naïve imputation

process to estimate any missing data. We also estimate the index using posterior imputation, the

results of which are disscussed in Section 5. In Figure 4, we compare the posterior mean ranks of

our MDG index with the ranks of official HDI using the naïvely imputed data. Figure 4 shows a

positive association between the ranks of our “MDG index” and those of the official HDI which

we would expect even between measures of human development using different variables.28

      Because the MDG index includes both a greater number of variables and variables which the

official HDI does not use, it naturally produces a higher level of discordance with the official HDI

compared to our main results or those obtained from our alternative specifications built around the

four HDI manifest variables. More specifically, the sum of absolute differences between our model


28
     The correlation between the posterior mean ranks of our MDG index and the ranks of official HDI is roughly 0.95.

                                                          29
based HDI ranks and the ranks of official HDI is 1,439, while the sum of absolute differences

between the ranks of our MDG index and the official HDI is 2,448.29 Referencing the top-right

corner of Figure 4 for a visual example of the discordance between the two indices, Equatorial

Guinea, Congo, Zambia, Kenya, and Swaziland, none of which fall into the lowest development

quintile of official HDI, are all located in the lowest development quintile of our MDG index.

Therefore, the official HDI may overestimate the development levels of these countries under the

assumptions of our MDG index. Given that the MDG’s variables focus more on developing

countries, a driving factor of this discordance may be information regarding the relative

performance of low development level countries across dimensions which are captured by our

MDG index but not by the HDI’s manifest variables. Looking to the bottom-left corner of Figure

4, Brunei, Qatar, and the United States are all ranked outside of the most developed quintile of our

posterior MDG ranks while they are included in the most developed quintile of the official HDI.

Therefore, it is possible that the official HDI overestimates the development level of these

countries given our findings. We also estimate the total level of uncertainty in ranks produced by

our MDG index to be lower than our estimations using the HDI manifest variables which is most

likely the result of including a greater number of total variables in the model.30

     Table 4 presents the normalized squared correlation coefficients for the variables of our MDG

index and the sign of their factor loadings. Our MDG index suggests that maternal mortality

(MMR) and child mortality (U5MR) account for the greatest shares of variation in human

development. The relative contributions of MMR and U5MR are both in line with the assumption

that an untimely death represents the worst-case human development scenario for individuals



29
  The average absolute difference in ranks between the official HDI and MDG index is 13.1.
30
  For example, the average standard deviation of ranks for our MDG index is 1.58 compared to an average standard
deviation of 2.25 for our model based HDI.

under a human outcomes focused theory of development. Alternatively, the adult HIV rate (HIV)

and employment-to-population ratio (ETP) account for the smallest amounts of variation in human

development according to our MDG index.

5. Sensitivity Analysis

In this section, we explore the sensitivity of our model’s results across four separate dimensions.

First, we examine the change in our results using an alternative specification of spatial correlation

based on trade rather than geographical boundaries. Second, we evaluate the roles of ordinality

and cardinality in our model by estimating human development using the ranks, rather than raw

values, of each country’s observed outcomes.31 Third, we evaluate the sensitivity of our model to

imputation procedure by comparing the results of our MDG index under both PMM and posterior

imputation. Finally, we evaluate the performance of both our model and the official HDI in a

simulated data exercise where our model is assumed to capture the correct data generating process.




31
     We would again like to thank an anonymous reviewer for suggesting this test of our model.

                                                          32
5.1 Estimation with an alternative spatial correlation structure

Spatial correlation plays a significant role in our model as it allows for the estimation of spillover

effects in human development across countries. We estimate the results presented in Section 4

under a framework of spatial correlation where countries are considered “neighbors” if they share

a common land or maritime border. This method of defining neighbors captures the geographic

clustering of similar development level countries observed in the data (i.e. many low-development

level countries in sub-Saharan Africa or many very-high development level countries in Europe).

On the other hand, since the transfer of ideas and technologies related to human development is

not restricted to countries sharing a common geographical border, a logical alternative is a spatial

correlation framework based on trade flows between countries.

   To evaluate the sensitivity of our model to changes in spatial correlation structure, we re-

estimate our primary results using an alternative “neighbor matrix” 𝑊 such that for two countries

                       𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑠
                            𝑖𝑗
𝑖 and 𝑗, 𝑊𝑖𝑗 = 𝑊𝑗𝑖 = 𝐺𝐷𝑃 +𝐺𝐷𝑃  , where 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑠𝑖𝑗 is the sum of total exports shared between both
                          𝑖      𝑗


countries, and 𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑖 and 𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑗 are country 𝑖 and 𝑗’s total GDP, respectively. If 𝑖 and 𝑗 are not

trading partners, 𝑊𝑖𝑗 = 𝑊𝑗𝑖 = 0 . Finally, 𝑊𝑖𝑖 = 0 . Figure C.3 of Appendix C shows the

correspondence between the ranks of official HDI and the ranks of our model under this trade-

based framework of spatial correlation. As Figure C.3 illustrates, the estimated ranks of our model

using trade-based spatial correlation correlate well with those of official HDI. Comparing the

results across models more closely, the average absolute deviation between the ranks of official

HDI and our trade-based model is 6.56.

   Table C.2 of Appendix C compares the normalized squared correlation coefficients of our trade-

based model with those of our primary results. As the table shows, both specifications of spatial


                                                 33
correlation produce almost identical estimations of the covariance in human development

explained by each manifest variable. Comparing both specifications’ posterior means and

confidence intervals of the model’s other parameters shows that the only non-trivial difference

comes from the spatial correlation parameter, 𝜔, which has a mean posterior value of 0.126 in our

primary model and 4.25 in our trade-based specification. Of course, variation in 𝜔 between models

is expected when altering the underlying spatial correlation structure. Given these results, we

conclude that our model is generally robust to spatial correlation specifications regarding how

countries are related with one another.




5.2 Estimation using ranks of manifest variables

Given that the outcome we are most interested in estimating is the human development ranks for

each country, the roles of cardinality and ordinality in our model are of particular importance. One

dimension by which we can examine this is to compare the results of our model using the cardinal

(raw) values of each manifest variable to the results we find using ordinal (rank) values. By

converting manifest variable values into ranks, each country’s performance is evaluated only with

regards to their relative standing rather than the magnitude to which their manifest variable values

differ. Naturally, the use of ranks preserves order, but it also limits the effect of outlier countries

in variables like GNIpc which harbor high degrees of variation.

   Figure C.4 of Appendix C presents the correspondence between the ranks of official HDI and

our primary model using rank values of each manifest variable. Compared to the results of our

model using the raw manifest variables shown in Figure 1, the most obvious change between the

raw and ranked models’ correspondences with official HDI is in the top-right-hand corner for the


                                                  34
lowest development level countries. Comparing the raw and rank manifest variable model rankings

with official HDI more formally, however, we find the average absolute deviation in ranks to be

almost identical, at 7.72 and 7.79, respectively. 32 Alternatively, while the average levels of

absolute discordance between models are nearly identical, some countries with outlier values for

their manifest variables see considerable changes in their posterior ranks. This result implies that

using rankings of manifest variables may abstract away from potentially valuable information

coming from cardinal relationships in the data. Table C.3 of Appendix C presents the normalized

squared correlation coefficients of our model when using raw manifest variable values and rank

manifest variable values. Comparing the raw and rank models, Table C.3 shows that MYS and

GNIpc see the most notable change in their estimated contribution to human development. Given

that the amount of discordance between both model specifications and the official HDI change

only trivially, however, we conclude that the rankings of our model are generally robust to the

ordinal transformation of manifest variables.




5.3 Results using posterior imputation

Following the naïve imputation method used to predict the missing MDG data, we next formulate

our MDG index using the posterior imputation process built into our model. As spoken to in

previous sections, a substantial quantity of data is missing for the MDG index manifest variables,

implying that they must be imputed before estimation. For our main results, we use these imputed

values as data without accounting for the inherent uncertainty of the imputation process. As an

alternative, we now incorporate the imputation of missing data into the estimation algorithm.


32
 The standard deviation for the absolute deviations of both models are also nearly identical, at 7.04 for the raw
model and 7.11 for the rank model.

                                                         35
Unlike our naïve imputation method, posterior imputation draws from a posterior distribution of

missing values during each iteration of the sampler. We present the results of our MDG index

under posterior imputation graphically in Figure C.5 of Appendix C.

     While the posterior mean rank for most countries remains stable, the uncertainty of rankings

following posterior imputation appears much larger for some countries when compared to the

uncertainty of the naïve imputation results. More specifically, the more missing data a country has,

the more uncertainty it will show following posterior imputation. This relationship leads countries

like Liechtenstein and Hong Kong to have extreme confidence intervals compared to the average.

Additionally, higher levels of missing data increase the magnitude of separation between a

country’s naïve and posterior imputation mean ranks.

     Formally measuring the amount of discordance between our model under the two imputation

processes with the official HDI, we see an increase in the sum of squared differences in rank from

51,410 to 64,890 using posterior imputation, a change of roughly 26%. While the sum of squared

differences increases considerably following posterior imputation, the sum of absolute differences

remains relatively unchanged (a 3% increase from 2,444 to 2,522). 33 This result implies that

several outlier countries see a considerable change in rank between the two imputation methods

while the general discordance changes a comparably small amount for countries with less missing

data.

     Table C.4 of Appendix C shows the normalized squared correlation coefficients of our MDG

index under both naïve and posterior imputation. Our model still estimates that MMR and U5MR

account for the greatest proportion of covariance in human development, while NER, HIV, and


33
  The average of absolute differences in rank increases from 13.07 to 13.49, and the standard deviation of absolute
differences between ranks increases from 10.2 to 12.9.

                                                        36
ABR see the most significant amount of relative change between both models. Since posterior

imputation extrapolates the non-missing relationship between a manifest variable and the latent

factor onto the missing data, changes in the magnitude of each squared correlation coefficient

reflect the observed effect’s strength. For example, the increased effect of HIV under posterior

imputation suggests that HIV is highly reflective of human development in the non-missing portion

of our data. Using non-Bayesian methods to estimate an MDG index would force practitioners to

rely on naïve imputation and potentially miss the prominent level of contribution variables like

HIV expresses in the non-missing data.




5.4 Simulated data exercise

Since both our model and the official HDI are inherently incomplete models of human

development, it is important that we better understand the relative capabilities of each approach.

One way to evaluate the performance of both models is using a simulation where we can directly

specify the true underlying relationship of the data. More specifically, we use the posterior mean

parameter values estimated with our model under real data to simulate a set of data for each of the

official HDI’s four manifest variables using the assumed data generating process of our model.

The outcome of our simulation is a set of artificial data for all 187 countries which we know

matches the assumptions of our model.

     Comparing the results of official HDI to our model using simulated data shows that the level

of average absolute deviation between ranks increases by nearly a factor of three.34 Furthermore,




34
  The average absolute deviation in ranks between the official HDI and our model goes from 7.7 using real data to
22.0 using simulated data.

                                                       37
our model can estimate each data generating parameter to within one standard deviation of the

posterior mean. We present the data generating parameter values and the estimated posterior means

and standard deviations in Table C.4 of Appendix C. Given that the official HDI is a direct measure

as opposed to a model which assumes an underlying data generating process, one can interpret our

results using real data under the assumption that the official HDI is the “correct” measure of human

development. Under this assumption, the results discussed in Section 4 show that the posterior

mean ranks of our model are well correlated with the ranks of official HDI. Under the opposite

assumption that our model is correct, the simulated data exercise shows that the official HDI is not

able to achieve a similar level of agreement using data for which we know our model identifies

the true data generating process. This result suggests that our model is more flexible when

estimating human development using data generated from different sources relative to the official

HDI.




6. Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a Bayesian factor analysis model which serves as both an alternative

approach to calculating the UNDP’s Human Development Index and a general methodology which

can be used to either augment existing indices or build new ones. We address several technical

issues of the official HDI in the following ways. First, our model produces data-driven weights for

each manifest variable’s contribution to the latent factor of human development. Informing

weights with observed data stands in contrast to the ad hoc factor weights used to calculate the

ranks of official HDI. Second, our model estimates its ranks in terms of distributions, allowing for

a measure of uncertainty which is absent from the official HDI. This measure of uncertainty



                                                38
provides a more holistic view of relative performance across countries. Finally, we adjust the

uncertainty in ranks by incorporating a measure of spatial correlation between countries while also

including country populations in our estimation. These additions improve the precision of our rank

distributions and allow for the estimation of spillover effects in human development.

   Using our model to estimate human development with the same observed variables as the

official HDI, we find that the “living standard” dimension provides a greater proportional

contribution to human development than it is assigned by the official HDI, while the “longevity”

dimension provides a lower proportional contribution. The results of our model also show

considerable levels of disagreement when compared to the ranks of the official HDI. Under our

model, it is is not uncommon for the confidence intervals of country ranks to cover more than one

quintile of human development level. Therefore, a country’s relative performance according to the

rankings of our model may vary considerably when compared to its relative performance according

to the official HDI.

   Aside from its technical advantages, we show the flexibility of our methodology by estimating

human development with three additional variables not used in the official HDI and by creating a

novel MDG index using data from the Millennium Development Goals. As our alternative

specifications illustrate, sets of variables can easily be added or removed from our model without

fundamentally restructuring its estimation. This stands in contrast to the HDI’s rigidity with respect

to variable selection which makes the addition or removal of information impractical. We find that

EPI, QR, and SOL explain roughly 16% of the total variation in human development when

estimated along with the official HDI manifest variables. Under the assumptions of our model, this

result implies that the alternative variables account for variation across dimensions of human

development not captured by the official HDI. Therefore, our model supports the use of alternative

                                                 39
human development indices such as the Inequality Adjusted HDI, Gender Inequality Index, and

Multidimensional Poverty Index proposed by the 2010 HDR (UNDP, 2010). As opposed to the

official HDI and its related indices, however, our model provides a convenient framework for

measuring an index using different manifest variables. Additionally, even with the complicated

structure of the MDG’s indicator variables, we show that our approach is suited to constructing

the desired index. The MDG index not only exemplifies the adaptive nature of our methodology,

but also provides a blueprint which researchers can follow to build indices that may have

previously seemed too complex. The results of our MDG index suggest that mother and child

mortality outcomes explain the greatest proportions of covariance in human development. This

finding is supported by the assumption that early death represents one of the most severe and

adverse outcomes for countries under the human-centered theory of development that measures

like the HDI are meant to represent. Future studies of human development may wish to examine

the effect of these mortality measures by incorporating them directly in models of development as

opposed to relying on the official HDI’s life expectancy measure.

   We also evaluate the sensitivity of our model across several dimensions. First, we estimate

human development ranks using an alternative specification of spatial correlation built on trade

rather than geographical borders. On average, we find that our estimates remain stable across

specifications, implying that our model is robust to different definitions of spatial correlation.

Second, to evaluate the role of cardinality and ordinality in our model, we estimate human

development using the rankings of each manifest variable as opposed to their raw values. The

squared correlation coefficients of our model change across specifications, but the average

absolute deviation in ranks between the official HDI and our model remains nearly constant.

Alternatively, some outlier countries see relatively significant changes in their rank using the rank


                                                 40
model, implying that we may be losing information captured by differences in magnitude when

not using raw variable values. Third, to account for the inherent uncertainty of imputation in our

estimation of the MDG index, we compare the results of our model using both naïve and posterior

imputation. We find that posterior imputation leads to an increase in the discordance between our

ranks and the ranks of official HDI for some countries with substantial amounts of missing data,

but minimal movement in the discordance on average. Finally, since both the official HDI and our

model are incomplete measures of human development, we perform a simulated data exercise

where our model assumes the correct data generating process. In our simulated exercise, the

average absolute difference between the ranks produced by the official HDI and our model increase

by nearly a factor of three compared to results when using real data. This result implies that while

the rankings of our model are very close on average to those of the official HDI under the

assumption that the HDI is “correct” when using real data, the official HDI is not able to do the

same in a simulation where the assumption is reversed.

                             Appendix A: Gibbs Sampler Algorithm

Following Hogan and Tchernis (2004), our hierarchical factor analysis model is as follows:


                                        𝑌|𝛿~𝑁(𝜇 + 𝛬𝛿, 𝑀 −1 ⨂𝛴)

                                                         1     1
                                             𝛿~𝑁(0, 𝑀−2 𝝍𝑀−2 )

where:

𝜇 = [𝜇1 , 𝜇2 , 𝜇3 , 𝜇4 ]′;


𝛬 = 𝐼𝑁 ⨂𝜆, with 𝜆 = [𝜆1 , 𝜆2 , 𝜆3 , 𝜆4 ]′;


𝝍 = (𝐼 − 𝜔𝑊)−1;


𝛴 = 𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔(𝜎12 , 𝜎22 , 𝜎32 , 𝜎42 ) with all the off-diagonal elements equal to 0.


Therefore, the parameters to estimate are 𝜆, 𝛿, 𝜇, 𝛴 and 𝜔.




Step 1: Sample elements of 𝜆.


Let 1𝑁 be an 𝑁 × 1 vector with all elements equal to 1. Therefore, for each 𝜆𝑗 , 𝑗 = 1,2,3,4, let the

estimation equation be 𝑌𝑗 − 1𝑁 ′𝜇𝑗 = 𝜆𝑗 𝛿 + 𝜀𝑗 , where 𝑌𝑗 is the 𝑁 × 1 vector of manifest variable

𝑌𝑖𝑗 , and 𝜀𝑗 ~𝑁(0, 𝜎𝑗2 /𝑀) . Let the prior distribution be 𝜆𝑗 ~𝑁(𝑎, 𝐴) , where 𝑎 = 0, 𝐴 = 1000 .

Hence, the posterior of λj is drawn from conditional distribution 𝑁(𝑏, 𝐵), where:

                                                                   −1
                                        𝐵 = (1/𝐴 + 𝛿 ′ 𝑀𝛿/𝜎𝑗2 )


                                  𝑏 = 𝐵[𝑎/𝐴 + 𝛿 ′ 𝑀(𝑌𝑗 − 1𝑁 𝜇𝑗 )/𝜎𝑗2 ]


                                                    46
As factor loadings, λj ’s, are restricted to be positive.


Step 2: Sample 𝛿.


Let the estimation equation be 𝑌 − 𝜇⨂1𝑁 = 𝛬𝛿 + 𝜀, where 𝑌 is the 𝑁𝐽 × 1 vector of manifest
                                                                                     1    1
variable 𝑌𝑖𝑗 , and 𝜀~𝑁(0, 𝑀−1 ⨂𝛴). Given that the prior distribution is 𝛿~N(0, 𝑀−2 𝝍𝑀−2 ).


Hence, the posterior of 𝛿 is drawn from conditional distribution 𝑁(𝑑, 𝐷), where:

                                                                                −1
                                          1     1 −1
                                      −       −             ′ (𝑀−1         −𝟏
                            𝐷 = [(𝑀       2 𝝍𝑀 2 )     +𝛬            ⨂𝞢) 𝛬]


                                 𝑑 = 𝐷[𝛬′ (𝑀−1 ⨂𝛴)−𝟏 (𝑌 − 𝜇⨂1𝑁 )]


Step 3: Sample elements of 𝜇.


For each 𝜇j , 𝑗 = 1,2,3,4 , let the estimation equation be 𝑌𝑗 − 𝜆𝑗 𝛿 = 1𝑁 𝜇𝑗 + 𝜀𝑗 . Let the prior

distribution be 𝜇𝑗 ~𝑁(𝑐, 𝐶), where 𝑐 = 0, 𝐶 = 1000.


Hence, the posterior of 𝜇j is drawn from conditional distribution 𝑁(𝑒, 𝐸), where:

                                                                      −1
                                     𝐸 = (1/𝐶 + 1𝑁 ′𝑀1𝑁 /𝜎𝑗2 )


                                 𝑒 = 𝐸[𝑐/𝐶 + 1𝑁 ′ 𝑀(𝑌𝑗 − 𝜆𝑗 𝛿)/𝜎𝑗2 ]


Step 4: Sample elements of 𝛴.


For each 𝜎𝑗2 , 𝑗 = 1,2,3,4 , let the estimation equation be 𝑌𝑗 = 𝜆𝑗 𝛿 + 1𝑁 𝜇𝑗 + 𝜀𝑗 . Let the prior

distribution be 𝜎𝑗2 ~𝐼𝐺(𝛼0 , β0 ), where 𝛼0 = 0.001, β0 = 0.001.


Hence, the posterior of 𝜎𝑗2 is drawn from conditional distribution 𝐼𝐺(𝛼1 , β1 ), where:



                                                   47
                                                      𝑁
                                          𝛼1 = 𝛼0 +
                                                      2

                                               ′
                       𝛽1 = (𝑌𝑗 − 𝜆𝑗 𝛿 − 1𝑁 𝜇𝑗 ) 𝑀(𝑌𝑗 − 𝜆𝑗 𝛿 − 1𝑁 𝜇𝑗 ) + 𝛽0




Step 5: Sample 𝜔 using a Metropolis-Hasting algorithm.


Let the prior distribution of 𝜔 be 𝜋(𝜔) = 𝑁(0,1000)𝐼(𝜉1−1 < 𝜔 < 𝜉𝑁−1 ), where 𝜉1 and 𝜉𝑁 denote

the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the spatial correlation matrix 𝑊. Hence, the target

density of 𝜔 is 𝑓(𝛿|𝝍(𝜔))𝜋(𝜔) , where 𝑓(𝛿|𝝍(𝜔)) is the kernel of the distribution of 𝛿

conditional on 𝝍 = (𝐼 − 𝜔𝑊)−1 . Let the proposal density be 𝑞(𝜔′ |𝜔)~𝑁(𝜔, 𝜌2 ), so that the

candidate 𝜔′ is drawn from a random walk equation: 𝜔′ = 𝜔 + 𝜖, where 𝜖~𝑁(0, 𝜌2 ) , and 𝜌2 is a

tuning parameter. The generated 𝜔 is also restricted to the domain 𝜉1−1 < 𝜔 < 𝜉𝑁−1 .


Therefore, 𝜔′ is accepted with probability:
