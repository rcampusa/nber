                Estimating the Long—Run Relationship Between
                       Interest Rates and Inflation:
                           A Response to McCallum



                                  ABSTRACT



        This note demonstrates that Bennett McCallum's recent critique of

low frequency estimates of macro—economic relationships is of little empirical

significance. It also demonstrates that readily available and frequently

used techniques can be used to diagnose the problem McCallum raises.

Finally, it shows that the standard critique of expectational distributed

lags is not warranted once the role of learning by economic agents is

recognized.

     In a recent contribution to this journal Bennett McCallum (198I) sharply

criticizes econometric tests of long run economic relationships, which make use

of frequency domain time series techniques. Summers (1982) is held out as an

offending example. This note demonstrates that McCallum's criticisms are not

valid either theoretically or empirically. It nkes three points. First, as

asserted in ntr original paper, the issue of nasuring inflation expectations,

which is the heart of McCallum's critique, is of limited empirical significance

in low frequency studies of the Fisher effect. Second, very simple econometric

procedures implemented in itrjr original paper and in another paper criticized by

McCallum make it possible to bound the bias arising from the problems McCallum

raises. The potential bias is small. Third, once the role of learning is

recognized, the Sargent—Lucus critique of expectational distributed lags which

provides the basis for McCallum's comment is incorrect.



I. Measuring Expected Inflation

     McCallum summarizes his comment by noting that "the low frequency measures

in question are simply not designed to reflect the distinction between antici-

pated and unanticipated fluctuations that is crucial for accurately charac-

terizing inter variable relationships in dynamic nDdels." The central issue of

measuring inflation expectations was recognized in rir original paper. Indeed

the Appendix contains an exposition of Sargent's (19T1) point which underlies

McCallum's comment. The text also addresses the issue of measuring inflationary

expectations and makes the empirical assertion that "low frequency variations in

the rate of inflation are almost completely forecastable so that the assumption

that expected inflation can be proxied by actual inflation is warranted.
                                       —2—


Indeed, when the equations reported here were re—estimated with various proxies

for expected inflation the results were not significantly affected."

       Below this asssertion is documented using asures of expected inflation

which are free from the Lucas—Sargent—McCallum taint. Before turning to

this empirical evidence it should be made clear that the ntivation for per-

forming low frequency econometric tests is the conviction that history should

not be viewed as a sequence of realizations of a single stationary stochastic

process. The data can only illuminate long—mn issues if regime changes of the

type envisaged in comparative steady state economic theory have actually taken

place. The possibility that such changes may take place and     that   if they do

low frequency econometric techniques may provide a good way to study their

effects is not disputed by McCallum. If regime changes have taken place, they

will acccount for nest of the variance in both expected and actual inflation, so

that actual inflation will, at low frequencies, be a satisfactory proxy for

expected inflation.

       Ultimately then, the validity of the low frequency econometric techniques

used in rrr paper is an empirical question depending on the properties of the

inflation process. I tried to resolve it in preliminary work on the paper by

seeing if substantively different empirical results regarding the Fisher

effect were obtained when proxies for expected inflation were used. A rolling

ARMA   procedure   of the type first used in Feldstein and Summers (19T8) was

employed. In this procedure each period a measure of expected inflation is

   by forecasting inflation based on an ARMA estimated over the previously

available data. This method produces direct estimates of 11e which depend on the
                                          —3—


 stochastic process actually followed by inflation, and so is free of the

problems     raised by McCallum. Note that McCallum raises        no objection to the low

frequency estimation of a structural relation between         interest rates and a

direct measure of inflationary expectations. His only difficulties involve the

use of distributed lags in measuring inflationary expectations.

        Some of the results in nr original paper are reproduced along with results

using proxies for expected inflation in Tables 1 and         2.   The alternative results

suggest larger estimates of the effect of inflation on interest rates than do

those   in nr   earlier paper. However, its principal conclusions are confirmed.

For   the   186O—l9IO period, the   hypothesis   that the Fisher coefficient is one is

rejected. For the Post—War interval, the hypothesis that the Fisher coefficient

equals its tax adjusted value is also rejected. However, in some sub—samples,

the   use of the alternative inflation variables       does have dramatic effects. This

is particularly the case for the l951_197l interval, where the Fisher coef-

ficient rises from .79 to 1.39, at a frequency of over 3 years. The observation

that over short intervals the choice of an expectations measure has significant

effects should not be too surprising since they are less likely to contain

regime changes of the type discussed above.


II. Bounding Possible Errors'

      The analysis so far establishes the empirical irrelevance of McCallum's

criticism of evidence pointing to the non—adjustment of nominal interest rates.

This section reconsiders McCallum's econometric argument and the next section re—

examines its theoretical basis.

      Consider McCallum's example:
                                                                                    (i)
       itP+EtIIt+i+vt
                                                                                    (2)

where I have changed his notation 'but nothing else. McCallum's analysis focuses

on low frequency estimates of the relationship:

          =     +
                     + i 11t + Vt
He notes that a researcher estimating this relationship in either the time or

frequency domain would conclude that the Fisher relationship failed to hold

even though it was built into the econonr by assumption in (1) as long as iii, < 1.

       Equation (3) is temporally misaligned relative to the actual estimation

presented in Summers (1982),


          =   (p +   +
                            11t+l + Ut

where the actual realization of inflation is used as a proxy for its expec-

tation.2 McCallum in a footnote asserts that the distinction between (3) arid

(14) is immaterial. To see that this is in general incorrect, consider the spe-

cial case where e1 is perfectly forcastable using information available to

agents but not available to econometricians. Then clearly, 1Ttl =                  and
                                                                         E(fl+1)
so (14) provides a legitimate test for the Fisher effect even though (3) does

not.

       As McCallum (19T6)   himself   was the first to point out, (14) can be thought

of as having the classical errors in variables problem. Under the assumption of

rational expectations,           is a noisy measure of E(JTt+i). This means that

will be 'biased towards 0. As Delong (1983) demonstrates, a parallel result to

be classical errors in variables formula holds in the frequency domain as well.
                                           —5—



There      is no deep identification problem here, only one of errors in variables.

       A   primitive solution to the errors in variables problem is     to bound the bias

by-   running the   regression equation in the opposite direction. In     fact this Is
not   necessary in the two variable case since the reverse regression coefficient

can be calculated as the ratio of the            to the slope coefficient in the origi-

nal regression. This primitive solution to the errors in variables (and

simultaneity) problem was      discussed   and implemented in my original paper.

Implicitly, it was     also   implemented by Lucas (1980) who exhibits his data

graphically without explicitly estimating regressions. The results in my work

suggested that in almost all cases, the point estimates bounded the effect of

expected inflation on interest rates below that predicted by the Fisher theory.

       An alternative procedure for calculating the possible bias in band spectral

estimates of (1) is to calculate explicitly the noise to signal ratio for           as

a measure     of E(ll). This approach is taken by Delong (1983) who concludes that,

"there is no Fisher effect before World War II and after World War I it is not

possible to believe both in the distortionary effects of the tax system and the

Fisher effect."

       There is both a methodological and a substantive point in this section.

The latter confirms in a different way the empirical analysis of the first sec-

tion suggesting that problems of measuring inflation expectations are not an

important explanation for negative results regarding the Fisher effect. The

methodological point is that it is easy to determine whether expectational

errors are an important problem, and to estimate the nEgnitude of any biases

they engender.

III.    The Validity of Expectational Distributed Lags

        As the previous section n.de clear, the use of actual inflation as a proxy

for expected inflation involves errors in variables problems, but not deeper

issues of the type raised first by Sargent (1971). Here, I demonstrate that

even if lagged rather than actual values of inflation had been used in the ana-

lysis, there would be no serious problem. The now traditional critique of iden-

tification in distributed lag irodels is incorrect once the need for economic

agents to learn the true economic model is recognized. The point made here is

spelled out in xrore detail, and its implications for rational expectations eco-

nometrics are spelled out in more detail in Summers (19814).

        Consider again McCallum's example given in (1) and (2). McCallum and

Sargent (1971), (1973) implicitly argue that a regression of i on any distri-

buted lag of past JI would yield a coefficient of            on    and 0 on all lagged

ITs. This argument implicitly assumes that agents know            and    divinely and

need not try to infer them from the data, unlike underprivileged ecoriometri—

cians. Friedman (1980) discusses the implausibility of this assumption.

       Assume on the other hand that agents always use some finite amount of past

data to estimate the parameter c in (2). If their estimates are unbiased,

they must have the property that:




or
              +
                  l   ' =

     equivalently that:

              =                                                                     (6)
                  (1—p1)11



where    IT   refers   to the mean value of fl in the sample period over which the para—
                                                         —7—


meter P0 is being estimated. Suppose for example that agents always use only

the nxst recent N observations in estimating P0. Then an estimte of' (3) in

which additional lagged                  values   were included would yield:


           =       +              + (i_)          pt—i +    e                                        (7)



Note that the weights on the inflation terms in (7) sum to unity. This result

generalizes easily                to   the case where          follows a irore complicated process than

(2). It also can be generalized to allow for alternative learning procedures in

which the weight given to past data declines gradually.

     A more significant generalization of this result proceeds as follows.

Consider any method by which agents try                        to   discern structure and forecast a sta-

tionary time series. Estimation and forecasting using time series models is one

example of such a method. Any explicitly described method will give rise to a

functional relationship between forecasts and past data of the form:4


               =
                   F(llt,JItl,.....lltNl)
This function can be approximated by using its Taylor expansion about the sample

mean value of II.                This yields:


               =
                   F(tL...tNl)                 +y. [ll •       —
                                                                                                    (8)

where y. =
       1
                       t—i
                             )      . If   we impose the minimal rationality requirement on the

function   F that F(Tt,L...T!Nl) =                 ii,   we obtain:



                           N—l
                                                   .
                                                  N—i
               =       +                   —
                           .

Substituting for II using the definition                11 =             yields
                                                                   1=0

where r =           1.   •   The sum of the bracketed terms in (10) is unity.     This
                     1
              1=0
establishes       that in general learning procedures applied to finite bodies of data
which satisfy a minimal rationality requirement will have the property that they
are   best approximated as weighted averages of past data with weights summing to

unity.5

      Thus,    once agents need to learn the mean inflation rate is recognized, tra-

ditional expectational distributed lags and their maintained hypothesis that the

sum of the lag weights used in forming inflation expectations is unity are vin-

dicated. McCallum's equation (9) shows that when the sum of the weights on

lagged inflation used in forecasting inflation is unity, band spectral

regressions will provide a legitimate test of the Fisher effect. Of course,

depending upon how agents process information, the lag length may be quite long.

But this corresponds to the available empirical evidence on inflation and

interest rates, particularly for the l860—l94O period, and also confirms the

desirability of using low frequency techniques.



IV. Conclusions

      The point MeCallum makes while technically correct is of negligible

substantive       importance for studies of the Fisher effect. Nor should his paper
                                      —9—


deter future investigations from using low frequency econometric techniques in

appropriate settings. There is no econometric "wonder technique" that will give

right answers in all settings. Empirical workers have at their disposal a

variety of techniques which will work well in some situations and poorly in

others. Successful empirical work requires an appropriate nRtch betweeen sta-

tistical technique and the data and question being examined. In order to be

telling, criticism of econometric techniques must go far beyond denonstrating

that conceivable settings exist where they will not yield meaningful results.

While McCallum shows that such settings exist for band spectral techniques, this

does not call into questions their utility in the setting where they have been

applied.   If economists are going to test the "long run" implications of their
theories, some technique like   band spectral regression will be necessary.

1. This section draws heavily on DeLong (1983).

2. Because of problems of data alignment, the equation estimated r.y not be

   exactly equivalent to (4).

3. We assume implausibly that     is known. This assumption is relaxed below.

4. One example of a learning procedure would be the rolling ARMA method

   described   in Section I. By nRking N arbitrarily large, any procedure can be

   approximated. Note that there is no requirement that observations be used sym-

   metrically. Giving   nre weight to recent data is consistent with (7).
5. Note that it is possible that some of the I will be negative. This will

   occur if plausible learning procedures are applied to non—stationary series.
