                  PRIVATE MILITARY R&D INVESTMENT:
                          DODS IR&D POLICY


                              ABSTRACT




    A relatively obscure defense procurement policy establishes a large

subsidy to private military R&D investment. On the surface, it appears

that the marginal subsidy to suéh investment is zero, but this is only

true in the short run. Due to DOD's policy of allowable-cost determina-

tion, the long-run subsidy is substantial. It is much larger, in fact,

than the subsidy provided by the R&D Tax Credit enacted in 1981. I

calculate the subsidy by estimating an econometric model using

contractor-level data from the Defense Contract Audit Agency. This

subsidy may have an important influence on the amount and character of

privately financed innovation in the U.S.

     In a previous paper (1988) I argued that the Department of Defense

encourages its contractors to invest their own   funds   in defense—related

research and development (R&D) by sponsoring design competitions for the

award of major weapons contracts. I estimated the amount of private R&D

investment devoted to winning the "prizes" offered by the Pentagon, and

found it to be subatantialj

     This paper seeks to show that the Defense Department encourages

private military R&D not only by establishing prizes, but also by subsi-

dizing expenditures dedicated towards winning the prizes. In other

words, DOD promotes this contractor activity both by creating returns to

it and by reducing the (private marginal) costs of it.

     The Defense Department policy that provides a subsidy to private

military R&D is its policy regarding so-called "Independent" R&D.

Independent R&D is contractor-initiated and -directed technical effort•

that is not sponsored by, or required in performance of, a contract or

grant. The contractor selects the projects that comprise its IR&D

program. The Defense Department and its contractors consider indepen-

dent, or non-contract, R&D to be "company-funded" R&D, and it is reported

as such in financial statements and official government R&D statistics.

But under the Defense Procurement Regulations, some of the costs of

Independent R&D are "allowable," i.e. they can be included as indirect

costs (overhead) in contractors' Defense Department contracts. Each

year, ceilings on the amount of allowable Independent R&D     costs   are

negotiated in advance by the Defense Department and each of its major




     11n a recent paper, Rogerson (1988) has estimated the value of the
prizes (economic profits) contained in aerospace contracts using an
event-study methodology.

contractors. the existence of a subsidy to private military R&D is due

to the way in which these ceilings are negotiated or determined.

     In this paper I will formulate a simple model of allowable IR&D cost

determination, and estimate the model using data for about 275 contrac—

tars compiled by the Defense Contrsct Audit Agency. These estimates

enable me to calculate the (long—run) marginal rate of subsidy to con-

tractor Independent R&D investment.

     A major point of this paper is that, whereas the apparent marginal

rate of subsidy to independent R&D is zero, the true (long-nan) subsidy

is positive and substantial. The apparent subsidy is zero because

virtually all firms spend an amount in excess of the ceiling on allowable

costs previously negotiated with the Defense Department.2 Costs beyond

the ceiling cannot be recovered from the Pentagon. But the true marginal

subsidy is positive because the negotiated ceiling is an

increasing function of lagged expenditures. Thus a contractor whose

independent R&D costs already exceed his ceiling will not recover more

funds from DOD this year by increasing his expenditure, but he will

recover more in future years.

     If IR&D policy does establish a subsidy for private military R&D

investment, it may have an important effect on the amount and character

of innovative activity in the U.S., and consequently on the nation's

economic performance. Since IR&D policy does not subsidize private

civilian R&D investment, it would lower the price to firms of sponsoring

military R&D relative to that of sponsoring civilian R&D, and therefore




     21n 1986 aggregate (across all contractors) independent R&D costs
incurred was $5.0 billion, and aggregate allowable coats was $3.5
billion.

increase the relative quantity of military R&D. If, moreover, the aggre-

gate supply of R&D inputs were aufficiently inelastic, the policy could

reduce the absolute (as well as relative) amount of civilian R&D. There

is abundant evidence that civilian R&D has a much larger impact on indus-

trial productivity and other performance measures than military R&D.3

The IR&D program may influence U.S. productivity growth by influencing

the amount and composition (military versus civilian) of induatrial R&D.

     In Section I I describe DOD's IR&D policy and specify a model of

allowable-cost determination, which enables me to compute the (long-run)

marginal subsidy to private military R&D investment. In Section II I

briefly describe the data set and present the empirical results. Section

III contains concluding remarks.



I. A MODEL OF DOD's POLICY OF ALLOWABLE-COST DETERMINATION

     To develop a model of DOD's policy of allowable-cost determination,

we adopt the following notation:



                    C =   ceiling on allowable   costa

                    X =   total costa incurred
                    R = costs recovered from OOD

                    S =   total   salea of the contractor

                    D = DOD sales of the contractor




      3See, for example, Criliches and Lichtenberg (1984), and Griliches
 (1986).
                                                                              4




R, the amount of costs recovered from DOD, is determined by the following

formula



               R =     min(X,C)


Cost recovered is the fraction of firm sales accounted for by sales to

DOD times either Costa incurred or the ceilings, whichever is lower.

     As Table I indicates, in practice, X   C in the case of all firms.

The maximum value of the ratio C/X is 1; the mean and median values are

.823 and .872, respectively. Hence min(X,C) = C.   Let us define 0 = D7S

as the DOD share of sales; we shall treat this fraction as a parameter.

Then equation (1) reduces to


                                  R=B.C                                  (2)



The private cost to the firm P of conducting a level of investment X is


                               PX- R
                                  =x-ec                                  (3)



The marginal rate of subsidy to contractor IR&D expenditure is


                            MR8_dR_e dC                                   4
                                  dX


The marginal private cost of investment, which is generslly hypothesized

to determine the equilibrium rate of investment, is 1 —   S.     The margin-

al rate of subsidy, hence marginal private cost, depends on the deriva-

tive dC/dX. A primary objective of my empirical work is to determine the

value of this derivative.

     The ceiling C is set in an agreement negotiated by the firm and DOD

_____   to   the investment of funds- One might, therefore, regard C as

predetermined, i.e. independent of the realized expenditure X. In this

case, dC/dX = 0 and IR&D reimbursement has no effect on the marginal

private coat of investment; it reduces only total costs, like a lump-sum

payment. But the proposition that C does not depend on X, if it is true

at all, is probably only trud in the short run. Winston (1985, p. 22)

maintained that "the accepted ceilings are set at a fraction of the

contractor's anticipated tRW expenditures that are deemed to meet the

Pt-fR criterion and to be of value of DOD." This hypothesis can be repre-

sented as follows;

                                        =   Y


where C denotes the ceiling negotiated for period t and           denotes

anticipated expenditure during the period. Suppose 4        is   forecast by a

distributed lag function of past actual expenditures, with geometrically

declining lag coefficients;



                       4 = 6(X_ ÷ ?(t_2 ÷
Substituting (6) into (5),


                       C = yâ(X_1   +               +   ÷
                                        AX_2

It is well known (see, e.g., Pindyck and Rubinfeld (1981, pp. 232-3))

that eq. (7) can be rewritten in the more empirically tractable auto-

regressive form


                              C =               +
                                                                           7




where   a y'6. In this model there is a distinction between the

short-run and long-run derivatives of C with respect to X; these are

and I(l - N), respectively.

     It is interesting to note that an alternative "structuralt' model for

determining C can generate a similar (although restricted) reduced—form

equation. Suppose that the change in a firm's negotiated ceiling is

proportional to the degree of "excess demand" for IR&D funds, as measured

by the difference between lagged costs incurred and the lagged ceiling:



                       C — Ct_i   =              -
                                      (X_1           Ct_i)

Adding Ct1 to both sides,


                        C =           + (1   -
                                                 B)C_1                 (10)


In eq. (10) the coefficients on X_1 and Ct_I sum to 1, whereas this is

not the case in eq. (8). This restriction can be tested by estimating

both equations.

     Below I report estimates of these equations based on cross—sectional

data for about 275 IR&D sponsoring organizations. To attenuate

heteroskedasticity and for other reasons, I estimate logarithmic versions

of the equations, i.e., C and X are defined as logarithms of the respec-

tive variables. In this case     and b/(l - N) are respectively the short-

and long-run elasticities of C with respect to X. The long-run

tive of C with respect to X is

is in general a function of the previous year's ceiling, modified by any
changes in expected sales base or sales mix."

II.   DATA AND EMPIRICAL RESULTS

      The data for this investigation are derived from Detailed

tical Reports on IR&DIB&P Costs Incurred y Major Contractors for 1985-56

compiled by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA).5 The DCAA report

contains data on expenditures, ceilings, and reimbursements pertaining to

another type of technical effort related to IR&D: the preparation of

bids and proposals (B&P). Because the reasoning which led to the speci-

fication of eqs. (8) and (13) applies as well to B&P as it does to IR&D

expenditure, these equations are estimated for both IR&D and B&P expendi-

ture. The disturbances of the IR&D and B&P equations are likely to be

correlated, in part because there is some fungibility of expenditures

between the two categories. We can therefore obtain more efficient

parameter estimates by estimating the IR&D and B&P equationa jointly,

using Zeilner's seemingly unrelated regresaions (joint generalized least

Audit Agency for providing me with these data.

squares) technique.    In. this context we can also test the hypothesis that

the parameters of equation (8), hence MRSaI are the same for B&P as they

are for IR&D.

     Joint generalized least squares estimates for IR&D snd B&P of

equation (8) are presented in the first two columns of Table 2. I also

report point estimates and standard errors of the nonlinear function of

the parameters /(l -   X),   since this expression is needed to compute the

long—run marginal subsidy. (The standard errors were computed by esti-

mating the model using a nonlinear regresaion procedure.) In both

equations, the parameter      (the coefficient on X_1) is positive and

significantly different from zero. The hypothesis that       + X = 1, which

is implied by the model (9), is decisively rejected in the case of IR&D

but is not rejected Cat the .10 level) in the case of B&P. The cross-

model residual correlation is -.093, suggesting that there is some

substitution between IR&D and B&P ceilings and/or expenditure. In the

third column of Table 2 I report estimates of the model on which the

restriction is imposed that the parameters      and A are identical across

equations. The P—statistic (prob. value) for testing this restriction is

1.68 (.187), so I am unable to reject this restriction.

     table 3 presents calculations of the average and (long—run) marginal

rates of subsidy separately for IR&D and B&P and for the two categories

pooled. The long-run marginal subsidy to IR&.D alone is 36.9 percent,

slightly less than (but not significantly different from) the average

subsidy of 43.4 percent. The marginal and average subsidies to B&P

expense are somewhat higher: 45.7 and 55.6 percent, respectively.

In the case of B&P, the difference between the estimated marginal and

average subsidy rates is significant. Since we were unable to reject the

hypothesis of equality of the [R&D and B&P coefficients, the pooled

results perhaps deserve the greatest emphasis. These imply that the

government pays 41.3 percent of the marginal cost of IR&D and B&P ex-

pense. This is slightly (although significantly) less than the average

subsidy rate of 47.4 percent.

       The rates of subsidy were computed using data for 1985-86; it is

natural to ask whether similar rates applied in the past. Data presented

by Winston (1985, p. 67) reveal that the average subsidy for IR&D and B&P

combined during the period 1974-84 ranged between 41.4 and 48.0 percent,

with little discernible trend. But Hill and Bodilly (1988) assert that

IR&D cost "recovery is now less tightly tied to the firm's expenditure"

than it was in the past, implying that the marginal subsidy rate has

declined.

       The marginal rates of subsidy to IR&D and SW appear to be quite

high. The R&D Tax Credit created by the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act

provides a bencbmark against which we can compare this subsidy. The

provisions of the credit allowed firms to deduct from their tax liability

an amount equal to 25 percent of their R&D spending above a certain

base-period amount. But due to certain technical festures of the creait

--   particularly   the way in which the bsse-period amount was cslculated --

the   effective rate of subsidy it provided was much lower than 25 percent;

Baily and Chakrabarti (1988, p. 119) estimate that the effective rate of

subsidy was 7 to 8 percent. Moreover, the credit was only temporary --

it was originally due to expire at the end of 1985 after 4-k years.       In

contrast, DOD's IR&D policy has remained essentially unchanged since

1970, and predecessor policies can be traced back to the l930s.

III. CONCLUDING REMARKS

     The evidence presented in this paper is consistent with the hypothe-

sis that the Defense Department, via its independent R&D policy, provides

a substantial implicit subsidy -- on the order of 40 percent --   to
private military R&D investment. Contractors spend above their ceilings

on allowable costs, so it appears on the surface that the marginal

subsidy ia zero. This appearance is misleading because in the long run,

negotiated ceilings respond positively to lagged expenditures.

     While our estimates reveal the magnitude of the subsidy to private

military R&D, they do not reveal how much (additional) R&D is undertaken

due to the existence of the subsidy. To determine this with any preci-

sion, we would need to know the price-elasticity of supply of R&D, a

parameter about which little is known. But the existence of the subsidy

is no doubt partly responsible for the fact (established in my earlier

paper) that the marginal private R&D intensity of government (primarily

defense) sales is much higher than the R&D intensity of nongovernment

sales ——   9.3   percent as opposed to 1.7 percent.

     The main point of this paper is that the government encourages

private defense-related R&D investment by providing an implicit subsidy

to. this activity as well as by establishing rewards or prizes for per-

forming it. We conclude by briefly considering two questions about the

"logic" of this policy.

     First, why does the government provide a subsidy for private mili-

tary R&D, in addition to establishing prizes for innovation? Presumably

if the subsidy were abolished the government could continue to induce the

same amount of private R&D investment by increasing the value of the

prizes. The answer may be that the cost to the goverpment of promoting a
given level of investment may be lower with a combination of prizes and

subsidies than it would be with prizes alone. By providing a subsidy the

government in effect shares with the contractor the risk of investment;

the agency theory literature suggests that such risk-sharing is often

optimal from the principal's (government's) point of view.

     The second question is, given that the government wanta to provide a

subsidy, why doesn't it do so explicitly by announcing "we'll pay 40

percent of your independent R&D expense, with no ceiling," rather than by

imposing ceilings that are in reality influenced by past expenditures? It

is not possible to offer a definitive answer to this question, but two

factors may account for the institutional arrangements we have described.

First, while the major objective of independent R&D policy is to

strengthen the defense technology base by promoting private military R&D

investment, for political reasons the Defense Department may need to at

least appear to be "controlling costs" by imposing ceilings.6 Second,

the government is interested not only in encouraging private innovation

but also in transferring technologies and knowledge developed in the

course of independent R&D to government officials. The negotiation of

ceilings provides the government with the opportunity to monitor contrac-

tor activity, thereby facilitating technology transfer.




     6Alexander (1988, p. 35) notes that there are two offices within the
office of the Secretary of Defense involved with independent R&D policy:
The Deputy Undersecretary for Research and Advanced Technology, whose
primary concern is the promotion of technology and the encouragement of
industry R&D, and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Procurement, whose
primary concern is reducing the cost of acquisition.
