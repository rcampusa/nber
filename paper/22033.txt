Does Fundraising Create New Giving?

NBER Working Paper No. 22033
February 2016
JEL No. D64,H41

                                          ABSTRACT

Despite an extensive literature on the impacts of a variety of charitable fundraising techniques,
little is known about whether these activities increase overall giving or merely cause donors to
substitute away from other causes. Using detailed data from Donorschoose.org, an online
platform linking teachers with prospective donors, I examine the extent to which matching grants
for donations to certain requests affect giving to others. Eligibility for matches is determined in
entirely by observable attributes of the request, providing an exogenous source of variation in
incentives to donate to between charities. I find that, while matches increase giving to eligible
requests, they do not appear to crowd out giving to similar ones, either contemporaneously or
over time.

       Despite the increased focus on the science of philanthropy in recent years (see Andreoni
and Payne (2013) for an overview), charitable giving has remained fairly stable at around two per-
cent of GDP in the United States (Perry, 2013). Given the vast literature on the efficacy of solicita-
tion in general and of specific fundraising approaches on a charity’s own donations, this observa-
tion raises the question of whether fundraising activities by a charity increase overall giving or mere-
ly crowds out some other part of an individual’s altruism budget. The answer is of great importance
to the theoretical and empirical literature on altruism and policy questions like the impact of tax
preferences for charitable giving.
       However, the prerequisites for a full answer to this question are daunting. To begin, a
thorough accounting of the altruism budget requires data on all formal giving to both individual
charities and potentially altruistic non-charity causes (such as campaigns to elect politicians who
support policies that the donor believes have public goods aspects); all informal and casual giving
(such as donations on the street or to door-to-door solicitors); intrafamily transfers motivated by
altruism (Browning and Chiappori, 1998); volunteering (Brown, Meer, and Williams, 2015); dona-
tions of blood or organs (Kessler and Roth, 2012; Lacetera, Macis, and Slonim, 2012); and will-
ingness to pay more for charity-linked goods (Elfenbein and McManus, 2010), inter alia. One
would then perturb donations to, say, an individual charity, either through random assignment or a
natural experiment (to avoid the endogeneity inherent in charities’ decisions to engage in fundrais-
ing activities) and monitor the effect within and across each form of giving over time – including
bequests at the end of life. Such an exercise would allow one to fully assess whether increases in
giving to one cause expand the total philanthropic budget or shift giving from one cause to another.
       This approach is, to put it mildly, impractical. Yet, as an approximation, extremely detailed
data on closely-related charities with exogenously-given incentives to donate to certain ones could,
at least, answer the question within that context. DonorsChoose.org, an online platform that allows
public school teachers to raise funds for projects, is well-suited for this approach. Donations to
some projects posted on the site are matched by DonorsChoose.org’s partners, usually foundations
or corporations. Importantly, matches are made exclusively on the basis of observable characteris-
tics of the project – there is no scope to include or exclude a specific project if it does not meet the
criteria specified by the match. For example, a match may be given to all mathematics-related pro-
jects in a particular state. Both projects already existing on the site and those posted afterwards re-
                                                                                                        4

ceive the match; funds are dispensed when projects reach their goals, and the offer continues until
the funds provided by the partner are exhausted.
        I create a daily panel of DonorsChoose.org projects, comprising nearly 30 million observa-
tions on 350,000 projects. In specifications with project and day fixed effects, I document that, in
line with the previous literature, matching grants increase giving to that charity. I then examine how
the presence of similar projects with (and without) matches affects giving, both cross-sectionally on
a given day, and over time. The identifying assumption is that there are no shocks to giving to a
particular project on a particular day that are correlated with its likelihood of receiving a match; as
described more fully in Section 3, the structure of the matching process at DonorsChoose.org is
such that this type of correlation is unlikely. While it is certainly possible – and perhaps probable –
that teachers increase their personal fundraising efforts in response to being matched, that is a
mechanism by which charities may raise more funds in the presence of a matching grant. If match-
es crowd in givers who would not have otherwise made a donation, this is part of the outcome ra-
ther than a source of bias.
        I find no evidence that giving to a particular charity is reduced by the presence of induce-
ments to give to others; most of the estimates are, in fact, positive and precisely-estimated, but quite
small. This finding is robust to different definitions of the similarity of projects and alternative spec-
ifications. Restrictions on the types of donations considered (such as including only those who give
to multiple schools) provide suggestive evidence that the results are not, in fact, being driven by
increased teacher effort when matched. Finally, I aggregate the data to a daily time series and show
that overall giving to DonorsChoose.org by non-partner donors increases when more projects are
matched.
        Of course, I cannot state whether the total amount given by donors to all possible causes
increases (especially over long time horizons). However, the strong similarity of projects at
DonorsChoose.org suggests that crowd-out from additional fundraising activities, in the form of
matching, would be particularly high in this context. Finding little to no substitution of giving is an
important piece of evidence on the economics of altruism and philanthropy, as well as an encour-
aging sign for fundraising professionals. In Section 2, I discuss the previous literature on solicita-
tion, matching grants, and crowd-out of giving to related charities; in Section 3, I provide more de-
tails on the DonorsChoose.org data and describe the econometric approach. The results are pre-
sented in Section 4, and Section 5 concludes.

2. Previous Literature
        The literature on charitable giving highlights the importance of solicitation (Andreoni,
Trachtman, and Rao, 2011; Meer and Rosen, 2011; DellaVigna, List, and Malmendier, 2012).
The key result is that giving is rare without fundraising. Charities often look to spur donations
through various inducements, like providing gifts (Falk, 2007; Alpizar, Carlsson, and Johansson-
Stenman, 2008; Eckel, Herberich, Meer, 2015), recognition and prestige (Harbaugh, 1998), and,
very commonly, matching grants (Eckel and Grossman, 2008; Karlan and List, 2007; Huck, Rasul,
and Shepherd, 2015). In general, the existence of a match increases the likelihood of receiving a
donation, though not on the size of the donation, and the rate of the match appears to have little
impact. Yet while the charity with a match benefits, research on whether this giving crowds out do-
nations to other charities is limited.
        Theoretical models, primarily on the optimal regulation of charities, depend heavily on this
issue. For example, Rose-Ackerman’s (1982) findings on the regulation of fundraising depends on
the degree to which donors “recognize that high levels of fundraising may be translated into higher
donations from others,” understanding that they “benefit little if fundraising simply shifts funds be-
tween charities that they find ideologically attractive.” Similarly, Aldashev and Verdier (2010), de-
veloping a model of nongovernmental organizations, note that “the crucial question is how effective
fundraising efforts are in attracting new donors,” and that this is ultimately an empirical issue.
        Laboratory experiments, offering the advantages of a controlled environment, can be used
to examine the degree of crowd-out from additional choices or more intense solicitation for certain
charities. Motivated by the seemingly-overwhelming number of projects on crowdfunding sites,
Corazzini, Cotton, and Valbonese (2015) design an experiment with multiple threshold public
goods and show that increasing the number of competitors can decrease total contributions and the
likelihood that any option reaches its goal. Krieg and Samek (2014), in a similar experiment with
simultaneous public goods games, find that reducing the price of giving in one game increases giv-
ing to the untreated game, for an overall increase in total contributions. Using non-pecuniary incen-
tives (like recognition) results in more crowd-out of giving to the untreated game. Harwell et al.
(2015) give subjects a menu of charities to which they can donate, and examine within-subjects dif-
ferences in giving after participants are shown a video promoting one of those charities. They find
substantial shifting of donations to the targeted charity, but no impact on overall contributions.
Taken together, this recent literature suggests that results are highly dependent on context.
                                                                                                      6

        Field experiments have found mixed evidence as well. Meier (2007) shows that while do-
nors who are randomly assigned to the offer of a match for their gift initially donate more, their
giving rate falls after the match is removed. Ultimately, giving is lower in the long run for the treat-
ed group, highlighting the importance of examining effects beyond the initial period of an interven-
tion. Conversely, Landry et al. (2010) find that donors initially attracted by a lottery (as opposed to
a standard voluntary contribution mechanism) give more in future solicitations, without the offer of
an incentive, and Bekkers (2015) finds that those offered a match do not give less in response to a
natural disaster months later. In a somewhat different context, Lacetera, Macis, and Slonim (2012)
find that economic incentives to give blood substantially increases donations. However, turnout is
reduced at nearby and later drives, negating nearly half of the higher participation in response to
the incentives and demonstrating the importance of accounting for spillover effects.
        Papers using observational data find similarly divergent results. Cairns and Slonim (2011)
examine the effects of multiple collections at Catholic Masses, finding that about a fifth of the se-
cond collection is cannibalized from the first. Van Diepen, Donkers, and Franses (2009) combine
the databases of three large charities in the Netherlands, finding that a charity’s own mailings re-
duce revenue from subsequent solicitations, but mailings from competitor charities increase overall
giving in the short run, with no long-run impacts.
        Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics’s charitable giving supplement, Brown, Harris,
and Taylor (2012) find that donations during 2004 had a positive association with giving to help
victims of the December 2004 tsunami, and that giving to tsunami-related causes had a positive
impact upon giving in the 2006 calendar year. They conclude that “there is no evidence in the
analysis that giving to an unplanned natural disaster diverts future expenditure away from other
types of giving.” Reinstein (2010), also using the PSID, documents a similarly positive relationship
between giving to different types of charities. After controlling for individual fixed effects (which
would account for time-invariant altruistic preferences), though, he finds negative correlations be-
tween giving to certain categories, suggesting evidence of substitution. More to the point, the panel
nature of the PSID offers many advantages, but the two year gap between waves, the self-reported,
retrospective nature of the questions, and the general lack of truly exogenous variation in giving
limits its applicability to this question.
        Finally, two very recent papers use natural disasters to examine whether greater need for
certain causes (and perhaps attendant fundraising) crowd out giving to other causes. Using tax data,
                                                                                                                 7

Deryugina and Marx (2015) show that giving increases in response to nearby tornadoes, particular-
ly severe ones, and that the impact persists for several years. Scharf, Smith, and Wilhelm (2015)
use detailed data from the United Kingdom to examine giving in the aftermath of organized ap-
peals for disaster appeal, finding no reduction in giving to other charities.
        Even leaving aside the unattainable overarching puzzle of individuals’ lifetime altruism
budget, it is evident that there are unanswered questions in the literature. I use exogenously-
assigned incentives to give to particular projects in the rich data from DonorsChoose.org, de-
scribed in the next section, to estimate impacts both among charities at a given moment and over
time.

3. Data and Econometric Specification
       3.1 DonorsChoose.org
       Founded in 2000, DonorsChoose.org is an online platform that allows public school teach-
ers in the United States to post requests for funding. 1 Donors, whose gifts are tax-deductible, can
easily select projects to which to donate. The platform has raised nearly 400 million dollars from
two million donors, for 270,000 teachers in 66,000 schools. Over two-thirds of the public schools
in the United States have at least one teacher who has posted a project on the site. About 36 per-
cent of projects request classroom supplies, 22 percent request books, and 30 percent request
some type of technology.
        A teacher selects supplies from lists of approved vendors (no requests for labor or capital
improvements may be submitted). He or she writes several paragraphs regarding student needs
and the purpose of the supplies, as well as posting a photograph of the classroom and students.
The request’s web page includes information about the school (such as its location and poverty
level) and the project (such as its subject matter and the number of students reached). The request
includes an itemized list of the materials requested, their price and quantity, and any additional
charges. These projects are screened by the organization’s staff.
        If a project reaches its goal, DonorsChoose.org purchases the materials and ships them di-
rectly to the teacher to ensure quality. If the project expires prior to being funded, donors have the
option to have the funds returned to their account (to select another project) or to have
DonorsChoose.org select a project for them; in general, unfunded projects expire after five

the end date of the sample in this paper.

months. Screen captures of the main landing page, the search page, and sample requests are shown
in the Appendix. 2
         My data extract consists of 346,136 projects posted between January 2008 and May 2012,
of which 68.3 percent reached their goal and were funded. The mean request was $602, with a
median of $472. On average, projects were live for 81 days (median of 73); among successful pro-
jects, the mean time to funding was 51 days (median of 34). Aggregating individual donations to a
daily panel of projects yields 27.1 million day-project observations, of which 816,388 have at least
one donation from a non-partner donor; that is, the gift comes from an individual not affiliated
with DonorsChoose.org or its partner organizations. Conditional on receiving a donation on a giv-
en day, the average project receives 1.9 donations per day totaling $81 (median of $40).
         Further summary statistics are shown in Table 1; summary statistics for the numerous time-
invariant project attributes shown to prospective donors are not shown, as they are subsumed into
the project fixed effects described in Section 3.4.
         3.2 Matching Grants
         A number of foundations and corporations partner with DonorsChoose.org to provide
matching grants for projects, selecting the eligibility criteria that define the matches. These matches
come in two types. “Double Your Impact” (DYI) grants offer a standard dollar-for-dollar linear
match; 3 importantly, though, the funding is applied to gifts made prior to the start of the match.
There are 316 dollar-for-dollar matches in the sample, with an average amount of $49,182 (median
of $20,000) in partner funds, totaling $15.5 million. The other type of match is an “Almost Home”
(AH) grant, in which the partner organization offers all but the last $100 of funding to the project.
There are 86 matches of this type, with an average of $90,672 (median of $33,432), totaling $7.8
million. 4 Projects that have already accumulated half or more of their target amount (DYI) or are
within $100 of the target (AH) are ineligible, regardless of whether they meet the match criteria. In
both cases, funds are not committed by the partner unless the project fulfills its remaining need



2
  DonorsChoose.org made some changes to the layout of project pages after the data for this project was collected. The
screen captures shown are of the site in early 2011. The default sorting when browsing or searching projects is by ur-
gency, a metric determined by DonorsChoose.org based on the poverty level of the school and if the project was both
relatively close to completion and to expiration.
3
  “Double Your Impact” was renamed “Half Off” after the end date of the sample used in the paper. In early 2016, the
site is altering the nature of dollar-for-dollar grants once again; the practices discussed here are as they existed during
the sample period.
4
  There are a number of promotions as well, totaling $4.2 million in funds, but unlike the matches, these can by used
by donors on any project.
                                                                                                                   9

with others’ donations. When the amount given by the partner to successfully completed projects
is exhausted, the match ends. Projects that are still live return to being listed as unmatched.
        Given that the identification strategy requires that the matches be unrelated to the project’s
unobserved attributes, it is worth highlighting the nature of matching data provided by
DonorsChoose.org. These data consist of an identifier for the partner organization, the start date
of the match, the amount of the grant, and the parameters of the match. These parameters are de-
termined entirely by project characteristics and are reported as a search URL tagging the relevant
variables. 5 As such, there is no scope for unobservable attributes of the project to be correlated
with whether or not it is matched. New projects entering after the match is live are matched as well,
if they meet the criteria, though there is little scope for teachers to know the exact parameters and
tailor their appeals to be eligible. 6
        By comparing the match criteria to project characteristics and tracking the dates on which
funds are committed by the partner organization’s identifier, I am able to determine whether or
not a project is matched on a particular day. Of the 27.1 million day-project observations in the
data, 20.8 percent (5.65 million) are associated with a match. Importantly, there is substantial with-
in-project variation; about 35 percent of projects are ever matched.
        3.3 Competitors
        It is not immediately obvious how to determine what comprises a project’s set of competi-
tors. DonorsChoose.org has thousands – and sometimes tens of thousands – of live projects at any
given time. It stands to reason that users are not considering every possible project. Subject matter
and geographic location are reasonable candidates. Based on search data on the
DonorsChoose.org website during 2010, about 55 percent of searches or filters involve a geograph-
ic restriction and 29 percent involve a subject-area restriction (16 percent have both), far more than
any other search criteria. Moreover, among donors who give more than once, the average donor
gives 70 percent of their donations to projects in one subject area, with 39 percent giving to only
one. Donors give 79 percent of their donations to projects in one two-digit ZIP area (that is, the
area defined by the first two digits of the ZIP code), with 57 percent giving to only one ZIP2. 7 I
therefore define the competitor set as projects sharing the same subject and ZIP2, with an average

  An example of the match criteria provided is
“http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/search.html?subject4=-4&zone=104,” which returns all math and science pro-
jects in upstate New York.
6
  The results are unchanged when projects that were eligible for a match upon being posted are excluded from the
sample.
7
  A map of two-digit ZIP codes based on Census data is available in Appendix Figure A5.
                                                                                                      10

size of 162 total projects per day (median of 82), of which 40 are matched (median of 7). ZIP2 is
an arbitrary choice, of course, but the results are robust to using geographic areas both generally
larger (state) and smaller (three-digit ZIP or county), as seen in Table 3.
           3.4 Econometric Specification
           To estimate the impact of matches on funds raised, I first measure the impact on the prob-
ability of receiving a gift on a given day.

(1) P(Donationsit = 1) = β1·Matchedit + β2·MatchedCompetitorsit + β3·TotalCompetitorsit +
                         β4·PreviousMatchedCompetitorsit + β5·PreviousTotalCompetitorsit
                         + β6·DaysLiveit + Projecti + Datet + εit

           Equation (1) is estimated with ordinary least squares, and includes date fixed effects to con-
trol for time-specific factors that affect giving (such as increased news coverage that drives more
donors to the site) and project fixed effects to account for any time-invariant project-specific attrib-
utes that impact giving. These include not only the observable characteristics of the project, such as
the purpose of the funds or the poverty level of the school, but also unobservable characteristics
such as the quality of the teacher’s description or the photograph on the appeal page, as well as the
overall popularity of the project.
           The variables of interest are an indicator for whether the project itself is matched on that
day, the log of the number of matched and total competitors on that day, and the average daily
number of matched and total competitors over a period prior to that day; 8 in most specifications, I
use sixty days. I also include the log of the number of days the project has been live. Equation (2),
also estimated with ordinary least squares, estimates the impact of these variables on the log of the
amount donated, conditional on raising any funds that day. It is straightforward to combine the es-
timates from Equations (1) and (2) to estimate the total impact on (the natural log of) donations.




(2) Donationsit =                β1·Matchedit + β2·MatchedCompetitorsit + β3·TotalCompetitorsit +
                                 β4·PreviousMatchedCompetitorsit + β5·PreviousTotalCompetitorsit
                                 + β6·DaysLiveit + Projecti + Datet + εit if Donationsit > 0

           The effects of the time-varying variables are identified from within-project changes in
whether the project is matched and the number of its competitors. To ascribe a causal interpreta-

8
    I add one to the number of competitors prior to taking logs.
                                                                                                     11

tion to those coefficients, project- and day-specific shocks cannot be correlated with those varia-
bles. Given the manner in which matches are made at DonorsChoose.org, this is a reasonable as-
sumption. It is possible that lower-quality projects enter in response to a match, though project
fixed effects will account for those factors, and excluding those projects from the data does not
change the results. It is also possible that exogenous events, such as natural disasters, drive both
matches to be made to projects in particular area and donors to seek out those types of projects.
Specifications including ZIP2-by-month effects, which would account for any such shocks, are simi-
lar to the primary results.
        A possible objection to this interpretation is that teachers may respond to being matched by
increasing their off-site fundraising efforts – for example, by soliciting friends and family more in-
tensely. A teacher’s direct solicitations to friends and family for his or her own project as the result
of being matched should not crowd out donations to other projects, because those donors only
considered the project about which they were contacted. This is a plausible mechanism, but it is
also part of the effect that I am investigating. The impact of a matching grant on a charity’s funds is
a combination of the impact on donors from the presence of the grant, with no reaction by the
charity itself, and the impact on donors from the additional fundraising efforts that are concurrent
with the grant itself. These two factors may be of independent interest, but, in practice, they do not
occur independently. Nevertheless, in Section 4, I explore a number of alternative specifications in
which the likelihood that donors were directly contacted by the teacher posting the project is low;
the results are unchanged.

4. Results
    4.1 Primary Specification
        I begin by examining the impact of receiving a matching grant for the project itself. Column
1 of Table 2 presents the results of estimating Equation (1) on the 27.1 million project-day observa-
tions, in which the outcome is a binary variable equaling one if the project received any donations
from a non-partner donor on that day and zero otherwise; standard errors are clustered at the pro-
ject level. Receiving a match increases the likelihood of receiving any funds by 0.76 percentage
points (s.e. = 0.03 percentage points), a large effect relative to the baseline of three percent. In
Column 2, I estimate the impact on the log of the amount conditional on receiving any donations.
The effect is negative, but relatively small at -1.5 percent and statistically insignificant (s.e. = 1.1
percent). Combining these two effects in Column 3 shows that the average amount raised by
                                                                                                               12

matched projects increases by 2.8 percent (s.e. = 0.1 percent) on each day they are matched. These
results are consistent with the previous literature on the impact of matches – matches matter, but
their impact is concentrated on the extensive margin.
            Turning to the impact of contemporaneous competitors, the second row of Table 2 shows
that an increase in the number of matched competitors increases the funds raised by a particular
project. While statistically significant, though, the impact is quite small in magnitude: a ten percent
increase in the number of matched competitors, all else equal, increases the likelihood of receiving
a donation by one-one-hundredth of a percentage point (about three percent of the baseline), in-
creases the conditional average gift size by 1.1 percent, and has a total impact on donations of 0.4
percent. This is a very small, albeit precisely estimated, effect. An increase in the total number of
competitors in the same ZIP2-subject group on a given day has no impact, as seen in the third row
of Table 2, with the coefficients both miniscule in magnitude and statistically insignificant; the con-
fidence intervals are sufficiently narrow to exclude meaningful effects. Based on these results, it
does not seem that an increase in competition reduces donations accruing to a particular charity.
            This does not preclude, of course, intertemporal shifts in giving. The last two rows of Table
2 examine the impact of the average daily number of competitors over the previous sixty days. 9
Perhaps surprisingly, an increase in the average daily number of matched donors over that time
period increases both the likelihood of receiving a donation and its size, with a ten percent increase
resulting in a 0.2 percentage point increase in probability of a gift (s.e. = 0.02 percentage points)
and a 3.7 percent increase in the size of the gift (s.e. = 0.8 percent), for an overall impact of 0.9
percent (s.e. = 0.07 percent). While fairly small in magnitude, this result, coupled with the effects
of contemporaneous matched competitors, suggests that matched charities do not cannibalize do-
nations from other charities. An increase in the total number of competitors over the previous sixty
days does reduce giving somewhat, with a 0.36 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of re-
ceiving a gift (s.e. = 0.05 percentage points), resulting in a 1.4 percent reduction in average gift size.
            Recall that if the positive effect of a project being matched is purely the result of teachers
soliciting their social network for donations to their own project, then there should be no impact of
competitors’ matches either at the same time or over prior periods. Alternatively, if donations to
one project come entirely at the expense of donations to others, then the effects of competitors
should be negative and substantial enough to offset the effect of a project’s own match. These ef-

9
    I also used time horizons of fourteen, thirty, and ninety days. The results do not differ substantially.
                                                                                                  13

fects are more easily seen in aggregate data, described in Section 4.4, which show no evidence of
crowd out. Regardless, the positive effects of contemporaneous matched competitors suggests that
matches induce donors to consider other, similar projects, and the positive effects of previous
matched competitors suggest that donors are induced to return to projects of that type.

    4.2 Interactions
        To investigate how the impact of competitors varies with the matching status of the project,
I interact the indicator for matching with each of the four variables defining the number of
matched and total competitors in Table 3.
          There is no change in the impact of the number of contemporaneous matched competitors
on the probability of receiving any donations when a project is matched, though an increase in the
total number of projects reduces the likelihood of receiving a donation when the project itself is
matched. On the intensive margin, though, a ten percent increase in the number of matched com-
petitors reduces the amount of donations when a project is matched, while it increases the amount
received by unmatched projects slightly. There is no impact on the intensive margin of an increase
in the total number of competitors. These results suggest that donors are stumbling across matched
projects rather than seeking them out; if donors were seeking out matched projects, then an in-
crease in the number of matched competitors would reduce the likelihood that any one matched
project receives funding, while an increase in the number of total competitors would have no im-
pact.
          Turning to the effects of competition over the previous sixty days, an increase in the num-
ber of matched competitors over that time period has a more positive effect on fundraising for
matched projects, again suggesting that donors develop a taste for matched projects of that type.
Further evidence for this hypothesis is provided by the interaction with the total number of com-
petitors; while greater previous competition reduces funds raise by unmatched projects, matched
projects counteract this effect and, indeed, more previous competition has a somewhat positive
impact.




    4.3 Robustness
        4.3.1 Alternative Definitions of Competitor Groups
        An important issue is whether the results are sensitive to the definition of the competition
group. In Columns 1 to 3 of Tables 4A, 4B, and 4C, I show that this is not the case. I define com-
                                                                                                                    14

petitors are those with both the same subject matter and the same ZIP3 (the area defined by the
first three digits of the ZIP code, a far smaller area than ZIP2); those with the same subject and
state; and those with the same subject and county. In each case, the results are essentially un-
changed. 10
         4.3.2 Restrictions on Donors
         As discussed above, the impact of matching is a combination of both the teacher’s in-
creased solicitation of his or her social network and the increased attention given to a matched pro-
ject by donors who have no connection to the teacher. The results in Table 2 suggest that the for-
mer effect cannot be the only operative one, but it is possible to address this issue in another way.
While there is relatively little data on the donors themselves, there are several attributes available
that are likely to be correlated with being subject to increased fundraising efforts directly from the
teacher that occur with the presence of a match.
         First, donors can self-identify as teachers themselves on their account. I exclude these ac-
counts when aggregating donations to the day-project panel level and estimate the three specifica-
tions in Table 2 in Column 4 of Tables 4A, 4B, and 4C. It is evident that there is little difference
from the main results when using this sample.
         Second, both donors and teachers can set up “giving pages,” in which they highlight pro-
jects that they find particularly worthy. DonorsChoose.org tracks whether donors make their gifts
through these giving pages; it stands to reason that these donors are more likely to be subject to
additional solicitation when a project is matched. Excluding donations made in such a manner
from the data also makes little difference to the results, as seen in Column 5.
         Third, I exclude donations made from the same ZIP3 as the project. Given many donors’
preference for giving to projects in close proximity, it is unsurprising that this restriction removes a
large number of donations from the data. Nevertheless, the results, in Column 6, remain broadly
similar to the primary specifications.
         Finally, in Columns 7 and 8, I only include donors who give to more than one project and
donors who give to more than one school. This removes individuals who only give in response to
social pressure related to the project (though, of course, other one-time donors as well) and those
who only give, for example, to their child’s own school. Once again, the results are quite similar

10
   Since geographic area appears to be primary search criterion for many donors, as described in Section 3.3, I also
estimated specifications in which the competitor group was defined as all projects in the same ZIP2 or ZIP3, irrespec-
tive of subject matter. The qualitative interpretation of the coefficients is unchanged: very small, precisely estimated
estimated impacts of competitors, with positive effects of additional matched competitors.
                                                                                                     15

        The impact of a project’s own match is similar across the five sets of results. This suggests
that the impact of matching is not driven primarily by increased teacher solicitation, and provides
additional evidence that the effects of additional matched competitors are not spurious.
        4.3.3 Alternative Specifications
        To check whether the log parameterization is masking patterns in the results, I also esti-
mate the model using linear and quadratic terms, as well as partitioning the number of competitors
into bins. These results, available on request, show no indication that the results in Table 2 are
driven by the log transformation of the number of competitors.
        I also examine the probability that a project receives its first donation or that it reaches its
threshold on a given day. In both cases, an increase in the number of matched projects both con-
temporaneously and over the previous sixty days increases the likelihood of a positive outcome;
while the coefficients are precisely estimated, they are extremely small and economically insignifi-
cant.

    4.4 Time Series Evidence
        If the results above are an accurate reflection of the impact of matching, then more dollars
accrue to DonorsChoose.org when a larger proportion of projects are matched. I examine this di-
rectly, by aggregating the data to a daily panel for the 1,611 days in the sample. To account for the
growth of DonorsChoose.org and time patterns in giving, I regressed the log amount of total dona-
tions, the log number of donations, and the log of the average donation size on a linear, quadratic,
and cubic time trend, along with day-of-week effects. I compared the residuals of each variable in
turn to the residual of the proportion of matched projects. In Figures 1A, 1B, and 1C, I plot the
vigintile (five percent bin) means of these values against each other, with the mean of the variable
added back in, including a regression line based on the full data sample. It is clear that there a posi-
tive correlation between a large share of projects matched and a greater number of dollars raised
from more donations. The average donation size is somewhat smaller, but the relationship is weak.
While the outcome of this exercise is not necessarily causal, coupled with the results above it is
strongly suggestive that matches within DonorsChoose.org are not simply cannibalizing donations
from other projects though, once again, I have no data on whether these additional funds reduce
giving to other charitable causes.

5. Conclusion
                                                                                                     16

       One of the most important outstanding questions in the charitable giving literature is
whether increases in fundraising by one charity reduce giving to others. Indeed, a necessary condi-
tion for fundraising to be effective overall is that it is effective on a subset of highly substitutable
alternatives. Using data from DonorsChoose.org, however, I am able to determine how exoge-
nously assigned incentives to donate to one cause affects giving to similar causes, both at the simul-
taneously and over time.
       In line with the previous literature, I find that matching grants increase the likelihood that a
given project receives donations and the overall amount it receives. I do not, however, find any ev-
idence that a greater number of matched competitors crowds out giving to a particular charity. It
does not appear that this effect is driven by increased fundraising efforts in response to the match,
but rather by donors developing a taste for matched charities of that type.
       DonorsChoose.org’s platform is well-suited for investigating this question, yet it is only one
sliver of the giving market. Indeed, I am unable to say whether the increase in donations in re-
sponse to matching crowds out giving to other causes or increases individuals’ overall giving budg-
ets. Given the contradictory results in the literature, investigating this issue in other contexts and
across multiple types of prosocial behavior is essential to a fuller understanding of the market for
altruism.
