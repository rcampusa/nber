We analyze under which conditions intermarriage can be used as an indicator of tolerance, and whether
such tolerant attitudes persisted in Germany during the last century. We find strong evidence for the
persistence of tolerant attitudes towards intermarriage with Jews. At the same time, our empirical analysis
also cautions against using intermarriage as a simple proxy for tolerance: The size of Jewish communities

Marriage is amongst the biggest decisions in life. In general, there is a tendency towards assortative

mating – people marry others who are relatively similar to themselves. Intermarriage between

different social, religious and ethnic groups in most societies is relatively rare (Blossfeld and Timm

2003). Where it occurs, it is associated with more rapid assimilation (Meng and Gregory 2005). The

frequency of intermarriage can therefore serve as a useful indicator of tolerant attitudes towards a

minority, and of the desire to integrate (Bisin, Topa, and Verdier 2004).

       In this paper, we analyze under which conditions intermarriage can be used as an indicator of

tolerance, and whether such tolerant attitudes persisted in Germany during the last century. We

combine information on individual-level attitudes from the German social survey (GESIS) with

historical data on marriage patterns. In Nazi Germany, marriages between Jews and “Aryans” were

considered a major threat to the racial purity of the German people. The strong trend towards more

intermarriage between Jews and gentiles that characterized the Weimar years came to an abrupt end

after 1933 (Figure 1). The Nuremberg racial laws placed heavy restrictions on intermarriage

(Burleigh and Wippermann 1991). The NS regime compiled detailed statistics on the ethnic

background of the population, classifying people as “full Jews”, “half Jews”, “quarter Jews”. These

records, created by the German authorities after 1933, can be used as a measure of past intermarriage.

                                           [Figure 1 here]

       We examine the extent to which a history of out-marriages in early 20th century Germany

predicts attitudes in the same location towards marrying a Jew almost a century later. The German

Social Survey (ALLBUS) questioned a representative sample of German respondents in 1996 and

2006 about their attitudes towards Jews. One set of survey question relates to preferences towards
                                                                                                    2


intermarriage with Jews. German levels of anti-Semitism today are broadly similar to those in other

European countries (Gabriel 2000). At the same time, distaste for intermarriage with Jews in

modern-day Germany is not low on average, and varies considerably from one location to the next.

We exploit this variation to examine if in towns and cities with numerous offspring from “mixed”

marriages in the period 1900-1940, modern-day attitudes towards intermarriage are markedly more

tolerant.

        We find strong evidence for the persistence of tolerant attitudes. However, our empirical

analysis also cautions against using intermarriage as a simple proxy for tolerance: The size of Jewish

communities in the early 20th century is an important confounding factor. In smaller communities,

where in-group matches were difficult to find, intermarriage was more frequent. At the same time,

small Jewish communities were typically located in smaller towns with less tolerant attitudes.

Therefore, smaller communities show both more intermarriage and less tolerance; raw correlations

suggest a negative relationship between intermarriage and tolerance today. To identify the historical

tolerance component in intermarriage, we use detailed data on elections for anti-Semitic parties

between 1890 and 1912. Where people voted less for the anti-Jewish parties, intermarriage was more

common; this component of historical intermarriage shows a positive association with present-day

attitudes towards marrying Jews.

                                              I.    Data

Before 1933, the only consistent source of information on the number of Jews in Germany was

compiled by the registry offices, which kept track of the legal residence of everyone living in

Germany. Jews were only counted as such if they were formally affiliated with the Jewish faith;

converts were not considered. The Nazi authorities engaged in a large-scale data collection effort to

assess the number of Jews overall, including converts and those of mixed ancestry. This was meant

to remedy the problem that the earlier statistics did “not shed light on the invasion of Jewish blood

into the body of the Volk.” (Statistisches Reichsamt 1944) The culmination of this effort was a
                                                                                                    3


special questionnaire, administered as part of the 1939 census, which required all respondents to file

detailed information on the race of their grandparents. Those with three or more Jewish grandparents

were classified as “Volljuden” (full Jews); those with two Jewish grandparents were “mixed of the

first degree”, and those with only one Jewish grandparent were classified as “mixed of the second

degree” (Burleigh and Wippermann 1991).

           According to the 1939 census, there were 442,000 Jews left in Germany; of these, 74.7%

were fully Jewish, 16% were mixed of first degree, and a little less than 10% were mixed of second

degree. There was substantial heterogeneity at the regional level: in Hesse, only 18% of all marriages

were mixed, whereas in Hamburg, 44%. Since the beginning of the 20th century, intermarriage had

become much more common. Of those who married before 1914, only 21.5% of Jews were in a

mixed marriage; by 1932, this had surged to 65.1%. As soon as the Nazis came to power in 1933,

intermarriage in Germany plummeted. The Nuremberg Laws in 1935 were followed by an even

steeper decline. By 1939, only 20.6% of new marriages involving Jews were mixed, even fewer than

before World War I (see Figure 1). To measure historical anti-Semitism, we use the average vote

shares for anti-Semitic parties from six nation-wide elections between 1890 and 1912, ASVOTE19C. 1

In combination, our historical city-level data comprise 759 observations – all cities with Jewish

inhabitants in 1939 where anti-Semitic parties had put forward candidates in at least one of the six

elections between 1890 and 1912.

           We pair this historical data with the large-scale German social surveys (ALLBUS), using the

two editions that collect data on attitudes towards Jews – 1996 and 2006. In addition to several other

questions (“Do Jews have too much influence in the world?”; “Should Jews have equal rights?”, etc.),

the survey also asks how people feel about the possibility of a Jew marrying into their family. On a

scale from 1 (very disagreeable) to 7 (very agreeable), respondents are asked about their reactions.




1
    This dataset is from Ritter and Niehaus (1980).
                                                                                                                       4


The modal response is neutral (4, given by 49%). Some 16.3% find the idea quite or very

disagreeable (answering 1 or 2); 16.4% claim to be quite or very pleased with it (answering 6 or 7).

There is substantial variation by region, especially when it comes to extreme responses. In Lower

Bavaria, 39% of respondents find the idea of a Jew marrying into their family either quite or very

disagreeable. At the opposite end of the spectrum, in Hamburg, only 5.6% of people feel this way.

Overall, we draw on data from 264 cities with 5,201 individuals with two generations of German

ancestors. 2

                                                    II.      Results

We first analyze raw correlations between modern-day attitudes and historical intermarriage rates,

and then disentangle the underlying drivers.

         Contrary to expectations, German towns and cities where “mixed marriages” were more

common before 1939 show less tolerance towards intermarriage today. This basic pattern holds for

both attitudes towards marrying a Jew (Table 1, columns 1 and 2) and intermarriage with ethnic

minorities in general (columns 3 and 4). This is true if we use offspring with two Jewish

grandparents as an indicator of intermarriage (MixedJew1st) or if we use all offspring with one or two

Jewish grandparents (MixedJew2nd). In the regressions, we control for personal characteristics – age

and education – as well as the wave of the survey. The basic correlation is particularly surprising

because there is ample evidence that anti-Semitic attitudes in Germany are highly persistent, with

medieval patterns of pogroms still having predictive power for behavior 600 years later (Voigtländer

and Voth 2012). What can account for such a puzzling result?

                                                          [Table 1 here]



         2
             Since we analyse the persistence of attitudes at the local level, we exclude first and second generation

immigrants. Keeping these in the sample (yielding a total sample size of 6,643 individuals) does not substantially change

our results.
                                                                                                                       5


           Two factors contribute to intermarriage – the willingness to marry across ethnic lines, and the

possibilities for minority members to find a mate inside their own group. The first channel is affected

by how tolerant the local German population is towards Jews. Where gentiles were more favorable

towards their Jewish neighbors in the past, we expect more intermarriage – and more positive

attitudes today. Where this channel operates, intermarriage reflects tolerance towards minorities. The

second channel may confound this relationship. Smaller towns are typically less tolerant towards

minorities, and they also host smaller Jewish communities. Smaller groups, in turn, have a greater

need to marry outsiders because suitable inside matches are harder to find (Banerjee et al. 2009).

Thus, since smaller Jewish communities were located in less tolerant towns, this channel leads to a

negative association between historical intermarriage and present attitudes. In other words, where

local attitudes were hostile, and the Jewish community was small, intermarriage rates may have been

higher simply because there were not enough feasible matches for individuals of marriable age. 3 If

this second channel dominates, the overall relationship will have the opposite of the expected sign.

This can rationalize the results in Table 1.

           Larger cities were more tolerant than smaller ones in several ways; in particular, they showed

less anti-Semitism at the ballot box.4 At the same time, Jews could choose from a large number of

co-religionists before having to consider gentiles as a possible match; intermarriage was

correspondingly rare (Figure 2). Table 2 shows that out-marriage was particularly common in towns

with small Jewish communities; as the number of Jews increased, intermarriage became increasingly



3
    Even if many inhabitants in a community were anti-Semitic, only one suitable match is required for the formation of a

marriage. There are many dimensions in which marriage partners can be “compensated“ (i.e., by finding a much more

attractive or prosperous match); this implies that some match should be possible if the willingness to compromise is

sufficiently high (Abramitzky, Delavande, and Vasconcelos 2011; Banerjee et al. 2009).
4
    A regression of ASVOTE19C on city size yields a strongly significant negative coefficient: A one percentage point

increase in city size is associated with a 1.6% decrease in ASVOTE19C (relative to a standard deviation of 14.4).
                                                                                                                        6


rare. 5 This pattern is true for both types of mixed marriages – those involving (in NS terminology)

“full Jews” and “half Jews”. At the same time, all regressions suggest that larger cities are more

tolerant towards intermarriage (after controlling for the size of Jewish communities). In addition, we

find a consistent negative effect of deeply rooted anti-Semitism on intermarriage rates. We use two

direct indicators – the electoral success of anti-Jewish parties, 1890-1912, and medieval pogroms for

those locations with a Jewish settlement in the Middle Ages. 6

                                             [Figure 2 here; Table 2 about here]

           In Table 3, we summarize the characteristics of localities by tercile of the share of “mixed

Jews” in 1939. The higher the proportion of intermarriages, the smaller the town/city and its Jewish

community; the lower the vote share for anti-Semitic parties; and the lower the educational level of

the population today. 7 These empirical regularities suggest that the basic relationship between mixed

marriages in the past and attitudes towards intermarriage in Table 1 is not well-specified. Only one

of the two determinants of intermarriage – attitudes amongst gentiles towards Jews – will reflect the

hypothesized persistence of tolerant attitudes.

                                                         [Table 3 here]




5
    The results reported in Table 2 are conditional on city size. When dropping city population from the regressions, the

negative relationship with Jewish community size becomes even stronger. In addition, results are very similar when we

use the size of Jewish communities in 1925 instead of 1939, i.e., before emigration had diminished the Jewish population

in German cities (deportations began on a large scale only after 1939).
6
    When using data on pogroms in 1349, we restrict the sample to cities with documented medieval Jewish settlements.

The data are from Voigtländer and Voth (2012).
7
    Note that ASVOTE19C does not decline continuously with each tercile of intermarriage. This is because the size of

Jewish communities is a confounding factor: Intermarriage was higher in cities with less anti-Semitism and with smaller

Jewish communities. However, ASVOTE19C was c.p. higher in smaller cities, with fewer Jews. Once we account for these

opposing effects by including city size, Jewish community size, and ASVOTE19C, the results are unambiguous (Table 2).
                                                                                                                               7


           In Table 4, we examine this question empirically. Here, we use a two-stage-least-squares

approach, predicting the share of mixed offspring in the Jewish population with voting results for the

anti-Semitic parties in Germany, 1890-1912. In columns 1 and 2, in the first stage, votes for anti-

Jewish parties are a (negative) predictor of intermarriage. The second stage demonstrates that more

intermarriage before 1940, driven by less historical anti-Semitism, is associated with more tolerant

attitudes towards marriages with Jews today.. At the same time, we control for Jewish community

size, which is strongly positively associated with favorable attitudes towards intermarriage today.

This captures the fact that larger cities tend to be more tolerant towards minorities, and also hosted

larger Jewish communities before World War II. 8 To gauge magnitudes, we define a variable that

can be more readily interpreted: A ‘tolerance dummy’ indicating whether respondents had “quite

favorable” or “very favorable” individual attitudes towards intermarriage with Jews. We then run the

2-stage specification from Table 4 (columns 1 and 2), using a Probit model for the second stage. The

estimates indicate large effects: A one standard deviation increase of intermarriage via the tolerance

channel predicts a rise in the share of Germans tolerant towards intermarriage with Jews from 15.7%

to 25.2%. 9

           In columns 3 and 4, we show that the second part of the variation in early 20th century

intermarriage behavior – driven by the need to marry outside one’s own group – is strongly

associated with more negative views of intermarriage today. 10 In other words, where Jewish


8
    We obtain very similar results when controlling for both present city population and the size of Jewish communities.

Results are also very similar for ordered probit or logit regressions in the second stage, and when including dummies for

German states (Bundesland). These results are available upon request from the authors.
9
    Another way to calculate the effect is to look at a one standard deviation reduction in votes for anti-Semitic parties (i.e.,

a reduced form of our 2-stage estimates). This predicts a rise in the share of tolerant Germans from 15.7 to 17.5%.
10
     We control for ASVOTE19C in order to isolate the community size effect on intermarriage from the direct effect of

historical anti-Semitism. The negative coefficient on ASVOTE19C in columns 3 and 4 suggests that historical anti-

Semitism persisted at the local level.
                                                                                                       8


communities were small and out-marriage was more of a need than a choice, its information value

for attitudes amongst gentiles is low. Instead, more intermarriage due to smaller Jewish communities

reflects less tolerant attitudes in smaller cities. As it happens, in Germany before 1939, locations with

small Jewish communities – mostly rural towns – were more anti-Semitic. Today, these attitudes

remain in the smaller towns, giving rise to a paradoxical relationship in the aggregate (Table 1).

                                                 [Table 4 here]

                                          III.    Conclusion

When does frequent intermarriage indicate tolerance towards a minority? We examine the case of

marriages between Jews and gentiles in early 20th century Germany. Places where historical attitudes

towards Jews were more negative – as reflected in higher vote shares for anti-Semitic parties in the

late 19th and early 20th century – recorded fewer “mixed marriages”. At the same time, locations

hostile to Jews also had much smaller Jewish communities. For Jews approaching marriage age in

these locations, there were few potential mates from within the community available; out-marriage

rates were correspondingly higher. We document these patterns using official German statistics on

“half Jews”, “quarter Jews”, etc. compiled by the Nazi authorities after 1933.

        Remarkably, attitudes towards intermarriage are stable over more than half a century – in

towns and cities where intermarriage rates between Jews and gentiles were high before 1939 because

of positive attitudes amongst the German population, respondents today are much more comfortable

with the idea of having a Jewish family member. In contrast, in places where out-marriage rates for

Jews were high because the Jewish community was small, attitudes today are also sharply more

critical – not least because the local population was often more hostile, reducing the number of Jews

in a location.

        The answer to our question – when does intermarriage reflect tolerance – is straightforward:

Only the part of the variation driven by attitudes directly is valuable in explaining cultural

preferences. The share of the variation reflecting the “tightness” of the marriage market can
                                                                                                 9


confound the result; in extreme cases – such as Germany before 1939 – it may even induce an

inverse correlation.
