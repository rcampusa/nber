              THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIET, PARENT'S FATNESS,
                  AND OBESITY IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS




                                  Abstract


      In this paper empirical evidence is presented on the determinants

of obesity in youth in the U.S., with particular emphasis on isolating

the effects of diet and parent's fatness on the obesity outcome. The

results show that parents fatness has statistically important impacts

on skinfold growth among children and adolescents. Diets between

obese and non—obese youth, however, do not differ substantially. Evi-

dence that youth with "fatter parents" are able to produce more skin—

fold or adipose tissue from given calorie intakes includes the signifi-

cant and relatively large parent's fatness (skinfold) effects in the

youth skinfold equations, the larger calorie coefficients in the skin—

fold equation for lO—16 year old youths with "fat" mothers as compared

to 10-16 year olds with around average mothers, and the significant and

relatively large parent's fatness effects in the youth obesity probabil-

ity equations. The probability models show that if either of the par-

ents of a 10—16 year old is obese, the probability of the 10—16 year

old being obese is .2, holding constant age, race, sex and calorie con—

suiption. If both parents are obese the probability of the 10—16 year

old being obese is .4.   The data set is the Ten State Nutrition Survey,

1968—1970.

1.0 Introduction

      Obesity in youth is a widely recognized health problem. Since obese

children tend to become obese adults, childhood obesity is a link to the

high incidences of diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, heart disease

and gall bladder disease found among obese adults. Obesity in children

and adolescents may also have more immediate impacts, particularly on

mental health because of social rejection and low self-esteem.1

      Previous research has established that obese parents tend to have

obese children and that lean parents tend to have lean children.2 There

is disagreement, however, over the extent to which this clustering re-

sults from environmental influences——in particular, common values toward

diet and exercise-—or from genetic factors. There is substantial evi-

dence in support of both the environmental37 and the genetic explana-

tions81° but few attempts to quantify in some way the separate effects

of each on the obesity outcome in children and adolescents.11

      The purpose of this paper is to present empirical evidence on the

determinants of obesity in children and adolescents in the United States

with particular emphasis on isolating the effects of diet and the effects

of genetic influences that correlate with parent's fatness. The data

set utilized in this research is the Ten State Nutrition Survey,

1968—70.


2.0 The Model

      The effects of diet and parent's fatness on obesity in children and

adolescents are estimated in a multivariate statistical framework that
                                        —2—


can be generalized as

                              0 = 0 (D, F, A, R, s)

                              w = w (D, F, A, R, S)

                              D = D (w, 0, I, E, X, S).


The model relates obesity (0) and weight growth (w) to diet (D), parent's

fatness (F), age (A), race (R), and sex Cs). The choice of diet CD) de-

pends on weight (W), obesity status (0), family income (I), mother's

education (E), family size CX) and sex CS). Obesity, weight growth and

diet are endogenous or mutually determined within the model because

causality is hypothesized to run from diet to weight growth and to the

obesity outcome for obvious reasons and from weight growth and obesity

status to choice of diet because weight is assumed to be highly corre-

lated with children/adolescent demand for calories and nutrients

(appetite) and because with weight held constant an obesity condition

may alter diet choice (dieting). The rationales for the exogenous vari-

ables in the model are straightforward. Children's growth         has   been shown

in   a number of studies to differ by age, race, and sex and choice of diet

for or by youth may be affected by family income, family size, and by

education   of the mother.12
        Triceps skinfold measurements are used as the measure of adipose
tissue or fat stores in this study. Skinfold measurements are generally
considered    more reliable indicators of obesity in children and youth

than weight    for height measures because there is rather large variation
in   adipose tissue among children of the same relative weight.13 Daily

calories    is the   primary diet measure    used in the model for reasons more

fully   explored below.
                                —3—

3.0 The Data and Estimation Techniques

      In the Ten State Nutrition Survey (TSNS) socioeconomic, dietary,

and clinical data were collected from 24,000 families in ten states of

the United States in the 1968-70 period. Selected subgroups, including

children less than 36 months of age and individuals 10—16 years, re-

ceived detailed dietary evaluations. Low income families are over

represented in the TSNS sample.14

     The diet data were collected by the 24 hour recall method. This

technique will generally produce unbiased mean intakes for groups be-

cause the influences of subjects with unusually high and unusually low

24 hour intakes tend to cancel.15 However, in an ordinary least

squares regression context this random measurement error would bias

downward the nutrient intake coefficients in the obesity or weight

growth equations. This problem is alleviated in the estimates presented

below because simultaneous equation estimation methods are required for

the multi-equation model of obesity and diet choice that has been speci-

fied. The technique used in this paper is two stage least squares which

removes bias due to mutual causality by using predicted values of the

right—hand side endogenous variables in the structural equations. A

by—product of this procedure is that random measurement error in endoge—

nous variables, such as in the 24 hour recall diet variables will also

be eliminated by the use of predicted values.

      The empirical results are for children less than 36 months of age

and for children/adolescents 10—16 years of age. These age groupings

include all children and adolescents for which dietary data were ob-

tained in TSNS. They correspond to the two most interesting periods
                                 —4—

of children's growth in terms of potential impact on adult obesity. The

first period is important because young children that acquire an ex-

cessive number of adipose cells may be destined to be obese adults.

Some researchers argue that by the end of the first three years of life

the development of the body's fat cells are complete and their number

difficult or impossible to reduce in later life.'6 The 10 to 16 year

age period is important because rapid growth occurs and the body

contour changes significantly, approaching its eventual adult configu-

ration. Obesity developed during this age period then may also be

carried through adult life.


4.0 Empirical Results

4.1 Summary Statistics

      In Tables 1—2 summary statistics are presented for the diet,

anthropometric, and socioeconomic variables that are relevant to a

model of obesity and diet choice such as specified in Section 2. The

10—16 years age grouping has been stratified into those in the upper

10 percent of the triceps skinfold distribution for their sex, those

in the lower 25 percent, and those in the group between the 25th and

75th percentiles of the sex specific triceps skinfold distributions.

The distributions are sex specific because of the differences in the

levels of subcutaneous fat stores carried by males and females of

similar ages; e.g., the mean triceps skinfold for males and for

females 10—16 years old in TSNS is 11.7 and 15.4. The sample

stratification are designed to enable comparisons between children and

youth that are obese (upper 10 percent), of around average fatness

(25 percent to 75 percent), and lean (lower 25 percent). Similar
                                 —5-.


stratifications following the same logic have been made for children in

the younger age group.

      The most striking result in Tables 1—2 is the similarity of diets

across the subsamples within each age grouping. For 10—16 year olds,

in fact, there is actually a slight inverse relationship between tri-

ceps skinfold measurement and caloric intake. Mean calorie consump-

tion is 2,347 per day in the obese group (upper 10 percent of triceps

skinfold distribution, mean triceps skinfold 28.1 nun) and 2,523 per

day in the lean group (lower 25 percent of triceps skinfold distribu-

tion, mean triceps skinfold 7.2 mm). There is a slight positive re-

lationship between triceps skinfold measurement and caloric intake in

the 0 to 36 month age group but daily calories only increases from

about 1,350 to 1,390 between the lean and the obese groups, while

triceps skinfold increases from 7 to 15 mm.

      These summary statistics imply then that obesity is not asso-

ciated with above average calorie consumption. It could be argued

that the average calorie consumption of obese 10—16 year olds is not

representative of their lifetime diet patterns because dieting may

begin for many in adolescence and when younger these individuals on

average had diets higher in calories than their peers and became

obese as a result. This argument loses force, however, when consider-

ing the results for the younger age groups which should be hardly

affected by dieting and which show near identical diets across the

subsamples. In any case, the regression results in the following

section will enable a more formal examination of the effects of diet

on obesity and will allow the presence of obesity to influence the

choice of diet.
                                  —6—

      The summary statistics in Tables 1—2 do show generally large and

statistically significant differences in parent's fatness between

obese and non—obese children and adolescents. For 10—16 year olds,

for example, mother's triceps skinfold for obese youth is 30.3 nun,

for average youth is 22.5 mm, and for lean youth is 20.1 mm. The same

figures for father's triceps skinfold are 18.2 nun, 13.4 mm, and 11.2 mm.

This association between parent's fatness and children's fatness is

also evident in the younger age group.

     The summary statistics then generally support the view that the

diets of obese and non—obese children and adolescents do not differ

greatly   and, therefore, the obese are "more efficient producers" of
adipose tissue from given levels of nutrient intakes.17 This productive
efficiency may well be irtherited for the parentc of obese children
and adolescents carry significantly more adipose tissue than the par-
ents of the non—obese.


4.2 Regression Results

      In Table 3 regression results are presented for a model of tri-

ceps skinfold growth and choice of calories that follows the general

structure presented in Section 2.18 The results are for the 10—16

year and 0-36 month age groups of TSNS. Calories is the only diet

measure examined at this stage of the research. By using calories as

the diet measure we are emphasizing "quantity" and skirting issues of

"quality" or diet composition. Models estimated with multiple diet

indicators——for example, calories arid protein——make it difficult to

reach conclusions about the impact of diet on triceps skinfold growth

because of multicolinearity.19
                                    —7—

      The first two regressions in Table 3 present results for triceps

skinfold growth for 10—16 year olds. The parent's skinfold measures

are highly significant and rather substantial in "elasticity" terms.

The elasticity of triceps skinfold with respect to mother's tricep

skinfold evaluated at the means using the regression parameter from

equation 1 is .40. The elasticity figures from equation 2 for mother's

tricep skinfold and for father's tricep skinfold are .34 and .22. To

restate these results from equation 2, a youth with each parent having

10 percent larger triceps skinfold than the parent's of another youth,

holding constant calorie consumption, race, age, and sex, would have

a 5 to 6 percent larger skinfold. Note that because calories are held

constant, these parent's fatness effects are not capturing the impact

of a common household diet high in calories that results in similar

skinfold growth within the family; an argument used by some to explain

why fatness clusters in families.

      The calorie coefficients in Table 3 for 10—16 year olds show a

positive association between calories and skinfold growth although

the coefficients are not statistically significant. This positive

association is surprising in light of the summary statistics which

showed the mean calorie intakes of the obese group to be slightly less

than those of the non—obese groups. There is evidence in the calorie

equation in Table 4 that the obese attempt to restrict their calorie

consumption and thus their reported daily calorie intake may under-

state their daily average over the longer term. Theoretically, this

reverse causality could be important and highlights the necessity of

allowing causality to run from obesity to calorie intake as well as

vice versa. It also brings out a potential weakness in the methodology of

sample mean comparisons between the diets of the obese and non—obese such as
                                 —8—

was performed in Section 4.1. To summarize this argument calorie intakes

for a 24 hour period for an obese sample are more likely to understate

longer term daily averages than for the non—obese because a higher

proportion of the obese will be on calorie restricting diets and be-

cause most calorie restricting diets fail or are only temporary devia-

tions from longer term average daily consumption. This could mean that,

longer term, and in conflict with 24 hour recall data, the obese consume

more than the non—obese and the additional calorie consumption results

in their additional skinfold. This argument then does not rely on the

notion that the obese utilize calories more efficiently and offers an

explanation of why the obese have been reported in some studies to eat

about the same amount, or even less than the non—obese.

      Empirically, however, dieting effects do not appear to be particu-

larly strong. The obese dummy variable in the first calorie equation

in Table 4, which takes a value of one for 10—16 year olds in the

upper 10 percent of the sex specific triceps skinfold distributions and

a value of zero otherwise, has a coefficient of about —95. Since weight

is also in the calorie equation, the result indicates that the obese in

their 24 hour recall period consumed 95 calories less than the non—obese

of their same weight. To the extent weight is a proxy for appetite the

difference of 95 would represent the effects of dieting. This effect

is rather weak given average diets of around 2,400 calories and given

the low statistical significance of the dummy coefficient. It is diff 1—

cult to argue, then, that the longer term average daily calorie consump-

tion of the obese is much higher than would be revealed in a 24 hour

recall period and that excessive calorie consumption determines obesity.
                                   —9—

The diets of the obese appear to be very similar to those of the non—

obese.

         Differences in parent's fatness between the obese and non—obese

are large and statistically significant, as previously noted. The

parents of obese children and adolescents have triceps skinfold about

one—third larger than parents of the non—obese. The regression re—

suits indicate that if children and adolescents in the obese category

had parents with the same average fatness as the non—obese, the triceps

skinfold of typical male and female youth in the obese category would

be about 3 mm less, still leaving them with triceps skinfold measure-

ments more than twice as great as for the typical 10—16 year old.

         In the third regression in Table 3, triceps skinfold results are

presented for children 0 to 36 months in TSNS.2° The results indicate

that the elasticities of triceps skinfold with respect to calories and

mother's tricep skinfold evaluated at the means are .7 and .2. The

standard error of the calorie coefficient, however, is relatively large.

Even if the calorie coefficient is assumed accurate and even if the ef-

fect of father's fatness is assumed equal to that estimated for the

mother, the results do not explain much of the differences in tricep

skinfold thickness between obese and non—obese children 0—36 months in

TSNS. In this statistical decomposition there is almost no calorie ef—

feet because of the near identical diets of obese and non—obese children

(see Table 2) and the differences in parent's fatness between the obese

group and the around average group only account for about 10 percent of

the difference in triceps skinfold, assuming equal effects for both

parents.
                                   — 10 —



      An alternative way to consider the extent to which children and

youth with "fatter" parents may be more efficient producers of fat

tissue is to stratify the samples based on parent's fatness. Children

and adolescents with "fatter" parents should have larger calorie co-

efficients in the triceps skinfold equations if they are more eff i—

dent producers of fat. Two stage least squares estimates for 10—16

year olds in TSNS whose mothers are in the top 20 percent of the skin—

fold distribution for all mothers of 10—16 year olds2' and for 10 to

16 year olds whose mothers are between the 25th and 75th percentiles

of this distribution yields calorie coefficients of .0037 and .0026,

respectively.22 The mean triceps skinfold of the youth in the fat

mothers group is 17.4 mm and mean daily calories is 2,416. For the

youth with mothers of around average stature mean triceps skinfold is

13.6 rrn and daily calories is 2,466. The more efficient production

of fat hypothesis can explain a good portion of the triceps differ-

ence of 3.8 mm (17.4—13.6) between the two groups. The difference In

calorie coefficients of .001 implies the youths with "fat mothers" get

2.4 mm more skinfold from the 2,400 calorie diets common to both
          23
groups.

      The first regression of Table 3 can be used to produce a similar

result. Mean triceps skinfold thicknesses for the group of fat

mothers    and for around average mothers are 38 and 23, respectively.
Using the coefficient for mother's triceps skinfold of .24 from the

regression, triceps skinfold for the youth in the "fat mothers" group

should be 3.6 (15 x .24) greater than for the youth with near average

mothers. This approximates the observed difference. In this case at
                                   — 11 —



least   parent's fatness effects are sufficient to explain differences in

skinfold thickness between groups. The same methodology did not have

much success in explaining differences in skinfold thickness between

obese and non—obese youth because the difference in parent's fatness was

much smaller and the difference in skinfold thickness to be explained

was much larger.

                 fatness effects on the obesity outcome can also be in-

vestigated within the context of a probability model. In Table 5

results are presented for an obesity outcome equation for 10—16 year

olds in TSNS where the dependent variable is the obesity dummy previ-

ously defined. Mothers and fathers have been similarly classified

from their sex specific skinfold distributions and the parent's fat-

ness variables are now dummies taking on a value of one for those in

the upper ten percentiles. The parent's fatness coefficients are each

about .2 and highly significant.24 They can be interpreted as prob-

abilities; that is If either of the parents of a 10—16 year old is

obese, the probability of the 10 to 16 year old being obese is .2,

holding constant age, race, sex, and calorie consumption. If both

parents are obese the probability of the 10—16 year old being obese is

.4. To say the same thing, there is a probability of .6 that a 10—16

year old with obese parents will not be obese. For children 0 to 3

years the probability of being obese given an obese mother is also

.2 (see Table 5)25

        Given these results it is not surprising to find that the distri-

bution of obese parents across the obese, around average, and slim sub—

samples of 10—16 year olds of Table 1 is not overwhelmingly skewed
                                — 12 —



toward the obese youth group. Thirty—two percent of obese parents are
in the obese youth category, 42 percent are in the around average youth

category, and 10 percent are in the slim youth category. For children

up to 36 months, 22 percent of obese mothers are in the obese children

category, 44 percent are in the around average children category, and

24 percent are in the slim children category.


5.0 Summary and Conclusions

      To summarize, the statistical results of the preceding section

have indicated that parent's fatness has statistically important im-

pacts on skinfold growth among children and adolescents. Diets be-

tween obese and non—obese youth, however, do not differ substantially.

Evidence that youth with "fatter parents" are able to produce more

skinfold or adipose tissue from given calorie intakes includes the

significant and relatively large parent's fatness (skinfold) effects

in the youth skinfold equations, the larger calorie coefficients in

the skinfold equation for 10—16 year old youths with "fat" mothers

as compared to 10—16 year aids with around average mothers, and the

significant and relatively large parent's fatness effects in the

youth obesity probability equations. Although the statistical results

could explain a large portion of the difference in skinfold growth be-

tween youth with "fat" mothers and youth with around average mothers,

the models were not nearly as successful in explaining differences in

skinfold between obese and non—obese youth. The results show that

calories, parents fatness, age and race differences between obese

and non—obese youth explain less than one—half of the skinfold growth
                                   — 13 —



differential,   with nearly all of this explanatory power coming from

parent's stature effects.26

      The regression results for choice of calories for or by children

and adolescents show no significant family income, mother's education,

or family size effects for children less than three years, while there

is stronger evidence for such effects among 10—16 year olds, although

the implied elasticities are small.27 This same pattern holds when

the demand for nutrients is considered, such as protein. It is inter-

esting that socioeconomic effects on diet may be more important for

older children than for preschool children, despite the presence of

school lunch programs.

      14TSNS is described in detail in health Services and Mental Health

Administration DHEW. Ten State Nutrition, 1968—1970. DHEW (HSM)

72—8130—8134, 1972. The sample design of TSNS was expected to produce

"essentially self weighted estimates" (Health Services and Mental Health

Administration, 1—13) for low income groups based on characteristics of

the population from the 1960 Census. However, because the survey was

carried out in the 1968 to 1970 period and because this research uses

sub—samples from TSNS, standard errors of estimates reported in this

paper, which are not adjusted for sample design, may understate the "true"

standard errors.

      15The fact that obese respondents are more likely to be on diets

than non—obese respondents presents special problems in the interpretation

of 24 hour recall data that are discussed below.

      '6See Hirsh, J. "Can We Modify the Number of Adipose Cells?"

Post—graduate Medicine, 51 (Nay 1972), and Coates and Thoresen, op. cit.,

p. 147.

      '7it is possible that differences in exercise or activity levels

rather than in ability to produce adipose tissue better explain obesity

in children and adolescents, although data from Cycle I of the Health

and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1971—1974 (HANES) do not support this

view. In HANES, two questions were asked of 12 to 16 year olds concern-

ing activity levels. These related to the amount of activity in a usual

day aside from recreation and to the amount of exercise during recreation.
There are virtually no differences in the responses to these questions

across samples stratified on triceps skinfold measurements using the

criteria      of Table 1.

        18The weight equation of the model specified in    Section 2 is
necessary      to complete the system of three endogenous variables but the

results for the weight equation itself are not of vital interest and

are not presented in this paper.

        19The correlation between calories and protein intake is .85 among

10—16 year olds.


        20Regression results are not presented for children 0 to 36 months

with the father's tricep skinfold as a right—hand side variable because

of the large number of missing observations for this variable.

              similar condition on father's stature was not imposed to pre-

serve observations, a shortage. of which would have developed for a jointly

conditioned fat parent's group because skinfold measurements are available

for only one—half as many fathers as mothers.


        22Race,   age,   and sex were held constant as in previous triceps skin—

fold specifications. The first stage instruments included these exogenous

variables and family income, mother's education, and family size.

        23The calorie coefficients are not significantly different from zero

(t   values   about 1.0 for each) nor are they significantly different from

each other. Thus, this analysis stretches the limits of statistical infer-

ence. Furthermore, the same methodology applied to the 0 to 3 years of. age

group yielded a slightly smaller coefficient for the children in the obese

mother's group than for children in the around average mother's group.
      24The equations in Table 5 are estimated by using two stage least

squares. The first stage instruments are age, race, sex, family in-

come, family size, and mother's education; that is the equations can

be considered part of a general model of obesity and diet choice. With

a dummy endogenous variable in the system two stage least squares yields

consistent estimates although they may not be as efficient as estimates

derived from more sophisticated methods. For a complete discussion of

estimation procedures for a dummy endogenous variable in a simultaneous

system, see J. Heckman, "Dummy Endogenous Variables in a Simultaneous

Equation System." Econometrica, July 1978.


      25To preserve observations, father's stature is again allowed to

vary, that is, it is not included in the regression.


      26Race, age, and sex effects on triceps skinfold have not been

discussed to this point. For 10—16 year olds, the race variable in

Table 3 indicates blacks may have slightly less skinfold than whites,

other things the same, while females have 5 mm more skinfold than maleF.

For 0—3 year olds the race effect is evident, but there is no sex ef-

fect. Age effects are not strong for either age group.


      27The elasticities at the means for calories with respect to

family income and mother's education are .004 and .14.
