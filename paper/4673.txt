                                          ABSTRACT

         This paper determines newborn costs and lengths of stay attributable to prenatal exposure
to cocaine and other illicit drugs, using as a data source all parturients who delivered at a large
municipal hospital in New York City between November 18. 1991 and April 11. 1992. We
performed a cross-sectional analysis in which multivariate, loglinear regressions were used to
analyze differences in costs and length of stay between infants exposed and unexposed prenatally
to cocaine and other illicit drugs adjusting for maternal race, age, prenatal care, tobacco, parity,
type of delivery, birth weight; prematurity, and newborn infection. Urine specimens, with linked
obstetric sheets and discharge abstracts provided information on exposure, prenatal behaviors,
costs, length of stay and discharge disposition. Our principal findings show that infants exposed
to cocaine and some other illicit drug stay approximately 7 days longer at a cost of $7,731 more
than infants unexposed. Approximately 60 percent of these costs are indirect, the result of
adverse birth outcomes and newborn infection. Hospital screening as recorded on discharge
abstracts substantially underestimates prevalence at delivery, but overestimates its impact on
costs.

                                                    Introduction

        One of the most disturbing consequences of the surge in cocaine consumption during the latter half of

the 1980's has been its impact on infant health. The clinical literature offers convincing evidence that newborns

exposed prenatally to cocaine are more likely to be born preterm. suffer intrauterine growth retardation and

have lower birth weights than infants born to similar mothers who are unexposed (MacGregor et al. 1987;

McCalla et a!. 1991; Batesnan et al. 1993). - These outcomes are strongly associated with infant death and

childhood morbidity (Institute of Medicine 1985).

        Prenatal exposure to cocaine and other illicit drugs is extensive. In the most comprehensive prevalence

study to date, urines from a population sample of over 29,000 women collected at delivery across California

reveal that 7.79 percent of black women, .55 percent Hispanic, and .60 percent white were positive for cocaine

(Vega et al. 1993). When exposure is expanded to include opiates, marijuana and amphetamines, prevalence at

delivery rises to 14.22, 2.75, and 6.79 percent among blacks, Hispanics and whites respectively. Even these

estimates are conservative since urine toxicological analysis can only detect exposure to certain drugs within 3

days of use (Ostrea et al. 1992). Application of these prevalence rates to national birth figures suggests that

287.800 black, white and Hispanic infants were exposed to illicit drugs in 1991 (National Center for Health

Statistics 1993).

        The economic consequences of prenatal illicit drug use are potentially enormous (Hay 1991). Even if

costs are limited to the additional medical expenditures at delivery attributable directly to exposure, they may be

sizeable given the technological sophistication of interventions available to treat premature and low birth weight

infants. Moreover, unlike users of tobacco and alcohol, taxes cannot be imposed easily on users of illicit drugs

so that much of the cost associated with the use of these substances will be borne by the population of non-

users. The existence of these external medical cosS atuibutable to illicit drug use raises difficult questions as

to how the cost burden will be distributed and what policies might best minimhe it.

         Despite the magnitude of the problem and the policy questions it engenders, there has been relatively

little research that specifically addresses the economic costs associated with prenatal drug use. One problem has

been the lack of reliable data on both exposure and costs with sufficient cases to allow for multivariate analyses.
 Clinical reports have documented increased length of stay and increased use of intensive care nurseries for

exposed as compared to unexposed newborns (Hurt et al. 1989; Noble ci al. 1989), and for infants exposed to

cocaine relative to opiates (Kayc et al. 1989). In the former two studies, however, small sample sizes precluded

any multivariate analysis and in the latter, exposure was based on self-reports. Research suggests that analyses

of birth outcomes based on maternal self-reports yield effects of exposure that are biased downwards (Zukennan

etal. 1989).

           The General Accounting Office (GAO) based on a survey of 10 urban hospitals reported median

charges fix newborn care between $1,100 and $4,100 above those of unexposed infants. As in the study by

Kaye ci al. (1989) that used self-reports, this investigation derived data on exposure from information recorded

on charts. A second difficulty with the data horn this study was that moneta1y differences were based on

charges and not costs.

           In a recent study which overcame many previous deficiencies, the authors examined newborn costs and

length of stay for all singleton births exposed to cocaine at Harlem Hospital between September 1985 and

August 1986 (Phibbs. Bateman, Schwartz 1991). During this period, toxicologic screens of all newborn urines

and maternal self-reported histories were used to ascertain exposure during pregnancy. Adjusting for

characteristics of the mother, authors reported that newborn length of stay and costs attributable to cocaine or its

derivatives (i.e. craclC) ranged from 4 to 10 additional days at a cost of between $2,600 and $8,450 in 1990

dollars.

           Although this study represents a major improvement over previous work, its estimates of both length of

stay as well as costs are problematic for several reason. First, between 1983 tz 1987 New York State hospitals

were reimbursed on a prospective per diem basis. If infants exposed to illicit drugs provided net gains to per

diem revenues, especially towards the end of the stay, then length of stay and thus costs reported under such a

system could be inflated. Second, cost information was based on the Medicare system of DRO's, a

reimbursement mechanism designed primarily for the care of the elderly. As the authors acknowledge, the 7

case groups designed to capture newborn costs have large variances within groups. 'Third, regression estimates

did not take into account the non-negativity and skewness of the data on length of stay and costs. Consequently.


                                                         2
statistical inferences may be misleading.

         In ibis paper, we estimate newborn costs and length of stay associated with prenatal exposure to

cocaine. The objectives are threefold: first, to improve on estimates in the clinical literature with greater

attention to unbiased exposure measures, more accurate cost data, and more appropriate statistical analysis;

second, to explore the mechanisms through which antenatal eaosure to illicit dntgs naay.exert its effects on

newborn length of stay and costs and; third, to compare costs and length of stay for patients in whom exposure

is loiown to medical providers compared to those in whom exposure rnth.c occult.

                                            Empirical Implementation

         To structure the empirical work, we postulate that physicians maximize the sum of 1Â½, the difference

between child health at birth (He,) and child health at discharge (H,). Infant health is improved by increasing

length of stay (U, which represents an aggregation of inputs available to physicians. Length of stay is

constrained by the number of newborn beds at the hospital, which is fixed.       If a newborn's initial health is

good, then the difference between H, and H will be small, and the physician will conserve scare resources (L)

for less healthy newborns, those with a smaller 1%. An important feature of the framework is that physicians,

not parents, are the decision makers. Physician choices regarding length of stay take prenatal behaviors and

birth outcomes as given. Thus, we view newborn costs and length of stay functions as reduced forms.2



         We included all women who delivered at a municipal hospital in New York City between November

 18, 1991 and April 11, 1992 (N=l,323). Specimens obtained for routine urinalysis from parturients were

 collected within 24 hours of admission to the labor and delivery unit. All urine samples were refrigerated and

 transported within 48 hours to the institution's toxicology laboratory. Information routinely collected from

 parturients was recorded on data sheets which were given the same code number as the urine specimens. Data

 included demographic information, history of exposure (cocaine, marijuana, heroin, methadone and tobacco),

 and prenatal care. Data on.birth outcomes, length of stay, expected reimbursement, and discharge disposition

 were, from discharge abstracts.

          To preserve confidentiality of study women we gave each data sheet and urine specimen the same case


                                                          3
number. Neither bad any personal identifiers. We kept a separate file that contained only case numbers and

the mother's medical record numbers. This file was used by personnel in the Medical Records department to

link mother and infant to discharge abstracts. The file was returned to us with only case numbers and relevant

discharge infoxmation. We linked discharge information, data sheets, and urine toxicology results by case

number.

          We were unable to obtain medical record numbers for 34 infants. Two of the 34 infants were unlikely

to have survived given birth weights of 400 and $20 grams. Excluding these 2 newborns, the mean

characteristics of the other 32 mothers and infants based on the survey data were not statistically significant

along a host of characteristics (available upon request). An additional 8 other infants died in the hospital and 2

others were transferred. Elimination of these 44 records, reduced the sample to 1,279 mothers whose infants

survived the initial stay.

          We analyzed three outcomes: I) the number of days the infant stayed in the hospital following delivery

that was certified to be medically necessary; 2) cost per discharge; 3) the service intensity weight associated

with each case. Cost per case is based on the New York Prospective Hospital Reimbursement Methodology

(NYPHRM l\O. Under NYPHRM IV, each discharge is assigned to a diagnostic related group (DRO); there

are 31 DRG's for newborns. The service intensity weighi for each DRG is multiplied by the case payment

rate, a weighted avenge of the hospital-specific costs (45 percent) and peer group costs (55 percent). The case

payment rate for municipal hospitals includes the cost of capital, physician services, medical education and

indigent case.    As an alternative expression of relative resource use, we present regressions with service

intensity weights (SIW) as the dependent variable. Service intensity weights reflect relative costs among the

600 ORG's in the New York State system. Thus, a case assigned an 51W of i costs half as muck, on average,

as a case with a 51W of 1.0. The SIW's are based on a one-third sampling of all discharges in the State, the

most recent being 1989 (New York State Department of Health 1991). Loosely, we view cost per discharge as

hospital-specific because it incorporates capital costs, physician services and indigent care at this particular

facility; SEWs, by contrast, reflect the average experience of all hospitals and include only costs comparable

across institutions.

sample 51 infants had stays that exceeded the number of days that were medically necessary. The avenge

number of days in excess of the medically necessary stay was 1.6.

         Of the l2l9womenlinfantpaixsintbefinalsample, 143 or ll.2pexcentwereexposed to.oneormore

drugs. We categorized exposure as follows: 1) cocaine exclusively (N 34); 2) drugs other than cocaine â

marijuana, heroin, or methadone (N=58); and 3) cocaine and some other drug (N=51). To facilitate

discussion we use the following acronyms: EC for exclusively cocaine, DOC for drugs other than cocaine, and

CPOD for cocaine pins other drugs. The three drug categories were further classified by how exposure was

determined. If exposure was ascertained by anonymous survey, and was not recorded on discharge abstracts,

we refer to these cases as exposures unloown to physicians (N 101; 71%of total exposures). Because

exposures reported on discharge abstracts were based on information in a mother's or infant's chart, we

consider these cases as exposures known to physicians (N =42 or 29% of total exposures).

         Other covariates include mothers age, race, tobacco use during pregnancy (yes or no), prenatal care,

parity and cesarean delivery. Mother's race was categorized as follows: African American, non-American

black, Hispanic, white and Asian. Eighty-five percent of the women included in the study were black. We

dichotomized race between African American (30 percent) and all others since preliinary analysis revealed this

to be the only statistically important distinction. Prenatal care was also dichotomized between women who had

at least 4 visits and women who had less thanvisits

As with maternal race, more refined categorizations offered no additional insights. Finally, we used three

measures of infant health at delivery: birth weight measured in grams, a dichotomous indicator of prematurity,

and a dichotomous indicator of newborn infection. The latter two indicators were based on International

Classification of Disease, Ninth Edition (10-9) codes on the infant or mother's discharge abstract. A

 complete listing of which ICD-9 codes were used for each measure is available upon request.

revealed obvious skewness. Given these characteristics, we use the natural lojarithm of each as the dependent

variable and White's estimator as a correction for heteroscedasticity.'     -


         We estimate two specifications for each outcome. The first includes our three measures of inftnt health

at delivery. The coefficients on illicit drug use in this specification capture what we term the direct effects of

exposure on newborn costs and length of stay. The second.speciflcation excludes measures of newborn health.

The restriction allows us to estimate the total effect of cocaine exposure on newborn costs and length of stay,

since it captures the indirect effects of exposure on birth outcomes and maternal transmission of infection.

                                                      Results

         Table 1 presents summary statistics stratified by drug use. We call attention to the obvious gradient

moving from left to right across this table. CPOD users are more likely than EC users, who in turn are more

likely than DCC users, to be African American, to have less than 4 prenatal care visits, to have smoked during

pregnancy, to have lower mean birth weights, higher rates of low birth weight, very low birth weight, and

newborn infection. Similar gradients hold for newborn length of stay, costs and service intensity weights.

Finally, the second to last row in Table I shows that discharge abstracts are more likely to record indications of

CPOD use than EC or DOC use.

Results from anonymous screen

         The regression results in Table 2 are consistent with the initial findings reported in Table I. Newborns

exposed to CPOD have longer stays, at substantially higher cost than infants unexposed to any drugs.         Based

on the specifications which exclude measures of newborn health, CPCD exposure is associated with a 131

percent increase in length of stay (column 1), a 282 percent increase in hospital specific costs (column 3) and a

300 percent increase in relative costs (column 5). By contrast, EC use is associated with a 21 percent

increase in length of stay (column 1) and a 45 percent increase in costs (column 3). Both effects are marginally

significant. The use of DCC has little impact on costs and length of stay.

         Another noteworthy finding is that only CPOD use is robust to the inclusion of newborn health at

delivery [columns (2), (4), (6)). This signifies strong direct cost effects of CPOD exposure since its

coefficients fall by at most 42 percent when birth weight, prematurity and infant infection are added to the


                                                          6
specifications. By comparison, the coefficients on prenatal care and multiple births, covariates with strong

indirect effects, fall to zero with the inclusion of newborn health tcolumns (2), (4), (6)]. Even when we add

additional indicators of newborn health, such as fetal distress, respiratory distress, and thug WiIIIdraWAJ,

coefficients on CPOD use remain essentially unchanged (results not shown). From a statistical perspective the

robustness of the coefficients on CPOD is impressive because measures of infant health increases the adjusted

K-squared dramatically, from between .10 and .22 to upwards of .61

         To transform the loglinear regression coefficients into length of stay and cost effects expressed in days

and dollars, wesuznmaiize inTables3 and4 the total and direct effects of illicitdrug exposure by type of drug.

In each table we show predicted length of stay and newborn costs for infants exposed and unexposed to each of

the three drug categories.   Estimates are evaluated for infants born to sample women whose characteristics put

them at high risk for an adverse birth outcome.' Differences in outcomes between exposed and unexposed

infants shown in column 3 reveal marginal effects of illicit drug use.

         Tables 3 and 4 underscore the strong association between CPOD use and newborn costs and length of

stay. Total effects of exposure shown in Table 3 indicate that infants exposed to CPOD stay in the hospital, on

average, 6.6 days more at a cost of $7,731. The marginal costs of EC exposure are notably less ($1,223). and

the comparatively small impactDOC use is statistically unrneaningful. Direct effects of exposure are

substantially less (Table 4). Holding newborn health at delivery constant, infants exposed to CPOD stay 2.4

days longer at an incremental costs of $3,114. Thus approximately 60 percent of total newborn costs

associated the CPOD exposure are the consequence of adverse birth outcomes and newborn infection.

Comriarison with discharne abstracts

         To deteimine whether the association between newborn costs and length of stay is greater when

exposure is known to clinicians than when it is unknown, we re-estimated the regressions in Table 2 with

separate indicators for biown and unknown drug use.         Recall that if exposure were recorded on discharge

abstracts we considered it hiown to clinicians. If exposure was not indicated on the discharge abstract, but was

captured by anonymous screen, we regarded it as unknown to clinicians.         The results appear in Table 5. To

simplify the exposition, we only show coefficients on drug use.


                                                           .7
         For infants exposed to BC at the time of delivery, differences in costs and length of stay between

known and unknown exposure are dramatic. Infants whose exposure to BC is known to clinicians have stays

almost 100 percent greater and newborn costs at least 180 percent greater than unexposed infants.     By

contrast, we find no association between unknown exposure to EC and newborn costs and length of stay. A

chi-squared test rejects the null of no difference between known and unknown EC exposure in 4 of 6

specifications. We obtained the same result for infants exposed toDOC. Known exposure is associated with

large and highly significant increases in costs and length of stay; unknown exposure is not. By contrast, there

are no meaningful diffarences in the costs between known and unknown exposures to CPOD.

         The results in Table 5 suggest that selective screening of women or infants for exposure to cocaine and

other drugs as recorded on discharge abstract would bias upwards, except in the case of CPOD use, the

estimated costs associated with exposure. To make this point more formally, we reran the regressions in

Table 2 substituting known exposure for actual exposure. Thus, infants classified as unexposed in these

regressions included a subset of newborns who were positive for an illicit substance at delivery as determined by

the anonymous screen, but not recorded on discharge abstracts (see Table A-I in the Appendix).

         We used the coefficients from these regressions to predict total costs and length of stay for newborns.

We used the same maternal characteristics as in Table 3 and 4 to evaluated the estimates.' Results are

presented in Tables 6 and 7. As noted on discharge abstracts, infants exposed to BC stay, on avenge. 4.6 days

longer at marginal cost of $4,830. If cost and stays are taken front specifications which include measures of

newborn health, marginal costs fall to $1,122 (Fable 7). These results are in sharp contrast to comparative

estimates reported in Tables 3 and 4. The marginal costs associated with known DOC exposure differ even

more dramatically than those reported in Tables 3 and 4. Infants exposed to DOC as recorded on discharge

absbacts have marginal costs of $6,165 with additional stays of 3 days (Fable .     When we control for

newborn health, marginal costs fall, but are still substantial (Fable 7). Differences between predicted costs and

length of stay for CPOD users are higher than those reported in Tables 3 an 4, but the differences are not

statistically significant.




                                                        8
National costs of exnosure

        We conclude this section with projections of the marginal newborn costs of exposure at the national

level for blacks, whites and Hispanics. This exercise is speculative because our cost estimates are from a single

institution. Thus, we use estimates of the total and direct costs of exposure in order to bracket our

calculations. We believe the direct costs are conservative because they minimize the indirect costs of exposure

associated with adverse birth outcomes. Births are from 1991 (National Center for Health Statistics 1993).

Prevalence estimates for cocaine and opiates are from California (Vega a a!. 1993). We assume that 60 percent

of all cocaine users are CPOD based on the distribution in our sample (51/85).

        We estimate that EC and CPOD exposure have added 360 million dollars to newborn costs in 1992

dollars. We assume the marginal cost of DOC is zero based on the results in Table 3. If we use only the direct

costs of exposure (Table 4), marginal costs fall to 132 million dollars. We recomputed the estimates using costs

per exposure as recorded on discharge abstracts. Based on total costs (Table 6), we find exposure adds 929

million dollars to newborn costs nationally. If we limit projections to only direct costs, we find that exposure

is associated with an increase of 387 million dollars nationally.

                                                     Discussion

         We have found that newborns prenatally exposed to cocaine plus other drugs (CPOD) are three times

more cosdy to care for after delivery than infntc unexposed at a large municipal hospital in New York City.

Exposure to exclusively cocaine (EC) is associated with a 44 percent increase in costs whereas exposure to

drugs other than cocaine (DOC) has no meaningful association with newborn costs.

         The findings axe in general agreement with Phibbs, Bateman and Schwartz (1991) who also found that

women exposed to cocaine plus other drugs bad the greatest increase in costs and length of slay. The magnitude

of increases reported by Phibbs, Bateman and Schwartz (1991) axe substantially greater than ours. They

report, for instance, incremental stays of 10 days for infrnts exposed to cocaine and other drugs, an effect 50

percent greater than the 6.6 days we report. If we adjust their costs for inflation and add 20 percent for

physician services, the marginal costs.of exposure to cocaine â other drugs reported in their study rise to

$11,864, a sum also 50 percent greater than ours. The difference may be attributable, in part, to the New


                                                          9
York State prospective per case reimbursement system which provides powerkl incentives to minimize length of

stay. As noted above, this system did not become effective until 1988, two years after the study by Pbibbs,

Sateman and Schwartz (1991) was conducted.

         In addition to improved cost estimates we have also elucidated some of the mechanisms through which

antenatal exposures to illicit drugs exert their effects. We foind we could account for all of the length Of stay

and cost effects of EC and DOC exposure b! including gestational age, birth weight and congenital infection in

the analysis as independent predictors. Only CPOD showed substantial direct effects independent of these birth

outcome variables though the length of stay and cost effects of CPOD decreased by over 40% when the birth

outcome factors were included.

         There are important policy implications to these findings. Programs designed to ameliorate

prematurity, tow birth weight and congenital infection may be predicted to demonstrate substantial cost savings

among individuals with prenatal illicit drug exposures whether or not treaent is directed specifically at

eliminating the underlying exposure. Evidence of this effect has been demonstrated with respect to the

association of prenatal care on birth weight among cocaine exposed individuals (Racine, Joyce, and Anderson

1993).

         Another noteworthy finding is that where exposure to EC or DOC was recorded on discharge abstracts,

the affected neonates were found to stay longer and were more costly to care for than where exposure was

ascertained only by anonymous screen. These were the same exposures for which we were unable to

demonstrate significant direct effects on costs and length of stay after including prematurity, birth weight and

congenital infection in the analysis. By contrast, we found no significant differences in outcomes between

CPOD users identified on discharge abstracts and those found on the anonymous screen and at the same time

were able to demonstrate strong direct effects for these exposures.

         If we consider identification on discharge summaries as similar to sell-reporting of illicit substance use.

these findings are consistent with a study which used meconium analysis to screen for exposure. Ostrea et al.

(1992) demonstrated that infants whose meconium was positive for illicit substances and whose mothers admitted

use had more adverse clinical outcomes than infantE whose meconium was positive but whose mothers denied


                                                         10
use.

        Two competing explanations may be invoked to account for these findings. On the one hand it could

be argued that physicians, once aware of a patient's exposure status, behave more conservatively. They may

order more tests. consider more intensive treatments for medical conditions, observe newborns for longer

periods and, in general, strive to avoid undertreatment of such individuals whether or not their condition

clinically warrants this most resource-intensive approach. On the other hand, it may be that certain readily

observed conditions associated with more severely affected individuals provoke medical personnel to sehrch

more intensively for evidence of exposure. A typical example would be a woman who was unregistered for

prenatal care or who screened positive for a sexually uansmitted disease.

         Our data, we believe, support the latter contention. We found that infants whose exposure to EC was

recorded on discharge abstracts (what we have referred to as known exposure) had smaller mean birth weights,

greater rates of low birth weight and their mothers received less prenatal care than infants whose exposure was

unknown. Among DOC users, differences in smoking were significant while differences in mean birth weights

and rates of low birth weight were sizable, but statistically insignificant.'

         The fact that we could not demonstrate equivalern differences in costs and length of stay for CPOD

users identified by medical providers compared to those identified on the anonymous screen is also consistent

with this explanation given the large direct effects we found. While it appears that a greater proportion of

CPOD users were more severely affected and thus more readily identified than EC or DOC users (see Table 1),

a significant portion of the effect of CPOD exposure was found to be independent of the conditions that might

ordinarily motivate a provider to screen for exposure. Under these circumstances providers who depend upon

 factors such as birth weight receipt of prenatal care, gescational age. etc. to detemiine who they should -screen

 are unable to predict who is likely to be exposed. The result is that the unscreened CPOD users have clinical

 outcomes similar to screened CPOD users.

         The epidemic of antenatal exposure to illicit substances is a serious threat to the health of pregnant

 women and their newborn offspring. The paradoxical results of our investigation, however, indicate that while

 the extent of the epidemic is, as others have found, far greater that what has been estimated on the basis of


                                                            11
clinical reports from discharge summaries alone, the clinical andcost Impact of exposure is significantly smallÃ r

than what estimates from these sources would indicate.

         Finally, it is somewhat reassuring that for exposure to cocaine alone or drugs other than cocaine, at

least in the setting of an urban hospital with ongoing experience of the epidemic, those women most severely

affected appear to be identified with little difficulty. The same sanguine appraisal cannot be substantiated for

women who ise cocaine together with other drugs. The offspring of these women not only appear to have

worse clinical outcomes with larger consequent neonatal costs, but the ability of the medical system to identify

them prospectively is limited.

1. External costs are   those   imposed on nonuseis See Hay (1991) and Manning Ct al. (1989).


2. The separation of physicians and parents is more problematic among private service patients who have an

   ongoing relationship with a particular obstetrician. In this case, prenatal behaviors are endogenous. In

   anticipation of an adverse outcome, the physician as perfect agent recommends interventions prior to birth (e.g.,

   a smoking cessation program) in order to conserve resources postnatally. At municipal hospitals in New York

   City, the majority of births are public service deliveries and in our sample, 50 percent of all exposed women

   had 3 or less prenatal visits, which suggests a minim1 level of patient/physician interaction.


3. We use a Lagrange Multiplier test for heteroscedasticity (Breusch and Pagan 1980). In all 6 specifications we

   rejected the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity decisively.


4. The percent changes are equal to l00*(eMl) where $ is the coefficient on illicit drug use.


5. The specific characteristics are in the footnotes to Tables 3 and 4. Marginal effects were relatively insensitive

   to variations in the characteristics of the mother.
