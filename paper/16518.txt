                                              ABSTRACT

The increase in obesity over the past thirty years has led researchers to investigate the role of social
networks as a contributing factor. However, several challenges make it difficult to demonstrate a causal
link between friends’ physical fitness and own fitness using observational data. To overcome these
problems, we exploit data from a unique setting in which individuals are randomly assigned to peer
groups. We find statistically significant peer effects that are 40 to 70 percent as large as the own effect
of prior fitness scores on current fitness outcomes. Evidence suggests that the effects are caused primarily
by friends who were the least fit, thus supporting the provocative notion that poor physical fitness
spreads on a person-to-person basis.

        One of the most striking health trends in recent years has been the decline in the

physical fitness of the U.S. population.              Nearly two-thirds of adults are currently

overweight, while more than 30 percent are obese (Hedley, et al., 2004). In response,

researchers have proposed several explanations. While some point to societal factors that

have shifted people toward increased food consumption or decreased exercise (Hill &

Peters 1998; Cutler, Glaeser, & Shapiro, 2003) a provocative recent explanation is that

the effects of social and environmental factors may be amplified by the person-to-person

spread of obesity (Christakis & Fowler, 2007). This explanation has profound

implications, as it suggests that social networks can multiply the effects of otherwise

smaller changes in the determinants of obesity. Conversely, if social networks are an

important determinant of health, policies that increase individual health could

conceivably combat the obesity epidemic through the social multiplier effect.

        However, credibly estimating the causal effect of social networks on individual

health outcomes has been difficult.           There are three main empirical challenges to

overcome: self-selection, common environmental factors, and reflection.1 Self-selection

implies that people tend to associate with those similar to them. For example, two

individuals who prefer a sedentary lifestyle may both socialize together and gain weight

over time, making it impossible to distinguish the effect of the (common) lifestyle from

that of the friend. In addition, people within a social network may be subject to common

environmental factors, which confound the social network effects. For example, family

members may both spend a lot of time together and share genetic predispositions toward

weight gain, making it difficult to distinguish the effect of one factor from the other.

1
  The medical literature often refers to self-selection as "homophily" (love of the same). Common
environmental factors are often referred to as "correlated effects" or "common shocks" (Manski, 1993).



                                                  1
Similarly, people within a neighborhood may share the same proximity to fast food

restaurants and city parks. Finally, it is empirically difficult to overcome what social

science researchers have referred to as the reflection problem (Manski, 1993). That is,

between two friends, each friend affects the other simultaneously.

        While understanding whether social network effects exist is an important question

for public health policy, overcoming these identification problems using observational

data is challenging.2 In this study, we address these identification challenges by utilizing

data from the US Air Force Academy in which 3,487 college students were randomly

assigned to (residential) social networks from 2001 to 2005 to examine the role of such

networks in shaping physical fitness outcomes. While this population is unique in that

the students are both younger and considerably more physically fit than the general

population, these data offer us two extraordinary advantages with respect to estimating

fitness peer effects. First, because students were randomly assigned to peer groups with

whom they are required to spend the majority of their time interacting, we can estimate

peer effects free of bias caused by self-selection into the group.3,4 In addition, our data



2
  As such, the causality of estimates in the recent social network health literature has been drawn into
question. These concerns have perhaps been best illustrated in Cohen-Cole and Fletcher's (2008a and
2008b) critiques of Christakis and Fowler (2007), who use data from the Framingham Heart Survey to
show that obesity, smoking, and happiness appear to spread through social ties. Cohen-Cole and Fletcher
report that the same methodology also yields social network effects in implausible outcomes such as height
and headaches, and that controlling for confounders reduces the estimates on BMI. Christakis and Fowler
(2008) respond by questioning whether effects on height and headaches are implausible when the outcomes
are self-reported, and report evidence that health peer effects estimates are robust across several
specifications. While we leave the reader to judge the merits of these critiques and their responses, we do
argue that the debate highlights the general difficulty with making causal inferences using observational
data.
3
  The only other study we know of that uses a randomized treatment design to study the impact of peer
effects on fitness or obesity is Yakusheva, Kapinos, and Weiss (2010), who examine whether a randomly
assigned roommate’s initial weight affects weight gain during the freshman year of college. They report no
effect for men, and find that women assigned to heavier roommates lose weight. However, the lack of
evidence of positive peer effects among roommates is roughly consistent with the findings of Carrell,
Fullerton, and West (2009), who report only moderate evidence of peer effects in education among


                                                    2
contain an individual level pre-treatment measure of fitness, which enables us to estimate

peer effects free of biases due to common environmental factors and reflection.

         We evaluate whether being assigned to peers who were less fit during high school

affects college fitness scores as well as the probability of failing the academy’s fitness

requirements. We also examine whether the effects we find are caused primarily by

exposure to the least or most fit friends in one’s own social network. Results indicate

that poor fitness does spread on a person-to-person basis, with the largest effects caused

by friends who were the least physically fit.



Data

         The data utilized in our study consist of 13,016 observations on 3,487 freshmen

and sophomore students from 2001 to 2005 at the United States Air Force Academy

(USAFA).5        These data are utilized because of one extraordinary feature of the

environment there: while most individuals have a significant amount of choice over the

group of people with whom they associate, USAFA students are randomly assigned to

squadrons of approximately 30 students with whom they are required to spend the

majority of their time.          Prior to the start of the freshman and sophomore years,

administrators implement a stratified random assignment process in which females are



roommates, though they estimate much larger peer effects when the peer group is defined as the group with
which the students spend the majority of their time (i.e., squadron).
4
  A number of recent studies have used randomization at the college roommate and/or college peer group
level to identify peer effects in academic achievement. See Sacerdote (2001), Zimmerman (2003),
Stinebrickner & Stinebrickner (2005), Foster (2006), Lyle (2007), and Carrell, Fullerton & West (2009) for
examples. While most of these papers focus on whether peer academic ability affects achievement, Kremer
& Levy (2008) examine the effect of roommate drinking on college GPA.
5
 In total there are three cohorts of students from the graduating classes of 2005-2007, with two years of
semester-by-student level outcome data.


                                                     3
first randomly assigned, followed by male ethnic and racial minorities, then nonminority

recruited athletes, then students who attended a military preparatory school, and then all

remaining students. Thus, while by design there is relatively little intergroup variation in

attributes such as race or gender, the assignment of other attributes such as peer fitness is

effectively random. This critical feature of our data set enables us to overcome bias due

to self-selection.

         Statistical resampling tests provide evidence that the algorithm that assigns

students to peer groups is consistent with random assignment (Lehmann & Romano,

2005). To implement the test, for each peer group we randomly drew 10,000 groups of

equal size from the relevant cohort of students without replacement. We then computed

empirical p-values for each group, representing the proportion of the simulated peer

groups with higher average pre-treatment fitness scores than that of the observed group.

Under random assignment, any unique p-value is equally likely to be observed; hence the

expected distribution of the empirical p-values is uniform. We tested the uniformity of

the distributions of empirical p-values in each year using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov one-

sample equality of distribution test. We failed to reject the null hypothesis of random

placement for both the freshman and sophomore peer group assignments, with p-values

of 0.934 and 0.578, respectively.6

         Students are required to spend the majority of their time interacting with peers in

their assigned group: they live in adjacent dorm rooms, dine together on meals served



6
  We also regressed own peer high school fitness on peer pre-treatment characteristics such as peer high
school fitness score, peer SAT verbal and math scores, peer academic composite score, and peer leadership
score. None of the coefficients are statistically significant at the 10% level, and the p-value from the F-test
of joint significance is 0.652. For further evidence of the randomization of peer groups at the USAFA, see
Carrell, Fullerton, and West (2009).



                                                      4
family-style, compete in intramural sports together, and study together. During the

freshman year, students have limited ability to interact with students outside of their

social network.7 However, across peer groups, nearly all other aspects of life and work at

USAFA are similar. Specifically, during both the freshmen and sophomore years, all

students primarily take the same courses in which they are randomly assigned to

professors, are served the same meals in the cafeteria, live on the same campus in the

same dorm buildings, and are subject to the same physical conditioning requirements.

Importantly, students do not take academic or physical fitness courses8 together with

peers from their squadron, but rather are randomly assigned to professors and instructors

along with the other students from their entire cohort. Consequently, there is little scope

for environmental confounders to bias estimates of social network effects.

        A second advantage of this study relates to the outcomes examined. While most

existing studies examining physical fitness/obesity use weight-to-height comparisons

such as body mass index (BMI), there is consensus that such measures do not adequately

measure whether an individual is actually physically fit and healthy (Smalley, et al.,

1990; Gallagher, et al., 1996; Burkhauser & Cawley, 2008).9 In contrast, our dataset



7
  In their sophomore year, students have more opportunity to interact with students from other groups,
though students within groups still live in adjacent dorm rooms, dine together, compete in intramural sports
together and in general interact together frequently. We note, however, that interaction with students
outside the group would likely bias our estimates toward zero by introducing measurement error in the peer
variable (Carrell, Fullerton, and West, 2009).
8
  All students at USAFA are required to take mandatory physical education courses, which are non-
academic in nature. For instance, all freshman students are required to take swimming and boxing (males)
or unarmed combat (females). Scores in these courses are based on the student's athletic performance in
the course such as a timed swimming test and two three-round boxing matches.
9
  In response to those same concerns, in 2005, the US Air Force came to its own conclusion that its' weight
management program based on BMI was flawed and instead began using an annual fitness exam that
included a timed 1.5 mile run, sit-ups, push-ups, and pull-ups.



                                                     5
from the USAFA provides for two, arguably superior, health outcome measures:10 the

overall physical education score achieved during the semester and whether or not the

individual failed the physical fitness requirements.

         The physical education average (PEA) score is measured on a 0.0 - 4.0 scale,

where the average score is 2.61. It consists of a weighted average of scores on the

following tests: 1) a 1.5 mile timed run called the aerobic fitness test (15%), 2) a physical

fitness test consisting of pull-ups, push-ups, sit-ups, standing long-jump and a 600 yard

sprint (50%), and 3) grades in mandatory physical education courses (35%).11 Grades in

the physical fitness courses are based primarily on performance, rather than knowledge or

effort. For example, grades in the boxing class are based on one’s performance against

classmates during three-round fights and grades in swimming are based on distance

swimming times and proficiency performing various swimming strokes.

         Failing the fitness requirement occurs when an individual receives a PEA score

lower than 2.0, or when he or she fails to meet certain specified minimum standards on

any of the subcomponents of the PEA score. As shown in Table 1, on average, roughly

nine percent of the students fail to meet these requirements and were thus put on athletic

probation by the USAFA.12



10
  Unfortunately, BMI data are not available for the students in our sample, so we are unable to assess
whether peer effects on BMI are different from peer effects on fitness.

11
  Approximately 13% of our observations having missing data for the PEA variable (1,695 of 13,016). The
PEA variable is not available for students who are unable to complete all components of the score. To test
whether these missing observations could bias our estimates, we regressed an indicator for missing PEA on
peer pre-treatment characteristics such as peer high school fitness score, peer SAT verbal and math scores,
peer academic composite score, and peer leadership score. None of the coefficients are statistically
significant at the 10% level, and the p-value from the F-test of joint significance is 0.985.
12
  The 9-percent failure rate represents the average across all observations. In total, 12.2 percent of students
in our sample (406 of 3,323) failed the fitness requirement at least once.



                                                      6
        Importantly, we also collected data on individuals’ physical fitness prior to

enrolling at the academy. This score is based on applicants’ performance on pull-ups, sit-

ups, push-ups, a 600-yard shuttle run, the standing long jump and a basketball throw.

The test is typically administered and certified by an official from the individual's high

school, such as a physical education teacher.13 Observing fitness prior to enrolling is

critical for making causal inferences for two reasons. First, because we examine whether

friends’ fitness in high school affects an individual's own fitness in college, we can rule

out the possibility that common environmental factors are causing the correlation

between own health and friends’ health. For example, it is difficult to conceive of a

factor that would simultaneously affect own fitness in college as well as a friend’s fitness

in high school, since the two were not yet friends in high school.14 In addition, we can

rule out the possibility of reflection, since it is impossible for one’s own current health to

affect a friend’s health (i.e. high school fitness score) before she or he entered the social

network.

        The full set of summary statistics is shown in Table 1. The average combined

SAT score of students at the academy is 1,298, which is similar to other undergraduate

institutions such as UCLA, University of Michigan, University of Virginia, and UNC-

Chapel Hill. Eighteen percent of the sample is female, 5 percent is Black, 6 percent is

Hispanic, and 5 percent is Asian. The average high school health fitness score of peers




13
  The high school fitness data were available for 99.5 percent of all students in the sample. We dropped
from our sample the 19 of 3,506 students who were missing the high school fitness score.
14
  Students at the USAFA come from every congressional district in the United States; therefore, it is highly
implausible that common environmental factors could affect both the high school and college fitness
exams.

randomly assigned to one’s social network is 460, with a standard deviation of 18 points

across groups and a standard deviation of 97 across individuals.



External Validity

         While the USAFA data offer distinct advantages with respect to both the

randomization of peers and the availability of an absolute measure of fitness, there is an

open question regarding whether the effects we find generalize to the broader population.

The most significant difference between USAFA students and their peers at other

selective public universities is that USAFA students spend considerably more time

exercising and playing sports. Only 12.5 percent of USAFA students reported spending 5

or fewer hours on sports and exercise per week in their last year of high school, compared

to 48.2 percent of students at other selective public universities (Cooperative Institutional

Research Program (CIRP), 2007). Similarly, 24.6 percent of USAFA students reported

spending more than 20 hours on exercise and sports per week in their last year of high

school, compared to 8 percent of students enrolled at selective public universities (CIRP,

2007).

         In addition to differences in incoming fitness levels, students at USAFA are held

to rigorous physical fitness standards throughout their college experience. For example,

one way in which students can fail the fitness requirement is by not meeting the

minimum standards on any of the subcomponents of the physical education score. For

the 1.5-mile timed run, minimum passing times are 11:15 for men and 13:20 for women.

For the physical fitness test, students must score at least 250 points and achieve the

following minimums on each component: 1) pull-ups (7-males, 1-females), 2) long jump




                                             8
(7'00"-males, 5'09"-females, 3) sit-ups (58-males, 58-females), 4) push-ups (35-males,

18-females, and 5) 600 yard run (2:03-males, 2:23-females). However, minimums on

every event result in a total score of 125 points and failure of the test. Although our data

do not contain each individual component of the PEA, anecdotal evidence suggests that

failing the physical fitness test is the most common reason students fail the fitness

requirement. However, we note that these are stringent requirements, and that even

students who fail this requirement are likely more fit than the typical college student.

        As a result of these fitness requirements, students at USAFA likely have lower

body fat than typical college students. According to the USAFA Athletics Department,

only about seven percent of students during their freshman and sophomore year fail to

meet body fat standards of 20 percent for males and 28 percent for females.

        Since we are not aware of any other studies on fitness peer effects, we are unable

to make direct comparisons of our estimates to those covering other populations.

However, Carrell, Fullerton, and West (2009) report that academic peer effects at the

academy are similar to those at other academic institutions when the peer group is

defined as either roommates, as in Sacerdote (2001) and Zimmerman (2003), or as dorm

halls, as in Foster (2006).15

        There are several factors unique to USAFA that could cause the magnitude of

fitness peer effects to be different than in other contexts. Students at USAFA both eat

and exercise with their (randomly assigned) friends, suggesting our estimates may

overstate the effects found in other environments. On the other hand, certain factors may

cause our estimates to understate the effects in other contexts. For example, students at


15
  However, Carrell, Fullerton, and West (2009) estimate much larger academic peer effects when the peer
group is defined as the squadron rather than as roommates or dormitory residents.


                                                   9
the USAFA face strict upper and lower bounds on the time devoted the physical activity

that are not present for the general population. Similarly, the presence of mandatory,

well-defined physical fitness requirements may reduce the need for peer comparisons,

thus reducing the size of the peer effect estimates at USAFA relative to elsewhere.16 In

addition, all students at USAFA are offered the same family-style meals in the dining

facility, which reduces the extent to which friends can affect the type of foods eaten.

Finally, we note that the effect of other factors, such as living in an environment in which

peers are randomly assigned, is more ambiguous.

        For these reasons, we remain agnostic regarding whether effects would be larger

or smaller for other populations in other environments. However, it clear is that

regardless of the population in question, peer effects on outcomes such as fitness or

obesity must occur by affecting own diet, own exercise, or both. Thus, our view is that at

a minimum, the presence of such peer effects in one population increases the likelihood

that peer effects in fitness exist more broadly.



Methods

        To determine the effect of friends on own physical fitness, we estimate standard

ordinary least squares regressions17 in which the dependent variables are the overall

physical education average (PEA) score and whether the individual was placed on

athletic probation, respectively. The main explanatory variable of interest is the average


16
   If students fail to meet the minimum requirements in a given semester they are placed on athletic
probation and put into a mandatory reconditioning program. Repeated failures lead to expulsion.
17
  We use a linear probability model rather than logistic regression when using the binary dependent
variable to allow us to compute two-way clustered standard errors, which computational limitations prevent
us from doing when using a logistic regression model. However, results are qualitatively similar when
using logistic regression rather than OLS.


                                                   10
high school fitness score of one’s peers, and in all specifications we include a control for

own high school fitness as well as graduation class fixed effects. To ease interpretation,

own fitness scores are normalized to have mean zero and standard deviation one.

Similarly, the peer high school fitness score variable is normalized by subtracting the

mean and dividing by the individual-level standard deviation. We normalized the peer

variable in this manner to ensure comparability between the coefficients on the own and

peer high school fitness variables. We cluster our standard errors at both the peer group

level and individual level using multi-way clustering to allow for correlation across

individuals within the same network (Cameron, Gelbach, & Miller, 2010).

          Although the average high school fitness of peers in one’s network is determined

by random assignment within a graduation class cohort, in some specifications we also

include additional controls to examine the robustness of our results. Specifically, we

include cohort by year by semester fixed effects and state of residence fixed effects. This

allows for changing factors over time that might affect the entire cohort of students in a

given semester, such as differing academic requirements or changes in the dietary menus.

We also include controls for individual-level characteristics that may affect fitness

including math and verbal SAT scores, a high school academic composite (GPA and

class rank) score, a leadership composite score, and indicators for student race, whether

the student was recruited to the academy as an athlete, and whether the student attended a

military preparatory school.

          For aid in interpreting the reduced form parameters on our peer effects

coefficient, consider the following linear in means peer effects model:

(1) y ig  1 x ig   2 y g   3 x g   g  ig




                                                     11
where x ig is the pre-USAFA fitness score and y ig is the contemporaneous fitness score.

x g and y g are the average scores of the peer group excluding individual i. In Manski's

(1993) framework,  2 represents the endogenous peer effect,  3 is the exogenous peer

effect, g represents common environmental factors, and ig are other individual

unobservables.

       Taking averages within group g, one obtains a reduced form equation:

                        2 (1   3 )
(2) y ig  1 x ig                    x g  
                                             ˜  
                                                 ˜ig
                           1  2
                                              g




Hence, the coefficient in a regression of own college fitness on peer high school fitness is

a function of both the endogenous and exogenous structural peer effects. Thus, while our

reduced form estimates cannot distinguish between whether the peer effects we find are

driven by the background characteristics or behavior of the group, we can say that our

estimates are a causal effect of one’s peers. That is, we can be confident that 
                                                                                ˜ig is

uncorrelated with x g because of the random assignment students to peer groups.

Random assignment also ensures that there is no correlation between x g and fixed

components of g (e.g. dorm proximity to the gym or cafeteria). However, it is

theoretically possible that some common environmental factors endogenously adjust to

the average high school fitness level of the group. For example, physical education

teachers could adjust curriculum depending on the fitness level of the class. Fortunately,

students of all squadrons are randomly assigned across courses at USAFA (including PE

courses), ensuring there are no classroom level common shocks biasing our estimates.




                                                       12
Additionally, given the rigidity of the academic, athletic, and military curriculum and

standards at USAFA, we expect any such endogenous adjustments to be quite minimal.18



Results

         Results are shown in Table 2, which reports the effect of peer high school fitness

on the Physical Education Average (PEA) score. Column 1 controls only for own fitness

in high school and indicators for graduation year. The estimate indicates that peers’

fitness (as measured in high school) has a large and statistically significant effect on own

fitness in college. The marginal effect shows that a one standard deviation increase in the

high school fitness score of all peers in the group results in a statistically significant

0.165 standard deviation increase in college fitness.19 By comparison, a similar sized

improvement in own fitness is associated with a statistically significant 0.434 standard

deviation increase in college fitness. This is striking, as it suggests that the effect of

friends' high school fitness on own current fitness is nearly 40 percent as strong as the

effect of own high school fitness.

         To account for individual-level factors that may affect own fitness, in columns (2)

and (3) of Table 2 we sequentially add the individual controls and the fixed effects. The

magnitude of the peer effect decreases slightly, but is statistically indistinguishable from

   The academic, athletic and military standards are constant across all squadrons at USAFA, with
guidelines set forth in formal Air Force Instructions and Manuals.
19
   For ease in interpretation we present all of our results in terms of standard deviations. To get a sense of
how fitness levels translate into standard deviation changes in the PEA score we provide the following
examples for males: 1) A four minute change in the 1.5 mile (12 to 8 minutes), holding PE grades and the
physical fitness test score constant would result in a one-half standard deviation change in the PEA score.
2) From the mean score, adding five pull-ups, 9 inches on the long jump, 14 sit-ups, 15 push-ups, and a 12
second decrease on the 600 meter run would result in roughly a one-standard deviation change in the PEA,
holding the 1.5 mile run time and PE grades constant.

the estimate in column (1). These results are expected given that peer groups were

randomly assigned.

           While the estimates in columns (1) through (3) imply that the underlying fitness

of friends does have a significant impact on fitness in college, it is also possible that the

effect is caused by other peer factors correlated with fitness. For example, perhaps more

fit peers are also more motivated to achieve success generally. Similarly, it may be that

more fit peers are also more likely to take a leadership role among friends at the academy

and this leadership, rather than the physically fit friends, causes students to become more

fit in college.

           To address these possibilities, we include additional peer controls in column (4).

Specifically, we control for the average SAT math and verbal scores, high school

academic composite score, and high school leadership composite of peers in one’s social

network. Results show that the impact of friends’ fitness remains statistically significant

and similar in magnitude. This suggests that the effects we find are likely caused by

friends' fitness and not by general motivation or leadership ability.

           Next, we examine whether friends’ fitness affects whether or not an individual

fails the fitness requirement at the academy. Results are shown in Table 3 and indicate

that there is a large and statistically significant effect that is unchanged when adding

controls in columns 2 through 4. For example, the estimates in column 4 indicate that the

effect of peer high school fitness on own college fitness (-0.044) is approximately 70

percent as large as the association between own high school fitness and own college

fitness.




                                               14
Mechanisms and Heterogeneity

         Given that friends’ average high school fitness affects own college fitness, it is

natural to wonder how peers matter. While any effect on the outcomes used in this

analysis presumably works through either diet or exercise, we can identify several

potential mechanisms. Peer effects may arise through increased positive knowledge

about how to exercise or train. If so, we would primarily expect the effects to be driven

by peers who are the most fit. In contrast, if the effects operate through the adoption of

poor diet or negative exercise habits, we would expect the effect to be driven by the least

fit members of the group.

         Thus, to help assess these potential mechanisms, we examine more closely which

peers appear to be causing the peer effect, and which groups of students are most

affected. We begin by examining how own fitness is affected by the proportion of

randomly assigned friends who were in the bottom and top 20 percent of the high school

fitness score distribution.20 These estimated effects are relative to having peers from the

middle 60 percent of the fitness distribution.

         Results are shown in Table 4. Columns (1) and (2) show that it is primarily the

least fit friends who reduce average physical fitness (estimate = 0.360, p<0.01) and

induce students to fail the fitness requirements (estimate = 0.105, p<0.05). The estimates

imply that if half of your friends were to become among the least fit for reasons unrelated

to you,21 your own fitness level would drop by nearly 20 percent of a standard deviation


20
  We also examined whether females respond differently to peers than males. We find that while the
coefficients are larger for women, they are not statistically distinguishable from those for men.
21
  This is approximately the variation observed across peer groups in the data; the proportion of peers in
one’s squadron ranking below the 20th percentile prior to attending the academy ranges from 0 to 42
percent.


                                                     15
and you would be nearly 60 percent more likely to fail the fitness requirements. Put

differently, the effect of the least fit peers on college fitness is 85 percent of the effect of

one’s own high school fitness. Even more strikingly, the effect of the least fit peers on

the probability of failing the fitness exam is larger than the effect of own high school

fitness.22

         Next, we examine which students are most affected by their peers. To do so, we

interact average peer high school fitness with indicators for whether the individual's high

school fitness score is above- or below-average. Results are shown in Columns (3) and

(4) of Table 4. The estimates indicate that it is the college students on the lower end of

the fitness distribution who are most affected by their peers.

         Finally, we estimate the effects after allowing for interactions between whether

own high school fitness was above- or below-average and exposure to peers from the top

and bottom 20 percent of the high school fitness distribution. Results are shown in

Columns (5) and (6) of Table 4. These results are consistent with results from Columns

(1) through (4): exposure to the least fit peers is what matters, and college students with

the lowest propensity to be fit are the ones who are most affected.

         Our results thus yield two notable findings. First, they indicate that the peer

effects in physical fitness we find are primarily driven by the least physically fit friends.

Second, the individuals most at risk from exposure to unfit friends are those who

themselves struggle with fitness. Collectively, this suggests that peer effects in fitness do



22
  We also investigated whether variance in peer fitness affects own fitness in college by regressing own
college fitness on the standard deviation of peer high school fitness. We find that increased variance in
peer fitness causes a reduction in own fitness, though the effect goes away once we control for the
proportion of least fit peers, as in Table 4. This suggests that at least in this context, variance matters
primarily because it means you are exposed to more of the least fit peers.


                                                     16
not appear to arise due to the spread of knowledge from highly fit to less fit individuals.

Rather the results are more consistent with the notion that people imitate the diet or

exercise habits of their least fit friends, or use those friends’ fitness as a benchmark for

their own.



Conclusion

       Understanding the nature of social interactions is important for both diagnosing

the causes of the decline in physical fitness and assessing policy strategies to combat the

decline.     However, because individuals can select their friends based in part on

preferences for diet and exercise and because friends are likely to be subjected to the

same environmental factors, it is difficult to credibly estimate the effect of peers on

fitness and obesity using observational data.

       We estimate the impact of friends’ fitness on own physical fitness by exploiting a

unique data set in which college students are randomly assigned to a group of 30 students

with whom they spend the majority of their time. We find strong evidence that friends’

fitness affects own fitness as well as the probability of failing the fitness requirements.

The magnitude of the effect is large, as the effect of peer high school fitness is

approximately 40 to 70 percent as large as the effect of own high school fitness. Thus,

our findings are broadly consistent with the provocative notion that poor physical fitness

spreads on a person-to-person basis.

       Our results also indicate that the peer effects work largely through exposure to the

least fit peers, and the students most affected are those at the lower end of the fitness

distribution. This asymmetry in the nature of the peer effects suggests that individuals




                                            17
appear to either compare their own fitness to the least fit among them, or adopt the diet

and exercise of the least fit.    Thus, our results suggest that there is an efficiency

motivation for improving the health habits of the least physically fit individuals, as doing

so may ultimately affect the health of many more individuals by harnessing the effect of

the social multiplier.
