                  Stock Prices, Earnings and Expected Dividends

                                    ABSTRACT

   This paper presents estimates indicating that, for aggregate U.S.

stock market data 1871-1986, a long historical average of real earnings

is a good predictor of the present value of future real dividends.     This

is true even when the information contained in stock prices is taken into

account.   We estimate that for each year the optimal forecast of the

present value of future real dividends is roughly a weighted average of

moving average earnings and current real price, with between 2/3 and 3/4

of the weight on the earnings measure.    This means that simple present

value models of stock prices can be strongly rejected.

   We use a vector autoregressive approach which enables us to compute

the implicationa of this for the behavior of stock prices and returns.

We estimate that log dividend-price ratios are more variable than, and

virtually uncorrelated with, their theoretical counterparts given the

present value models.    Annual returns on stocks are quite highly

correlated with their theoretical counterparts, but are two to four times

as variable.

   Our approach also reveals the connection between recent papers showing

forecastability of long-horizon returns on corporate stocks, and earlier

literature claiming that stock prices are too volatile to be accounted

for in terms of simple present value models.    We show that excess

volatility directly implies the forecastability of long-horizon returns.

     In this paper we present estimates indicating that data on accounting

earnings, when averaged over many years, help to predict the present

value of future dividends.      This result holds even when stock prices

themselves are taken into account.      The data are the real Standard and

Poor Composite Index and associated dividend and earnings series 1871-

1987.       Our estimates indicate to what extent dividend-price ratios and

returns on this index behave in accordance with simple present value

models, and allow us to shed new light on earlier claims that stock

prices are too volatile to accord with such models (LeRoy and Porter

1981,   Shiller 1981, Mankiw, Romer, and Shapiro 1985, Campbell and Shiller

l987a, 1987b, and West 1988).

     It seems appropriate to consider earnings data for forecasting

dividends, since earnings are constructed by accountants with the

objective of helping people to evaluate the fundamental worth of a

company.      However the precise economic meaning of earnings data is not

clearly defined; accounting definitions are complicated and change

through time in ways that are not readily documented.      Because of this,

many studies of financial time series have avoided the use of earnings

data and have thus omitted relevant information about fundamental value
                                  -
from the analysis1.




        1
       There is a large accounting literature on the response of
securities prices to earnings announcements; see Kormendi and Lipe (1987)
for a list of references. However with a few exceptions, notably
Kormendi and Lipe, this literature does not ask whether the response is
consistent with a particular fundamental valuation model for the security
price.

                                           1
  Our approach is to introduce earnings, measured either annually or as

an average over a number of years, as an information variable in a vector

autoregressive (VAR) framework. Any errors in measurement in earnings

are accounted for automatically by the estimation procedure, which allows

earnings to enter the model only insofar as they are useful in

forecasting.   The VAR framework, developed originally in Campbell and

Shiller (1987a,   1987b),   enables us to answer two questions.   First, what

component of stock returns can be Dredicted given the information used in

the VAR system?   Secondly, what component of stock returns can be

accounted for ex post by news about future dividends?      The existing

literature addresses the first question, but the second question is also

important for evaluating present value models.     As Shiller (1984) and

Summers (1984) have shown, it is possible to construct a model in which

only a small fraction of I-period stock returns is predictable, but in

which news about fundamental value accounts for only a small part of the

variability of ex post returns.

   Our approach reveals that stock returns and dividend-price ratios are

too volatile to be accounted for by news about future dividends.

Further, this excess volatility is closely related to the predictability

of multi-period returns.      It has recently been shown that stock returns

are more highly predictable when they are measured over intervals of

several years, rather than over short intervals of a year or less.        Fama

and French (l987a, 1987b) have made this point most forcefully, although

the result can also be found in Flood, Hodrick and Kaplan (1986), and

Poterba   aa Summers   (1987).   (See also Deflondt and Thaler 1985).   These

returns can be explained by variables such as lagged multi-year stock

returns or dividend-price ratios.          The explained variances are higher

when dividend-price ratios are used than when lagged returns are used.

     It may be helpful, by way of motivation, to give at the outset a

simple story indicating why excess volatility is fundamentally related to

this forecastability of multi-period returns.               Let us consider the

simplest argument for excess volatility given in the original LeRoy and

Porter (1981) and Shiller (1981) papers.              It was argued in those papers

that if, as the present value model asserts, price                      is the expectation
                                                                    P
of   P,   the present value of actual future dividends, then the data must


satisfy the variance inequality: var(P)                var(P).
                                                                     The proof that the

model implies this variance inequality was as follows.                    Since
                                                                                  }' is known
                               =
at time t, we may write P
                                   P+           where
                                                        u is a      forecast error.     A
forecast error must be uncorrelated with the corresponding forecast, so

                                         Therefore var(P*) —
                                                                        var(P) +
     must be uncorrelated with
                                   P.                                              var(u).
Since variances cannot be negative, the variance inequality follows.

This argument can be reversed to show that if the variance inequality is

violated in U.S. data, then it must be that P               -
                                                                P   is forecastable. We

will show below that       -                                            a sort of infinite-

period return. Hence, excess volatility directly implies forecastability

of infinite-period returns.

     While the above simple story is illustrative of the nature of our

argument, we will restate it below in           tens    of dividend-price ratios to

allow for nonstationary dividends and prices, we will avoid any

comparisons of   P and P    estimated with a terminal condition, we will

take account of earnings data, and we will allow for a simple form of


                                                3
time-variation in the real discount rate on stock.   These advances are

made possible by our use of the VAR framework discussed above.   In our

earlier work using this framework (Campbell and Shiller l987b), we found

that our rejection of the hypothesis that one-period returns are

unforecastable was much less strong than our rejection of the hypothesis

that the dividend-price ratio equals the theoretical dividend-price ratio

given the present value model. We will see that this is essentially the

same result as noted by Fama and French and others that the one-period

return is much less forecastable than the multiperiod return. The limit

of their excess return regression, where returns are computed over an

infinite period of time, is essentially our test that the stock price

equals the expected present value of future dividends.   Thus we argue

that excess volatility and predictability of multi-period returns are not

two phenomena, but one.

   The organization of the paper is as follows.   In section 2 we discuss

our data and show that dividend-price and earnings-price ratios predict

stock returns measured over several years.   We also present an approxi-

mation to the continuously compounded stock return, which we need to use

in our VAR analysis.   We show that predictability of approximate returns

is close to that of exact returns.   In section 3 we explain our VAR

methodology and relate it to research on multi-period returns.     In

section 4 we present basic VAR results, and in section 5 we use them to

compare the historical behavior of stock prices and returns with the

behavior implied by the present value model.   Section 6 checks the

robustness of our results to changes in specification.   Section 7

concludes, and there is a brief Appendix describing our data sources.

2.   Predicting Stock Returns Using Prices. Dividends and Earnings

     The data set used in this paper consists of annual observations on

prices, dividends and earnings for the Standard and Poors Composite Stock

Price Index, extended back to 1871 by using the data in Cowles (1939).

The series on prices and dividends are also used in Campbell and Shiller

(]L987a,    l987b), and in much of the literature on volatility tests.

Campbell and Shiller (1987b) show that the properties of the post-1926

data are very similar to those of the CRSP series on the value-weighted

New York Stock Exchange Index, while Wilson and Jones (1987) have

carefully analyzed the pre-1926 data.             We deflate nominal series using a

January Producer Price Index (annual average before 1900).              More details

on the data are given in the Appendix to the paper.

     We write the real price of the stock index, measured in January of

     We also wish to study excess returns on common stock over short debt.

The short term interest rate we use is the annual return on 4-6 month

prime commercial paper, rolled over in January and July.              If we write the

realized log real return on commercial paper in year t as                  and
                                                                      rt

then the excess return on stock over i periods is              Working with

excess returns has the advantage that price deflators cancel so that

results are not contaminated by measurement error in the deflators.

  We begin our empirical work by regressing real and excess stock

returns on some explanatory variables which are known in advance (at the

start of year t).    For real returns, we consider the following

variables2: the log dividend-price ratio,     & dt1p       (the dividend is

lagged one year to ensure that it is known at the start of year t); the

                                      the log earnings-price ratio
lagged dividend growth rate,   d1;
   —
       e-p;     and two log earnings-price ratios based on moving averages

of earnings.    The latter two are a 10-year moving average of log real

earnings minus current current log real price,    f   —



                            and a 30-year moving average of log real

earnings minus current log real price,          ((e1.i..   .+e30)/3O)-p.
   The ratio variables are used here with the same motivation that we see

in the financial press, as indicators of fundamental value relative to

price.   The notion is that if stocks are underpriced relative to

fundamental value returns tend to be high subsequently, conversely if

stocks are overpriced.    A moving average of earnings is used because

yearly earnings are quite noisy as measures of fundamental value; they

could evem be negative while fundamental value cannot be negative.      The

use of an average of earnings in computing the earnings-price ratio has a

long history.    Graham and Dodd (1934) recommended an approach that

"shifts the original point of departure, or basis of computation, from

the current earnings to the average earnings, which should cover a period

of not less than five years, and preferably seven to ten years."

(Security Analysis, page 452).           We push their averaging scheme even

further, to 30 years, in recognition of the substantial decadal

variability of earnings, under the supposition that fundamental value may

be less variable than this decadal variability.

   We regress real stock returns on each of these variables individually,

and also on the combination                              For excess stock returns,

the procedure is similar except that we use the excess of dividend growth

over the commercial paper rate,                      in place of the real dividend

growth rate.

results for excess returns.           For each regression the table reports the R2

the hypothesis that all coefficients (other than a constant) are zero.

The Wald test corrects for the moving average structure of the equation

not correct for heteroskedasticity3.

where p is a parameter related to the mean ratio of prices to dividends.

   We now define a multiperiod extension of (3). For the purpose of

showing the relation between the excess volatility literature and the

multi-period return forecasting literature, it is helpful to define this

slightly differently than would be natural given (1). We define the

discounted i-period return       as:




     -
         :        l,t+f                                                  (4)




   The variable       is the discounted sum of approximate returns from t

to t+i-l.   It has the convenient property that it depends only on

      and dividend growth rates from t to t+i; log dividend-price ratios

for times between t and t+i do not appear.     While the summation in (1)

approaches infinity as i increases, the summation in (4) instead

approaches (under the assumption that        and   Ad1   are jointly

                                                                         We

can thus speak of an infinite-period log return, which we will see below

is related to the log dividend-price ratio; this is why use of the

definition (4) ties the multi-period return literature to our own earlier

study of the behavior of the dividend-price ratio.

   One interpretation of the discounted i-period return           is that it is


(up to a constant   ten   that depends on i) a linearization of an exact

i-period log return       where dividends paid are reinvested not in the

can be written in terms of the log dividend-price ratio and log dividend

growth rates:

The subsequent terms give the terminal value of total dividends received

between t and t+i-l divided by                        Note that since reinvestments are not

made in the stock, dividend-price ratios between t and t+i do not enter

the expression, as also with (4).                     Let us linearize the above expression

around          —                    =
            S       S   and
                              Ad+         g,   for all j.     This gives us the discounted i-

period return                 defined in equation (4), plus a constant that increases

with   i.


   Naturally equations (3) and (4) do not give actual log returns

exactly; since they were derived from a linearization there is some

approximation error.               In Campbell and Shiller (l987b), we presented

considerable evidence that in practice the error is quite small for one-

period returns.           Here we supplement that analysis by repeating the

regressions of Table 1 using discounted multi-period returns                         rather

than exact returns                       We treat the parameter p as fixed, and set it

equal to 0.936 following Campbell and Shiller (1987b)6.


       We assume this reinvestment rate of return is equal to the rate of
return r implicit in the p used in the linearization, that is, r — g - ln(p).
       6
       In that paper we showed that varying p in a plausible range did
not greatly affect our conclusions. Here too, when we set p — 1 in
equation (4) (but retain p = 0.936in equation (3)), so that      becomes
the simple sum which approximates      we obtain very similar results to

                                                        11
   The results are given in Table 2.    They are generally similar to those

in Table 1; while there is a slightly greater tendency to reject the

constant-expected return model in Table 2 (indicating that the

approximation error is correlated with the explanatory variables), the

•difference   is relatively minor. This confirms that we can speak of our

definition of multiperiod returns (4) as roughly interchangeable, for

present purposes, with the definition (1) used by Fama and French (1987a,

1987b) and others.

3.   A   Vector Autorearessive Anroach

     In the previous section we derived en approximation to the log return

on stock which is linear in log dividend-price ratios and dividend growth

rates.     We now exploit this linearity in analyzing stock price movements.

     First, we write the discounted i-period log return as an explicit

linear function of                 and           j—O     i-l.   From equations (3)
                                         td+.
and (4) we have:




       —     -          +                + k(lpi)/(lp).
                            ;: P3tdt+


Equation (5) shows that the discounted i-period return is higher, the

higher is the dividend-price ratio when the investment is initiated, the

lower is the dividend-price ratio when the investment is terminated, and

the higher is dividend growth between those two dates7.

     We can also use this equation to see the relationship between multi-

period returns and the literature on price volatility.            If we take the

limit of (5) as i increases, assuming that lim.        S
                                              i-' ptE t t+i
                                                                    .   —   0   (which

follows from the stationarity of                we find that we have

       Note that as i grows larger, less weight is given in (5) to the
terminal dividend-price ratio       and hence to the terminal price. One
might wonder why the terminal price is downweighted in an approximate
expression for log total return over t to t+i. The reason is that as i is
increased the component of total return due to reinvestment of
intervening dividends at the fixed rate grows larger, causing the slope
of the log function at the point of linearization to approach zero as i
is increased.

                                              13
The first term on the right hand side of this expression is the present

discounted value of log dividends, which is a log-linearization of

while the second term is the log of                        Thus,   as noted in the

introduction, the infinite-period discounted log return is a log-

linearization of the variable                  -      which is the subject of the

volatility literature.             Moreover, for finite i             is a log-linear

representation of          -         where         is computed under the assumption that

the present value in period t+i of dividends from t+i onwards equals

           This assumption was used in the volatility literature to obtain an

estimate of         with a finite record of dividends.

   Equation (5) makes it easy to compute the implications of a returns

model for the dividend-price ratio.                  For example, suppose our model is

that expected real 1-period stock returns are constant:                     EEi
                                                                                     —   r.   Then


Etet
       =    r(l-p')/(l-p).         Taking conditional expectations of the left and

right hand sides of (5) and rearranging, we have




   =
       -:        P3EM+.        +    iES            + (rk)(lpi)/(lp).




This equation says that the log dividend-price ratio at time t is

determined by expectations of future real dividend growth over i periods,

by the i-period-ahead expected dividend-price ratio, and by the constant

required return on stock.             If we take the limit as i increases, assuming

as before that lim.       S                  — 0, we     obtain
                  i-' ptEt t+i

   —   -    S                  +   (r-k)/(l-p)

                                                      14
Equation (7) expresses the log dividend-price ratio as a linear function

of expected real dividend growth into the infinite future.

  A similar approach can be used when our returns model is that expected

excess returns on stock, over some alternative asset with return          rt   are

constant:          —           In our empirical work, we take rt to be the real

  —
      :                             +       iES        -
                                                           k(lpi)/(lp),   (6)'




and taking the limit as i increases,




  —
          PE[r         -
                           tdt÷.1
                                        -
                                            k/(l-p).                      (7)'




This relation is what Campbell and Shiller (1987b) call the "dividend-

ratio model".      It may also be described as a dynamic Cordon model, after

the simple growth model proposed by Myron Cordon (1962), which makes the

dividend-price ratio equal the interest rate minus the growth rate of

dividends. The original Cordon model did not specify how the dividend-

price ratio should change through time if interest rates or growth rates

change through time:       equation (7)' says that the dividend-price ratio is

related to a present value of expected one-period interest rates and

dividend growth rates.

   The linearity of these relationships makes it possible to test them as

restrictions on a vector autoregression. This procedure has several


                                                  15
advantages over the straightforward multi-period regression approach

discussed in the previous section.      First, one need only estimate the VAR

once: then one can conduct Wald tests of (6) or (6)' for any          i,   without

reestimating the system.      Secondly, as i increases the regression

approach forces one to shorten the sample period.        This becomes quite

serious when returns are calculated over 5 or 10 years.           The VAR, by

contrast, can be estimated over the whole sample.        Thirdly, the VAR can

be used to test the restrictions (7) or (7)'     ,   which   are the limits of (6)

and (6)' as i increases.      This is important because (7) and (7)' directly

state the implications of the returns model for the dividend-price ratio.

Finally, the VAR approach enables us to characterize the historical

behavior of the dividend-price ratio in relation to an unrestricted

econometric forecast of future dividends and discount rates.           It is

important to note that if the present value model is correct, then this

unrestricted forecast, which we call           should equal the log dividend-
                                         6,
price ratio       no matter how much information market participants have.

The reason for this is that         which is included in the VAR system, is a

sufficient statistic for market participants' information about the

present value of future dividends.

   A   detailed account of the VAR framework is given in Campbell and

Shiller (1987a,    1987b).   Here we briefly summarize it for the constant-

expected returns case.       Consider estimating a VAR for the variables

    and           The last variable, a moving-average earnings-price ratio,
          el.
is included only as a potential predictor of stock returns.           If the VAR

has only one lag, then the system estimated is

This makes it easy to translate equations (6) and (7) into restrictions

on the VAR.                 First, define vectors el        — [1       0    0)', so that           —
                                                                                            el'z

of equation (6), conditional on

The left hand side is unaffected, because                             S is      in the information set

         and the right hand side becomes an expectation conditional on

     Finally, apply the multi-period forecasting formula (9):

These are complicated nonlinear restrictions on the coefficient matrix A,

but they do simplify in two special cases, which are emphasized in

Campbell and Shiller (1987b).             First, if i—l then we have a set of linear

restrictions that 1-period returns are unpredictable: el'(I-pA) =                -e2'A.
In terms of the individual coefficients, the restrictions are

      —                   =                —          The coefficients in the

equation for the earnings-price ratio, a31, a32, and a33, are

unrestricted.        Secondly, if     i—   then we have a set of nonlinear but

simple restrictions that the log dividend-price ratio             5 equals   the

unrestricted VAR forecast of real dividend growth into the infinite

           which we will call              The restrictions are              =

                                     S.                           6   el'z
e2'A(IpAY1z a             5,   which requires that el' =    -e2'A(I-pAY1.    We will

compare the historical behavior of            5,   the VAR forecast of future real

dividend growth, with that of the log dividend-price ratio             S.
   Of course, the restrictions for all             i are algebraically equivalent.

If el'(I-pA)    — -e2'A,then         one can postmultiply by (I-p1A1) for any i to

get the i-period restriction.             The reverse is also possible since

stationarity of the VAR guarantees nonsingularity of (I-p'A').               This

algebraic equivalence reflects the fact that if 1-period returns are

completely unpredictable, then i-period returns must also be; and vice

versa.     Nevertheless, Wald tests on the VAR may yield different results



                                                 18
depending on which value of i is chosen, just as regression tests did in

Tables 1 and 2.

   The VAR approach can easily be modified to handle different

specifications.   To test the model in which expected excess returns are

constant, one simply replaces     with        and proceeds as before.     To

handle higher-order VAR behavior, one estimates the higher-order system

and then stacks it into first-order "companion" form as discussed by

Sargent (1979) and Campbell and Shiller (1987a, 1987b).   When   z,   A, el

and e2 are suitably redefined, the restriction (11) remains correct.

4. Results of the VAR Procedure

   In Table 3 we apply the VAR method to our data on stock prices,

dividends and earnings over the period 1871-1987.                         The sample period is

truncated at the beginning to allow for construction of a 30-year moving

average of earnings, but it need not be truncated at the end even though

we will test for unpredictability of multi-period returns.                        We estimate

first-order VAR's, using real dividend growth in panel A (to test the

constant expected      j         return model), and the excess of dividend growth

over the commercial paper rate in panel B (to test the constant expected

excess return model).            We devote most of our attention to the results in

panel A, discussing the panel B results briefly in section 6.

   The VAR coefficients, a1. for i,j =                   1,2,3,      are reported at the top of

the table,       Below each coefficient is an asymptotic standard error in

parentheses.       The coefficients in the second row (the dividend growth

equation) are perhaps of special interest; they show that the dividend-

price ratio has strong forecasting power for dividend growth, and the

earnings-price ratio         30      is also highly significant.             These results

suggest that some improvement is possible in the dividend growth equation

proposed by Marsh and Merton (1986, 1987), which does not use the long

average of earnings variable.

   The hypothesis that expected real returns on stock are constant

restricts the coefficients in the first two rows, the equations for the

dividend-price ratio and real dividend growth respectively.                         We should

have         —                   —          and         =             As before, we fix the

   These restrictions do not hold exactly, and the differences

a21-pa11+l, a22-pa12         a23-pa13 are the coefficients obtained in a

regression of   lt   on the VAR explanatory variables.   Coefficients from

such a regression are reported in Table 3 below the VAR results.        (This

regression was also used in Table 2, panel A, bottom left entry).

   Wald tests of the model restriction (11), for i —     1,2,3,5,7,10   and   ,
are   reported next in Table 3.   The test statistic for i—i is numerically

identic6l to the statistic obtained from the regression of          on the VAR

explanatory variables; its significance level of 0.047 is therefore

identical to the one reported in Table 2, panel A, bottom left entry.

When i>l, the exact equivalence of the regression test and the VAR test

is broken, but the general nature of the results is the same.       The VAR

tests, like the multi-period regression tests, reject more and more

strongly as the return horizon increases.     In the limit, at   i—,   the null

hypothesis is that the log dividend-price ratio    &   equals the

unrestricted VAR forecast of the present value of future real dividend

growth        This hypothesis can be rejected at better than the 0.1%

5. Comparison of Historical and Theoretical Stock Prices and Returns

     In this section we use the VAR estimates in Table 3 to compare actual

stock prices and returns with their theoretical counterparts. We find

that with the constant expected real return model, the log dividend-price

           has only a weak relation to its theoretical counterpart               a
ratio                                                                     8,

0.162), and      is less variable than          see the bottom of Table 3, Panel

A.    Its standard deviation is 0.638 times that of          with a small

standard error of 0.074.      This would suggest that the dividend-price

ratio is unrelated to the theoretical value implied by the constant

expected real return model.      However, a plot of       and   8 (Figure 1)
shows a suggestion of short-run coherence, even though the overall

correlation between the two is virtually zero.         Our VAR results also

indicate that the dividend-price ratio helps to forecast short-run

dividend changes.

     One-period returns       are about four times as variable as they should
                                                                             -

be a strong result, as the standard error on this ratio of standard

deviations is only 0.069.       This result is good evidence that returns on

 stocks are far too volatile to accord with the constant expected real


                                           22
return present value model, confirming the earlier claims of the

volatility literature.

   Although returns seem to be too volatile, we do estimate a remarkably

                                                                                  and their
high correlation coefficient between actual returns                          lt

volatile, but they appear to be on-track in the sense that they correlate

very well with their theoretical values.

   This result is due to the same feature of the data which gives the

short-run coherence between                 and     observed in Figure 1.                It is easy

to see where the result comes from if we use the derived equation

                 as shown in Table 3, Panel A.               This equation defines               as

the moving average of log real earnings and of log real price with most

of the weight on the moving average.

since long moving averages smooth out the series averaged.                               Hence, most

behavior is dominated by the short-run movements in the series so that

they are highly correlated with each other.      Dividend-price ratios     S   and

not very correlated.

6.   How Robust Are the Results to Changes in Specification?

     In panel B of Table 3, we repeat all these exercises using dividend

growth deflated by the commercial paper rate rather than the inflation

rate of the producer price index.     The null hypothesis here is that

expected excess returns on stock over commercial paper are constant.             We

obtain results which are similar to, though for the most part somewhat

less dramatic than,   those in panel A.    The correlation between         and

is small, at 0.246.    The standard deviation of            is just under half

that of        and the two have a substantial correlation, of 0.727.         The

implied variable   p now places a weight of      0.638 on    e°   and 0.288 on
                                                                                 Pt.

Again, the long moving average of earnings dominates the stock price in

forecasting dividend growth adjusted for commercial paper rates.

     In Table 4 we check to see whether our VAR results are robust to

increases in the lag length of the VAR.        We estimate VARs of order 1

through 5.    For each lag length, we report regressions of exact and

approximate 1-period returns on the VAR explanatory variables, and the

summary statistics a(&)/a(&t)      corr(S&) c(E)/a(el)             and

corr(je1).        Except for the fact that the significance levels in the

1-period return regression decline with lag length, the conclusions for

the most part do not seem to be very sensitive to the order of the

estimated VAR.

     We also checked to see whether a shorter 10-year moving average of

earnings gives similar results to those reported in Tables 3 and 4.          As

one would expect from the regression results in Tables 1 and 2, the 10-

year moving average gets less weight in the estimated equation (constant

real returns model) for
                          p,   which is
                                          p — 0.369e° +       O.467p + O.29Odtl

higher, although other results are similar to those in Tables 3 and 4.

We note that this correlation is sensitive to VAR lag length; it falls

towards the values in Tables 3 and 4 when the lag length is increased.

Thus it seems that the use of a 3-decade moving average of earnings is

not essential to our results.

     Finally, we estimated the VAR system in Table 3 for the shorter sample

1927-86.   We obtained results which were very similar to those for the

full sample period.




                                         26
7. Conclusion

   Our results indicate that a long moving average of real earnings helps

to forecast future real dividends. The ratio of this earnings variable

to the current stock price is a powerful predictor of the return on

stock, particularly when the return is measured over several years.     We

have shown that these facts make stock prices and returns much too

volatile to accord with a simple present value model.     Yet annual returns

do seem to carry some information and are correlated with what they

should be given the model.

   Whenever a new variable is introduced into an analysis, in this case

the long moving average of earnings, and the new variable plays an

important role in the results, it is natural for critics to wonder if the

new variable really belongs in the analysis. There is always the

possibility that many different variables were attempted, until the

results changed, and only the one that changed the results was reported.

However, we think that it can be argued that a long moving average of

earnings is a very natural variable to use to represent fundamental

value, and that there are not many competitors for this role.     We note

also that we found evidence of excess volatility in earlier research

(Campbell and Shiller 1987b) which did not use the information in

earnings.

   In evaluating our results, it should also be borne in mind that

(disregarding small sample considerations) if we find one variable that

destroys the model, then introducing new variables can never save the

                                                  is in the information set
model.   Since the log dividend-price ratio   S
assumed, it should get a unit coefficient and all other variables should


                                      27
get zero coefficients in the equation for the theoretical log dividend

price ratio   8.   Adding more variables can never bring us back to this

situation, so long as the earnings variable is included. Another way to

put this,   recalling our argument that excess volatility is the same as

forecastability of multi-period returns, is that once a forecasting

variable is found that predicts multiperiod returns, adding new

forecasting variables can never make them unforecastable.

Appendix: Data Sources

   The stock price and dividend data, the producer-price index data and

the interest rate data are the same as in Campbell and Shiller (1987b).

The nominal stock price index is the Standard and Poor Composite Index

for January of each year. The Dividend series is the total dividends per

share for the year adjusted to index. The producer price index is the BL

series (formerly wholesale price index) for January starting in 1900,

annual average before 1900.     The nominal interest rate series is the tota

return to investing for six months in January at the January 4-6 month

prime commercial paper rate (six month starting January 1980) and for

another six months at the July 4-6 month prime commercial paper rate       (Si:


month starting July 1980). The nominal earnings series for 1926 to 1986

is from Standard and Poor Statistical Service: earnings per share

adjusted to index, composite, four quarter total, fourth quarter. The

Standard and Poor earnings series begins in 1926, however, Alfred Cowles

who is also responsible for the published Standard and Poor Composite

Index 1871-1925, extended the earnings series back to 1871 (1939). The

problem he faced was absence of earnings data for many of the stocks in

the Standard and Poor Composite Index. He thus computed an annual series

      -             of stocks for which Earnings Data are available, all
P-l       "prices
stocks," a series of earnings E-l on these stocks, and the ratio R-1 of

these series, the "earnings-price ratio." Our nominal earnings is series

R-1 (Cowles (1939) pages 404-5) times the annual average Standard and

Poor Composite Index for the year. (The       S&P Composite Index 1871-1925 i

the same as Cowles "common stock index" series P-l, for all stocks,

Cowles (1939), pages 66-7, times a constant.)


                                         29
     The absence of earnings data for some stocks is of some importance for

the accuracy of the earnings series. One indication of the potential

importance of their omission can be found by comparing the series P-l

(The Cowles index for all stocks) and the series    P-l    (the Cowles series

prices of stocks for which earnings data are available). The ratio of P-l

to         1871-1925 ranged from 0.98 to 1.27,   the biggest discrepancies
     P-l
                                                                 of the
occuring in the earliest years of the sample. Another suggestion

importance of the omissions is in Cowles list ((1939), Appendix II,

pp.456-75) of the companies in the index and the years for which the

companies' earnings are available. Typically, lack of data on earnings

comes for isolated years (as if earnings reports were occasionally

                                                                    of
missing) or for single years near the begin or end of the inclusion

the company in the index.

     Wilson and Jones (1987) have recently examined the Cowles data for

accuracy. They found some apparent errors in Cowles' monthly series of

cumulated returns (Cowles data implied negative dividends for some

months) and produced an alternative monthly return series that attempted

to correct these errors. They concluded that "the overall impact of these

revisions as compared to the original Cowles Commission data is

minimal."8 We do not use the Cowles monthly data that they criticise,

computing returns on   a   January to January basis assuming dividends are

not reinvested during the year.

Table 1

The numbers reported are the R2 in the regression of return on the
explanatory variables, and in parentheses the significance level of a Wald
test of the hypothesis that all coefficients in the regression are zero.
The Wald test adjusts for overlapping data in regressions with multi-period
returns, but does not adjust for heteroskedasticity. The sample period is
1871-1987, truncated at the end where necessary to compute multi-period
returns.

      The first two rows report R statistics from regressions of exact and
discounted stock returns on 1,2,3,4 and 5 lags of the VAR explanatory
variables, and in parentheses the significance levels of Wald tests of the
hypothesis that all the coefficients are zero.  The remaining rows report
implied statistics computed from the VARs, with asymptotic standard errors
in parentheses.
