                                             ABSTRACT

Employing original, representative survey data, we document that cognitive, interpersonal and physical
job task demands can be measured with high validity using standard interview techniques. Job tasks
vary substantially within and between occupations, are significantly related to workers' characteristics,
and are robustly predictive of wage differentials both between occupations and among workers in
the same occupation. We offer a conceptual framework that makes explicit the causal links between
human capital endowments, occupational assignment, job tasks, and wages. This framework motivates
a Roy (1951) model of the allocation of workers to occupations. Tests of the model’s implication that
'returns to tasks' must negatively covary among occupations are strongly supported.

Introduction

    Contemporary analysis of the economic value of skill in the labor market is rooted in

Becker’s (1964) human capital model. A central insight of the Becker framework is that skill can

be treated as a durable investment good that is acquired (i.e., purchased) in part by attending

school or engaging in on the job training. Building from this logic, empirical analysis of the

market price of skill, starting with Mincer (1974), uses investment measures, such as years of

schooling and experience, as proxies for skill. The human capital model has been highly

successful in explaining both the level of the return to education and its evolution over time. A

key result of this work is that despite unprecedented increases in the supply of educated workers

over the course of a century, secularly rising demand for skill has kept the wage returns to

schooling investments high and, for the most part, rising for at least as long as representative data

are available (Goldin and Katz, 2008).

    Although the human capital framework illuminates both the determination of skill prices and

the incentives for skill investment, it is silent on what factors determine the skills that are

demanded. Concretely, empirical analysis of the return to education is not directly informative

about what skills workers use on the job, why these skills are required, and how these skill

requirements have changed over time. To answer these foundational questions requires a

conceptual framework that links the tasks and activities that workers perform on the job to the

skills needed to carry out these activities.

    A recent literature attempts to supply this conceptual apparatus by using a “task framework”

to analyze job skill requirements (Autor, Levy and Murnane, 2003). The simple idea of this

approach is to classify jobs according to their core task requirements—that is, the main activities

that workers must accomplish in their work—and then consider the set of formal and informal

                                                                                                    1
skills required to carry out these tasks. The task approach potentially offers a microfoundation

for linking the aggregate demand for skill in the labor market—a primitive in the human capital

model—to the specific skill demands of given job activities.

    The task approach has found application in several recent strands of work. Autor, Levy and

Murnane (‘ALM,’ 2003) study the link between evolving technology, changes in job task

requirements, and shifts in the demand for workers of different levels of education. Their

primary hypothesis is that workplace computerization leads to the automation of a large set of

‘middle education’ (i.e., high school or some college) routine cognitive and manual tasks, such

as bookkeeping, clerical work and repetitive production tasks. Job tasks in these occupations are

readily automated because they follow precise, well-understood procedure—or ‘routines’—that

lend themselves to codification in computer software. A key implication of the ALM hypothesis

is that the well-documented hollowing out (or ‘polarization’) of the occupational distribution of

employment in numerous advanced countries is in part attributable to computerization.1

    Recent work in the immigration literature also employs the task approach. Papers by Cortes

(2008) and Peri and Sparber (forthcoming) compare the job task assignments of equally educated

native and immigrant workers. An intuitive but nonetheless important finding of both studies is

that for given levels of education and experience, U.S. natives are much more likely than

immigrants to be employed in language and communications intensive occupations whereas

immigrants are more likely to be employed in occupations demanding physical labor. This

 Goos and Manning use the term ‘polarization’ in a 2003 working paper. Acemoglu (1999), Goos and Manning
(2003, 2007), Autor, Katz and Kearney (2006, 2008), Autor and Dorn (2008), Spitz-Oener (2006), Smith (2008),
Dustmann, Ludsteck and Schönberg (2009), and Goos, Manning, and Salomons (2009) present evidence that
employment polarization has occurred during the last two decades in the UK, US, and in 14 of 16 Western European
countries for which consistent data are available for 1993 through 2006. Black and Spitz-Oener (forthcoming)
consider implications of this phenomenon for demand for female labor. Bartel, Ichniowski and Shaw (2007) present
plant-level evidence on the impact of computerization on work organization and productivity in the valve
manufacturing industry.

finding in part helps to explain why similarly educated immigrants and natives do not appear to

compete more directly in the labor market.2

    Several recent studies consider the effect of international offshoring on U.S. employment. In

these studies, the unit of analysis is job tasks rather than jobs per se. Antràs, Garicano and Rossi-

Hansberg (2006) and Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) develop theoretical models of

international offshoring built upon the notion that routine job tasks are more suitable for

offshoring than non-routine job tasks. Empirical papers by Blinder (2007) and Jensen and

Kletzer (forthcoming) analyze the task content of U.S. jobs to assess their potential for

international offshoring.3

    While these examples highlight the potential of job tasks as an organizing framework, the

task approach faces two significant challenges. The first is conceptual. Research using the task

approach has not to date made explicit the economic mapping between tasks—which are

characteristics of jobs—and human capital, which is a characteristic of workers. This disjuncture

between tasks and human capital is particularly relevant to the analysis of the wage ‘returns’ to

job tasks, as we discuss below.

    The second challenge is measurement. The primary research data sets used for studying

employment and earnings provide rough measures of workers’ human capital, such as education,

potential experience, gender, race and place of birth, but essentially no information on their job

tasks. To overcome this limitation, researchers typically impute task requirements to person-level

observations using data from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Dictionary of Occupational Titles

(DOT) and its successor, the Occupational Information Network (O*Net). Both data sets offer
2
 In related work, Black and Spitz-Oener (forthcoming) point to differences between males and females in job task
specialization as a factor contributing to the closing of the gender gap in the U.S. and Germany.
3
  Distinct from the focus of the polarization literature on routine tasks, these papers analyze the degree to which jobs
require face-to-face interactions—which are tasks that are inherently difficult to offshore.
                                                                                                                       3
representative measures of job requirements in detailed occupation, but their limitations for task

measurement are substantial.4 Most significantly, both DOT and O*Net provide information on

job characteristics only at the level of occupations, not workers. This makes analysis of within-

occupation heterogeneity in task demands and its relationship to earnings infeasible.5 We present

evidence below both that job tasks differ among workers within an occupation and that this

variation is an important determinant of earnings.

    The current paper provides an exploratory effort to confront both of the limitations above: a

lack of conceptual structure for analyzing the wage ‘returns’ to tasks, and a lack of data for

analyzing the person-level relationship between tasks, education and wages. The first offers a

simple conceptual framework for interpreting the relationship between job tasks and wages. We

argue that the familiar logic of the Mincerian wage regression, used to estimate the ‘return to

education,’ does not carry over to estimating the ‘returns to tasks.’ Distinct from durable

investments such as education, job tasks are not fixed worker attributes; workers can modify

their task inputs at will. Our conceptual framework assumes that workers choose tasks according

to comparative advantage and reallocate their labor input among tasks when the market value of

tasks changes. These assumptions motivate the use of a Roy (1951) self-selection framework to

analyze the relationship between tasks and wages. We show that a simple, multi-dimensional

Roy model implies testable restrictions on the relationship between ‘task returns’ within and

between occupations. Notably, these implications are quite distinct from the Mincerian model.



4
 While an earlier generation of scholars criticized the DOT for its subjective, non-representative and outmoded
measurement of job characteristics (cf. Miller et al., 1980), the Department of Labor’s substantial investments in the
O*Net have improved this instrument relative to its predecessor.
5
  Another key limitation is that job content measures in these databases are updated infrequently (the DOT is no
longer updated), with time lags that differ among occupations. This makes it difficult to use these tools to track
changes in task content within jobs.
                                                                                                                     4
   The second goal of our paper is to rigorously explore the value-added of task measurement at

the person level for analyzing job content and wage determination. For this analysis, we

collected new data on the job activities of a representative sample of U.S. workers across a

variety of task domains, including cognitive, interpersonal, and physical activities. These data, a

subcomponent of the Princeton Data Improvement Initiative (PDII) survey, allow us to assess the

extent to which job tasks vary within (as well as between) occupations, and to test whether

within-occupation variation in job tasks is systematically related to workers’ human capital and

demographic characteristics, such as race and gender.

   Analysis of person-level task measures reveals sizable, systematic and statistically significant

differences in the job tasks performed by minorities and non-minorities possessing observably

similar education and experience levels and working in the same occupations. While such race

differences in job tasks are plausible and indeed expected, they are nevertheless inaccessible to

statistical analysis using either standard human capital variables or occupation-level indicators,

or both.

   We further assess the value-added of self-reported job tasks as predictors of labor market

outcomes relative to occupation-level measures available from sources like the O*Net. To

operationalize this comparison, we merge O*Net measures at the level of detailed 6-digit

Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) occupations onto individual PDII records and also

assign occupation-level PDII task means to individual PDII records. Combining parallel

measures from O*Net and the PDII, we estimate a set of wage regressions that test whether (1)

occupation-level PDII measures have predictive power for earnings conditional on O*Net

occupation-level measures; and (2) whether person-level PDII measures have predictive power

for earnings conditional on PDII and O*Net occupation-level measures. In both cases, we find

                                                                                                      5
that they do. Controlling for worker demographics and a full set of occupation dummies,

measures of the tasks that workers actually perform on the job significantly improve the power

of cross-sectional earnings models.6 Moreover, the within-occupation relationship between job

tasks and wages is statistically indistinguishable from the between-occupation relationship,

suggesting that tasks are a potentially valuable tool for characterizing individual jobs in addition

to broader occupations, as is the conventional practice.

      In the final section of the paper, we offer an initial empirical test of the Roy model’s

implications using the PDII data. This test yields qualified support for the model. Though the

primary purpose of our model is to build intuition for how job tasks ‘should’ be related to worker

earnings in equilibrium, we believe that the general approach and initial empirical evidence

provide a useful foundation for more comprehensive analyses.


I.     How should job tasks be rewarded in the labor market? A conceptual framework

      The Mincer (1974) earnings model provides the conceptual underpinnings for empirical

analysis of the market returns to human capital investments. In the Mincer model, human capital

is proxied by education and potential experience, and the coefficient on years of schooling

obtained from a log earnings regression is interpreted as the compensating differential for

income forgone while in school. If human capital is unidimensional and markets are competitive,

the law of one price applies: the economy wide price of human capital should be invariant across

jobs. These assumptions motivate a hedonic model of earnings such as the following,

(1)                                                       ,

 Black and Spitz-Oener (forthcoming) analyze the relationship between job tasks and wages in West Germany.
Distinct from our approach, their task measures are constructed at the occupation- rather than person-level.
                                                                                                               6
where     is the log hourly wage of worker ,       is a vector of person-level covariates,    is

years of completed schooling, and       is potential experience. In this model,      is an estimate of

the market return to a year of schooling. If the primary cost of schooling is foregone earnings and

capital markets function efficiently, the Mincer model further predicts that the equilibrium rate of

return to a year of education should approximately equal the market interest rate.

   Does this hedonic reasoning also carry over to the interpretation of the market returns to job

tasks—that is, should we expect the coefficient on job tasks in a wage regression to capture the

equilibrium, economy-wide price of these tasks? Our answer to this question is no. Job tasks

differ from education in two key respects. First, tasks are not durable investment goods like

education that must earn a well-defined market rate of return. The tasks that a worker performs

on the job are an application of that worker’s skill endowment to a given set of activities, and

workers can modify these task inputs as job requirements change. This ongoing self-selection of

workers into job tasks implies that there will not generally be a one-to-one mapping between a

worker’s stock of human capital and the job tasks she performs. Of course, tasks and human

capital cannot be treated as independent. In the model below, we assume that workers’ task

efficiencies are determined by their human capital stocks.

   The second key distinction between job tasks and years of schooling is that tasks are a high-

dimensional bundle of activities, the elements of which must be performed jointly to produce

output. For example, flight attendants engage in both interpersonal and physical tasks,

construction workers perform both analytical and physical tasks, and managers perform both

analytical and interpersonal tasks. In each case, these core job tasks cannot be unbundled; each

worker occupying the job must perform them.



                                                                                                    7
    These two observations—ongoing self-selection of workers into tasks and bundling of task

demands within jobs—motivate a Roy (1951) model of the allocation of workers to job tasks.

We conceive of a job, or, more broadly, an occupation, as an indivisible bundle of task demands,

all of which are performed simultaneously by each worker in the occupation. We assume that

workers are income maximizing. They self-select into the occupations that offer the highest wage

(or, more generally, highest utility) to the bundle of tasks they are able to produce given their

skill endowments. The empirical implications of this model differ significantly from the

Mincerian compensating differentials framework, as we show below.


A. Model

    We write workers’ skill endowments as a vector of task efficiencies (equivalently, abilities),

where the skill endowment of worker              is written as                          . Each element of          is a

strictly positive number measuring the efficiency of worker                  at task    . Thus, worker       can

perform        units of task      in a given time interval. We think of             as representing a worker’s

stock of human capital, and her efficiency in each task may be a result of human capital

investments. We make no further assumption on the distribution of                      or the correlation among

its elements except that         has continuous support on             .7

    Occupations produce output using the vector of                  tasks, where the productive value of tasks

differs among occupation. This assumption differs from the Mincerian framework for human

capital, in which the marginal productivity of education is equated across sectors. It is logical for

job tasks, however, due to occupation-level indivisibilities.

7
  The assumptions that all elements of are positive and have continuous support assures that the self-selection of
workers into occupations is well determined. Absent this assumption, two occupations that offered different rewards
to a specific task but identical rewards to all other tasks could be equally attractive to a given worker (i.e., if that
worker’s endowment had           ).

                                                                                                                       8
       Let the output of worker       in occupation    equal:


(2)                            ,

where                     and      is a worker-specific error term. Note that      is not constrained to be

positive; a worker who is poorly matched to an occupation could have a negative marginal

product in that occupation (e.g., an untrained airline pilot). We normalize the output price for

each occupation at unity. This normalization is not restrictive since a logarithmic change in the

market price of an occupation’s output is equivalent to a multiplicative change in the

exponentiated terms of (2).8 Thus, we can summarize the production structure of occupation

with the vector                                   .

       Assuming that workers are paid their marginal product, the log wage of worker              in

occupation         is:

(3)                                    .


Taking this production structure as given, each worker chooses the occupation                that maximizes

her output and hence earnings:

(4)                                                      .

       This economy is characterized by self-selection of workers into occupations based on

comparative advantage. In equilibrium, the marginal worker in occupation                is indifferent




8
    We could equivalently write equation (2) as                          , where       is a productivity shifter

that reflects market demand and other factors,         and           .

                                                                                                                   9
between that occupation and the next best alternative.9 Infra-marginal workers, however, strictly

prefer the occupation they have selected relative to any alternative.

      What are the ‘returns to tasks’ in this model? Differentiating equation (3) indicates that task

returns in this model are occupation-specific:


(5)                     .


The equilibrium of the model ensures that workers are employed in the occupation that has the

highest reward to their bundle of tasks. But this does not imply that workers necessarily receive

the maximum market reward to each element in their task bundle, or that each element is equally

valuable in all occupations.


B. Empirical implications

      As is well understood, identifying the market locus of the ‘return to skills’ in the presence of

self-selection is not empirically straightforward (cf. Heckman and Honoré, 1990). Given the non-

random assignment of workers to occupations, a regression of log wages on workers’ job tasks

will not generally recover the average returns to those tasks. Concretely, workers with high

efficiencies in given tasks will sort towards occupations that have high rewards for those tasks.

The average ‘return to tasks’ observed in the data will therefore not correspond to the average

return over all occupations (e.g., if workers were randomly assigned to occupations).

      Estimating task returns using observational data is particularly challenging when the rewards

to clusters of tasks are correlated. Consider, for example, a hypothetical case where the marginal

productivity of physically demanding tasks is strictly positive in all occupations (                             ) but

9
 This assumes that occupations are sufficiently ‘close together’ that there is a marginal worker in each occupation.
With a finite set of occupations, it is conceivable that all workers would strictly prefer the occupation they are in.
This would not affect our substantive conclusions.
                                                                                                                     10
the productivity of physical tasks is highest in occupations that have comparatively low returns

to other major task categories (e.g., analytical tasks), so                        . Let     and      denote the

intensity of worker        physical and analytical task input on the job respectively. An OLS

regression of log wages on individual task input of the following form,

(6)                                  ,

may potentially recover a ‘return’ to physically demanding tasks that is negative (i.e.,                     ).

This spurious inference would arise because the cross-occupation correlation between the returns

to physical and analytical tasks is negative, even though the within-occupation return to physical

tasks is uniformly positive.10

      Without further strong assumptions on the distribution of task endowments, it would be

difficult to identify the structural parameters that underlie this model. Fortunately, the model

implies testable restrictions on the relationship between tasks and wages that do not rely on these

parameters.

Proposition 1: Let be the set of all occupations that have non-zero employment in equilibrium.
For each occupation     , it must be the case that    is not vector dominated by some another
occupation        where          .

      This proposition says that for occupation           to attract workers (and thus belong to       ), there

cannot be an alternative occupation           that has both a higher intercept and a higher return to all

tasks. If such an occupation existed, all workers in occupation             would strictly prefer

employment in occupation             and hence        .


10
   This bias will be present if there is non-zero cross-occupation correlation between the returns to physical and
analytical tasks. The sign and magnitude of the bias will depend on both the sign and magnitude of the covariance
term and the magnitude of cross-occupation variances in task returns. Proposition 2 below demonstrates that there
must be a negative cross-occupation correlation in task returns among occupations that have positive employment in
equilibrium.
                                                                                                                  11
Proposition 2: For all occupations                  , the covariance among task returns cannot be uniformly
positive across all task pairs              . That is, either                   for some       , or
for some        , or both.
       To see why this proposition holds, consider a case where all occupations use only one task

     , so each occupation        can be described by the double                     . For each occupation

         , it must be the case that                                        for some value of          . That is, there

must be a worker          who prefers occupation           to    . Given that        , however, there must also

be some value of                 such that                      , so some worker     prefers      to . Jointly,

these restrictions imply that:

(7)                                     .

That is,                     : the returns to tasks must negatively covary within the set of occupations

that have positive employment. Were this not so, some subset of workers could be made strictly

better off by changing occupations. This reasoning extends directly to the case of multiple tasks:

the covariances among task returns, and between task returns and the intercept, cannot be

uniformly positive.11 We test this proposition below.


II.      Data Sources

       The primary data source for our analysis is a module of the Princeton Data Improvement

Initiative survey (PDII) that collects data on the tasks that workers regularly perform on their

jobs. The items in this module cover cognitive, interpersonal, and physical dimensions of job

demands, corresponding to the Data, People, and Things classification used in the Dictionary of

Occupational Titles (DOT).



11
     It does not need be negative for all elements, however.
                                                                                                                   12
     Four items elicit information on cognitive job demands: (1) the length of longest document

typically read as part of the job (ranging from one page or less to more than 25 pages); (2)

frequency of mathematics tasks involving high-school or higher mathematics (algebra, geometry,

trigonometry, probability/statistics, or calculus); (3) frequency of problem solving tasks requiring

at least 30 minutes to find a good solution; and (4) proportion of work day managing or

supervising other workers.

     Three items on face-to-face interactions with people other than co-workers or supervisors

elicit information on interpersonal job demands: (1) interactions with customers or clients; (2)

interactions with suppliers or contractors; and (3) interactions with students or trainees.12

     Two items elicit information on physical and routine job tasks: (1) proportion of the work

day spent performing physical tasks such as standing, operating machinery or vehicles, or

making or fixing things by hand; and (2) proportion of the work day spent performing short,

repetitive tasks.

     For many analyses, we use principal components analysis to combine the PDII items into

three standardized scales, which we designate Data, People, Things, respectively.

     The PDII also includes information on individuals’ human capital, demographic background,

occupation, industry, and wages. We use this information to examine the correlations between

standard demographic measures and job tasks across individuals, and to analyze the value of

using task measures to predict wages in addition to standard human capital and demographic

background variables. For all analyses we use a consistent sample of cases with full information

on tasks, demographics, human capital, and wages, and with at least five cases per three-digit

occupation (n=928). The restriction that occupations contribute at least five cases is needed for

  These questions are from the PDII module that measures the suitability of jobs for international offshoring
(Blinder and Krueger, 2008).
                                                                                                                13
the analyses comparing the relative strengths of individual- and occupation-level measures of job

tasks in wage determination.13

     Many of the task questions contained in the PDII are adapted from the survey of Skills,

Technology, and Management Practices (STAMP) written and fielded by Handel (2007,

2008a,b; see also Hilton 2008). Handel (2008a) provides an extensive discussion of the

conceptual basis, validity, and reliability of the STAMP measures, which generalizes to the

closely related PDII measures. Handel (2008b) presents preliminary results from the STAMP

survey, which can be compared to results presented below.

     An alternative source of information on job content is the U.S. Department of Labor's

Occupational Information Network (O*Net), which contains occupation-level measures and

replaces the Dictionary of Occupational Titles as an official career counseling tool. The O*Net

database, many years in the making, is only beginning to be used by academic researchers.

Nevertheless, O*Net offers a useful point of comparison to the PDII measures. If parallel

measures from the PDII and O*Net are highly correlated, this offers evidence of what

psychologists call convergent validity. Comparing results across wage regressions provides

evidence on the relative strengths of two different approaches to measuring task input (Handel

2008a) and the value-added of person-level relative to occupation-level job content measures.

We construct scales from a large number of O*Net items that appear likely to capture




13
  Our precise sample restrictions in sequence are as follows (based on an initial PDII sample of 2,500): Currently
working (238 observations dropped); ages 18 through 64 (211 observations dropped); non-missing task measures
(35 observations dropped); non-missing education (6 observations dropped); non-missing wage data (486
observations dropped); non-missing, non-military and non-farm occupation (36 observations dropped); at least 5
valid observations in each occupation (573 observations dropped).
                                                                                                                     14
comparable or closely related dimensions of task input to those in the PDII and match these

measures to the PDII data at the six digit occupation level.14

       Other approaches to providing job task measures alongside human capital variables at the

person level include the German IAB/BIBB dataset and the British Skills Survey, which are

repeated cross-sections of workers over one or two decades (Spitz-Oener, 2006; Dustman,

Ludsteck and Schonberg, forthcoming; Felstead et al., 2007). If the PDII analyses prove

illuminating, they may suggest the utility of a similar time series for the United States.


III. Job Tasks: Levels and Differences among Education and Occupation Groups

A. PDII measures

       The PDII measures, summarized in Table 1, provide a snapshot of the skill levels and task

content of U.S. jobs. Only about one-quarter (23 percent) of wage and salary workers use any

kind of higher-level math on at least a weekly basis, while about one-third (35 percent) read

documents longer than 6 pages on a regular basis as part of their jobs. Along with similar results

from the STAMP survey, these are the first figures on the actual levels of math and reading that

individuals use on their jobs. A far larger percentage report engaging in extended problem

solving either daily (40 percent) or weekly (29 percent). Approximately 31 percent manage or

supervise others at least half the time on their jobs.

       More than half (52 percent) of wage and salary workers have a lot of contact with customers

or clients as part of their jobs. Not surprisingly, far fewer people have a lot of contact with

students or trainees (23 percent) and suppliers (11 percent) as part of their jobs.




14
     See the Appendix for a detailed description of the O*Net measures we use.
                                                                                                   15
     Slightly more than half (51 percent) of workers report spending more than half their time on

short, repetitive tasks and almost two-thirds (63 percent) report spending at least half their time

doing physical tasks, such as standing, handling objects, or operating equipment.

     Because these characteristics describe important dimensions of both jobs and the persons

selected into them, one expects the measures to be associated with both demographic and job

characteristics. Subsequent columns of Table 1 summarize PDII responses by gender, race

(White, Black, Hispanic), and education (less than high school, high school only, some college,

college degree or greater).15 Appendix Table 1 provides a similar breakdown by major

occupational group. There are striking differences across gender, race and education categories

in all task activities. For example, females are substantially more likely than males to spend at

least half of their time on repetitive tasks (58 versus 44 percent), and Blacks and Hispanics are

substantially more likely than Whites to spend at least half of their time on physical job tasks

(these percentages are 60, 73, and 77 for Whites, Blacks and Hispanics respectively).

     To facilitate comparisons among PDII variables, and for later comparison with O*Net

measures, we converted the response scales of individual PDII items to a common metric (0-10)

with two exceptions: length of longest document typically read on the job is converted to number

of pages; and the interpersonal items measuring frequency of face-to-face contact are converted

into dichotomous measures.

     The upper panel of Table 2 presents means and standard deviations for the converted PDII

sample for the full sample overall and by education group. The final column of the table provides

the contrast in the mean of each task between the most educated and least educated group,

normalized by the standard deviation of the task measure. Among the individual PDII items, the
15
 1.5 percent of the sample is in a fourth race group, Asian. Because of the very small number of respondents (12),
we do not separately tabulate this group.
                                                                                                                 16
range in means across education groups is particularly sizable for physical tasks (1.3 standard

deviations) and problem solving, reading, and routine tasks (1.1 standard deviations). Somewhat

surprisingly, neither managerial/supervisory activity nor advanced math tasks are strongly

associated with educational level in the PDII. None of the interpersonal measures is associated

with education, but this is somewhat less surprising for reasons noted below.

       The lower panel of Table 2 summarizes three composite variables constructed from the PDII

that correspond to the canonical Data, People and Things scales introduced by the DOT. The first

principal component of the variables measuring interactions with Customers, Suppliers and

Trainees is used as a scale of a job’s involvement with People (explained variance=0.44). Unlike

the other domains, the individual variables measure qualitative differences rather than levels or

magnitudes of skill demands. This may account for their relatively low association with

education and weak performance in the analyses below.16

       The first principal component of the Routine and Physical variables is used as a scale for a

job’s level of involvement with Things (explained variance=0.69). These characteristics define

jobs with high levels of routine, generally manual demands, and engagement with physical

objects. The PDI variables measuring Management, Problem Solving, Math and Reading,

identify jobs that demand relatively high levels of cognitive skills. Their first principal

component is used as an overall scale of a job’s involvement with Data (explained

variance=42%). Notably, the ranges in task means between education groups are especially large

for the scales dealing with Things (1.5 s.d.) and Data (1.3 s.d). This is not so for the People

measure, though this is not surprising for the reasons noted.




16
     For a discussion of the difficulties involved in measuring interpersonal skill demands, see Handel 2008a.
                                                                                                                 17
    Table 3 shows the breakdowns by one-digit occupation. In this case, the largest and smallest

means differ by approximately 1.5 standard deviations for physical tasks and customer service

interactions, by 1.4 standard deviations for routine tasks, 1.3 standard deviations for

managerial/supervisory tasks, 1.1 standard deviations for math and problem solving, and 0.8

standard deviations for reading and training tasks. The ranges for Data, People and Things are

1.5, 1.2 and 1.8 standard deviations, respectively. Broad occupation does a better job than

personal education in identifying individuals who perform most of the interpersonal tasks.

    Table 4 presents correlations of the items and scales with one another and with education and

three-digit occupation. Education has moderate correlations with the physical tasks (-0.39),

routine tasks (-0.39), and problem solving (0.31) items, and moderate to strong correlations with

the Data (0.39) and Things (-0.47) scales. The correlations with detailed occupation were

calculated by regressing item and scale values on the 91 unique three-digit occupation dummies

present in the data, and taking the square root of R-squared to calculate the multiple correlation

coefficient. These correlations are much larger than those involving personal education, ranging

from 0.51 to 0.75. This is not surprising given the greater fineness of the occupational categories

and the fact that the items were designed to measure the characteristics of jobs more directly than

the qualities of the people holding them.

    Taken together, the PDII task measures show sensible patterns of variation across education

and occupational groups, with some exceptions, and provide concrete information on what

people do on their jobs and the share of the workforce performing each task at various

intensities.


B. Comparing Job Task Measures between the PDII and O*Net


                                                                                                 18
     Table 5 presents correlations between composites of O*Net items and the corresponding

PDII items, measured both at the individual level (column 1) and averaged by detailed

occupation to match the level of O*Net's aggregation (column 2). In selecting O*Net scales for

comparison, we attempted to use only those O*Net variables that have a close relationship to the

underlying construct. With 234 question items arrayed across seven questionnaires, the O*Net

offers an abundance of candidate measures. We selected on average four O*Net measures for

each PDII measure, with a minimum of two O*Net variables used for each comparison and a

maximum of eight. Details of these variables are given in the Appendix.

     The correlations between PDII person-level responses and O*Net occupation-level mean

responses given in the first column of Table 5 are moderately strong for managing, problem

solving, and reading (>0.38), and even stronger for physical job demands and the Data and

Things scales (0.56 - 0.63). The math and People scale correlations are rather modest (<0.30), as

are measures of contacts with suppliers and students/trainees.

     Taking advantage of the detail of the O*Net questionnaire, we created two subscales for the

routine measures that are intended to capture multiple dimensions of routine tasks, following the

taxonomy of Autor, Levy and Murnane (2003). One scale measures routine physical (‘manual’)

activities such as tasks involving repetitive motion. The second measures routine cognitive tasks,

such as checking entries in a ledger.17 Notably, the PDII measure of routine activity correlates

positively with the O*Net routine manual scale (0.36) and negatively with the O*Net routine

cognitive scale (-0.22). Scrutiny of Appendix Table 1, summarizing PDII responses by
17
  The O*Net questions used to represent routine manual tasks are: repetitive physical tasks; keeping a pace set by
machinery or equipment; and time spent making repetitive motions. The routine cognitive questions are:
documenting/recording information; processing information; importance of continuous, repetitious physical
activities (like key entry) or mental activities (like checking entries in a ledger); and clerical knowledge.




                                                                                                                     19
occupation, provides some insight into this pattern. The major occupation for which workers are

most likely to report spending almost all of their time on routine activities is Transportation (63

percent). By contrast, Clerical workers are lower on self-reported routine activities (47 percent)

than workers in service occupations (48 percent).

     The clear contrast between the routine cognitive and routine manual scales is apparent in

Appendix Table 2, which tabulates standardized means of PDII and O*NET measure by

occupation. The major occupations with the highest level of routine cognitive tasks are clerical

occupations, management, and professional specialty occupations. Two of three of these

occupations score well below average for routine manual tasks, with clerical occupations scoring

close to average. By contrast, the major occupations with the highest levels of routine manual

tasks are production, transportation, and construction/repair occupations. All three are well

below the mean for routine cognitive tasks.

     These results suggest two inferences. First, the routine cognitive and routine manual task

groups in O*Net almost certainly comprise two distinct factors; treating them as a single

repetitiveness dimension (as done by the PDII survey) sacrifices important detail and, in the

process, places far greater weight on the manual than cognitive dimension of routine activity.

Second, the response pattern to the PDII routine activity question suggests that this item may not

be well worded.18 While the PDII question was intended to capture workers’ involvement in

tasks that are repetitive in the sense of being mechanistic, procedural and readily subject to

automation, it is apparent that many respondents understood the question to include activities

that are repetitive in the sense of being mundane or potentially tedious—such as driving a

18
   The precise wording of Q25b is, “How much of your workday (involves/involved) carrying out short, repetitive
tasks? (Almost all the time, more than half the time, less than half the time, almost none of the time.)”


                                                                                                            20
vehicle or serving customers. These tasks are not mechanistic or readily automatable in the sense

intended by the question. But they are likely viewed as repetitive by workers who perform them

on an ongoing basis. This probable flaw in the construction of the PDII question should be kept

in mind when interpreting subsequent regression results.19

     The second column of Table 5 gives occupation-level correlations between the O*Net

composite measures and the corresponding occupation-level means of the PDII variables for the

91 occupations represented in the data set. By construction, these correlations must be as large or

larger than the person-level correlations in the first column since the O*Net measures only vary

at the occupation level and thus cannot be correlated with within-occupation variation in

responses to the PDII measures. The magnitudes of the occupation-level correlations are in fact

quite high. Six are in the range 0.62-0.82, compared to none in first column.

     This pattern raises an important question: what is the appropriate level of measurement for

job tasks? Though O*Net measures are based upon person-level surveys of incumbent workers

or, for some scales, designated subject matter experts, the O*Net data are only released to

researchers as occupation-level measures, typically means. A potential virtue of the PDII survey

instrument is that it measures tasks at both the individual and (via aggregation) occupation level.

The value-added of using person–level task measures, alongside or instead of occupational

averages, is however unknown. One objective of the PDII survey effort is to study this question.

     Industrial psychologists typically view occupational titles as coherent, well-defined job

categories rather than merely as pragmatic classification tools, and hence tend to treat all within-

occupation variation as measurement error (Harvey 1991; Peterson, et al. 1999). While we

concur that some portion of within-occupation variation in survey measures of job task content
19
  In ongoing work, we are exploring task ‘automatability’ in detail by classifying respondents’ self-reports of
primary work activities in the PDII survey according to the automatability of these tasks.
                                                                                                                  21
will reflect measurement error, it appears unlikely that there is no meaningful variation in job

tasks within occupations. Casual empiricism suggests that it is commonplace for workers with

the same occupational title in a given firm to differ in their skills, responsibilities, work

activities, and pay.20

     A contribution of the PDII instrument is that it allows us to assess both the extent to which

task self-reports vary within-occupations and the degree to which this variation captures

substantive differences among workers rather than simply measurement error. To shed light on

these issues, Section V of the paper analyzes the relationship between individual earnings and

job tasks measured at both the individual and occupation level, in the latter case using both PDII

and O*Net measures.


IV. Explaining Differences in Job Tasks: The Roles of Human Capital, Occupation, and
    Demographic Characteristics

     Although almost all analyses of job tasks treat tasks as an occupation level construct, a virtue

of the PDII’s individual-level task measures is that they permit investigation of the variance of

job tasks within occupations and the degree to which this variation is systematically related to

worker as well as job attributes. This section analyzes the extent to which the tasks workers

perform on the job can be explained by their individual human capital, demographic attributes,

and the technical requirements of the job itself, proxied by detailed occupation dummies.




20
  This view is clearly untenable for the large, residual “not elsewhere classified” occupations, which are quite likely
heterogeneous and not really detailed occupations in their own right at all. Moreover, since the specificity and
boundaries of occupational classifications differ among survey instruments and are subject to regular revision, it is
not possible in practice that measured occupational categories correspond to distinct and unique job categories in the
economy.
                                                                                                                    22
      We focus on the three task composites: Data tasks, representing cognitive demands; People

tasks, representing customer service and managerial tasks; and Things, representing manual

demands and engagement with physical objects. We fit OLS models of the form:

(8)                                     ,

where the vector      includes human capital measures (education, potential experience, primary

language),      is a vector of demographic characteristics (race, ethnicity and sex), and            is a

vector of 91 occupation dummies corresponding to the full set of occupations contributing 5 or

more observations to our sample. 21 The reference group for this regression is white male high

school graduates who, implicitly, are employed in the ‘average’ occupation in the sample.

      Table 6a presents regressions results for the Data scale, which is standardized with mean zero

and variance one. Models (1) through (3) enter each set of independent variables separately and

models (4) through (7) enter them in varying combinations. Human capital variables—education,

potential experience, and Spanish language—explain approximately 19 percent of overall

variation in on-the-job use of Data tasks (column 1), whereas demographic characteristics—race,

ethnicity and sex—explain only about 2 percent of variation in this measure (column 2).

Nevertheless, female workers and those with limited English proficiency perform less

cognitively demanding work on average, with Data task demands about one-fifth of a standard-

deviation below that of white males.

      Column 3 shows that detailed occupation dummies explain a substantial proportion (48%) of

total variation in use of Data tasks. Even within occupations, however, human capital measures

are significant determinants of workers’ use of Data tasks. Holding occupation constant, workers


21
  The Spanish language dummy variable is equal to one for individuals who required the Spanish-language version
of the PDII questionnaire.
                                                                                                             23
with post-college education perform more cognitively demanding tasks, though the effect is

greatly diminished, while Spanish language workers perform less cognitively demanding tasks.

When all three sets of variables—human capital, demographic, and occupation—are entered

simultaneously, post-college education and Spanish language remain significant determinants of

Data tasks. Female-male and Black-white gaps in Data tasks are eliminated.

     In sum, the models suggest that a substantial proportion of cognitive task content is ‘hard

wired’ into occupations. Individual human capital remains relevant, however, for workers with a

graduate education and limited English proficiency even after accounting for occupation effects.

Notably, human capital differences do not explain the substantial female-male gap in the use of

cognitive tasks, but this difference is entirely accounted for by occupation. Thus, race and sex

exert an independent effect on occupational assignment that does not run through human capital

as measured in our data.22

     As was the case with cognitive tasks, estimates for interpersonal tasks in Table 6b show that

occupation explains a large proportion of the total variation in interpersonal job demands (33%),

while human capital explains a relatively small proportion (6%), with this latter fact mostly

reflecting the strong negative effects of limited English language proficiency. What differs

between cognitive and interpersonal tasks, however, is that the effects of education and race on

interpersonal tasks operate largely within rather than between occupations. Better educated

workers, limited English proficient workers, and Asian workers perform significantly fewer

interpersonal tasks than white high school males, and this pattern is equally pronounced whether

or not we condition on occupation.

22
  Bertrand, Goldin and Katz find that among U.S. workers obtaining an MBA from a top U.S. business school
between 1990 and 2006, substantial gender gaps in career advancement develop and accumulate within a few years
of graduation, reflecting differences in training prior to MBA completion, differences in career interruptions, and
differences in weekly hours (Bertrand, Goldin and Katz 2009).
                                                                                                                  24
   Women are more specialized in interpersonal tasks than males, consistent with expectations.

Notably, this pattern is entirely explained by differences in occupational specialization rather

than differences in specialization within occupations. Somewhat unexpectedly, blacks are more

likely to perform interpersonal tasks on their jobs than non-Hispanic whites, and this effect

remains robust across all models.

   Table 6c shows that both human capital and occupation account for a substantial proportion

of the variation in the Things scale, explaining 28 and 54 percent of variance respectively.

Demographic characteristics explain a much smaller proportion of variance, and these

relationships are not robust to inclusion of either human capital or occupation variables. There is

a strong negative relationship between education and physical task demands, and a strong

positive relationship between limited English proficiency and physical task demands. Though the

magnitude of these relationships is diminished by inclusion of occupation dummies—indicating

that these human capital variables affect physical task demands in part through occupational

choice—both attributes remain robust predictors of physical task demands within occupation.

   In net, these results are notable for revealing the structuring power of occupations as

determinants of job content. Indeed, occupation is the dominant measurable predictor of job

tasks in our data. Alongside this fact, measures of human capital—in particular, education and

English language proficiency—are in all cases significant predictors of within- as well as

between-occupation variation in job tasks. Human capital therefore plays a dual role in

determining workers’ job tasks, both allocating workers to occupations and influencing their job

tasks within occupations (though it is apparent that the occupation channel is quantitatively

larger). Race and sex are also strong predictors of workers’ job tasks across all categories. But

the relationship between race, sex and job tasks runs largely through occupational assignment;

                                                                                                    25
we find few systematic race or sex differences in cognitive or physical job task demands among

workers within the same occupation.


V.    Job Tasks and Wages: Descriptive Regressions

A. Predicting wages using the PDII measures

     To what extent does within-occupation variation in job tasks capture substantive differences

in job content rather than simply noise? In the absence of canonical, observational measures of

job tasks, we test whether self-reported variation in job tasks, net of occupation, human capital

and sex/gender, is a robust predictor of wages. If so, this would provide prima facie evidence that

self-reported task variation is likely to be informative about job content even within

occupations.23

     We explore the predictive relationship between tasks and wages in Table 7 by regressing

workers’ log hourly wages in the PDII on the Data, People, and Things scales, as well as human

capital, demographic background, and detailed occupation variables. As a benchmark, column

(1) presents a standard cross-sectional Mincerian wage regression of hourly wages on human

capital and demographic measures. All variables in this regression have the expected signs and

magnitudes, and the R-squared of this model is equal to 0.38, comparable to standard cross-

sectional models estimated using the Current Population Survey.

     Column (2) replaces the human capital and demographic controls from the Mincerian

regression with the three tasks scales. The task measures predict substantial wage differentials. A

one standard deviation increase in the cognitive task scale is associated with a 22 percent wage

premium, while a one standard deviation increase in physical tasks is associated with a 24

23
  An alternative interpretation would be that some omitted worker characteristic affects both wages and self-
reported jobs tasks but does not affect actual job tasks per se (or does not affect wages through tasks). We cannot
dismiss this possibility out of hand, though we doubt it is the primary explanation for the findings below.
                                                                                                                      26
percent wage penalty. Interpersonal task demands as measured in the PDII are associated with a

slight wage penalty of 6 percent. By themselves, the three task scales account for 33 percent of

the variation in log wages, which is only slightly less than the full set of human capital and

demographic measures. When 91 detailed occupation dummies are used in place of the task

measures (column 3), they account for 57 percent of wage variation.

   To what extent do these three sets of variables—human capital and demographics, job tasks,

and occupation—capture distinct sources of wage variance? Columns (4) and (6) show that the

task measures remain significant predictors conditional on either human capital and demographic

measures or on a full set of occupation dummies. Similarly, columns (4) and (5) indicate that the

human capital measures are also robust to inclusion of either task measures or occupation

variables. Finally, column (7) demonstrates that when all three clusters of variables are entered

simultaneously, each is a significant predictor of wages. Notably, comparing the Wald tests for

the joint significance of each group of variables (bottom row of Table 7), we find that the F-

statistic for the task measures is substantially larger than for the other two groups of variables.

   While statistical significance is not synonymous with economic significance, the economic

magnitude of the relationship between tasks and wages—even net of other variables—is sizable.

Within occupations, a one standard deviation increase in cognitive tasks predicts an 8 log point

wage premium. A one standard deviation increase in physical tasks predicts a 14 log point wage

penalty. When human capital and gender controls are also included (column 7), these effects are

diminished slightly but remain large and significant.

   One aspect of these results merits particular emphasis. The regressions in Tables 6a through

6c indicate that even within occupations, there are systematic differences in job tasks among

workers who differ according to human capital, race and gender. This pattern directly implies

                                                                                                      27
that job tasks must also be predictive of wages, since tasks are correlated with education,

demographics and occupation, and these variables are in turn predictors of wages. What is not

known from the prior results, however, is whether the residual variation in job tasks remaining

after netting out occupation, education, race and sex is also predictive of wages. Column (7) of

Table 7 reveals that it is. Thus, we read this evidence as plainly supporting the hypothesis that

self-reported job tasks capture substantive differences in job activities among workers both

within and between occupations.


B. Do PDII Task Measures Add Value to O*Net Task Measures?

     One further means to assess the value-added of the individual-level PDII measures is to

compare their predictive power with the corresponding O*Net measures. Table 8 performs this

comparison. The first column repeats the simple regression of wages on the Data, People, and

Things scales used in the prior table. In this case, we cluster standard errors at the occupation

rather than person level since we will also be using occupation-level means of PDI and O*Net

variables as predictors.

     In column (2), we replace the individual-level scales with PDII occupational means,

following the O*Net approach.24 These occupation-level scales are also highly significant

predictors of earnings. When both person- and occupation-level task measures are entered

simultaneously (column 3), both sets of variables remain highly significant, and this remains true

when human capital and demographic controls are added to the model.25 Notably, the person-


24
  To avoid confounding the predictive power of occupational averages with the direct correlation between a
worker’s own tasks and wages, the O*Net occupational mean assigned to each observation is a ‘leave-out’ mean,
equal to the grand mean of the task measure for all workers in the occupation except for the current worker. Thus,
the leave-out mean of each task measure differs very slightly for each worker in the sample.
25
  Demographic variables are included in Table 8 in all columns that include human capital measures, but we do not
tabulate them to conserve space.
                                                                                                                     28
level and occupation-level relationships between job tasks and wages are similar in magnitude to

one another, a hypothesis that we formally test and accept in the third to final row of the table.

Thus, the within-occupation relationship between tasks and wages is indistinguishable from the

between-occupation relationship.26 Given that measurement error in tasks is greater at the person

than the occupation level, this pattern argues strongly that the person-level tasks measures are

quite informative.

     In the remaining columns of Table 8, we introduce the O*Net measures and compare their

performance with the PDII scales. Column (5) shows that the standardized O*Net Data scale has

a stronger effect on wages (0.38) than the parallel PDII Data scale calculated at the occupational

level (0.23). But when both O*NET and PDII occupation-level scales are included in column (7),

the PDII effect is larger and more precisely estimated. Notably, neither the O*Net People nor

Things scales has a significant effect on wages. Moreover, the PDII Data variables measured at

both the individual and occupational levels remain largely robust as a group to the inclusion of

all additional predictors, while all O*Net measures become insignificant in columns (7) through

(9) when PDII occupation-level measures are included.27

     This exercise demonstrates that the PDII task measures compare favorably with O*Net

occupation-level measures as a predictor of worker-level outcomes, despite the fact that the

O*Net measures are derived from much larger samples. Mean PDII scores could potentially be

usefully merged onto other data sets that lack detailed information about the task content of jobs,

such as the Current Population Survey. But the results in Tables 7 and 8 underscore that this

26
  The table reports tests of the joint hypothesis that the coefficient of each of the three person-level task measures is
equal to the corresponding occupation-level measure. We further test these restrictions for each task measure
separately, and readily accept the hypothesis in all cases. The closest any test comes to rejecting the null is in
column (3), where equality of the person- and occupation-level Things measure is accepted at the 9 percent level.
27
  We again accept the hypothesis of the joint equality of the PDII person and occupation level measures in column
(9).
                                                                                                                      29
procedure would discard meaningful variation in job tasks that occurs within rather than between

occupations. Indeed, the main takeaway of these wage models is that, relative to standard,

occupation-level measures of job tasks, person-level task measures appear to add substantial

value in explaining worker outcomes


VI. Job Tasks and Wages: Testing the Model’s Predictions

      In this final section, we provide an exploratory test of the primary implication of the

conceptual model, which is that the returns to the task categories must negatively covary within

occupations.28 To implement this test, we first estimate separately by occupation the following

OLS regression of workers’ hourly wages on their task inputs:

(9)                                                                  .

The explanatory variables in this model are the three PDII composite task measures used in

earlier tables. As discussed above, for an occupation to be included in this exercise, it must

contribute at least five wage observations to the PDII data set, yielding a sample of 91

occupations and 928 observations.29

      Using the parameters obtained from estimating equation (9), we perform bivariate

regressions of the elements of                              on one another, in all cases weighting by the

sum of worker weights within an occupation:


(10)




28
  To simplify terminology but with no loss of generality, we also refer to an occupation’s wage regression intercept
as a ‘task return.’
29
  There are four parameters to be estimated, and hence at least five observations are required to estimate the
parameters plus standard errors. It is for this reason that our entire analysis is limited to occupations with five-plus
observations.
                                                                                                                       30
The conceptual framework predicts that the point estimates for                     will generally be negative.

       Panel A of Table 9 presents estimates of equation (10). In three of six cases, the bivariate

relationships are negative, and two of these estimates are highly negative. By contrast, none of

the three positive relationships is significant at the 5 percent level. Though we did not have

strong priors on the relationships among task returns, the pattern of results accords with

conventional notions about occupational specialization. Occupations that most reward physical

tasks have comparatively low returns to analytical tasks and vice versa, and occupations that

most reward analytical tasks have comparatively low returns to interpersonal tasks and vice

versa.

       There are of course numerous limitations to this procedure. One such limitation is that there

is substantial imprecision in estimates of task returns due to the fact that the occupation-level

regressions from which these estimates are drawn have a very small number of data points in

most cases.30 To address this concern, we re-estimated equation (10) using median regressions,

which are substantially more robust to outliers than OLS regressions. These median regression

models, found in panel B of Table 9, strongly reinforce the OLS results. Four of six point

estimates obtained from the median regressions are negative, and as before, two are negative and

significant. Precision is substantially higher for these models, however, with t-ratios of 3.9 and

7.2, respectively, for the physical-analytical and analytical-interpersonal regressions. By contrast,

the two positive point estimates are very far from significance. These median regressions

demonstrate that the OLS results are not driven by outliers—in fact, just the opposite.

       Though these patterns are supportive of the model, substantial uncertainties remain. A first is

that the estimation procedure applied to equation (9) implicitly assumes that there is no self-

30
     The mean number of observations per occupation is 10.2 and the median is 8.
                                                                                                            31
selection into occupations based upon unobserved characteristics, specifically                  in equation (2).

If in fact, the fixed, unobserved, person-level component of productivity is correlated with

occupational choice, this would bias estimates of the intercept terms,                 , in the occupation-

level regressions.

     A second limitation is that our procedure implicitly assumes that the three task measures used

for the estimation comprise exhaustive measures of the tasks rewarded within occupations. If this

strong assumption is not met, and, furthermore, the omitted tasks are correlated with the included

task measures, we will again obtain biased estimates of                               , where the direction of

the bias is not ex ante ascertainable.

     Finally, the imprecision inherent in the estimation prevents us from applying even stronger

tests of the conceptual apparatus. Taken literally, the model implies that each worker is

employed in the occupation that provides the highest wage given her task endowment. We

should accordingly be able to compare the calculated counterfactual wage (based upon

                    ) that each worker would have received in all possible occupations to confirm

that no worker could be made better off by switching occupations. Given, as above, the

imprecision in estimates of                         , and moreover, the likelihood that our estimation

procedure captures only a subset of relevant tasks, this test would be trivially rejected.31


VII. Conclusions


31
  An additional strict implication of the model that is not supported by the estimates is that returns to each task
should be positive in all occupations. Though we would of course expect some point estimates to be negative simply
due to sampling variability, we suspect that the issue is somewhat deeper. Of greatest concern is that the estimated
returns to physical tasks are negative in the majority of occupations. This suggests, plausibly, that there is
unobserved negative selection of low-skilled workers into occupations that are intensive in physical tasks. Other
interpretations are possible, however, including compensating differentials, incomplete measurement of tasks, and
non-competitive wage setting between occupations.
                                                                                                                 32
   This paper makes three contributions to the expanding theoretical and empirical literature

that employs job tasks as a building block for conceptualizing and quantifying job skill demands.

Drawing on original, representative survey data containing detailed measures of workers’ job

tasks, along with standard demographic and wage measures, we document that job tasks vary

substantially within (as well as between) occupations and we establish that variation in job tasks

among workers in the same occupations is systematically related to their race, gender and

English-language proficiency. The most pronounced and systematic differences in job task

activity are found for Spanish language speakers, who perform substantially fewer analytic and

interpersonal tasks and substantially more repetitive physical and cognitive tasks than equally

educated workers in the same occupations. We also find that black workers perform a

disproportionate number of interpersonal tasks. Notably, females perform substantially fewer

analytic tasks and substantially more interpersonal and routine tasks than equally educated

males, a pattern that is driven by differences in occupational category. In fact, we find no

significant differences in average task input between males and females once we condition on a

full set of occupation effects.

   The second contribution of the paper is to explore the degree to which person-level variation

in job tasks is a robust predictor of wages. While it would be hypothetically possible that the

systematic differences in self-reported job tasks that we find between demographic groups

primarily reflect cultural differences in response patterns rather than realized differences in job

tasks, the wage analysis suggests that this is not the case. Both between and within occupational,

demographic and education groups, the tasks that workers perform on the job are significant

predictors of their hourly wages. Notably, this predictive power is maintained when occupation-

level job task measures from O*Net and the PDII survey are also included in regression models.

                                                                                                      33
Thus, job task measures effectively distinguish normally unobserved attributes of workers and

jobs that vary within occupational, demographic and education groups.

   The third contribution of the paper is to offer a conceptual framework that makes explicit the

causal links between workers’ human capital endowments, their occupation, the tasks that they

perform on the job, and the wages they earn. The simple observation that motivates our approach

is that, while workers can hold multiple jobs, they can supply tasks to only one job at a time. The

indivisible bundling of tasks within jobs means that the productivity of particular task inputs will

not necessarily be equated across jobs—and so the ‘law of one price’ will not generally apply to

the market rewards to job tasks.

   We propose instead a high-dimensional Roy model in which the allocation of workers to

tasks is driven by individuals self-selecting into occupations to maximize their incomes given

their skill endowments. While this framework is primarily intended to build intuition rather than

guide empirical analysis, our exploratory empirical analysis provides some initial support for the

conceptual model. In particular, we find that estimated ‘returns to tasks’ negatively covary

within occupations, which is a necessary condition for self-selection to occur; absent this

negative covariance, a single occupation might conceivably offer the highest return to all tasks,

and thus attract the entire labor force. We believe that further refinement and rigorous testing of

this conceptual and empirical approach is a promising avenue for future study.

The correlations for routineness show association of the
single PDII routine task measure with O*NET's routine
manual (line 5a) and routine cognitive (line 5b) items. The
PDII's physical task item correlates more strongly with both
the O*NET routine manual measure (0.45) and routine
cognitive measure (-0.52). The O*NET math measure also
correlates more strongly with the PDII problem solving
(0.39) and reading (0.34) measures than the PDII math
item.

n = 91. Each column in each panel corresponds to a separate regression (OLS or
Median) of the indicated coefficient on the tabulated coefficients plus an intercept.
Standard errors are given in parentheses. Models are weighted by the sum of PDII
sampling weights in each occupation.

Coefficients used as regressions variables above are obtained from person-level
regressions of log hourly wages on standardized PDII task input measures (data,
people and things) and an intercept, where regressions are performed separately
within each PDII occcupation that contains at least 5 observations (91 occupations
total). Regressions are weighted by sum of PDII sampling weights in each occupation.
Means and SD's of the variables used in these models are: b(data) 0.09 (0.46); bpepl -
0.02 (0.41); b(things) -0.19 (0.38); intercept 2.90 (0.60).
