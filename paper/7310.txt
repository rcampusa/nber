What Inventory Behavior Tells Us about Business Cycles

        Manufacturers’ finished goods inventories move less than shipments over the business cycle. We
argue that this requires marginal cost to be more procyclical than is conventionally measured. We construct,
for six manufacturing industries, alternative measures of marginal cost that attribute high-frequency
productivity shocks to procyclical work effort, and find that they are much more successful in accounting
for inventory behavior. The difference is attributable to cyclicality in the shadow price of labor, not to
diminishing returns—in fact, parametric evidence suggests that the short-run slope of marginal cost is close
to zero for five of the six industries. Moreover, while our measures of marginal cost are procyclical relative
to output price, they are too persistent for intertemporal substitution to be important. We conclude that
countercyclical markups are chiefly responsible for the sluggish response of inventory stocks over the cycle.

        Researchers have studied inventory behavior because it provides clues to the nature of

business cycles. Many have viewed the procyclical behavior of inventory investment as evidence

that costs of producing are lower in an expansion because it suggests that firms bunch

production more than is necessary to match the fluctuations in sales. If short-run marginal cost

curves were fixed and upward sloping (the argument goes), firms would smooth production

relative to sales, making inventory investment countercyclical.1 Countercyclical marginal cost in

turn is viewed as evidence for procyclical technology shocks, increasing returns, or positive

externalities.2

        We claim that this reasoning is false. The argument outlined above overlooks changes in

the shadow value of inventories, which we argue increases with expected sales.3 We propose a

model in which finished goods inventories facilitate salesÆ The model implies that, holding prices

fixed, inventories should vary in proportion to anticipated sales, as in fact they do in the long

run. Over the business cycle, however, the ratio of sales to stocks is highly persistent and

procyclical, which suggests that inventory stocks behave sluggishly in the short run. This

seemingly paradoxical feature of inventory behavior—the sluggish adjustment of stocks even to

1 See West (1985), Blinder (1986), and Fair (1989) for evidence on production volatility and the cyclical
behavior of inventory investment.

2 West (1991) explicitly uses inventory behavior to decompose the sources of cyclical fluctuations into cost and
demand shocks. Eichenbaum (1989) introduces unobserved cost shocks that generate simultaneous expansions
in production and inventory investment. Ramey (1991) estimates a downward sloping short-run marginal cost
function, which of course reverses the production-smoothing prediction. See also Hall (1991). Cooper and
Haltiwanger (1992) adopt a nonconvex technology on the basis of observations about inventory behavior.
Others (e.g., Gertler and Gilchrist, 1993, Kashyap, Lamont, and Stein, 1994) argue that credit market
imperfections--essentially countercyclical inventory holding costs for some firms--are responsible for what is
termed ‘‘excess volatility’’ in inventory investment.

3 Pindyck (1994) makes a related point regarding what he calls the “convenience yield” of inventories. A
number of papers in the inventory literature do include a target inventory-sales ratio as part of a more general
cost function to similarly generate a procyclical inventory demand. Many of these papers, for example
Blanchard (1983), West (1986), Krane and Braun (1991), Kashyap and Wilcox (1993), and Durlauf and
Maccini (1995), estimate upward-sloping marginal cost in the presence of procyclical inventory investment.
This appears consistent with our evidence that marginal cost is procyclical. West (1991) demonstrates that the
estimated importance of cost versus demand shocks in output fluctuations is very dependent on the size of the
target inventory-sales ratio.

relatively small changes in targets—has been noted by researchers going back at least to

Feldstein and Auerbach (1976).

        Figure 1 plots the monthly ratio of sales (shipments) to the sum of beginning-of-period

finished goods inventories plus production (what we define as the “stock available for sale”) in

aggregate manufacturing for 1959 through 1997, together with production.                        Production is

detrended using a Hodrick-Prescott (H-P) filter. The sales-stock ratio decreases dramatically in

each recession, typically by 5 to 10 percent. Note that these decreases do not simply reflect

transitory sales surprises, but are highly persistent for the duration of each recession. Replacing

sales with forecasted sales generates a very similar picture. The correlation between the two

series in the figure is 0.675. In the empirical work below we examine data for six two-digit

manufacturing industries that produce primarily to stock. These data reinforce the picture from

aggregate data in Figure 1—inventories fail to keep up with sales over the business cycle. 4

        Because in the long run inventories do track sales one for one, we find the real puzzle to

be why inventory investment is not more procyclical.              Inventories sell with predictably higher

probability at peaks, suggesting that—ceteris paribus—firms should add more inventories in

booms so as to equate the ratios (and hence the “returns”) over time. Our model shows that this

striking fact implies that in booms marginal cost must be high relative to either (1) discounted

future marginal cost; or (2) the price of output.                 The former chokes off intertemporal

substitution of production, while the latter implies a relatively small payoff from additional sales.

        We initially consider the assumption that markups are constant, which allows us to

measure expected movements in marginal cost by expected movements in price. For sales to

increase relative to inventories in an expansion then requires that the rate of expected price

increase be less than the interest rate. This is sharply rejected for the six industries we study—in

fact the opposite is true. We turn then to the task of measuring marginal cost separately from



4 We find similar results for finished goods inventories and works-in-process for new housing construction and
for finished goods inventories in wholesale and retail trade.

output prices. When we measure marginal cost based on inputs and factor prices, however, we

do not find high marginal cost in booms, or countercyclical markups, because input prices are

less procyclical than productivity. But when we allow for procyclical factor utilization that

affects the shadow cost of labor, we find countercyclical markups; these countercyclical markups

are then reflected in countercyclical optimal inventory holdings relative to expected sales. We

find little reason for firms to engage in the standard production or cost-smoothing envisioned in

conventional inventory models. Such intertemporal substitution requires forecastable changes in

marginal cost relative to interest rates that we cannot find in the data. The last finding is

important given that the linear-quadratic inventory model—by far the most commonly employed

model of inventory behavior—imposes a constant target sales-stock relationship and requires

that persistent deviations from that target be the result of intertemporal substitution.

        We find the joint behavior of inventories, prices, and productivity consistent with the

following view of business cycles:       Real marginal cost is procyclical, but changes are not

sufficiently predictable relative to real interest rates to give rise to intertemporal substitution.

The rise in real marginal cost during an expansion is equivalent to a decline in the markup; it

damps production by reducing optimal inventory holdings relative to expected sales. Thus the

salient features of inventory behavior are not the result of persistent deviations from a fixed

target sales-stock ratio; rather, the target ratio itself varies systematically over the cycle due to

countercyclical markups.



                                II. The Demand for Inventories


A. A Firm’s Problem

       We examine the production to inventory decision for a representative producer, relying

on little more than the following elements: Profit maximization, a production function, and an

inventory technology that is specified to reflect the fact that inventory-sales ratios appear to be

independent of scale (which we document below). To achieve the latter, we assume that finished


                                                 3
inventories are productive in generating greater sales at a given price (see Kahn, 1987, 1992).

Related approaches in the literature include Kydland and Prescott (1982), Christiano (1988), and

Ramey (1989), who introduce inventories as a factor of production. Inventory models that

incorporate a target inventory-sales ratio, or that recognize stockouts, create a demand for

inventories in addition to any value for production smoothing.

         A producer maximizes expected present-discounted profits according to

5 In the empirical work we incorporate a storage cost for inventories. We let the cost of storing a unit from

nonproduction labor, 6> , and capital, 5> . The value-added production function has returns to

scale # , potentially greater than one. Material inputs are proportional to output as dictated by a

vector of per unit material requirements, -. Although we do not treat elements of - as choice

variables, in the empirical work we allow for low-frequency movements in -. (For convenience

we write - without a time subscript.)

       Constraint (333) depicts the dependence of sales on finished inventories. For a given

price, a producer views its sales as increasing with an elasticity of 9 with respect to its available

stock, where ! ì 9 ì ". This approach is consistent, for example, with a competitive market

that allows for the possibility of stockouts (e.g., Kahn, 1987, Thurlow, 1995). This corresponds

to the case 9 é ", because a competitive firm can sell as much as it wants up to +> . At the other

extreme,   9 é ! represents a pure cost-smoothing modelÇ where the firm decouples the timing of
production from sales. More generally, one can view the stock as an aggregate of similar goods

of different sizes, colors, locations, and the like. A larger stock in turn facilitates matching with

potential purchasers, who arrive with preferences for a specific type of good, but the marginal

benefit of this diminishes in + relative to expected sales. This corresponds to the intermediate

case of 9 between 0 and 1. Pindyck (1994) provides evidence for a similar functional form.

       The data strongly suggest that firms do value inventories beyond their role in varying

production relative to sales. We typically observe that firms hold stocks of finished inventories

that are the equivalent of one to three months’ worth of sales. But under a pure production

smoothing model it is difficult to even rationalize systematically positive holdings.

       We also allow the demand for the producer to move proportionately with a stochastic

function .> ¸:> ¹. Again, this is consistent with a perfectly competitive market in which charging a

price below the market price yields sales equal to +> and charging a price above market clearing

implies zero sales. The function .> ¸:> ¹ will more generally depend on total market demand and

available supply. All we require is that the impact of the firm’s stock +> be captured by the
                                9
separate multiplicative term +> . In the absence of perfect competition, firms maximize the

objective in (1) with respect to a choice of price as well as output. We focus, however, on the

                                                 5
choice of output given that price. From constraint (i) expanding production translates directly

into a higher stock available. Given price, constraint (iii) then dictates how that extra stock

available translates into greater sales versus greater inventory for the following period.


B. The First-Order Condition for Inventory Investment

        In a pure production smoothing model of inventories a firm’s expected discounted costs,

at an optimum, are not affected by marginally increasing current production in conjunction with

decreasing subsequent production. Our firms face a similar dynamic first-order condition, but

with the additional consideration of the marginal impact of the stock on expected sales. For our

firms the appropriate perturbation is producing one more unit during >, adding that unit to the

stock available for sale, and then producing less at >  " to the extent that the extra unit for sale

during > fails to generate an additional sale. This yields the first-order condition

Here 7> is the percent markup of price in > over discounted marginal cost in >  ". We refer to

this as the markup because          ">" ->"   is the opportunity cost of selling a unit at date >. For

9  !,   I> ¸7> ¹  ! even under competition and zero profits, as firms require an expected
markup to rationalize the costs of inventory holdings. Suppose we denote an aggregate output

price deflator by T> . Note that the term ">" ->" ¶-> , the growth rate of nominal marginal cost

relative to a nominal interest rate, is equivalent to the growth rate of real marginal cost, -> ¶T>

relative to the real interest rate defined net of the rate of inflation in T> .

         In a pure production smoothing model (9 é !), the discounted expected growth of

marginal cost would always equal 1. That is, nominal marginal cost would always be expected

to grow at the nominal interest rate; otherwise it would be profitable to shift production

intertemporally. But with 9  ! the desire to smooth costs is balanced against the desire to have

+> track expected sales multiplied by the markup.

         If I> ¸">" ->" ¹¶-> and 7> were both constant through time, then I> ¸=> ¹¶+> would be

constant, i.e. all predictable movements in sales would be matched by proportional movements in

the stock available.6 To generate persistent and systematic procyclical movements in the ratio of

sales to inventory such as we see in the data therefore requires either:

                      1.   Procyclical marginal cost, judged relative to I> [">" ->" »
                      2.   A countercyclical markup.

Suppose for the moment that the markup were constant. Then we would observe high expected

sales relative to +> only if marginal cost is high relative to expected next period’s marginal cost,

i.e.   the firm would let +> fall short of its target only to the extent that marginal cost is

temporarily high. Thus although firms systematically accumulate inventories during expansions,

the strong procyclicality of => ¶+> requires, under a constant markup, that marginal cost be

                                                                                            <$

interest rate equalling V minus the inflation rate in marginal cost and $ is the rate of storage cost.

temporarily high in expansions—that is, high relative to next period's discounted cost. The

impetus for marginal cost to be temporarily high could be internal (i.e. from a movement along

an upward sloping marginal cost curve), or external through input prices.7 We will refer to this

motive for procyclical => ¶+> as “intertemporal substitution.”

         Alternatively, suppose that I> ¸">" ->" ¹¶-> does not vary, i.e., discounted marginal cost

is a random walk (possibly with drift). Then we would observe high expected sales relative to +>

only if the markup is low, or, equivalently, real marginal cost (marginal cost relative to output

price) is high. The return on holding inventories is largely their ability to generate sales; so a

lower markup requires a higher I> ¸=> ¹¶+> to yield the same return. The strong procyclicality we

document for => ¶+> would, in the absence of an intertemporal substitution motive, thus require

countercyclical markups.

         We can justify the functional form in constraint ¸333¹ above by examining the low

frequency behavior of => ¶+> , where we can arguably neglect movements in ">" ->" ¶-> and 7> .

The model then yields a constant desired ratio of expected sales to stock available (akin to the

inverse of the usual inventory-sales ratio) because sales, conditional on price, are a power

function of the available stock. This implies an absence of scale effects; in other words, the

steady-state =¶+ ratio should be independent of the size of the industry or firm.

         Some evidence can be gleaned from observing how the ratio => ¶+> changes over time in

industries with substantial growth. Below we examine in detail the six manufacturing industries

tobacco, apparel, lumber, chemicals, petroleum, and rubber. For all but tobacco, sales increased

by 50 percent or more from 1959 to 1997. Figure 2 presents the behavior of => ¶+> for each

industry for that period. None of the six industries display large long-run movements in the

ratio, even when the level of => changes considerably. The largest such movements are for


7 This also suggests little role for credit market imperfections in accounting for the cyclical behavior of
inventories. To account for the data, credit constraints would need to bind in expansions, thereby driving up
current marginal cost relative to discounted future marginal cost (for example, by increasing the effective
interest rate, thereby reducing ">" ). This is opposite the scenario emphasized by Gertler and Gilchrist (1993),
Kashyap, Lamont, and Stein (1994), and others.

apparel, where the ratio declines by about 25 percent, and in rubber, where it rises by about 20

percent. Clearly there are no systematic scale effects on => ¶+> , though there are some secular

changes in some industries.

         The model’s implication that stock available is proportional to expected sales is also

supported by cross-sectional evidence. Kahn (1992) reports average inventory-sales ratios and

sales across divisions of U.S. automobile firms. These data show no tendency for the ratio to be

related to the size of the division, either within or across firms. Gertler and Gilchrist (1993)

present inventory-sales ratios for manufacturing by firm size, with size defined by firm assets.

Their data similarly show little relation between size and inventory-sales ratio. If anything, larger

firms have higher inventory-sales ratios. We conclude that scale effects do not appear to be a

promising explanation for the cyclical behavior of => ¶+> .8


C. Relation to the Linear-Quadratic Model

         Much of the inventory literature estimates linear-quadratic cost-function parameters (e.g.

West, 1986, Eichenbaum, 1989, or Ramey, 1991). A typical specification of the single-period

cost function is9
                                        <        3

where, as before, C> , +> , and => are output, stock available, and sales during >. The last term

multiplying C> represents input costs including           -=>   (material inputs), labor input, and a general

cost shock    % (which could be correlated with output), all expressed in real terms.                  The slope of


8 In a previous version (available as Rochester Center for Economic Research Working Paper #428, September
                                                                               _
1996) we allow for the more general functional form st _equal to dt (pt )[at  a ]9 , implying st increases with at
only after the available stock reaches a threshold value a. This generates a scale effect in inventory holdings,
providing another possible explanation for the_ failure of inventories to keep pace with sales over the business
cycle. Our estimates for the threshold term a were typically less that 20 percent of the average size of at ; and its
introduction did not significantly affect other estimated results.

9 A number of papers include a cost of changing output. Its exclusion here is simply for convenience. Measures
for cost shocks, such as wage changes, are also sometimes included (e.g., Ramey, 1991, or Durlauf and Maccini,
1995).


                                                         9
marginal cost (which holds prices fixed) is governed by the parameter                <, whereas the cyclical
behavior of marginal cost depends in addition on the behavior of                -=>  0A>  %> .     Note that

.  ! allows for a target => ¶+> ratio.
        The first-order condition for minimizing the present discounted value of costs based on

this cost function is

                                  I> ¾3¸+>  .=> ¹  ¸" ->"  -> ¹¿ é !.

where   " is the discount factor and marginal cost ->  <C>  -=>  0A>  %> .               Thus +> deviates

from .=> only to the extent that -> is expected to deviate from " ->" . Functional form aside, this

condition is very similar to our condition (2). The crucial difference is that here                 .   is just a

parameter; whereas the term in (2) that corresponds to               .   is proportional to a time-varying

markup.

        Many researchers (e.g., Blinder, 1985, Fair, 1989) have focused on the relative volatility

of production and sales or, relatedly, on explaining why inventory investment is procyclical. But

if .  !, procyclical inventory investment is perfectly consistent with marginal cost being either

procyclical or countercyclical (West, 1986). On the other hand, under this linear-quadratic

model, it can only be optimal for a firm systematically to have a high => ¶+> ratio when sales are

high if its marginal cost is relatively high in those periods. Otherwise costs could be reduced by

bunching production in periods with high sales, thereby generating a procyclical ratio.10 Thus
the cyclical behavior of => ¶+> is more revealing than the cyclical behavior of the stock alone.

What needs explaining, therefore, is not why inventory investment is so procyclical, but rather

why it is not more procyclical, i.e. why +> fails to keep up with => over the cycle.

        Our approach differs substantially from the linear-quadratic literature in at least two

ways. First, we exploit the production function to measure marginal cost directly in terms of

observables and parameters of the underlying production technology. This measure allows not


10 For example, in the absence of cyclical cost shocks, one can prove by a variance bounds argument similar to
that of West (1986) that if => ¶+> is procyclical then < must be positive.


                                                      10
only for variation in wages, the cost of capital, and other inputs, but also potentially for

measurable shocks to productivity. Second, and more important, our model explicitly considers

the revenue side of the firm’s maximization problem. This allows us to account for variation in

target inventory holdings caused by variation in markups. In our model the return on finished

inventory is proportional to the markup; so sales relative to stock available should move

inversely with the markup. The standard specification of the linear-quadratic model does not

permit variation in     .,   and therefore requires that all persistent deviations of inventories from

their target be the result of intertemporal substitution.11

          In fact, we find that movements in the markup (and, hence, movements in the desired =¶+

ratio) are the dominant explanation for the procyclical behavior of => ¶+> in five of the six

industries we examine. Failure to allow for a cyclical markup represents a potentially serious

misspecification in the linear-quadratic model, as its effects will be confounded with other

cyclical variables in the model, biasing the parameter estimates. This could account for the

rather mixed success of the linear-quadratic model, and for why estimates of the slope of

marginal cost in the linear-quadratic model have varied so much in the literature.12

          The tobacco industry provides an excellent case study to illustrate the importance of the

markup. The price of tobacco products rose very dramatically from 1984 to 1993. Figure 3

shows the behavior of the producer price for tobacco relative to the general PPI as well as the

ratio of sales to stock available. The relative price doubled. Although material costs in tobacco

rose during this period, the relative price change largely reflected a rise in price markup (Howell

et al., 1994). Consistent with the model, the ratio => ¶+> fell over the same period by about 15


11 This distinction between a persistently varying target and persistent deviations from a fixed target dates back
to Feldstein and Auerbach (1976). They argued that persistent deviations from a fixed target were inconsistent
with the apparent ease with which firms could and did adjust inventory stocks to sales surprises.

12 For example, Ramey (1991) estimates downward-sloping marginal cost, while others find it upward sloping
(e.g., Blanchard, 1983, West, 1986, Krane and Braun, 1991, Kashyap and Wilcox, 1993, and Durlauf and
Maccini, 1995). The linear-quadratic model may also be misspecified in functional form. This is suggested by
Pindyck (1994), who finds evidence of a convex “marginal convenience yield” of inventories consistent with our
specification with 9  "Æ

percent. More striking is what occurred in 1993. During one month, August 1993, the price of

tobacco products fell by 25 percent, apparently reflecting a breakdown in collusion (see Figure

3). Within 3 months the ratio => ¶+> rose dramatically, as predicted by the model, by at least 25

percent. Whereas the linear-quadratic model is silent on these large movements in inventory-

sales ratios, the model in this paper contains a ready explanation.




                                 III. Empirical Implementation



A. The Case of a Constant Markup

       Inventory investment is closely related to variations in marginal cost.       A transitory

decrease in marginal cost motivates firms to produce now, accumulating inventory. A higher

markup of price over marginal cost also motivates firms to accumulate inventory. For this

reason, much of our empirical work is directed at the behavior of marginal cost. But first we

consider the case of a constant markup. This not only eliminates markup changes as a factor,

but also implies that intertemporal cost variations can be measured simply by variations in price.

This clearly holds regardless of how we specify the production function or costs of production in

(1).

       The expected opportunity cost of selling a unit of inventory is equal to I>+ [">" ->" ].

I>+ denotes the expectations operator conditioned on information available at the time of sales
during t. In addition to variables incorporated in I> , we assume it includes => and :> . Assuming

a constant markup 7 therefore implies that :> equals ¸"  7¹I>+ [">" ->" ]. Substituting :>

appropriately for discounted future cost in the firm’s first-order condition (2), taking

expectations, and rearranging yields

                                       >" :>

                                                 "

Equation (3) predicts strong procyclical movements in the ratio => ¶+> only if there are opposite

movements in => ¶+> . Based on this striking result, we consequently drop the assumption of a

constant markup and proceed to measure movements in marginal cost and markups.


B. Measuring Marginal Cost of Production

       From the firm’s problem (1), marginal cost -> equals               -=>  ->@ ; where =>   is the price of

materials,   -=>   the cost of materials per unit of output, and ->@ the marginal cost of labor and

capital required to produce a unit of output from those materials.

       Let A> denote the wage for marginally increasing production labor.                           Given that
production labor enters as a power function in technology in (1), the marginal cost of value
          " > >A8
added is #! C> , which is proportional to the wage divided by production workers’ labor

productivity. This result allows for technology shocks, the impact of which appear through

output. A value for     #! equal to labor’s share in revenue corresponds to marginal cost equal to
price. Higher values for #! are associated with lower marginal cost.

       Marginal cost then depends on the observables: output C> , materials cost -=> , production

hours 8> , and the production labor wage A> ; and it depends on the parameter combination                   #!Æ
We have

Part 2 of the appendix constructs a measure of ! based on observable variables (conditional on a

profit rate), which turns out to be

storage cost $ . As explained in the appendix,   ' adjusts the price of output for the average cost
of holding inventories. (Note that =¶+ é " implies ' é ".) Equation (5) implicitly assumes that

firms do not earn pure economic profits. The appendix treats the more general case with pure

profits. (It also discusses evidence for a small profit rate.) In the empirical work we consider

the robustness of results to profit rates as high as 10 percent of costs.

       In estimating first-order condition (2) we proceed as follows. Together, equations (4)

and (5) express marginal cost in terms of observables and the parameter # . We substitute this

expression for marginal cost into (2), yielding an equation that depends on observables and the

two parameters we estimate, # and 9.

       We will describe the data in greater detail below in Section IV. Part 1 of the appendix

describes how we construct monthly indices of materials cost,       -=> , for our six industries.   We

now consider how to measure the price of labor.



C. Measuring the Marginal Price of Labor Input

       It is standard practice to measure the price of production labor by average hourly

earnings for production workers. We depart from this practice by considering a competing

measure that allows for the possibility that average hourly earnings do not reflect true variations

in the price of labor, but rather are smoothed relative to labor's effective price. (See Hall, 1980.)

Specifically, we allow for procyclical factor utilization that drives a cyclical wedge between the

effective or true cost of labor and average hourly earnings because in booms workers transitorily

boost efforts without contemporaneous increases in measured average hourly earnings.

       Total factor productivity is markedly procyclical for most manufacturing industries. One

interpretation for this finding is that factors are utilized more intensively in booms, with these

movements in utilization not captured in the measured cyclicality of inputs (e.g., Solow, 1973).


                                                 14

where B> denotes the effort or exertion per hour of labor. We treat the choice of B> as common

for production and nonproduction workers.

        We assume firms choose B> subject to the constraint that working labor more intensively

requires higher wages as a compensating differential (as in Becker, 1985).             Therefore the

effective hourly production worker wage is a function of B> , A> ¸B> ¹, and similarly for the wages

of nonproduction workers. If data on wages capture the contemporaneous impact of xt on

required wages then the measure for marginal cost in equation (4) remains correct. Higher

factor utilization increases labor productivity, but at the same time increases the price of labor.

                                                                                        – .
        Our concern is that hourly wages may reflect a typical level of effort, say A> ¸B¹

          We estimate a value for          #   based on explaining the time-series behavior of inventories.

Given that estimate for # , we can then judge the extent to which the procyclical behavior of

factor productivity reflects increasing returns or procyclical factor utilization.

A. The Behavior of Inventories

          We begin by examining the behavior of the ratio of sales to stock available for sale => ¶+>

for the six manufacturing industries:               Tobacco, apparel, lumber, chemicals, petroleum, and

rubber.     These are roughly the six industries commonly identified as production for stock

industries (Belsley, 1969).13 We obtained monthly data on sales and finished inventories, both in

constant dollars and seasonally adjusted, from the Department of Commerce. The series are

available back to 1959.          We construct monthly production from the identity for inventory

accumulation, with production equal to sales plus inventory investment.14

           Figure 2 presents the ratio => ¶+> for each of the six industries along with industry sales.

The period is for 1959.1 to 1997.9. For every industry the ratio of sales to stock available is

highly procyclical. An industry boom is associated with a much larger percentage increase in

sales than the available stock in each of the six industries. Table 1, Column 1 presents industry

correlations between the ratio => ¶+> and output with both series H-P filtered. The correlations

are all large and positive, ranging from .46 to .84. To show that these correlations do not merely

reflect mistakes, e.g. sales forecast errors, Column 2 of Table 1 presents correlations between a

conditional expectation of => ¶+> and output. The expectation is conditioned on a set of variables

>>   and   >>" ,   where   >> é ¾ln¸+> ¹,   =>-1

ln(TFP> ), ln(TFP>-1 )¿. Price :> is measured by the industry’s monthly Producer Price Index, and

V> refers to the nominal interest rate measured by the 90-day bankers’ acceptance rate.
Replacing sales with forecasted sales yields even larger correlations, ranging from .52 to .88.15


13 In comparison to Belsley, we have deleted food and added lumber. We are concerned that some large food
industries, such as meat and dairy, hold relatively little inventories. Thus any compositional shift during cycles
could generate sharp shifts in inventory ratios. On the other hand, our understanding of the lumber industry is
that it is for all practical purposes production to stock, though there are very small orders numbers collected.
This view was reinforced by discussions with Census.

14 West (1983) discusses that the relative size of inventories is somewhat understated relative to sales because
inventories are valued on the basis of unit costs whereas sales are valued at price. We recalculated output
adjusting upward the relative size of inventory investment to reflect the ratio of costs to revenue in each of our 6
industries as given in West. This had very little effect. The correlation in detrended log of output with and
without this adjustment is greater than 0.99 for each of the industries. It also has very little impact on the
estimates of the Euler equation for inventory investment presented below. Therefore we focus here solely on
results from simply adding the series for inventory investment to sales.

15 Data sources for hours, wages, and TFP are described in part % of the appendix. All variables are H-P filtered
as described in part 5 of the appendix. We also first differenced the series, looking at the correlation of the
changes in the ratios => ¶+> with the rate of growth in output. The correlations are very positive, ranging across
industries from 0.18 to 0.70, and averaging 0.47. (Using forecasted growth in => ¶+> yields even higher
correlations, ranging from 0.57 to 0.86.)


                                                             17
         We want to stress that the strong tendency for => ¶+> to be procyclical is not peculiar to

these six industries. Figure 1 depicted a similar finding for aggregate manufacturing. We also

observe this pattern in home construction, the automobile industry, and in wholesale and retail

trade. Furthermore, for most of these six industries production is more volatile than sales, as it

is for aggregate manufacturing.



B. The Behavior of Marginal Cost and Markups

         Our model suggests that the procyclicality of => ¶+> requires that marginal cost is

temporarily high in booms or that the price-marginal cost markup be countercyclical. We next

ask whether costs and markups in fact behave in that manner. We start with the case of a

constant markup, so that expected discounted cost can be measured by expected price. We then

drop the assumption of a constant markup and see how well we can explain inventory behavior

under our two competing measures of the cost of labor.

         With a constant markup the first-order condition for inventory investment reduces to

equation (3). If we assume the two variables in this equation are conditionally distributed jointly

lognormal, then (3) can be written16

                                                     ln è 

                                                                      ,       !Ç


where   ">   reflects the nominal interest rate from >  " to > measured by the 90-day bankers’

acceptance rate as well as a one percent monthly storage cost. The constant term                             ,   reflects



                                                                            a"                b
covariances between the random variables. Equation (8) implies we should see a strong negative

relation between expectations of the two variables => ¶+> and ln                 > :> ¶:>"   .

         We first report, by industry, the correlation of I ¸>"¹ ¾ln                a"   > :> ¶:>"   b
                                                                                                        ¿ with output.
I ¸>"¹ is based on the information sets              >>"   and   >>2    plus the variables =>" ¶+>" and

16 This approximation is arbitrarily good for small values for the real interest rate r and for the ratio ma9s . In
steady-state the ratio ma9s equals r plus the monthly storage rate. So we would argue this is a small fraction on
the order of 0.02.


                                                         18
lnº:>" ¶:># », which are part of >> . All variables are H-P filtered. Results are in the first column

of Table 2. The correlation is significantly positive for every one of the six industries. This is

precisely the opposite of what is necessary to explain the procyclicality of the ratio => ¶+> . The

correlation of I ¸>"¹ ¾ln       a"   > :> ¶:>"   b   ¿ with I ¸>"¹ º=> ¶+> » appears in Table 2, Column 2. Again
the correlation is positive, significant, and large for every industry, ranging from .34 to .72. For

equation (8) to hold these variables need to be negatively correlated. Also, estimating ¸8¹ by

GMM yields a statistically significant, negative coefficient estimate for 9 for every one of the six

industries.

            We interpret the evidence in Table 2 as strongly rejecting the constant-markup

assumption. Indeed it leaves us with even more to explain: Absent changes in markups, we

would expect => ¶+> to be not merely acyclical, but actually countercyclical. Therefore we

proceed by allowing the markup to vary, as in first-order condition (2).                            Again assuming

variables in the first-order condition are conditionally distributed jointly lognormal, the equation

can be written

Thus the procyclicality of I> º=> ¶+> » requires countercyclical movements in the expectations of
">" ->"
   -      and/or 7> . Marginal cost is given by equation (4), with ! as defined as in (5). (This
       >

assumes zero pure profits. See part 2 of the appendix.) For this exercise we impose constant

returns to scale (# é "). To obtain conditional expectations of the variables we again project

onto the set of variables >> and >>" described above.

                                                                   19
            The results, by industry and for each of the two measures of the price of labor, appear

in Tables 3 and 4.        Consider first the measure based simply on average hourly earnings,

represented by the first three columns of each table. For every industry the growth in marginal

cost is very significantly positively correlated with both output and I> º=> ¶+> ». The correlations

with output range from .45 to .82. The correlations with I> º=> ¶+> » range from .30 to .72.

Markups, on the other hand, do not display a consistent pattern across industries. They are

procyclical, and vary positively with I> º=> ¶+> » , in apparel, lumber, and chemicals, whereas they

are countercyclical, and vary negatively with I> º=> ¶+> », in tobacco, petroleum, and rubber.

Taken together, these correlations do not bode well for the average hourly earnings-based

measure of marginal cost: I> º=> ¶+> » fails to be consistently negatively related to expected

growth in marginal cost or markups, as required by (10).

           Next consider correlations that use the wage augmented for variations in worker effort as

described by equation (7), assuming for now that      # é ".   These appear in the last set of columns

in Tables 3 and 4. In Table 3 we see that the cyclical behavior of marginal cost changes

dramatically, with expected growth in marginal cost negatively correlated with output except in

the petroleum industry. (Value added is very small in petroleum. So adjustments to the cost of

value added have very little impact.) But despite the fact that I> º=> ¶+> » is strongly procyclical

(Table 1) and expected growth in marginal cost is strongly countercyclical (Table 3, Column 3),

the two variables are not systematically correlated with each other. Expected growth in marginal

cost is actually positively correlated with I> º=> ¶+> » in five of the six industries, though

significantly so only for petroleum. For tobacco the two variables are significantly negatively

related.     Using the augmented wage rate does dramatically decrease the magnitude of the

correlation between expected growth in marginal cost and I> º=> ¶+> », except in petroleum.

           The expected markups based on our alternate wage and cost measure are much more

consistently and dramatically countercyclical. Looking at the far right columns of Tables 3 and

4, the markup is highly countercyclical in all but the lumber industry. Excluding lumber, the

correlations of expected markup with output vary from Æ%$ to Æ*!.                  For lumber the

                                                 20
correlation is slightly positive. The correlations of expected markup with I> º=> ¶+> » varies from

Æ%* to Æ(*, again excluding lumber where it is significantly positive.

        Tables 3 and 4 additionally report the correlations of the composite term I> º7> => ¶+> »,

with detrended output and with I> º=> ¶+> ». Focusing on the augmented wage measure, we see

from Table 3 that I> º7> => ¶+> » is clearly countercyclical for every industry but lumber. Thus the

markup is sufficiently countercyclical to more than offset the strong procyclical movements in

=> ¶+> . In fact, we can see from Table 4 that, again with the exception of lumber, the composite
I> º7> => ¶+> » is even negatively correlated with I> º=> ¶+> ». The implication is that countercyclical
movements in the markup are more than sufficient to explain the procyclicality of => ¶+> .



C. Estimation of the First-Order Condition

        The statistics presented thus far suggest that the wage measure augmented to reflect

procyclical factor utilization is qualitatively more consistent with inventory behavior. We now

evaluate the alternative cost measures more formally by estimating the parameters 9 and # from

the first-order condition (9).     Bearing in mind that the two wage measures reflect polar

assumptions regarding the interpretation of short-run productivity movements, we do not

necessarily expect either measure to rationalize inventory behavior completely; but we can

evaluate which one does so more successfully. The parameter estimate for              #   also provides

information on the slope of marginal cost, that is, the response of marginal cost to an increase in

output holding input prices fixed. This is distinct from our discussion to this point, which has

focused on the reduced form cyclical behavior of marginal cost.

        Equation (9) contains explicitly the parameter       9   and implicitly the returns to scale

parameter # through both -> and 7> . Using (4) to substitute for -> and ->" in (9), and using the

definition of 7> , we get

to the returns to scale    #   and an industry profit rate. We therefore also estimate equation (12)

imposing this constraint on 9 as a function of # .

        Table 5 contains results using the wage measured as average hourly earnings, while Table

6 contains results based on our alternative wage. The results in Table 5 using average hourly

earnings are nonsensical, overwhelmingly indicating misspecification.                   Returns to scale are

estimated at a very large positive or very large negative number (greater than 16 in absolute

value) for all industries but petroleum. To interpret this, note that marginal cost of value added

reflects a weight of "¶# . So by estimating an absurdly high absolute value for # , the estimation

is essentially zeroing out this measure of the marginal cost of value added.

        The results in Table 6 using the augmented wage are much more reasonable. The

constraint that    9 take the value implied by the steady-state level of => ¶+> is rejected only for the
lumber and rubber industries. Turning first to the constrained estimates, the estimate for returns

to scale is very large for tobacco (about 2.9), but varies between 1.09 and 1.42 for the other five

industries.     For the unconstrained estimates,         9   is not always estimated very precisely. The

estimate of    9   is positive for four of the industries, and significantly so for three: apparel,

chemicals, and petroleum. The estimates of returns to scale are more robust: Even where the

constraint is rejected the two estimates of # are very similar, and the one case in which the point

estimates differ substantially (petroleum), the difference is not statistically significant.17



                                                                    ïî ü
        As we discuss momentarily, for many of the industries, the exceptions being chemicals

and petroleum, the intertemporal substitution term I> ln ">"->->"                   is largely acyclical.     If

discounted marginal cost literally follows a random walk, then the parameter 9 is not identified.

This suggests focusing largely on the constrained estimates of 9. Furthermore, although we find

that allowing for uncompensated fluctuations in factor utilization goes quite far in explaining the

behavior of inventory investment, we would not argue that Table 6 reflects an exact or “true"

17 These results are for data with low frequency movements in the variables removed by an H-P filter.
Parameter estimates based on unfiltered data are very similar to those in Table 6. The primary difference is that
the test statistics for overidentifying restrictions and for the constraint on 9 more typically reject.

measure of marginal cost. To the extent we have an imperfect measure of marginal cost, the

signal-to-noise ratio in the growth rate of marginal cost will be rather low if -> is close to,

though not literally, a random walk. Evidence that we have an imperfect measure of marginal

cost may also be reflected in the tendency to reject the overidentifying restrictions of the model

according to the J-statistic. (The restrictions are rejected in four of the six industries). On the

other hand, the model is fairly successful in accounting for most of the persistence of => ¶+>

without resorting to ad hoc adjustment costs: With the exception of the lumber industry, the

Durbin-Watson statistics do not suggest the presence of a large amount of unexplained serial

correlation.

       We have focused on implications for the cyclical behavior of marginal cost—both relative

to price and relative to expected future marginal cost—that come from inventory behavior.

Much of the inventory literature, however, has focused more narrowly on estimating cost

function parameters and, in particular, the relationship between output and marginal cost holding

input prices constant, which we refer to as the “slope of marginal cost.” We would argue that

the broader cyclicality measure is more relevant both for inventory behavior and many broader

questions about the nature of business cycles.      The slope of marginal cost does not enter

separately from overall marginal cost in the Euler equation; and for many questions about the

nature of cyclical fluctuations the distinction between internal and external convexity or

diminishing returns is not germane.

       Nonetheless, for the sake of comparison, we can look at the implications of our estimates

for the slope of marginal cost. If we assume that capital is fixed in the short run, then marginal

cost is upward sloping if and only if # ¸!  / ¹  ". The estimates of # in Table 6 bear a close

inverse relationship to each industry's total labor exponent   !  / , which is provided in the first
column of the table. By this criterion only chemicals (# ¸!  / ¹ é 0.88) and petroleum (0.69)

exhibit significantly upward sloping marginal cost. The other four industries have very close to




                                               24
flat marginal cost.18       Given a relation between short-run marginal cost and output that is

relatively flat, then the extent to which overall marginal cost (allowing for changes in input

prices) is procyclical rests largely on the behavior of input prices, and in particular the shadow

price of labor.



D. Cyclical Markups versus Intertemporal Substitution

         Our approach of adding back short-run TFP movements to construct an effective wage

explains the procyclical behavior of => ¶+> by some combination of procyclical marginal cost

(relative to discounted future marginal cost—i.e. intertemporal substitution) and countercyclical

markups. Can we say which factor is more important? Recall that Table 4 reported correlations

of I> º=> ¶+> » with the expected growth in marginal cost, with the expected markup, and with

I> º7> => ¶+> », assuming constant returns to scale. Those correlations suggest that much of the
impact of augmenting marginal cost for procyclical factor utilization acts through making the

markup very countercyclical (except for the lumber industry), and not through the intertemporal

cost term.

         This conclusion is strengthened when we allow for returns to scale. Using the estimates

of   # from Table 6, Figure 4 presents the implied markup together with the ratio => ¶+> for each
industry. The movements in the markups are highly countercyclical (except for lumber) and

quantitatively important. Several empirical papers have examined the cyclicality of markups.

(Rotemberg and Woodford, 1999, survey some of these.) Our definition of the markup is

slightly different, as it compares price to discounted next period's marginal cost. The markup of



18 The tobacco and rubber industries display very slightly downward sloping marginal cost, with # ¸!  / ¹
estimated at 1.02 in tobacco and 1.04 in rubber. In a model where inventories are held only to minimize costs a
lack of short-run diminshing returns to labor can lead to failure of the second-order condition that accompanies
first-order condition (2) for optimizing. This is not the case for our model. For 9  ", there are diminishing
returns to the available stock, +> , in generating sales. This provides an incentive to smooth the stock available,
and therefore production as well, even if there is no direct cost motive for smoothing production. In fact, our
estimate for 9 is less than 0.5 for each of the six industries, implying considerable diminishing returns in
increasing the stock +> . Related to this, the second-order condition for an optimum is satisfied for each of our
industries based on the estimates in Table 6.

                                                        25
price relative to contemporaneous marginal cost, however, behaves extremely similarly to the

markups pictured in Figure 4. Figure 3 showed that the large shifts in price markups in tobacco

in the 1980s and 1990s were accompanied by opposite movements in the ratio => ¶+> as predicted

by the model. Figure 4 shows that, more generally, most of the striking shifts in => ¶+> that

occurred in these six industries are associated with large opposite movements in the markup.

        In fact, we can say more. Table 7 presents correlations for the terms: I> ¾">+1 c>+1 ¶c> ¿,

I> ¾7> ¿, and I> ¾7> => ¶+> ¿ with detrended output and with I> ¾=> ¶+> ¿. This parallels Tables 3
and 4, except now the cost and markup terms are constructed using returns to scale as estimated

in Table 6. In contrast to results under constant returns, the intertemporal substitution factor is

now significantly positively correlated with output and with I> ¾=> ¶+> ¿ in each of the six

industries.   By itself this would push => ¶+> in the direction of being countercyclical; the

movements in the markup have to more than offset the behavior of intertemporal cost in order to

generate procyclical => ¶+> .      As under constant returns, with the exception of lumber, the

anticipated markup is very countercyclical and significantly negatively correlated with

I> ¾=> ¶+> ¿, though the magnitudes are now somewhat smaller.19 Table 7 also shows that
I> ¾7> => ¶+> ¿ is negatively related to both detrended output and with I> ¾=> ¶+> ¿ in all industries
but lumber. This indicates that forecastable movements in 7> do indeed more than offset the

cyclical behavior of => ¶+> . Intertemporal substitution, due to temporarily high marginal cost

during expansions, does not explain why +> fails to keep pace with fluctuations in I> ¸=> ¹.

        Although intertemporal substitution fails to play a key role, the alternative marginal cost

measure that allows for cyclical work effort is still crucial in explaining inventory behavior.

Allowing for the impact of cyclical work effort on the shadow cost of labor sufficiently alters our

measure of marginal cost to enable the model to account for the procyclical behavior of => ¶+> .

While it does not make marginal cost procyclical, in the sense of being transitorily high at




19In the case of lumber, even though both the expected markup and the intertemporal cost terms are slightly
procyclical, they are negatively related to each other, as required by the model.

                                                     26
business cycle peaks, it does moves it in that direction. More importantly, it makes marginal

cost procyclical relative to the price of output.




                                         V. Conclusions

        Evidence from cross-sectional and low-frequency time-series data indicates that firms’

demands for finished goods inventories are proportional to their expected sales. Yet during

business cycles these inventories are highly countercyclical relative to sales. This behavior

requires that during booms firms exhibit either high marginal cost relative to discounted future

marginal cost (prompting intertemporal substitution) or low price markups.

        Measures of marginal cost based on measured prices and productivity fail to explain this

behavior because factor productivity rises during expansions relative to input prices. We show

that the cyclical patterns of inventory holdings can be rationalized by interpreting fluctuations in

labor productivity as arising primarily from mismeasured cyclical utilization of labor, the cost of

which is internalized by firms but not contemporaneously reflected in measured average hourly

earnings.   Our view that procyclical factor utilization accounts for the inventory puzzle is

consistent with other evidence that factors are worked more intensively in booms (for example,

Bernanke and Parkinson, 1991, Shapiro, 1993, Bils and Cho, 1994, Burnside, Eichenbaum, and

Rebelo, 1995, and Gali, 1997).

        It turns out, however, that it is not intertemporal substitution that accounts for the

cyclical behavior of inventories.     The standard story that firms deviate from a fixed target

inventory-sales ratio because of transitory changes in marginal cost is not borne out by our

analysis. Instead, what drives inventory behavior is primarily countercyclical markups, which

have the effect of changing the target ratio. Thus the failure of inventories to keep pace with

shipments is mirrored by the failure of price to keep pace with marginal cost.

        In aggregate, observing a countercyclical markup is equivalent to observing procyclical

real marginal cost, that is marginal cost that is procyclical relative to a general price deflator.

                                                    27
What we see in the industry-level data is consistent with the following picture of the aggregate

economy: An aggregate expansion in output is associated with an increase in real marginal cost.

This rise in real marginal cost emanates not from diminishing returns to labor in the production

function but from a higher shadow cost of labor. For a persistent increase in output, however,

this does not justify predicting a negative growth rate for real marginal cost (relative to real

interest rates) as needed to give rise to intertemporal substitution. For our model, a rise in real

marginal cost, or equivalently a drop in the markup, directly reduces the value of inventory

holdings by reducing the valuation of sales generated by those inventories.          Therefore, a

persistent rise in real marginal cost, absent intertemporal substitution, creates a persistent

reduction in inventory holdings relative to expected shipments, as in Figure 1.

       In recent years a number of papers have attempted to explain why firms might cut price

markups during expansions.      Rotemberg and Woodford (1995) survey many of these. As

outlined by Rotemberg and Woodford, among others, such pricing can dramatically exacerbate

cyclical fluctuations by reducing the distortionary impact of price markups on employment and

output during booms. Our results clearly support these efforts.

1. The Cost of Materials

        We know of no monthly data on material price deflators by industry. We construct our
own monthly price of materials index, => , for each industry as follows. Based on the 1977 input
output matrix, we note every 4-digit industry whose input constituted at least 2 percent of gross
output for one of our six industries. This adds up to 13 industries. We then construct a monthly
index for each industry weighting the price movements for those 13 goods by their relative
importance. For most of the industries one or two inputs constitute a large fraction of material
input; for example, crude petroleum for petroleum refining or leaf tobacco for tobacco
manufacture. For the residual material share we use the general producer price index. This
contrasts with Durlauf and Maccini (1995), who scale up the shares for those inputs they
consider so that they sum to one, which results in more volatile input price indices than ours.

         Although we assume that materials are a fixed input per unit of output, we do not impose
that this input be constant through time. We allow low frequency movements in the per unit
material input by imposing that our series -=> exhibit the same H-P filter as does the industry’s
material input measured by the annual survey of manufacturing (from the NBER Productivity
Database).


2. Production Function Parameters

        We choose to calibrate the production labor exponent !. Because we do not impose that
price equals marginal cost, we cannot calibrate the parameter based simply on production labor’s
share of value added. Even if firms do not earn profits, price must exceed production’s marginal
cost to cover the holdings costs of inventories. Secondly, if there are increasing returns, this
implies average cost exceeds marginal cost; so zero profits implies that price exceeds marginal
costs. Thirdly, firms in principle may earn profits.

        We measure ' by its sample average, where "˜ is the average value of               :>       assuming a
monthly storage cost of one percent and a nominal interest rate measured by the 90-day bankers'
acceptance rate. Thus ! is directly related to observables except for the profit rate 1. For the
bulk of our estimation we assume that the steady-state level of economic profits is zero. A
number of studies have suggested that profit rates in manufacturing are fairly close to zero. For
example, Basu and Fernald (1997) experiment with several different industry cost of capital
series and always find very low profit rates, on the order of three percent, for manufacturing
industries. We also explore robustness to profit rates as high as ten percent.

       Note that in the absence of production to stock (i.e. =¶+ é ") and with 1 equal to zero,
! simply equals production labor's share of value added. More generally the share would tend to
understate !, due to the larger average markup necessary to make up for the cost of holding
inventories (as well as any profits).

        To allow for secular changes in factor and material cost shares we measure “steady state”
A8

          : respectively by H-P filters fit to series for production labor and material shares of
gross output. Consequently, ! varies at low frequencies as well. We do impose a constant
industry value for !  / , which reflects the sum of production and nonproduction labor shares,
adjusted as in (A4).


3. Constraining the value of 9

        In the estimation we consider the impact of constraining parameter 9 to take a value
consistent with an industry's long-run ratio of sales to stock available. We constrain 9 as
follows. Evaluating first-order condition (2) at a steady-state yields

where, again, '                   ì ". Substituting for :¶- in (A5) from (A6) relates 9 to the

                     "¸"=¶+¹"˜
parameters # ,   1, and the long-run values of =¶+, "˜ , and -=: .
        In estimating we proceed as follows: (1) Choose a value for 1; (2) set =¶+ and -=   : to
industry sample averages (the latter allowed to drift according to an H-P filter) and "˜ to be
consistent with an interest rate measured by the 90-day bankers' acceptance rate and a one
percent monthly storage cost; (3) estimate # , based partly on its influence on the constrained
parameter 9. In the estimation reported in Tables 5 and 6 we impose a zero profit rate 1 for
reasons discussed directly above. We did examine profit rates of 0.05 and 0.1 and found that the
results were robust.


4. Data sources for Hours, Wages, and TFP

        Monthly data for hours and wages for production workers are from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics (BLS) Establishment Survey. For the augmented wage we compute TFP and
adjust the wage according to equation (7) (except for the term involving # , which is estimated).
Output, for the purpose of measuring TFP, is measured by sales plus inventory accumulation,
as described in the text. In addition to output and production labor, TFP reflects movements in
nonproduction labor and capital. Employment for nonproduction workers is based on the BLS
Establishment Survey. There are no monthly data on workweeks for nonproduction workers.
We assume workweeks for nonproduction workers vary according to variations in workweeks
for production workers. We have annual measures of industry capital stocks from the
Commerce Department for 1959 to 1996, which we interpolate to get monthly stocks.


5. Detrending Procedures

ln      ->
           Although the first-order condition (9) suggests that quantities such as => ¶+> and
     ">" ->"
               ought to be stationary (or at least cointegrated), this may not necessarily hold over
the nearly 40-year period covered by the sample. Changes in product composition or inventory
technology, for example, could produce low frequency movements in these variables that are
really outside the scope of this paper. We therefore remove low frequency shifts in these
variables with a Hodrick-Prescott (H-P) filter, using a parameter of 86,400. (The conventional

above variables it would take out too much business cycle variation.) Because the Euler

                                                                                             > 8>
                                                                                                  8>"ü î ü
                                                                                                       Ç ln ">"==> >" ,
and ln(C> ¹Ç where A> here refers either to average hourly earnings or to the augmented wage
under the assumption # é "Æ Equation (12) can be expressed in terms of these variables
multiplied by parameters or by functions of parameters.

        We also use the same filter on ln(TFP) in constructing the augmented wage, though here
the purpose is different. Our assumption is that low-frequency movements in ln(TFP), the part
removed by the filter, reflect technical change, so we remove that component before using the
residual (which we assume reflects varying utilization) to augment average hourly earnings.
