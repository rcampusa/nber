                     Pension Funding and Saving

                                ABSTRACT



     This paper suggests that the nature of the funding of defined benefit

pension plans may be an important reason why personal saving has not responded

positively to the high real interest rites and tax incentives to encourage

saving and investment of the last few years. From a firm's standpoint, funding

the promised pension is a target, and higher rates of return permit reaching

that target with lower contributions. According to the Flow of Funds Accounts

of the Federal Reserve System between 1982 and 1984, net pension contributions

declined from 6.02 percent of disposable personal income to4.02 percent.

     The paper presents empirical information regarding pension contributions.

unfunded liabilities, interest rates, and recent developments in pension

funding. It specifies the target saving model of pension funding and derives

the theoretical elasticity of pension contributions to changes in interest

rates. It then investigates this elasticity with aggregate time series

econometrics. In general, the estimated elasticities are consistent with the

theory and indicate that one percentage point rise in real interest rates

would, in the long run, reduce pension contributions between 20 and 30 percent.

Such a large negative elasticity for such an important source of loanable funds

in the economy suggests that the pensions funding mechanism should be taken

into account in designing policies to increase the economy's saving and

investment.

I.   Introduction

     The private saving rate in the United States in 1984 has to be considered

disappointing. After the enactment of a large number of policies to make

investment/saving more rewarding (such as liberalized Individual Retirement

Accounts and Keough Plans, the special tax treatment of some reinvested divi-

dends, capital gains taxes which have been reduced twice in the past six years,

and certainly increased investment incentives at the corporate level), the

preliminary BEA estimate for the 1984 personal saving rate is 6.1 percent of

disposable personal income. This is lower than the average personal saving

rate in the 1970's of 7.3 percent. and only imperceptably better than the 6.0

percent of the first four years of this decade. With all of these incentives,

plus a robust economy and record high real interest rates, why was the personal

saving rate so low? We are not going to attempt to answer this general ques-

tion here. Rather, we suggest that personal saving needs to be examined in a

dissagregated manner. Some of the policies just mentioned do not really provide

incentives to save at the margin, but only serve to channel the existing quantity

of saving or wealth through particular vehicles. Undoubtedly, this accounts

for at least some of the apparent sluggishness in private saving. Our topic,

however, is the behavior of personal saving which results from the funding of

pension plans. In this country, most covered workers participate in defined

benefit plans, where the promised pension annuity is based on years of service

and the level of compensation, •nd not directly on the funding status of the

plan or the return on the investments which have been previously acquired to

fund the plan. However, while the worker may be able to separate his or her

accumulation of pension rights or wealth from the funding of the plan, it is

the aggregate funding contributions less outlays (i.e. benefits) which con-

stitute a component of personal saving, and which generate loanable funds

to finance investment or government deficits. Thus, the structure of defined



                                     2
benefit plans may produce a divergence between the apparent saving of workers

through the accumulation of pension rights and the actual creation of loanable

funds through net contributions to pension plan reserves.

     This can be an important phenomenon if only because pension funds are so

large relative to financial markets and because pension contributions constitute

such a large fraction of personal saving. Also, net corporate pension contri-

butions fell sharply in 1984. They amounted to 4.02 percent of personal

disposable income in 1984, down from 6.02 percent in 1982. Thus, the decline

in pension funding is possibly large enough to be responsible for the

disappointing level of aggregate personal saving.

     To understand why corporate pension contributions dropped so significantly

in 1984, one simply has to examine the defined benefit pension contract from

the firm's point of view. The liability of the firm is to pay for retirement

annuities for its vested workers. To calculate the present value of this

obligation, the firm typically predicts the magnitude of those annuities

(making some assumptions regarding wage growth until retirement, labor

turnover, etc.) and then discounts the future obligation to the present using

an assumed interest rate. The resulting present value of liabilities is then

compared to the value of the assets in the plan to arrive at the net unfunded

liability. By law, contributions are related to the unfunded liability of the

plan, although the companies have substantial discretion both as to the speed

with which unfunded liabilities are amortized and in the assumptions which are

made in arriving at the value of unfunded liabilities. However, the key point

is that from the company's point of view, the funding of pension liabilities is

a target — and the higher the earnings of the assets funding the plan, the

lower the contributions needed to meet the obligations. If the assets earn

more than the assumed discount rate used to value the liabilities (or if the




                                     3
 assumed interest rate is raised or the assumed rate of growth of
                                                                  wages is
 lowered), the unfunded liability will be reduced (or, more relevantly for
                                                                           many
 companies, become negative) and the contributions will tend to decline. In the

 not—so—rare case (in 1984) of an over—funded
                                                plan, the law may force a reduction
 or an elimination of contributions, lust the
                                                 factors which have been hailed as
 the economic achievements of the
                                    past few years (e.g. a rising stock market and
 a reduction in wage inflation), combined with those high real interest rates

 which may encourage other kinds of saving, are the primary reasons behind the

 reduction in the number of underfunded
                                          plans and the sharp drop in pension
 contributions. As with the classic target saving examples, defined benefit

 pension contributions have a negative elasticity with respect to (real)

 interest rates, With pension contributions so large a part of total personal

saving, the negative elasticity of this component may significantly offset the

positive responsiveness of other components of saving. We have not investigated

whether the private sector offsets this reduction in the contributions to

pension plans, but previous research suggests that this offset will only be

partial (Feldstein and Selignan (1981), Feldstein and Morck (1983), Bulow,

Morck, and Summers (1986)). It should be emphasized that the negative elasticity

of contributions to a defined benefit pension plan is not the result of inter—

temporal optimization on the part of either the firm or the workers, but is a

purely mechanical response inherent in the funding rules for these types of plans.

     In the next section of this paper, we present some empirical information

regarding pension contributions, unfunded liabilities, assumed interest rates,

and recent development, in pension funding. Then in the third section of the

paper, we present our target saving model of pension funding and derive the elas-

ticity of contributions to changes in interest rates. The fourth section

behavior of the stock market. We close the paper by summarizing our findings

in the conclusion.


II. Institutional Considerations

     As Table 1 shows, most pension plans (72 percent of them) are defined

contribution. However, the defined contribution plans are typically small and

often supplement a defined benefit plan (a notable exception being flAA—CREF.

which is the largest pension plan in the United States). Thus, in terms of

participants or assets, defined benefit plans dominate with about 70 percent of

the total. To gain some appreciation of the aggregate size of private pension

plans, note that the 52.4 million covered workers represent about 53 percent of

all civilian employees in 1978 and the the *377 billion in private pension

assets amounts to 51 percent of the equity holdings of households in 1978. If

 government pensions were included, the Federal Reserve Flow of Fund figures

 show 1978 pension assets at *593 billion compared to household corporate equity

 holdings of *741 billion.

      Table 2 shows the number of new plans qualified and terminated by type for

 the years 1974—84. Prior to this period, defined benefit plans had been

 growing more rapidly. In every year from 1956 to 1974. the number of new

 defined benefit plans exceeded the number of new defined contribution plans.

 However, since ERISA the pattern has been reversed. In the first three quar-

 ters of 1984, the number of defined benefit terminations was at a record level

 and the net growth in defined benefit plans was running at under a one percent

 yearly rate. The changes in the relative popularity of defined benefit vs.

 defined contribution plans is almost certainly due to the funding, vesting, and

 insurance requirements of ERISA for defined benefit plans.

        There are two sources of data regarding aggregate private pension contri-

butions and benefits, the Flow of Funds data of the Federal Reserve and the

National Income and Product Account (NIA) information. As with total saving

figures, the two sources do not agree particularly well on the numbers. The

time series on net contributions (contributions less benefits paid out) from

the   Flow of Funds information is shown in Table 3 for 1948 through 1984. 1984
numbers show a fairly drastic decline. The 1984 figure for private pensions
alone   was more than 430   billion less than for 1982.       The growth rate in net

contributions is also down, though less dramatically, for pensions managed by

insurance companies and state and local government pension systems. The

magnitude of the drop in net contributions from a trend line is comparable to

the total inflow of money into IRA and leough accounts. Thus, the data makes

it appear that the story may     be    large relative to the saving incentives

mentioned in the introduction. The relative importance of pension contributions

to personal saving can be Judged by comparing columns (4) and (5) of Table 3.

       The MA data, which we use in the empirical work of the next section, is

shown in   the   first two columns   of Table 4 for private pensions. The NIA
provides   separate information on contributions and benefits paid and we gener-

ally consider it to be more reliable than the Plow of Fund numbers. The NIA

contribution figures are based on business tax return information, while their

numbers for benefits are based on individual tax returns netted out for

government pensions. The MA          information   is not yet available for 1984, so our

estimations of the section IV    will    not use the dramatic developments of last

year. The third column of Table 4 contains information on reversions.

Reversions have received a lot of attention recently, partly due to the fact

that a few large publicly held companies have terminated their plans in this

manner. A pension plan reversion can occur when the plan becomes overfunded.

The   existing   plan is terminated and a new plan (usually a defined contribution

plan) is adopted (often with the old obligations covered by insurance company

annuities). The excess of the value of the plan assets over the cost of the

annuities may revert to the company. The whole procedure is made possible

because assets have previously earned more than the assumed interest rate. The

case which received the most attention was the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea

Co. which recouped $272.9 million out of its $355.1 million pension fund with a

reversion completed in 1984. The figures in Table 4 show that the aggregate

quantity of reversions is still relatively small, but the growth rate in this

practice has been phenomenal. The reversions already pending in January for

1985 amounted to *1.824 billion, and the figure is likely to go much higher.

Clearly, reversions reinforce the downward pressure on saving created by the

lower net contributions. Reversions and the lower contributions actually have

the same underlying cause. In both cases, assets have been earning far in

excess of assumed discount rates, resulting in many pension funds which are

massively overfunded if market rates were used to discount the pension obli-

gation. Reversions amount •to the company recognizing this profit suddenly,

while most ongoing plans simply reduce contributions over a long period of time.

     Pension plans have been slow to adjust their assumed interest rates toward

market rates. The mean assumed interest rate for plans with more than 1000 partici-

pants has climbed from 6 percent in 1980 to 7.2 percent in 1984. as shown below.

However, this growth in the assumed interest rate has been matched by increases

in the assured salary growth for the seventy percent of defined benefit plans

which project wage increase in determining liabilities. In fact, the spread

between the interest assumption and the wage growth assumption has narrowed

slightly in the past eight years. Since 1976. the average spread has decreased

from 2.3 percent to 1.5 percent.

     The adjustment towards market interest rates may be occuring somewhat faster

than the previous numbers indicate, however. A strategy termed "immunization" or

"dedication" has become increasingly popular. A portfolio is said to be immunized

when the cash flow (interest plus principle) generated by the assets matches the

cash flow of the pension liabilities. Dedication is a less precise matching stra-

tegy where the average duration of the assets matches the duration of the liabil-

ities. By structuring the portfolio in these ways, plan managers are protecting

themselves from interest rate risk. A change to a dedicated or immunized portfolio

amounts to suddenly changing the assumed interest rate to the market rate. In the

suddenness of the adjustment, the adoption of these strategies is similar to a

reversion. Total dedications and immunizations amounted to at least Ito   billion   in

1984. with Ameritech leading the pack with a *2.4 billion asset dedication. Chrysler

participated in a big w.y with a *1.1 billion immunization. The annualized yield

on Chrysler's immunized portfolio exceeds 14 percent. While aggregate numbers

are difficult to come up with, this phenomenon appears to be somewhat larger than

reversions, and certainly it amounts to an added factor dampening pension contri-

butions. One final example of the effect of dedication on contributions is given

by the Western Conference of the Teamsters Union. The Union is in the process

of adopting the strategy for its entire *5.1 billion portfolio. In 1984 it placed

*1.777 billion in dedicated bond portfolios yielding over 12 percent. When it

completes the dedication process, the entire *1 billion of "unfunded liability"

of its pension system will have been eliminated without further contributions.



                                   12
Basically, by structuring the portfolios in this manner, actuaries are willing

to raise the assumed interest rate to the market rate, thus dramatically

lowering both unfunded liabilities and contributions.

     The effects of high market interest rates and high stock market returns

can be seen by examining the funding status of pension plans. Table 5 shows

the distribution of the ratio of assets to present value of accrued vested

liabilities at the end of 1983 for the Fortune 500 Industrials. Even using the

companies' interest rate assumptions, fully 88 percent were fully funded and 34

percent were more than 50 percent overfunded. If the calculations are redone

with a common 10 percent interest rate, 94 percent are fully funded and almost

70 percent are more than 50 percent overfunded. The overfunding would be even

more massive at true market interest rates which ranged between 13 and 15

percent. The figures of Table 5 were requested by the Financial Accounting

Standards Board Statement No. 36 and did not permit the use of salary growth

projections. Many companies do make these projections in calculating their

unfunded liabilities and to determine contributions. Regardless of method,

however, the funding levels of plans have dramatically improved in the last few

years. Again, on the FASB no—projection basis1 the percent of the Fortune 500

whose assets are at least as much as accrued—vested benefits (with their

discount rates) has climbed from 58 percent in 1980 to 69 percent in 1981. 78

percent in 1982, and 88 percent in 1983. The figures are not available yet for

1984, but a further gain in funding relative to liabilities is most likely.


III. Theoretical Considerations

     In the previous section. we described the institutional factors which

largely govern the response of pension fund accumulation to changes in interest

rates. Our next objective is to quantify these effects. The current section

exhibits a simple model of defined—benefit pension plans, for which we compute

theoretical long run, and short run interest elasticities. Although these

calculations provide us with a sense for magnitudes, certain critical

parameters are not institutionally determined. In order to refine our

estimates of these interest elasticities, as well as •to confirm the predictions

of our theoretical analysis, we devote section IV to an empirical analysis of

pension fund accumulation.

        Consider a firm which, in period t, accrues new pension liabilities



              Lt_— Lt              .     Lt
                     C
                                             t+T'

          t    .           .       ..                    .       .
where L÷ is the liability accrued in period t, to be paid in period t+t.

The notion of "accrual" used here corresponds to whatever actuarial convention

is employed by fins under ERISA regulations. Let                            denote its stream of

previously accrued liabilities:


               t__,t
                —
                     't' t+l "''
                               t                   t




Here,          represents liabilities to be paid in period ti-v. which have been

recognized by period t. These streams are related as follows:

                         t—l
                    =                          ,       t=O,   ..., T—l   t+T =
                                       Li-
                    n=t+t—T

Note that          (r=O) represents the value of pension benefits which the

firm must pay out in period t. Throughout, we will take the stream of real

liabilities as given.

        In what follows, for any stream I =
                                                               (Ii,   X1. ...,   Xts).   we will denote

the present discounted value of I by




                                                         15
          V(X)            XtnI(l+i)t


where I is the nominal interest rate. We will also denote the "duration" of I

by
                      S

          D(I)            'c [
                                      V(I)      ]



The duration of I measures its average maturity. We will use            to
denote the interest elasticity of Vt(I). The following result will prove

useful:


                                      dvt(I)
                               1+ i ______
          e.(V
           1 t (I))       =
                                        di
                              Vt(X)

                                 'S
                      I l+i      Iv
                      [v (1)] 1          It+r/(l+i)t1
                             r=O

                 =   — D(I)

     Thus, the elasticity with respect to the interest rate of the value of a

nominal stream of payments is equal to the negative of the stream's duration.

We note that this is not the conventional interest elasticity expression, but

is approximately the percentage change in value per percentage point change in

the interest rite (precisely, it is the percentage change in value relative to

the percentage change in 1+1). This, of course, is quite a different figure

from the traditional elasticity which would in this case be the percentage

change in value relative to the percentage change in the interest rate. As an

example of the difference, consider a consol which pays one dollar per period

as a perpetuity. Its present value is 1/i and the traditional elasticity of

its value with respect to the Interest rate is —1. The interest elasticity



                                               16
that we just defined, which we should perhaps term the sensitivity or

responsiveness of value to interest rate changes, is —       1/i.   We have chosen to

express our elasticities in this manner only because we find it more natural to

think about a one percentage point move in the interest rate from, say, four to

five percent rather than a one percent change from 4.00 to 4.04 percent.

      In this paper, we will be concerned with changes in the teal interest

rate. In order to avoid unnecessary notation, we simply denote every stream in

real dollars, and discount by the real rate. Subsections A and B consider long

run, and short run   effects,   respectively.


A. Long   Run Effects    of Chanzes in the Real Interest Kate

      ERISA regulations permit temporary underfunding and overfunding of pension

plans, but require that the firm     fully   fund its liabilities in the long run.

It is. therefore, natural to begin our investigation by considering steady

states, which are characterized by constant interest rates (as well as other

exogenous variables), and full funding of current liabilities. Thus, at time

t, pension assets (Ar) are given by


(1)       At =   vtbt)
      We will assume that, in the long run, the liability profile grows at a

constant rate, g, by which we mean the following:



           t              t—t' t'
          Lt =    (1 + g)
                              Lt,

Note that this assumption places no constraint on the shape of the new

liability profile Lt, although it does imply that benefits paid, A, and

the value of discounted liabilities, YtO.t), will grow at the rate g. Thus,

pension assets, At. will also grow at this rate.




                                     17
      In steady state, pension assets always cover accrued liabilities exactly.

Thus, to maintain full funding, current contributions, C, must equal the value

of new accrued liabilities:



(2)        Ct =


Between equations (1) and (2). we may analyze the steady state effects of a

change in the real interest rate on pension fund contributions and total

capital accumulation, given a fired liability profile.

      The assumption of a fired liability profile is essential to our

calculations. Yet ordinarily, we would expect changes in the rate of interest

to be accompanied by changes in wage rates, and perhaps levels of employment.

It is, therefore, important to clarify the nature of our exercise. Ultimately,

one is interested in the general equilibrium effects of any particular policy

change. However, these effects are determined by partial equilibrium

responses. The    interest   elasticity of savings, defined as the response of

savings to a change in the interest rate given fixed values of other variables

(such as wage rates and employment), often appears as a critical parameter in

policy analyses. Consequently, many authors have attempted to measure personal

savings elasticities. Our     analysis     is in the spirit of these earlier studies.

      From equation (1), we see immediately that the long run       interest
elasticity of pension fund assets is



           s(A) = — Dt(kt)

where, again, this elasticity is the percentage change in the value of assets

for a one percentage point change in interest rates. While we have no data on

the duration of current pension fund liabilities, it is instructive to make

some rough calculations based on hypothetical values. It seems reasonable to



                                      18
believe that the duration of outstanding liabilities is in the neighborhood of

15 years. If so, a 1 percentage point increase in the real interest rate would

depress the long run value of pension fund assets by 15 percent. Given the

current size of pension funds, this translates into roughly lioo billion of

capital assets.

     A similar calculation for yearly contributions reveals that



          c (C ) = — 0 (Li)
           r t             t




Here, we clearly see the "target saving" aspect of defined benefit pension

programs: if all savings takes place to fund an expenditure in the following

period (Dt(Lt) =     1).   then the elasticity of savings is —1. Longer maturity

structures will amplify the effect of interest rate changes. Again, we have no

direct evidence concerning the magnitude of Dt(Lt). However, we can make

suggestive calculations based on hypothetic values. It seems reasonable to

believe that the duration of newly accrued liabilities is in the neighborhood

of 30 years. If so, a 1 percentage point increase in the real interest rate

would depress the long run value of pension fund contributions by 30 percent.

Given current mangitudes, this translates into roughly 125 billion.

     Of course, pension funds pay out significant benefits, and earn interest

on existing assets. Thus, net pension savings in year t, N, is given by



             =       +         —
                 C       rA        Bt


(where benefits paid, B ).). Our previous calculations reveal how
                                                                          C
changes with the real interest rate. By assumption, B is invariant. For the

remaining term (reinvested interest on assets), we observe that oar elasticity

measure for rA is



                                        19
               e (rA ) =   — fl (Xe)
                r   t    r     t




Taking   r =   0.025. and DtOt) = 15 as before, yields an elasticity of 25. If.
in addition, At = $650 billion1 then a 1 percentage point increase in the real

interest rate will, through this channel, bring forth approximately *4 billion

in pension fund savings.

     It is useful to suarize the changes in net pension saving relative to

total personal savings. S. Suppose that At/st =           4, A/C = 8,   At/Bt = 16, and

r = 0.02 (these magnitudes correspond roughly to historical averages). Then



            i±i — = — a
                          C                rA
                                           —
                                 (C ) +         a (rA )
                   dr     St r t                 r   t




                        .5 a (C ) +
                           r t        .1   a (rA
                                            r    t


Using our previous values for stream durations1


                    = —.5(30) +    .1(25)    = — 12.5


Thus, in the long run, a 1 percentage point increase in the real interest rate

may depress net pension fund saving by 12.5 percent of total personal saving.

     If investors perfectly pierce the corporate veil, then adjustments in

private portfolios will completely offset these changes. However, if the offset

does not occur or is only partial, the impact on private savings elasticities

may be substantial. Of course, partial offsets are much more plausible in the

short run, than in the long run. In addition, unexpected changes in interest

rates are likely to induce short run capital gains or losses on existing assets,

leading to short run pension fund imbalances. It is, therefore, essential to

consider the short run response of pension funds to interest rate changes.




                                                20
B. Short Run Effects of Chau&es in the Real Interest Rate

     Consider a pension fund with certain assets and liabilities. Suppose that

there is an unanticipated change in the real interest rate during some period.

flow does the accumulation of pension fund assets respond in each successive

period? We find it useful to divide this question into two parts. First, how

would the magnitude of unfunded liabilities respond to a change in interest

rates, if the full impact of this change was recognized immediately? Second,

how do recognition and response lags determine the timing of compensating

adjustments? We tackle these questions in order.

     The response of net unfunded liabilities to a change in the interest rate

can be divided into two parts: changes in assets, and changes in liabilities.

First, consider liabilities. The total value of outstanding liabilities is

given by Vt(Xt). We have already calculated that



                      =   — Dt(Xt),


and have argued that 15 is a reasonable hypothetical value for DtOt). Thus,

an increase in interest rates, if recognized immediately, generates a large

decline in the value of outstanding liabilities, thereby tending to make plans

overfunded.

     Next, consider the effect of interest rates on fund assets. Assets can be

decomposed into three categories: bonds, physical capital, and stock (levered

physical capital). It is straightforward to calculate the effect of interest

rites on the value of bonds. Suppose that, in period t, the pension fund

contains bonds which provide a claim on the real income stream



          Bt_It
            —                  t
               Bt+l



                                      21
(B4 represents the income from bonds in period t+c which the firm owns as

of period t.) Then, as before, for our elasticity measure,



                (Be) = — D (gt)
            r             t



Again, we have no direct evidence on the average maturity of bonds held in

pension plans. While we have noted the recent trends to "dedication" and

"imnnication" (section II), we suspect that most plans hold bonds with short

maturities relative to their liabilities. Bor purposes of hypothetical

calculations, we will assume tbat the duration of bonds held in pension plans

is 5 years. Thus, an increase in interest rates gener.tes a significant

decline in the value of bonds, thereby tending to make plans underfunded.

      The case of physical assets is somewhat more complicated. Specifically.

the effect of interest rates on physical asset valuation depends critically

upon whether a change in interest rates represents a change in the return on

existing units, or a change in the return on marginal units only. We consider

these cases separately.


Case 1: Change in return on all existing units.

      In this case, the higher discount is matched by higher returns, so


                 (y(pt)) =
            tr


(pt   represents the stream of returns associated with physical assets held by

pension plans in period t.)


Case 2: Change in return on marginal assets only.

       In this case, a physical asset is indistinguishable from a bond, so


                 (y(pt)) =    — nt (pt)
             r




                                          22
Since real physical assets often include items such as real estate, for which

durations are quite long, we choose as our hypothetical value Dtu)t) = 10.

Thus, in case 2, an increase in interest rates generates a large decline in the

value of real physical assets, again tending to make plans underfunded.

     Stocks can be thought of a levered physical assets, i.e., as a combination

of bonds and physical assets. To calculate the effects of interest rates on

equity values, we simply combine the preceding formulas appropriately.

     Let     be the stream of income associated with the physical assets of

firms in which our hypothetical pension plan holds common stocks. Let                               be

the stream of outstanding liabilities arising from debt contracts of these same

firms. Let      denote the stream of equity income:



           Et — (1—C)(Yt
            t+t                 t+t       t+t
                                                )




(Here, C represents the corporate income tax rate.) Let a denote the debt—

equity ratio of these firms:


                           Vt(Zt)

               (1—C) (Vt(Tt) —
                                     Vt(Zt))

The effect of interest rates on equity values depends upon whether we are in

case 1 or case 2, as defined above.


           Case 1:   £
                         r(Vt
                                (Et)) =   fl    t
                                                    (Zt)




           Case 2: a (V (Et)) =                     (Zt) —   (1+a)Dt (yt)
                     •r t                   t


In case 1, an increase in interest rates tends to improve the asset positions

of pension plans holding stocks. In case 2, the effect is ambiguous. For our

hypothetical calculations, we will take a =
                                                              f, Dt(Zt)     =   5, and   Dt(Yt) = 10.




                                                    23
     Now we assemble the various formulas given above. In year t, unfunded

liabilities, Ut. are given by



          Ut =   Vt(Xt)
                             —
                                  Vt(Bt)
                                               —
                                                   Vtt)       —
                                                                  VtCEt)


Thus, the change in unfunded liabilities (as a proportion of total liabilities)

resulting from a change in the real interest rate is given by


           1+r dU                                        Vt(Bt)
          ______   —=e                                             £r (Vt (Bt))
                    dr            r(Vt ,t)) —
          Vt(Xt)                                         VtO,t)


                                  Vt(Pt)                              Vt(Et)
                              —                £r(Vt (pt))        —
                                                                               r(Vt (Et))
                                                                      Vt(Xt)


For purposes of calculations, we will assume that pension fund assets are

evenly distributed between bonds, real assets, and stocks. Using the formulas

and hypothetical parameter values listed above, we calculate two predicted

responses of unfunded liabilities to changes in the real interest rate,

corresponding to the assumptions of case 1 and case 2.

In both cases, the response of net unfunded liabilities to a one percentage

point change in the interest rate is large.

     Now suppose that recognition and response effects were instantaneous ——

capitalization   of the change is immediate; firms quickly switch to new interest

rites for accounting purposes, and ERISA requires firms to fully fund plans at




                                                         24
 all times. Then the instantaneous response of net contributions to pension

 plans would be enormous. In the more conservative case, following a rise in

 real interest rates of 1 percentage point, contributions would fall by 25

percent of total private savings. Even if adjustments in personal portfolios

offset 80 percent of this, private savings would still fall by five percent.

      Of course, the response will not be instantaneous. While the evidence in

section II suggests that interest rates employed for pension plan accounting do

respond to market rates, they do so slowly. By accounting convention, the

historical costs of bonds, rather than their current market values are used to

compute pension net unfunded liabilities, so relevant bond values do not

immediately reflect changes in market conditions. Finally, ERISA permits firms

to cover unfunded liabilities over relatively long periods. Thus, we would

expect actual unfunded liabilities to be dissipated over a relatively long time

horizon. Nevertheless, the magnitude of funding imbalances builds in

significant downward pressure on rate of contributions in the short run.

      Rather than attempt to flesh out an explicit model of the adjustment

process, we turn directly to empirical evidence. In the following section, we

estimate both the short and long run effects of real interest rate changes on

the accumulation of pension fund assets.


IV.   Empirical   Evidence

      In the preceding sections, we have argued that institutional rules

governing pension funds may significantly depress the response of private

savings to changes in real interest rates, but have offered no direct evidence

to confirm or refute this hypothesis. In this section, we estimate a simple

model of fund accumulation using aggregate time series data. Our estimates

corroborate the existence and magnitude of the effects described in section

III. However, we must stress that we provide no evidence concerning the extent




                                    25
of offsetting adjustments in personal portfolios. Several other papers have

investigated the permeability of the corporate pension veil; in this matter, we

use existing estimates as a guide.


A. Estimation Technique

       Our   object        is to estimate the effect of changes in real interest rates on

gross contributions to pension funds, and to use these estimates to compute the

net effect on fund asset accumulation. To avoid problems with scaling, we will

attempt to explain variations in the ratio of current contributions to current

benefits. According to our model, in steady state this ratio is given by

                C                Vt (L)
                    till                  *
                           = (                =

                Bt

where g(.) is sore function. I is a vector of exogenous variables, and stars

(C)   denote   steady state values. The vector I will include the interest rates

wage growth and employment growth rates (this information determines the value

of the function g), and information concerning the shape of new liability

profiles. In steady state, the values of these variables remain unchanged, so

we may omit a time subscript.

       Since we do not observe the economy in steady state, it is impossible to

estimate (3) directly. One must explicitly describe the process of adjustment

before implementing the model with aggregate time series data.

      As we have remarked in section 111.8, the adjustment to a new steady state

is not instantaneous. Numerous factors induce lagged responses, including

       (1) the adjustment of expectations to a change in the current value of

some variable (real interest rates, or the rate of wage growth);

       (2) the adjustment of assumed parameters used in pension fund accounting

to changes in actual expectations concerning the corresponding market parameters;




                                                  26
       (3) the revaluation of existing assets (such as bonds) under pension fund

accounting conventions; and

       (4) the adjustment of contributions to cover unfunded liabilities under

ERISA regulations. Undoubtedly, there are other sources of lags as well.

Rather than model each separately to allow estimation of a structural model, we

adopt a reduced form specification intended to represent the aggregate effects

of these lags. Specifically.

                             C
             Ct
(4)               =
                      g(1)       A 1t—t



Note that if the vector          has remained at its current rate since the beginning

of tine, CIBt will assume the steady state value associated with X.

      Estimation of this relationship requires several simplifications. First,

we linearize g(.):



            g(X) =     la
Second, we restrict the lag structure, as follows. We allow 110 and          to be

estimated freely, and require that the effects of all right hand side variables

thereafter decline at the conon geometric rate, u (a scalar). That is, for t> 2,



            Pt = ILt_iu



Formally,   it would be easy to allow additional flexibility by estimating (u

      without restriction, and requiring geometric decline thereafter. However,

this consumes valuable degrees of freedom. Given the length of our sample

period, we felt that a relatively restrictive specification was essential.




                                          27
      When these      restrictions are imposed, it is possible to simplify our basic

functional specification, (4), as follows:


             Ct                                                                    ct_i
                         a(l—p)   +A        + ap) +A 1ti"i          —
                                                                        IIII) +
             ç=
As a practical matter, we will recover estimates of u. and the parameter

vectors a.            and p1. by estimating the following relationship:


             Ct                                          Ct_i
                  =         + A        + A 1t—12 +              +
(6)
                      1tO                            U
                                                         B_1

Note that (6) is linear in variables and parameters. Furthermore, (5) implies

no restrictions on the coefficients in (6). Thus, we can estimate (6) using

standard techniques (see below). This will yield an estimate of ji                      directly.
Other primitive parameters can be recovered as follows:



(7)               =
                      o"    —

(9)



      Under the assumption that            is i.i.d. and independent of contemporaneous

right hand side variables (interest rates, wage rates, etc.), equation (5) may

be estimated with ordinary least squares. While the second assumption does not

trouble    us, the     first is a serious concern. Specifically, if               the     are

autocorrelated, C_1lB_ will be             correlated with e, and OLS estimates will be

inconsistent.         Consequently, we   also estimate (6) with two stage least

squares,    instrumenting for C_i/B_i using lagged values of the other


                                             28
independent variables. This produces consistent estimates. However,

consistency is highly sensitive to the functional specification. If our

restrictions on the functional form ire invalid (if. for example, the
                                                                          ui's
decline geometrically after two lags), our instruments will be invalid.

Unfortunately, there are, of necessity, no alternative candidates.


B. Data

     We implement the procedure described above with aggregate U.S. time series

data. Our variables and their sources are as follows.



          —   Annual gross contributions by employers to private pension and

profit sharing plans, as reported in the National Income and Product Accounts

(NIPA) data (see the Survey of Current Business, July issue of each year).

This figure is derived from reporting of contributions on employers' tax

returns. Unfortunately, a breakdown between defined benefit and other plans is

unavailable. The series begins in 1951.


          —   The dollar value of reversions to plan sponsors. Data on

reversions have been collected by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation

since 1980, before which they were not an important phenomenon.


          —   Annual contributions by employers to private pension and profit

sharing plans, net of reversions (Ct =         —
                                           G       Re).

     Bt —     Benefits   paid by private pension and welfare plans, as given in the

NIPA data (see above). This series is constructed primarily from data on

pension income reported on individual income tax returns, and is available

beginning in 1952.

     i —      The nominal rate of interest, defined as the average annual rate

paid on Asa long term corporate bonds.



                                     29
     Vt —   The annual rate of change of wages and salaries for the average

full—time equivalent employee, as measured by the NIPA.


     St — The annual total return (dividends plus capital gains) for the
Standard and Poor's 500 stock index.


     Pt —   The annual rate of inflation, as measured by the year to year

percentage change in the GNP deflator.


Each of these rites (i, v,
                               ' p)    is measured in percentage points, rather

than fractions of unity. We also define the following real rates of interest.

wage—salary growth, and equity return:


             =        —




             =v       —
                          Pt


                      —
          et =   st       Pt


We do not mean these to represent expected real rates in any period. Rather.

they are actual cx post rates. Recall that our specification is designed to

capture various lagged effects, including the adjustment of expectations to

changes in cx post Values.

    Note that most of our data predates flISA. While firms undoubtedly had

greater flexibility in funding pension plans prior to federal regulation, we

suspect that most firms gravitated (however slowly) towards full funding.

Presumably, the existence of ERISA will make pension fund contributions more

responsive to interest rates than these data suggest.




                                  30
C. Estimates and Interpretation

     In this section, we present estimates of equation (6). We toot the vector

of independent variables, I, to include a constant term, the real interest

rate, the real rate of wage—salary growth, the residual real rate of equity

return (see below), and the rate of inflation (for AX. we ommitted the

constant term, for obvious reasons). We constructed the rcsidual rate of

equity return, err. as follows: we regressed the current real rate of equity

return on r. w, and       and set er equal to the fitted residuals. Our

justification for this procedure is that we are interested in all direct

indirect effects of changes in r on rates of contributions. If an unexpected

rise in r causes a change in stock values, thereby altering the value of

pension fund assets, which in turn precipitates adjustments in contributions,

this is a legitimate effect.

     We estimated two versions of equation (6). In the first, we imposed no

constraints on coefficients. In the second, we constrained the coefficient of

r($) to equal the negative of the coefficient of w(P). In the

long run, it is clearly the difference between r and w which is relevant for

determining pension fund balance. Each version of equation (6) was estimated using

both OLS and 2SLS techniques (see subsection A) on aggregate annual time series

data, from 1952 to 1982 (see subsection B). The results are presented in Table 6

     Several aspects of Table 6 deserve immediate comment. Note that the signs

of the coefficients on r. w era. and Pt determine the direction of the long

run effects of these variables on contributions (see equation (7)). Thus, we

see that the long run interest and wage growth effects have the anticipated

signs. In fact, for both instrumented and uninstrumented versions, the

absolute value of the coefficient on r is nearly the same as the coefficient

of w. as predicted, so that imposing this constraint changes the estimates by

negligible amounts. Note that the inflation rate increases long run

contributions (although the effect is not statistically significant in three

out of four equations). Strictly speaking, this is inconsistent with our model

——   the requirement of full funding determines      independent of inflation.

However, in practice, firms may have the ability to somewhat over or underfund

plans in the long run. With higher inflation rates, pension funds form a more

desirable tax dodge; hence, contributions may increase with inflation.

Finally, observe that long—run contributions rise with err. although the

coefficient is only marginally significant. In steady state, changes in er

presumably reflect changes in the risk premium associated with equity. Thus,

the corresponding coefficient implies that contributions increase as the risk

premium associated with equity rises. Perhaps this reflects caution on the

part of firms when facing greater variability on earnings from assets.

       While one might be tempted to interpret the other coefficients in Table 6

directly, this is potentially misleading. Only the primitive coefficients are

easily interpretable, and thus must be recovered by unscrambling our estimates

using equations (7), (8). and (9). Since we are primarily concerned with assessing

the effects of interest rates on contributions, we recover only those primitive

parameters bearing directly on this issue (g, as'. p, and

These estimates, along with asymptotic standard errors, are presented in Table 7.

       To interpret these coefficients, recall our basic specification (equation

(3)). The coefficient       measures the long run impact of the real interest

rate on pension plan contributions (with wages fixed, interest rates do not affect

benefits, the denominator). In particular, the OLS estimates indicate that a one

point increase in the real interest rate will depress CtIBt in the long run

by more than 0.4 (40 percent of benefits). If the long run valne of CtIBt is

effect is 50 percent larger. See below for a more complete discussion.

       The estimates of        and 4 indicate a relatively smooth. monotonic
adjustment of CIBt to its steady state value. In the first year following a

one point rise in the real rate of interest, Ct/Bt changes by r +

For the OLS estimates,            +       — — 0.1, which implies a short run impact

elasticity in the neighborhood of —5 (one quarter of the adjustment in CtIBt

occurs in the first year). For the 2SLS estimates, the impact elasticity is

much higher (approximately —13). and a larger proportion of the adjustment

(more than one third) occurs in the first year. Both OLS and 2SLS estimates

imply that just under half of the adjustment is complete by the second year.

Thereafter, ZSLS      estimates     imply much more rapid adjustment to the steady state

(compare the values of the i').            It is interesting to note that, for the OLS

estimates,         — p g, so that the additional flexibility offered

through inclusion of the lagged parameter makes very little difference.

       To assess more fully the implications of our estimates, we calculate

implied steady state values of (CtIBt) and (At/Bt) under different interest

rate assumptions. As mentioned earlier, the implied steady state value of

(Ct/Be) is given by substituting values of variables and parameters into

equation (4), where Alt           is set equal to zero for all r. Obtaining the

implied steady state value of At/Es is only slightly more difficult. Along any

path, the value of pension assets evolves as follows:

differ from r due to the risk characteristics of this portfolio. Equation

and (11).

       The calculations for these steady state contribution and asset ratios are

presented in Table S. We set the variables appearing in our regression analysis

equal to their recent (20 year) historical averages. Columns designated "initial'

refer to an assumed real interest rate of 0.025. Columns libeled final' refer

to an assumed interest rate of 0.015. We take p —            r   = 0.03. and g = 0.10.   This

assumed rate of real pension benefit growth ray seem quite high, but accords with

historical eiperience. presumably due to the immaturity of most pension programs.

We chose to rake our calculations using the value of g which prevailed for the

sample period, rather than a more "realistic" steady state value, because our esti-

mates may by unreliable in a regime of substantially lower pension benefit growth.

     Recall from our theoretical discussion that the (absolute) long run

interest elasticity of contributions should equal the duration of newly accrued

pension liabilities while the (absolute) long run interest elasticity of assets

should equal the duration of outstanding liabilities. Of course, one must

adjust for the fact that approximately one third of plans are not defined

benefit. Nevertheless, all estimates appear to be roughly consistent with the

magnitudes proposed in section III. Only one anomoly appears: for the 2 SLS

estimates, the implied duration of outstanding liabilities slightly exceeds the

duration of newly accrued liabilities. We suspect that our estimates of
                                                                            (At/Bt)
are not entirely reliable due to the maturation of the pension system during

our sample period, and hope to improve these calculations in further revisions.


V.   Conclusion

     We are reluctant to draw too many strong conclusions at this relatively

preliminary stage in our research. However, the target saving/negative

elasticity of contributions story for defined benefit pension plans seems to

hang together well in both a theoretical and empirical investigation. Real

interest rates have been at record levels for the past three years and the

effect this has had on pension funding has been considerable. The earnings of

pension assets have been much greater than actuarial assumptions with the

result being that a majority of pension funds are fully funded (even at their

still—below--market assumed interest rates) and net contributions are don over

*30 billion dollars since 1982. Net contributions are likely to remain below

the 1982 level because of the considerable lags in the pension actuarial

system. Such recent and increasingly important phenomena as pension

reversions, dedications, and immunizations also reflect tbe gap between market

interest rates and the previously assumed rates, and reinforce the downward

pressure on loanable fund savings from this source.



                                  38
    We developed a simple analytical model which suggested that the long run

percentage responsiveness of contributions to a one percentage point increase

in the interest rate should equal the duration of newly accrued pension

liabilities, and the responsiveness of pension assets should equal the duration

of existing liabilities. The OLS and ZSLS aggregate time series estimates of

our empirical section are remarkably consistent with this model.

     Pension funds are an important institutional feature in U.S. capital

markets. Their operation can, tad we feel has, affected the way the economy

responds to capital formation incentives. In the future, policies which take

into account the operation of pensions should be investigated.
