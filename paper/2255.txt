                       The Stochastic Properties of Velocity:
                                A New Interpretation




                                      ABSTRACT




       A number of recent studies have concluded that velocity for the United

States for the past century displays the characteristics of a random walk

without drift. In this study, we confirm this result for four other countries

for which we have over a century of data — Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden

and Norway.

       One implication of a random walk is that past changes in velocity cannot

be used to predict future changes. However, this does not mean that past

changes   in variables that economic theory deems important determinants of
velocity cannot be   used to predict future changes. In this study we find that

past   changes in the traditional determinants of velocity — permanent   income
and interest rates, as well as a number of institutional variables, can be used
to predict future changes in velocity.

The Stochastic Properties of Velocity: A New Interpretation*

1.   Introduction

     In the last two decades there has been considerable interest in the

stochastic properties of velocity. Research in this area has been

self-contained in the sense that it has been separated from the standard

literature on the determinants of velocity (the demand for money). Here we

attempt to reconcile these two different strands by jointly examining the

stochastic properties of velocity and the influence of the traditional

determinants of velocity, aiming at a synthesis. Practically all work on the

time-series properties of velocity have covered the US experience. Here we

examine not only the evidence from the United States but also the evidence from

other countries, anchoring the analysis in a broad international context.

     The work on the stochastic properties of velocity was started by Gould and

Nelson (1974) who in a seminal article1 questioned the predictive content of

the long run time series of velocity used by Friedman and Schwartz in A

Monetary History of the United States 1867-1960 (1963). According to Gould and

Nelson, the discussion of meaningful patterns in the long-run movement of

velocity, and of deviations from trend taken directly from the time series,

presumes that future velocity behavior can be extrapolated from its past

history. They examined the stochastic structure of velocity 1869 to 1960 to

determine whether a statistical basis can be found for extrapolative

predictions. Zero autocorrelations of the first differences of velocity as

well as an insignificant coefficient on the trend term led them to conclude

that velocity is a random walk without drift.

     Subsequently, Stokes and Neuberger (1979) demonstrated that the Gould and

Nelson result is highly period sensitive. They noted that the 1867-1960 period

covered by Friedman and Schwartz combines three distinct historical periods:
                                           2


1867-79 — the Greenback episode; 1940-60 — World War II and the subsequent

rise in V; and the intermediate gold standard period, 1880-1940. A

reexamination of the evidence for the homogeneous period, 1880-1940, led Stokes

and Neuberger to reverse Gould and Nelson's results — velocity is not a random

walk and the trend has a significant negative coefficient.

     More recently Nelson and Plosser (1982), following a procedure developed

by Dickey and Fuller (1979) have developed an approach distinguishing between

two classes of time series processes: trend stationary, or TS, processes;

differenced stationary or DS processes. A trend stationary (TS) process

characterizes a time series whose deviations from trend are stationary or

self-reversing while a differenced stationary (DS) process characterizes a

nonstationary series which does not revert to trend. A simple example of a DS

process is a random walk.2 The application of tests developed by Nelson and

Plosser to US. velocity data found it to be a DS process, consistent with the

original Gould and Nelson findings.

     In this paper, we follow the tests pioneered for the United States case by

Gould and Nelson, and by Nelson and Plosser, to five countries for which we

have assembled close to a century of data, that is, the United States, Canada,

United Kingdom, Sweden and Norway, from the 1880's to the mid 1970ts. Our

findings for the majority of countries examined here support those of the

earlier studies —     velocity   over the past century is characterize4 by a random

walk without drift.

     A key question that arises from this evidence on the stochastic nature of

velocity is how to reconcile it with evidence that we have found in previous

studies, (Bordo and Jonung, 1981 and Bordo and Jonung, 1987) as have others

(see interalia, Friedman and Schwartz, 1982; and for a survey Laidler, 1985) —
                                          3


that velocity behavior over the past century is well explained by permanent

real income, the interest rate, and by a number of institutional variables.

     An implication of a random walk is that since only the current value of

velocity can be used to predict that of the next period, past values of

velocity should have no influence in prediction. Alternatively changes in

velocity should be random —   future   changes cannot be predicted by past

changes. However, the fact that velocity displays the characteristics of a

random walk does not say that changes in variables which economic theory views

as important determinants of velocity cannot be used to predict future changes.

     We thus proceed in the following way. First, we test whether velocity

follows a random walk, then we test whether changes in velocity can be

explained by past changes in velocity in addition to past changes in a set of

variables which can be viewed as potential important determinants of velocity.

2.   Is Velocity a Random Walk?

     Table 1 reports the results for the five countries for the type of test

conducted by Gould and Nelson. We estimated the regression:

     (1) log V = A + B log Vt_i + u1.
Unlike in Gould and Nelson, regression (1) is expressed in logs rather than

levels to avoid the problem of heteroscedacity.3 Following Gould and Nelson we

test the hypothesis that A is not significantly different from zero and B is

not significantly different from one. To avoid the problem of bias observed in

the use of a standard t distribution in the Gould and Nelson study we compared

the calculated t ratios to the correct distribution suggested by Dickey and

Fuller (1979). t tests based on the Dickey Fuller distribution show that A

differs significantly from zero and B is not significantly different from one

for all countries except the U.S.. A joint F test of the hypotheses that A =
                                         4


0, B = 1 based on a distribution suggested by Dickey and Fuller (1981) confirms

the null hypothesis for all countries except the U.S.

     A key problem with these results is that the distribution of B involves

the true value of A which we do not know. The values calculated in Dickey and

Fuller are valid only under the maintained hypothesis that the true value of A

is zero. Thus the results that the null hypothesis A =    0,   B = 1 is rejected

for the U.S. may reflect either that A is different from zero or B is different
                  4
from 1 or both.

     We next conduct the type of test suggested by Nelson and Plosser (1982).

The test, designed to ascertain whether the time series pattern of velocity can

be characterized as a DS process, is based on the following regression

equation:

     (2) log V=A+B log Vt_i+CT+u2t
where T is a time trend.

     Table 2 reports the results of regressions of equation (2) for the five

countries. The test devised to determine whether (2) can be characterized as a

DS process is B = 1, C =   0.   As in the previous case, we conducted both t tests

and joint F tests using the distributions suggested by Dickey and Fuller. With

the addition of the time trend, the distribution of the test statistics does

not depend on unknown parameters such as the true value of A so interpretation

of the statistics is more clear cut.5.

     Based on t tests, B is not significantly different from one in all five

countries, and C is not significantly different from zero in all except Canada

and Norway. The joint F tests that B = 1, C = 0 is not rejected in all cases

except the U.S. and then only at the ten percent level of significance. These

results suggest that velocity follows a DS process in all five countries. It
                                       5


follows a random walk without drift for all countries except for Canada and

Norway where it follows a random walk with a drift.6

     Considerable recent interest in the relationship of monetary regimes to

macroeconomic performance, combined with the proposal by Stokes and Neuberger

that the stochastic process of velocity may be sensitive to the monetary regime

suggests that we split our data sample for the five countries into two regimes:

the gold standard, encompassing the years up to 1914; and managed money —    the
subsequent period. This demarcation is admittedly rough, since these countries

were on a gold exchange standard for a portion of the interwar period, and were

all part of the gold based Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system over

virtually the whole post-World War II period covered in this study. However in

all five countries the extent to which national money supplies were managed

increased considerably after 1914.

     Under the gold standard, according to Klein (1975), the money supply (in

the U.S.) displayed the properties of a stationary series — with a tendency to

revert to its trend level. This finding reflected the tendency under the gold

standard of gold flows to be self-reversing. Under managed money, according to

Leijonhuvud (1984), the money supply process (in the U.S.) is a nonstationary

series characterized by a random walk in rates of changes.

     In Table 3, we present the results of Nelson and Plosser type regressions

for these two subperiods for our five countries. Based on the Dickey-Fuller

distributions both the "t" and "F" tests indicate that during the gold standard

period the random walk hypothesis is rejected for the U.S. but not for the

other countries.7 In the period of managed money all five countries are

characterized by a DS process.

    These results suggest that for at least one country —    the United States
— the nature of the monetary regime may have influenced the velocity process.
                                      6


Under the gold standard, the predictable nature of the money supply regime may

have made velocity predictable. For the other countries, velocity may have

been unpredictable because theirs were more open economies buffeted both by

real and nominal shocks originating abroad. Under managed money, for all five

countries, the more stochastic nature of the money supply process may also have

influenced the velocity process.

3.   Are Changes in Velocity Predictable?

     Evidence that velocity displays the characteristics of a random walk in

the majority of countries examined here does not mean that velocity is a will

of the wisp, that is, that it merely reflects random walks in nominal income

and money, and hence that the relationship between money and income is totally

unpredictable. Indeed there is a large body of evidence to the contrary

(Friedman and Schwartz, 1982, Poole, 1986). Rather the random walk suggests

that there are numerous forces which systematically affect velocity and it is

impossible without prior information to predict which set of forces is

paramount.8 Thus, for example, an acceleration in money growth will initially

cause velocity to fall (below its trend) but then as holders of cash balances

adjust their actual holdings to the original desired level, velocity will

eventually rise and may even overshoot (Friedman and Schwartz, 1982). If such

a pattern is at work changes in velocity would display negative serial

correlation following a burst of monetary growth. Alternatively-a shock to

aggregate demand raising nominal income without any increase in money growth

would, if it persisted, raise velocity for several periods in a row and, as a

consequence velocity would display positive serial correlation.

     The two types of disturbances may be about equally frequent. When, for

example, a rise in velocity is observed, the rise by itself provides no

predictive information as to whether velocity is likely to rise further or
                                             7



decline. Thus past changes in velocity cannot be used to predict future

changes; but there is no reason why prior information on other variables which

systematically affect velocity may not aid in predicting future changes.

     In what follows we test whether successive past changes in the

determinants of velocity are significant in explaining future changes in

velocity. Initially we estimate two regressions:

     (3) log Vt = A +          log V_1 +     u3
     (4) log V = A +           slog V_1 + B2      log V2 + u4
The results are presented in Table 4. An implication of a random walk in (3)

is that A =
              B1
                   = 0 and in (4) that A =        =   = 0.   As can be seen in Table 4
                                             B1
based on joint F tests, the null hypothesis is accepted for all countries for

equation (3), but when a second lagged term is added in equation (4), the

hypothesis is rejected for Sweden and Norway. The presence of significant

coefficients on both lagged changes in velocity for these countries suggest

that a more complicated autoregressive process may be at work.

     Finally, we include as additional regressors to those in Equation (4)

changes in the long run determinants of velocity isolated in our earlier work

(Bordo and Jonung, 1981). In our previous work, we argued that the secular

pattern of velocity reflects in addition to the standard long-run determinants

— real permanent income and the interest rate — the evolution of
institutional factors. These institutional factors include the processes of:

monetization; the spread of commercial banking; financial development; and

growing economic stability.

     Empirical results in Bordo and Jonung (1981) (for the five countries

discussed above using annual data ove'r the 1870-1975 period) show that

inclusion of proxies for these institutional factors significantly improve a

benchmark regression of velocity on permanent income, interest rates and a
                                            8


variable to capture the business cycle. In addition, in the majority of cases

the institutional variables are of the correct sign and statistically

significant.

      The variables to be included as additional regressors to those of equation
                                                                              -
             red'
(4)   are: y per capita permanent income, i the long term bond yield; cycle the

ratio of measured to permanent per capita income, () the ratio of the labor

force in nonagricultural pursuits to the total labor force — a proxy for

monetization; ()   the     currency money ratio — a proxy for the spread of

commercial banking;               the ratio of total non bank financial assets to
                           TFA
total financial asset — a measure of financial development; and S a six year

moving standard deviation of real per capita income. — a measure of growing

economic stability.9

       Equatin (5) includes as additional regressors to those in (4) changes in

the long-run determinants of velocity discussed above. Inclusion of these

additional independent variables will enable us to ascertain whether prior

changes in velocity's determinants can predict future changes in velocity.10

       Table 5 presents the results of regressions of equation (5). In addition

to the individual coefficients and their t values, we also present for each

determinant the t values of the sum of the lagged coefficients.1'

       For each country significant coefficients (based on t tests of individual

coefficients and on the sum of the coefficients) on a number of the lagged

independent variables were detected. Thus of the traditional determinants of

velocity, significant (at least at the ten percent level) lagged changes can be

found in permanent income for every country; in the cycle variable for the

U.K., Sweden and Norway; and in the interest rate for Norway. Of the

traditional variables significant lagged changes can be detected in ()              for
the U.S. and U.K. and (CIM) for Sweden and Norway.

      These results combined with rejection of the null hypothesis F(A =       0,   B. =

0,   C. =   0...J.   =   0)   and a considerable improvement in   in every country —

compared to the equations in Table 4 including only lagged changes in velocity

as regressors — suggests that prior knowledge of changes in velocity's
                                                                        12
determinants improves predictions of future changes in velocity.

Conclusions

      In sum, the results over the past century for the five countries in our

study, with application of the approaches of Gould and Nelson, Nelson and

Plosser, confirm for all five their characterization of the behavior of

velocity as a random walk. For the gold standard subperiod velocity displays a

random walk for all countries except the U.S. but for the period of managed

money velocity is a random walk in all countries. The fact that velocity

behavior in the U.S. becomes unpredictable after the demise of the gold

standard may be a consequence of the switch to a more unpredictable monetary

regime.

     An implication of the random walk hypothesis is that past changes in

velocity cannot be used to predict future changes. Our tests of this

implication were confirmed for three countries but not for Sweden and Norway.

This result may reflect a more complicated autoregressive process in these

countries.

     Finally, we demonstrated that though for the majority of the five

countries future changes in velocity cannot be predicted by past changes in

velocity alone, changes in the determinants of velocity can in every country be

used to predict future changes in velocity. Thus changes in velocity are

better predicted given prior information, and the random walk hypothesis is

consistent with our earlier findings on the long-run determinants of velocity.

     These results point to the limitations on the use of simple univariate

time series models such as the random walk to explain the evolution of

important economic variables, since these models run the risk of omitting such

key factors as the long-run determinants of velocity discussed above.

         experimented with lags of two, three and four years. Based on an F

test, the two year lag performed best.

         a test of the monetarist hypothesis that   velocity   changes can be

predicted by past accelerations in money growth (Friedman and Schwartz 1982,

Taylor, 1976), we also experimented with lagged accelerations in money growth

as additional explanatory variables in the regressions explaining velocity

change. We obtained a significant (at the five percent level) negative

coefficient for a two year lagged acceleration in money growth for the U.S. and

a significant negative coefficient for a one year lagged acceleration for

Norway, thus confirming Taylor's results. However, for the other countries

this variable was insignificant.
