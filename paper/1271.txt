                          Family Labor Supply With Taxes

                                    ABSTRACT




     Over the period 1960 — 1983 the proportion of federal tax revenue raised by

taxation of labor supply has risen from 57-77 percent. In this paper, we specify

and estimate a model of family labor supply which treats both federal and state

taxation. Husbands and wives labor supply are treated jointly rather than in a

separate manner as in previous research. A method to calculate the virtual wage

for nonworking spouses is used within a utility maximizing framework to treat

correctly the joint family labor supply decision. Joint family efforts are found

to be important. The efficiency cost (deadweight loss) of labor taxation is

estimated to be 29.6% of tax revenue raised. The effect of the new 10% deduction

to ease the marriage tax for working spouses leads to a prediction of 3.8%

increase in wives labor supply and a .9% decrease in husbands labor supply.

Overall taxes paid are predicted to decrease by 3.4%.

        Taxes on labor supply raise the largest proportion of federal tax revenue.

Over the period 1960—1983, this proportion has increased from 57 to 77 percent.

While the income tax has increased moderately as a proportion of federal tax

revenue, the payroll tax has more than doubled as a proportion of all taxes. In

1980, approximately 50 percent of federal tax revenues was raised by the

individual income tax. The individual income tax is a progressive tax on labor

and non-labor income which is based on the notion of 'ability to pay'. We

finance Social Security by the payroll tax, FICA, which is a proportional tax

with an upper limit. As both the tax rate and upper limit have grown rapidly in

recent years, FICA taxes have become the subject of much controversy. In 1980,

FICA taxes represented 28 percent of total Federal tax revenue. In Table 1, the

income tax and payroll tax revenues are given for the period 1960—1980. It is

interesting to note that over the same period while the marginal income tax of

the median taxpayer remained constant, the FICA tax rate more than doubled. At

the same time, the earnings limit rose about 220% in constant dollars. Over the

sanie   20 year period, the corporate income tax has decreased from 24% to 13% of
Federal tax revenues. Likewise, excise taxes have decreased from 13% to 5%.

Thus, taxes on labor supply currently amount to about 3/4 of Federal taxes

raised.'     The potential effects on labor supply and economic welfare are

important because of the large and increasing reliance on direct taxation.

        In Table 2, we provide a summary of marginal tax rates for the period 1950-

1980. These rates are for married households filing jointly. We also give the

CPI and median family income so that valid comparisons across different years can

be made. First, note that the tax system between 1950—1980 was only imperfectly

indexed for inflation. The median income family faced a marginal tax rate of 17%

in 1950, but multiplied by the change in the CPI, this amount faced a marginal

rate of 21% in 1980. Similarly $10,000 of earned income in 1950 had a marginal

tax rate of 24% in 1950, but adjusted for inflation, the marginal tax rate

increased to 37%   in   1980. Similar increases in marginal tax rates occurred over

the period 1960-1980 and 1970-1980. Of course, this imperfect indexation

corresponds to greater progressivity which may have been the intent of Congress

over the period although the marked increase in tax preference items would lead

to lower actual progressivity. Another interesting finding which emerges from

Table 2 is the significantly higher marginal tax rates faced by the median family

over the period. The marginal tax rate increased from 17% in 1950 to 28% in

1980. Note that under the tax reform of 1981, marginal rates will drop

substantially by 1984 due to the 25% tax reduction. Much of the 'bracket creep'

of the past decade will be eliminated. Under current legislation, the income tax

system is scheduled to be indexed beginning in 1985. Also, beginning this year,

a 10% deduction for two earner couples up to a limit of $30,000 exists. This

deduction reduces the effects of the 'marriage tax' which arises due to the

progressive structure of the income tax. We estimate the effect of this new

     deduction on the labor supply of families given our results in the current

paper. Appropriate economic techniques to measure the effect of taxation need to

treat the non-linearity of the budget sets which arises due to the non-constancy

of the marginal after tax wage.2 Recent econometric research has developed

techniques which takes account of this non—linearity and the related situation

that the marginal wage rate is jointly determined with the amount of labor

supply. In this paper, we extend the recent work to account for the

interdependent nature of family labor supply decisions, rather than treating

husbands and wives separately. The effect of taxation has potentially important

effects here since the labor supply of the husband affects the marginal tax rate

of the wife and vice versa. Fixed costs of work may also have an important role

here, especially as they interact with the tax system. Therefore, we combine

joint family decisions with the effects of the tax system. When we combine these

approaches, an additional theoretical and econometric problem arises. For non—

working spouses, the appropriate 'virtual' wage must be estimated since this wage
                                                           3


enters the labor supply function of the working spouse. The notion of the

'virtual' wage arises in the theory of rationing and is analogous to the notion

of virtual income, previously used in models of labor supply with taxes.3 That

is, the 'virtual' wage is that wage which would cause the individual to choose to

work exactly zero hours with a tangency of the family indifference curve and the

budget set which is determined by the net after tax wage of the working spouse,

the 'virtual' wage of the non—working spouse, and the virtual income of the

family. The treatment of joint family labor supply with taxation and with the

use of the correct virtual wage for non—working spouses is the main contribution

of this paper.

     The plan of the paper is a follows: In the next section, we describe our

econometric model of joint family labor supply with taxation. In Section 3, we

describe our treatment of' both federal and state taxation. We also present our

empirical results and estimate the effect of the recent change in the taxation of

two earner families. In Section 4, we consider the problem of what labor supply

curve is being estimated. We also indicate how our model can be extended to an

intertemporal context which is the focus of our on—going research.



I. Econometric Specification

     We have specified a new indirect utility function for the multiple good

case. Specifications that have been previously used impose constraints on the

supply functions across goods that are improbable in the joint labor supply of

husbands and wives. In our sample, almost all of the men work but only half of

the women do. Wives who do work, work approximately half as many hours as

working husbands. Clearly, the supply behavior is very different among husbands

and wives and the parametric specification must be able to accommodate this.

    Our indirect utility function has the following functional form:


(1) V(w1,w2,y)    exp (1w1+2w2)(y+ee-o1w1+ ô2w2+.5(y1w + y2w + aw1w2))
or more simply,
                                                               4


     (2) V(w1,w2 ,y)                exp (1w1+2w2)y*(w1,w2,y)
where O,p1,2,ô1,ô2,y1,y2, and a are parameters of the indirect utility function,

the w's are the respective net wages, and y is the virtual income. Direct

These supply equations have the simple form of being linear in virtual income and

quadratic in wages, where the quadratic terms appear in y. Furthermore, this

functional form allows each equation to have its own intercept and income

coefficient. The equations are second order flexible and have the convenient

property that non-linearity arises only in products of coefficients which makes

econometric estimation considerably easier than with other flexible functional

forms.

     Nevertheless, their derivation from an indirect utility function places

constraints on these supply equations. That is, our model of family labor supply

assumes maximization of a joint family utility function so that the restrictions

imposed by economic theory apply. Because the indirect utility function must be

non—decreasing in wages, and both compensated supply equations must be upward

sloping despite the quadratic wage terms that allow backward bending labor

supply. One should note that although the supply equations appear conventional,

the individual parameters in these equations do not have conventional functions

of only eight parameters. For example, the derivative of h1 with respect to

is

            (4)       p181 +   y1+ft(y1w1
                                               +       a w2)

which depends on parameters that one might associate soley with income or w2

Combining the supply equations with the budget constraint

         (5) x y +      w1h1
                                +
                                    w2h2

completely characterizes the behavior of the household. The direct utility
function can 'be derived by solving these three equations for hi ,   h2, and x as
                                                           5



functions of w1 , w2, and y and direct substitution into the indirect utility

function. The direct utility function is needed to predict behavior when one or

both spouses are not working or in the presence of fixed costs. It is convenient

to express the direct utility function implicity as follows: Given h1 ,h2 , and

x, both y and w2 can be expressed as linear functions of w1. Substituting these

linear relationships into the first supply equation yields a quadratic function

in    that is easily solved: one chooses the root that corresponds to an upward

sloping supply. Recursive solution for w2, y, and, finally, utility yields the

direct utility function.

     The labor supply functions of equation (3) yield the hours that maximize the

direct utility function if the budget frontier is linear. This occurs when the

net wages are constant for all hours worked and there are no fixed costs incurred

by working. But the introduction of taxes leads to a non—linear budget set. It

is necessary to know the direct utility function in order to determine the hours

of the husband and the wife predicted by utility maximization over a non—linear

budget frontier because simple revealed preference arguments cannot determine

global maxima in utility. The exception to this rule occurs when the budget

frontier is globally convex. The argument in Hausman (1979) continues to work

for the multiple good case.

     For the tax schedules faced by couples the maximization of utility can be

broken up into maximization over convex subsets of the budget frontier followed

by maximization of utility over the entire set of solutions. Each income bracket

is a convex subset of the budget frontier that has a relatively simple utility

maximum. Within an income bracket, net wages and, consequently, virtual (non—

labor) income are constant so that locally the budget frontier is the

conventional linear budget constraint. This budget constraint must include,

however, non—negativity constraints on hours worked by each member of a couple

and income constraints that define the tax bracket.
                                                           6



     The utility maximum on such convex sets as an income bracket of the tax

schedule does not require the utility function. First, we compute the

unconstrained solution using the supply equations. If this solution falls within

the income bracket, then this solution is obviously the constrained maximum, too.

Otherwise, the utility maximum occurs on a boundary. One, two, or three of the

constraints may be violated. Let us examine each case in turn. If only one

constraint is violated by the supply equations, then convexity of the direct

utility function and the budget set ensures that the constrained solution lies on

the corresponding linear boundary. The boundary solution can be found by

substituting the boundary constraint directly into the system of supply equations

and the budget constraint and solving for the virtual wages and income in the

same manner as we described for deriving the utility function. The constrained

solution corresponds to the unconstrained hours supplied at these virtual wages

and income.

     On a boundary corresponding to zero hours, the wage for the working spouse

and the virtual income correspond to the observed ones. Therefore, one solves

the quadratic in the virtual wage of the person not working formed by their

supply equation to obtain the constrained maximizing point. On the income

bracket boundary, the ratio of the virtual wages must be equal to the slope of

the hours trade—off and total consumption is fixed by the total income

constraint. These two constraints also lead to a quadratic equation in a virtual

wage that leads to the constrained optimal hours. These closed form solutions

are a special feature of our parameterization. Other choices of functional forms

for labor supply can lead to extremely difficult systems of equation for which no

closed form exist.

     If the boundary solutions do not satisfy one of the other constraints, then

the constrained solution lies at the vertex where the constraints are

simultaneously satisfied. When two constraints are violated by the unconstrained

solution, then the constrained solution may rest on either boundary or the common
                                                               7


vertex.    Again, convexity ensures that only one boundary solution will be

feasible. Finally, three constraints will be violated by the unconstrained

solution if both supply equations yield negative hours. The constrained solution

will lie on the lower income boundary or one of the couple will not work. One

must examine all three cases to find the single, feasible solution.

       The stochastic specification which we use allows for a truncated bivariate

normal distribution to represent the deviation between actual and desired hours

and measurement errors. The truncation arises because of the lower limit of zero

hours of work. Therefore, the likelihood function is a bivariate Tobit model

where none, one, or both of the stochastic terms may be truncated. An individual

may not work either because the preferred hours are zero or because the

realization   of the stochastic term is sufficiently negative to induce zero hours.
We include fixed costs to working for the wife as   in   Hausman (1981a) but we do
not   allow for preference variation through a distribution of parameters as

Hausrnan did in his earlier work. The parameter estimates are unconstrained as

we do not impose the global integrability conditions of economic theory beyond

those incorporated into the indirect utility function of equation (1).



II. Estimation Results

      Our sample is drawn from the 1976 wave of the Michigan Panel Study of Income

Dynamics. It consists of 1991 couples that remained after removing the self—

employed and farming families and those observations that were missing data on

socio—economic explanatory variables. We eliminated any household which

contained an individual who claimed to work in excess of 4,000 hours per year.

We also truncated the sample based on the observed wages, requiring wages of both

husband and wife to be less than twenty dollars. The missing wages for women who

were not working were estimated by a standard sample selection model using the

wage data of the working women.5 For the tax calculations which define the non-

linear budget sets the basic federal income tax schedule is parameterized by 13

income brackets and marginal tax rates. The first bracket is $1,000 wide and

succeeding brackets, starting at $4,000 each of which is then $4,000 wide. This

representation of the federal tax system is the same parameterization used by

Hausman (1981a) for married couples filing joint returns. Unlike Hausman,

additional brackets were introduced to the federal scheme to accommodate

progressive state taxes on earned income, which were present in 35 states. Five

states had taxes strictly proportional to earned income and eleven states had

zero marginal tax rates in 1976.

        Non—convexities in the budget set appear because of FICA, the earned income

credit, and standard deductions. Social Security (FICA) contributions were 5.85

percent up to a limit of $14,110 for 1976 causing the marginal tax rate to fall

at that point. The earned income credit rises up to $4,000 of gross income and

is exhausted at $8,000. Thus an additional non-convexity appears at $8,000 net

of non—labor income. Finally, federal and some state tax schedules allow

personal exemptions that have upper and lower limits based on gross income that

introduce non—convexities. For example, the federal standard deduction reached

a maximum of $2,600 at $16,250. But for married couples filing jointly the

standard deduction was $1 ,900 for incomes less than $1 1 ,875 and became 1 6 percent

of income up to $16,250. This creates a non-convexity at approximately $12,000

where the marginal tax rate falls 84 percent. We assumed that every couple filed

jointly. For each state, personal exemptions and tax credits for married

couples and dependents were allocated when they were available. In addition, the

family is assumed to incur fixed costs when the wife works that reflect the costs

of child and house care, as well as social convention. This creates additionél

non-convexities in the budget frontier along the plane of zero hours for the

wife.

        The estimation results for the labor supply functions of equation (3) and

the associated indirect utility function of equation (1) are given in Table 3.

The method of estimation is maximum likelihood. Person I is assumed to be the
                                                            9


husband. Note that the coefficients for both virtual income and the own wage

effect and cross wage effect are quite precisely estimated. The coefficient for

virtual income for husbands equals -.147 and is quite close to the mean of the

distribution estimated by Hausman (1981a) where he estimated husbands labor

supply independent of the labor supply behavior of wives.6 The mean income

elasticity in the sample for husbands is estimated to be —.101 which again

demonstrates the importance of taking account of taxes in models of labor supply.

Since the net wage enters y in equation (3), we use equation (4) to calculate

the derivative of hours of labor supply with respect to the wage. The mean

derivative equals —.016

which corresponds to an elasticity of — .034 which is slightly greater than

Hausman (1981a) found. The restriction from economic theory that the compensated

demand curve be upward sloping is satisfied for hours greater than 231 .   This
restriction is satisfied for almost all the predicted hours which have a mean of

2140 and for actual hours which have a mean of 2129 hours. The mean derivative

of the cross wage effect for men is —.382. However, the estimate is not

significantly different from zero. Nevertheless, it is possible that this

finding may arise from the correct treatment of virtual wages for non—working

wives.

     The coefficient for virtual income for wives is estimated to be —.316 which

is about 2 1/2 times larger than the results from T{ausman (1981a) where husband's

labor supply is taken as exogenous in the determination of the wife's labor

supply. The mean elasticity estimate of .360 is quite similar to the Hausman

(1981a) result because here family virtual income is used in the elasticity

calculation. The average own wage effect is calculated to be .385 which leads to

an elasticity of .757 which is below the previous estimate of .906. However, a

substantial own wage elasticity still exists for wives. The mean cross wage

effect is estimated to be -.104 with an elasticity of —2.36. As with the

husband's cross wage effect, this estimate demonstrates the importance of the
                                                           10

spouse's wage. It is interesting to note that a 1% change in the mean husbands

wage leads to a predicted decrease of 30.9 hours for the average wife while if

the wife's response is conditioned on the husbands behavior as in previous

Hausman (1981a) models, the predicted reduction would be 47.2 hours.

The predictions are of similar size but the response in the joint labor supply

model is somewhat less as would be expected.

     Since symmetry has been imposed by the specification of' the indirect utility

function of equation (1), the only other restriction of economic theory is the

positive definiteness of the Slutsky matrix. That is, both compensated labor

supply curves must be upward sloping which is a restriction found to be violated

in many labor supply studies for men which ignore taxes. Also the compensated

cross wage elasticity cannot be too large. At the mean of the data both

compensated demand curves and the determinant of the Slutsky matrix are all

significantly greater than zero when tested at the .0 level. The positivity

restrictions are also satisfied at almost all the data points. We conclude that

our estimation results do not reject the economic theory of joint household

maximization.

     We now consider the economic welfare and labor supply effects of the tax

treatment of families. Using the indirect utility function of equation (1), we

calculate the deadweight (DWL) loss of the taxation of labor income with the

approach of Hausman (1981a, 1981b). The ratio of DWL to tax revenues is

estimated to be 29.6% which should be compared to 28.7% for males and

approximately 58% for wives estimated by Hausman (1981a). Again, we find a

rather high cost in efficiency for the progresivity of the tax system. We next

consider the effect of the 10% deduction introduced in 1983 to reduce the

marriage tax.7 It should be noted that we apply the 10% reduction to the 1976

tax rates of our sample rather than the actual 1983 situation. We estimate that

wives labor supply will increase by 3.8% while husband hours decrease by .9%.

Overall taxes paid decrease by 3.4%.
                                                             11


To compare the desirability of the change on efficiency grounds, we would need to

know the DWL of marginal tax revenues raised by other means to compensate for the

tax reduction here. But, the equity grounds for a reduction in the marriage tax

are quite strong.8



                     versus   Uncomped   Labor Supply Curves and the Income Effects
of Taxation:

     Two related arguments sometimes arise in the estimation of labor supply

functions. The first argument is that what we measure are actually compensated

(Hicksian) labor supply curves which therefore contain only substitution, but no

income, effects. The second argument is that a change in income taxation will

induce only substitution effects so that the change in labor supply has a

determinate direction, rather than being composed of potentially offsetting

income and substitution effects. These argwnents are usually associated with the

analysis of Milton Friedman (1949, 1976, Chapter 3)•9 The basic idea is that the

goods and services which the government provides with the tax revenues will need

to be replaced by the private economy when the taxes are reduced. The production

possibility frontier of the economy thus remains unchanged. The argument is then

made that income effects do not exist in this 'general equilibrium' analysis so

that only substitution effects are measured or of importance in the analysis of

changes in tax policy.

     Strictly construed, this argument will only hold in a one consumer economy.

In a times series regression of a so—called representative consumer model, it

might be argued that the government expenditure exactly duplicates the

individuals preferences. But this position is untenable in a cross-setion

regression of non—identical individuals. In this situation, note that all

individuals receive the public goods provided by the government irrespective of

their actual labor supply, Therefore, the statistical experiment being

undertaken is to compare sample points which have different after tax net wages

and different virtual incomes, but receive identical amounts of public goods.
                                                           12



The presence of an income effect is then immediate because of the different

levels of utility that the individuals or families reach. The Friedman argument

would seem to require that all families are on the same indifference curve which

certainly does not hold here. Therefore, the argument that the compensated labor

supply curve is being estimated does not stand examination in the typical context

of estimation of labor and supply with taxation.

     The second argument is that only substitution effects are relevant in the

consideration of changes in income taxation. The key consideration here

involves what is being held constant. Richard Nusgrave in his classic treatise

(1959) discusses the various possibilities and recommends the comparison of

"alternative methods of tax financing a given level of real expenditures".

(pg. 212). Income effects are clearly of importance in this situation. Hausman

(1981a) compares the labor supply effects and welfare effects of a switch from

the current tax system to an equal yield progressive linear income tax. The

level of public goods provision is being held constant and income effects occur

across different individuals as they shift from their current indifference curves

to their new indifference curves under the new tax system. The importance of

heterogeneity among individuals is ignored in the Friedman—type arguments. The

one case where the analysis becomes more difficult is when a tax change with

respect to the income tax is being considered without a compensating change in

other taxes to hold total revenue constant. But even here the argument that only

substitution effects exist is not correct in general. In fact, in the most

recent observation of a major tax change, the level of' government expenditure has

changed by only a small amount with respect to the decrease in government

revenues. Again, income effects would be important in the analysis of the income

tax cuts, although a confirmed believer of the Barro—Ricardo analysis might argue

that no effective decrease in taxes has taken place because of the concurrent

increase in the deficit.

IV. Conclusion:

     We have estimated a joint model of family labor supply with taxes taking

appropriate account of virtual income introduced by the tax system and virtual

wages for non-working spouses. We now intend to extend our model to make it

consistent within a life cycle framework. Richard Blundell and Ian Walker

(1983) have demonstrated how to embed the cross section framework within a life

cycle model by the use of a two stage bugdeting approach. To add taxes to the

model we would use the labor supply functions of equations (3) with virtual

income replaced by virtual income plus the change in assets minus after tax

property income. Therefore, the life cycle approach substitutes the change in

assets for property income, although the tax system still taxes the latter

amount. Preliminary estimates indicate that the general results of Table 3 do

not change. Significant income effects continues to appear for both husbands and

wives as do own wage effects for wives and cross wage effects for both husbands

and wives. But all these results should be taken as first attempt to introduce

the U.S. tax system into a joint family labor supply model. Continued research

on the influence of functional form and the effect of life cycle decisions is

needed.

1. Of course, not all income tax revenue is a tax on labor supply because of th
        taxation of capital income which was about 12% of adjusted gross income in
        1980. Also, a portion of the incidence of FICA taxes fall on the employer
        although the amount is likely to be small.


2. For recent reviews of research in this field, see Hausrnan (1983) and Mark
        Killingsworth (1983).


3.   The use of virtual prices in rationing was introduced by E. Rothbarth (1941).
        Recent treatments are given by Peter Neery and Kevin Roberts (1980) and by
        Deaton and John Muellbauer (1980). Note that the virtual wage is not the
        same as the reservation wage in a model with fixed costs and taxes, c. f.
        Hausman (1980).


4. The presence of fixed costs to working for the wife are the one asymmetrical
        part of our specification. However, in the absence of preference
        variation they seem to have an important role in the explanation of the
        difference in labor force participation between spouses.
