                                             ABSTRACT

The paper provides and empirical characterization of fiscal policy in the euro area and in a group of
twenty-two OECD economies over the period from 1970 until 2007. Using the cyclically-adjusted
fiscal balance we document that policy in the euro area has been mildly pro-cyclical. The adoption
of the common currency and the constraints imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact have not had
a large impact on the cyclical behavior of the structural balance. In contrast, over the past ten years
US fiscal policy has become highly countercyclical, which was due predominantly to discretionary
changes in tax policies. However, the component of the budget due to automatic stabilizers reacts stronger
in the euro-area countries than in the US. We also document the primary balance in the OECD economies
is more sensitive to output growth rather than to the output gap, which calls into question the common
practice of adjusting structural balances by using elasticities with respect to the output gap.

1. Introduction

The creation of a single currency in Europe has been accompanied by some major

changes in the institutional setting for fiscal policy. In this chapter we ask whether the

new institutional framework has led to a change in the conduct of fiscal policy in the

members of the euro area. The run up to the launch of the euro was already difficult and

driven by the strict criteria defined by the Maastricht Treaty. Because this was a process

driven by entry requirements, limited attention was paid to the long-run optimality of

these conditions. With the introduction of the euro in January 1999 the issues became

broader and moved from a matter of debate in the academic profession to a real-time

challenge for policy-makers. Within the first years of the EMU, the framework for fiscal

policy embedded in the Stability and Growth Pact has been subjected to many criticisms

and has certainly failed to provide a credible framework for the conduct of fiscal policy.

Although the Pact was intended to be conducive to an environment of discipline,

coordination, and stability, its constraints became binding for several countries and

presented challenges to macroeconomic stability and to the credibility of the Pact at the

very early years of the EMU.

       We review the behavior of fiscal policy after the introduction of the euro in

several dimensions: procyclicality, volatility, coordination, and the role of automatic

stabilizers. We characterize how the common currency and the constraints associated to

the Stability and Growth Pact have shaped fiscal policy among the members of the union.

The focus of the paper is not so much in providing yet another discussion on the merits

and the faults of the Stability and Growth Pact and how it could be reformed. We are

after characterizing the behavior of fiscal policy and understanding whether from the




                                                                                             1
perspective of the euro and monetary policy there should be any strong concerns about

this behavior. Is the ECB being hurt by the behavior of fiscal policy? Does monetary

policy have to compensate for the poor behavior of fiscal policy? In that sense, we see

our analysis as taking place at the aggregate level more than at the national level.

Nevertheless, given that there are no fiscal policy decisions taking place at the level of

the monetary union, we also report results related to the behavior of fiscal policy at the

national level.

       Our results show that despite the significant change in the institutional setting, the

cyclical behavior of fiscal policy in the euro area is mildly procyclical and has not

changed much since the introduction of the new currency. In contrast, US fiscal policy

has become distinctly countercyclical over the period 1999 to 2007. We also document

that there has been a broad-based decline in the volatility of discretionary fiscal policy in

all major economies. This decline is quite substantial for the euro area and is present in

the majority of the member states. Furthermore, the discrepancy of fiscal policy across

euro-area countries – measured by the dispersion of cyclically-adjusted balances – has

decreased threefold since 1999.

       The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we provide an assessment

of the debates around fiscal policy as well as an overview of the academic literature. In

Section 3 we characterize the behavior of fiscal policy at the euro level and we compare it

to policy dynamics in the US and other OECD economies. Section 4 asks the question

whether the correct cyclical measure is the output gap or output growth. In Section 5 we

discuss coordination of fiscal policies and Section 6 concludes.




                                                                                             2
2. The debates on fiscal policy

The fiscal framework of the Maastricht Treaty and the introduction of the euro generated

a renewed interest in fiscal policy and in the design of institutions that promote good

policies. The first problem in the analysis of the recent experience in the euro area comes

from the observation that it is difficult to reach a consensus on what constitutes good

fiscal policy and what should be the appropriate policy stance giving economic

conditions. Our approach is to focus on a set of particular behaviors of fiscal policy that

have been analyzed previously in the literature and that can be linked potentially to a

broad set of theoretical frameworks that study biases in fiscal policy.

        We characterize the performance of fiscal policy authorities and the environment

in which they operate along three main dimensions: (1) Long-term sustainability of fiscal

policy; (2) The behavior of fiscal policy over the business cycle; (3) Volatility (i.e.

changes in fiscal policy that are exogenous to the cycle). Implicitly, we assume that good

fiscal policy must be sustainable, possibly countercyclical (but also could be acyclical)

and it should not be a significant source of volatility.

        We start with an overview of the debates on these topics and a brief review of the

academic literature. We also offer a short discussion of the rules and institutions designed

to constrain fiscal policy discretion. The analysis is framed in the context of EMU. In the

next section we empirically characterize each of the fiscal policy behaviors we describe

here.




                                                                                              3
2.1. Sustainability of fiscal policy

Long-term sustainability is central to the institutional setting of fiscal policy in EMU and

one of the biggest concerns of both policy makers and academics. For emerging markets,

confidence in the sustainability of government budgets has direct effects on interest rates

and economic performance. Many of the deepest crises in these countries have been

characterized by large increases in the risk premium or defaults on government debt.

        In developed countries, the concerns started with the increase in government debt

levels in the mid-70s and while these levels have stabilized or have even gone down in

recent years, the uncertainty of the consequences of future demographic changes has kept

the debate alive.

        The difficulty of governments to produce sustainable budgetary plans became

known in the academic literature as the deficit bias of governments (Persson and

Svensson (1989) and Alesina and Tabellini (1990)). This deficit could be due to the

common pool problem or the strategic behavior of politicians in power as they tie the

hands of the new elected governments or simply a sign of short sightedness of policies

(for a survey of the theoretical literature see Persson and Tabellini (2001)).

        In the EMU context, the Maastricht Treaty identifies sustainability as the most

important bias to deal within the context of a single-currency area. What is the economic

rationale for such a concern in a monetary union? Unsustainable fiscal policy may

generate excessive macroeconomic volatility, which in turn will complicate the goal of

the central bank in maintaining stability within the EMU. The potential tension between

fiscal and monetary authorities is present in any economy but these tensions might be




                                                                                           4
more relevant for a monetary union where fiscal policy is decentralized and coordination

might be more difficult or simply not in the interest of national governments.

       This view has been articulated explicitly by the ECB in their statements where the

“sustainability of public finances” is seen as the main goal of the fiscal framework. And

the logic is that “sound fiscal policies and a monetary policy geared to price stability are

fundamental for the success of a Monetary Union. They are prerequisites for

macroeconomic stability and cohesion in the euro area” (Statement of the Governing

Council of the ECB, March 21 2005).

       Under extreme circumstances, unsustainable fiscal policy plans can lead to a

deterioration of credibility and the expectation that monetary policy will bail out

governments by creating unexpected inflation. In the context of a shared currency it can

be that this bias becomes stronger as governments do not internalize the consequences of

their behavior on the credibility of the common currency. This could create externalities

in terms of credibility or simply through interest rate channels. Although this is a

possibility, the academic literature does not reach a consensus neither on whether these

externalities matter nor on their size.

       While sustainability relates to the long-term behavior of fiscal policy, it is

connected in many ways to the discussions around business cycle stabilization policies.

The lack of discipline in fiscal policy can make the macroeconomic management of the

economy difficult. First, from a dynamic point of view, if governments face debt levels

which are unsustainable, they will have very little room to use automatic stabilizers in

bad times so all the pressure will fall on monetary policy to smooth the business cycle.

As such, a combination of high deficits and procyclical fiscal stance amplifies economic




                                                                                               5
fluctuations because it reduces the effectiveness of automatic stabilizers (as argued by

Melitz (2000) and Perry (2002)). Second, unsustainable plans will have to turn into

sustainable ones by fiscal consolidations that are likely to have a short-term effect on the

economy. Finally, high debt levels lead to higher interest rate and lower investment and

growth (Mankiw and Elmendorf (1999) provide a survey of the empirical literature). Of

course, a deterioration of macroeconomic performance might not have a direct impact on

the conduct of monetary policy but there is, however, the argument that favorable

macroeconomic conditions can make the running of monetary policy easier from a

political point of view. For example, in the presence of inflationary pressures, fiscal

prudence will reduce the need to increase interest rates.

       There is yet another connection between sustainability and the cyclical stance of

fiscal policy; one that is related to the design and implementation of budgetary plans.

When it comes to the discussions on what constitutes a sustainable fiscal policy, there is

the need to measure, characterize and monitor annual budgets. Because of the short-term

fluctuations in budgets due to automatic stabilizers, there is the need to capture the

structural balance in a given year, i.e. the budget balance adjusted for cyclical changes.

Without a proper understanding of how fiscal policy behaves over the business cycle, it is

impossible to provide long-term guidance to budgetary plans. This has been one of the

major difficulties of the implementation of the limits on deficits and debt of the

Maastricht Treaty. While they were based on simple principles of sustainability, there

were endless discussions on the special circumstances that had led to balances that did

not corresponded with the projected levels. The 2005 reform of the Stability and Growth

Pact allowed for a more flexible interpretation of the limits that takes into account the




                                                                                               6
cyclical position of the economy. There is, however, no consensus on how this

adjustment needs to be made and some see this flexibility as a relaxation of the

constraints.

        In summary, although the main concern of the EMU fiscal policy framework was

long-term sustainability, the implementation of the rules have led to debates that have

focused much more on the cyclical behavior of fiscal policy. We now turn to this debate.



2.2. Fiscal policy stance and management of business cycles

Although there is a large body of theoretical literature on fiscal policy, it is difficult to

provide an easy characterization of what the appropriate behavior of fiscal policy over the

business cycle should be. A starting framework could be one of tax smoothing as in Barro

(1979). Within that framework we can find a pattern of cyclical fluctuations of the budget

as distortionary taxes are kept constant and the balance has to absorb changes in other

revenues or expenditures or changes in taxes that follow the stochastic properties of the

cyclical shocks (as in Chari, Christiano and Kehoe (1994)). Within the context of

Keynesian models, and under the assumption that consumers are liquidity-constrained, it

is expected that governments run deficits during bad times and surpluses during good

times as this policy will help to stabilize the economy.

        From the perspective of monetary policy, high deficits can lead to inflationary

pressures and might force the ECB to keep interest rates higher than what they otherwise

would be. Of course, it has to be that these high deficits take place at a time when they

are not needed, which leads to the discussion on what is the appropriate stance of fiscal

policy during the cycle. This is relevant for economies where fiscal and monetary




                                                                                                7
policies are decided at the same level but it might become more acute when we have a

scenario of a monetary union. The decentralized nature of national budgets can make the

coordination of policies more difficult.

       Beyond the theoretical discussions, the issue of the cyclicality of fiscal policy has

received much attention in the empirical literature. There is strong evidence that fiscal

policy tends to less countercyclical than what normative models suggest. In fact, in many

cases, fiscal policy is procyclical, which will exacerbate the business cycle and makes the

conduct of monetary policy more difficult. Theories explaining this behavior point to

increases in spending in good times that exceed the increase in tax revenues. Most Latin

American economies, for example, display procyclical fiscal policy as documented in

Gavin and Perotti (1997) and explained in terms of the voracity effect in Tornell and

Lane (1999). The evidence for OECD and European economies is somewhat mixed.

There is some evidence of procyclical behavior, but in most cases, policy is either

acyclical or only slightly countercyclical. Lane (2003) and Wyplosz (2002) present

evidence on the cyclical properties of fiscal policy for this group of countries. More

recent studies corroborate these results (e.g. Kaminsky, Reinhardt and Vegh (2004)).

Alesina, Campante and Tabellini (2007) also discuss similar evidence and present

alternative political economy theories of this behavior.

       When analyzing the cyclical behavior of fiscal policy it is important to understand

that fiscal policy is a combination of automatic stabilizers and discretionary policy. Many

of the papers above deal with discretionary changes but we cannot forget that for most

countries the majority of cyclical changes in budgets are a result of automatic stabilizers.




                                                                                            8
The role of automatic stabilizers is one that has received little attention in the literature.

In the case of EMU, the assumption is that they are influenced by tax codes and spending

rules which have not been affected by the limits on deficits and debt. Many studies about

automatic stabilizers take a public finance perspective and attempt to measure the

elasticity of different fiscal components to the cycle. For example Auerbach and

Feenberg (2000) study the size of the automatic stabilizers in the US to conclude that

there have been quite stable despite changes in tax rates.

        From a macroeconomic point of view, the effects of automatic stabilizers have

been linked to the size of governments. The reason for this link is the empirical regularity

presented in Gali (1994) and confirmed in Fatás and Mihov (2001) that large

governments display less volatile business cycles. The logic is that the size of the

governments is related to the safety network provided by governments. There is some

evidence that this robust empirical regularity has gotten weaker in recent years as some

governments have reduced their size, which has not resulted in a more volatile economy

(see Debrun, Pisany-Ferry and Sapir (2008)). One potential explanation for the

weakening of the link between government size and volatility is that recent declines in

government size have happened in components that are inconsequential for

macroeconomic volatility. The reduced-form nature of the empirical analysis does not

provide a deeper insight into the sources of the reduced role of government size for

macroeconomic stability.




                                                                                                 9
2.3. Volatility

Fiscal policy can be a source of business cycles. When governments implement changes

in fiscal policy for political reasons or, more generally, for reasons that are not driven by

economic conditions, then these changes will lead to fluctuations in output and

consumption. In principle, such policies may have a negative effect on the economy if

they simply add volatility, which in some cases may slow down growth. The effects of

fiscal policy shocks has received much attention after the work of Blanchard and Perotti

(2002), Fatás and Mihov (2001) and Burnside, Eichenbaum and Fisher (2004). The origin

of these changes has been associated to the political business cycle. While the evidence is

mixed, there is some recent support for the presence of an electoral cycle among some

economies (Drazen (2000)). The macroeconomic consequences of volatility in fiscal

policy as well as its institutional origin has been documented in Fatás and Mihov (2003)

and (2007) where the aggressive use of discretion in fiscal policy has been shown to

generate macroeconomic volatility and lower growth.

        The issue of volatility has not been a major concern in the EMU context, but we

will still study it empirically to see if there is any evidence of changes in the use of

discretionary fiscal policy. It is possible that the absence of national currencies has

changed the incentives of governments to engage in policies that lead to a political

business cycle.



2.4. Rules, institutions and fiscal policy in the context of EMU

The 1992 Maastricht Treaty recognized the importance of providing a framework for

fiscal policy in EMU and established limits to deficits and debt in order to “avoid




                                                                                           10
excessive government deficits” (Article 104c). At the same time it defined an Excessive

Deficit Procedure in case of violations. The main goal of this fiscal framework was to

ensure the sustainability of public finances among members of the European Monetary

Union and provide the necessary credibility to the currency. The implementation of this

principle was done through a ceiling on deficits and debt as percentage of GDP. These

ceilings were defined independently of the business cycle although there could be

exceptional circumstances under which a country could go above those limits.

       The Stability and Growth Pact (1997) developed the original ideas of the

Maastricht Treaty into a set of more detailed rules and processes to ensure budget

discipline and enforcement. With the Stability and Growth Pact there is a slight change in

the focus and motivation of the framework. From the narrow goal of ensuring

sustainability of the Maastricht Treaty, there is a broader need to “strengthen the

surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic

policies”. From a process point of view, the Pact included the creation of an early-

warning mechanism through the preventive arm and emphasis on medium-term

budgetary plans.

       As a condition for entry in the single currency area, the limits on deficits and debt

had a large impact on fiscal positions. The run-up to EMU saw a large decline in budget

deficits among all candidates. Once EMU started there was a clear sign of fiscal fatigue

that combined with the slowdown of 2002, led to several countries being above the

agreed ceilings. While growth rates were low in those years, they were not low enough to

qualify as a “severe economic downturn”. As countries breached the limits on budget

deficits it became clear that the enforcement mechanisms of the SGP were not credible.




                                                                                          11
This opened a broad debate on the merits of the current system among policy makers and

academics. It is difficult to provide an exhaustive review of this literature but Buti and

Sapir (2003), Gali and Perotti (2003), Fatás, von Hagen, Hughes Hallett, Strauch and

Sibert (2003), Blanchard and Giavazzi (2002), Brunila, Buti and Franco (2001), Buiter

and Grafe (2002) provide a review of the early years as well as proposals to modify the

stability and growth pact. More recent reviews include von Hagen (2005) and Wyplosz

(2007).1 This debate led to a proposal to amend the principles of the Stability and Growth

put forward by a report of the ECOFIN council in March 2005, which was later endorsed

by the European Council.

        The modifications introduced in 2005 allowed for more flexible interpretations of

the limits on deficits, including adjustments for cyclical conditions. These changes were

criticized by many, including the ECB, as an attempt to relax the constraints that

governments faced and a failure to address the real problems with the current fiscal

policy framework. The fact that the European economies witnessed healthy growth rates

in the years that followed eased the tensions imposed by the limits on deficits. What

remains unclear is how the new rules, which provide much more room for the

interpretation of what constitutes an excessive deficit, will work in the years to come as

the euro economies enter a recessionary environment and deficits are likely to be above

the established ceiling. It is likely that we will return to the debate about the trade-off that

exists between simple rules that might be seen as inappropriate or short-sighted, and the

necessary flexibility to deal with idiosyncratic conditions in each country. The evolution


1
 This debate is also linked to the earlier academic literature on the effects of budget-balance
constraints of US states (Alt and Lowry (1994), Poterba (1994), von Hagen (1992) and Alesina
and Bayoumi, (1996). There is also a broader literature on the connection between budgetary
processes and fiscal outcomes (Poterba and von Hagen, 1999).


                                                                                                  12
of the Stability and Growth Pact has been towards flexibility, which has been welcomed

by governments, but there are well-founded concerns that the added flexibility has

relaxed the constraints of the system to a point that they have become irrelevant. This is

very much linked to the academic debate about rules versus institutions. Even if we

accept that there is a need to restrict governments and fiscal policy, are numerical rules

the right way to do so or can we design a set of budget processes and institutions that can

ensure the proper behavior of fiscal policy by using (good) judgment? Wyplosz (2003)

and Fatás, von Hagen, Hughes Hallett, Strauch and Sibert (2003) argue that establishing

checks on the budgetary process through independent committees might generate a

superior outcome relative to simple numerical rules.



3. Fiscal policy in the euro area

To start the empirical assessment of fiscal policy, we first take the perspective of the ECB

as it tries to manage the economic conditions of the euro area and it has to deal with the

euro area fiscal policy stance. This euro fiscal policy stance is the result of a collection of

decentralized national fiscal policies. Each of these policies is decided independently and

they react to national economic conditions but this is, in principle, irrelevant to the

conduct of monetary policy that is only concerned with the aggregate of the euro

countries. For this reason we also look at data at the level of individual countries.

       When we look at fiscal policy at the national level, we are interested in the same

characterization of fiscal policy but the issues that arise are slightly different. National

governments are worried that in the absence of monetary policy they need to be more

aggressive in the use of fiscal policy as a way to smooth the business cycle. This is even




                                                                                               13
more relevant in the European context where mobility of labor, is very limited. Has this

happened? Or have the constraints on deficits and debt limited the flexibility available to

fiscal policy?

        A second source of costs for national economies could be associated to interest

rate effects of fiscal policies in other countries. As all countries share a common currency,

there could be a spillover from deficits in the other members of EMU via the interest rate

(or the premium associated to the euro currency, if it had an effect on the credibility of

the ECB). This raises issue of coordination and the extent to which national fiscal

policies take into account what is happening in other countries or at the European level.



3.1 Sustainability of fiscal policy

Figure 1 shows the evolution of the debt to output ratio for the euro area, the UK and the

USA.2 The evolution of this ratio for the euro countries shows an increasing trend until

the mid-90s. There is a clear downward trend that starts at this point. This trend was also

followed also by the US and the UK until 2001-2002. The trend in the euro area has been

interpreted before as a clear sign of the discipline that the entry conditions imposed on all

members.3

        Figure 2 provides more insights on these trends by looking at structural budget

balances, which are measured as the cyclically adjusted balance as a % to potential output


2
  Figure 1 reports gross government debt. It might be more appropriate to look at net liabilities,
which in the case of the US stand at about 44% of GDP, while in Europe they are closer to 47%.
However, although the levels are different, the dynamics of the net and gross liabilities for the
three countries in the figure are very similar.
3
  Of course, one can construct explicit measures of sustainability by calculating the required tax
rate, which ensures that public debt does not explode (given assumptions on future interest rates
and output growth). Blanchard (1993) reviews some of the proposals for such “indicators of

(using the OECD methodology). The decade of the 1970s as well as late 1980s and early

1990s showed high deficits for all countries in the sample. By early 1990s there was a

growing need to tackle these deficits as levels of government debt increased in several

countries. This effort started in the mid 1990s, which coincides with the adoption of the

Maastricht Treaty among European countries. Therefore, for EMU countries, the fiscal

consolidation efforts that were necessary because of the high debt levels were reinforced

by the limits on budget deficits and debt that were being created as a condition for entry

into the single-currency area.

       During this period of fiscal consolidation all major economies with the exception

of Japan behaved in a very similar way: structural budgets were brought up closer to

balance or even to surplus. The improvement in the Euro-area budget balance is not as

large as in the case of the UK and the US but it is also true that the worsening of the

balances as a result of the economic slowdown of 2001/2003 is much more pronounced

in the US and the UK than in the euro area.

For the euro countries, 1997 represents an inflexion point as the adjustment of structural

deficits clearly slows down right at the time when entry decisions for EMU are made.

The euro structural balances improve again after 2003/2004 that coincides with a period

of faster growth rates.

3.2 The reaction of fiscal policy to macroeconomic conditions

To be able to interpret the stance of fiscal policy we need to separate the cyclical

component from the structural one. Separating the cyclical from the structural component

of fiscal policy is not an easy task and it is possibly one of the most controversial issues

in the academic literature. Not only there are some practical issues related to estimating

the cyclical behavior of fiscal policy, because of endogeneity, but there is also the

broader debate on how to characterize the business cycle itself. Before we look at the data

it is good to do a simple taxonomy of the different concepts of fiscal policy we want to

measure.

       From a methodological point of view, we can think of fiscal policy as a

combination of three elements:

   1. Automatic stabilizers: this is the reaction of fiscal policy to business cycles and it

       is a result of the tax code and spending rules that link budgetary components to

       changes in GDP.

   2. Endogenous discretionary fiscal policy: it includes changes in fiscal policy taken

       in response to changing economic conditions. These changes are discretionary in

       the sense that they are not coded in tax or spending laws.

   3. Exogenous discretionary fiscal policy: here we include changes in fiscal policy

       that are not related to economic conditions. They can be driven by political

       considerations (e.g. elections) or, in the case of European countries, by the

       conditions set by the Maastricht Treaty.

From a conceptual point of view, it might be difficult to separate these three components.

For example, governments that are trying to implement a reduction in their debt levels (as




                                                                                             17
if has been the case for most of these countries during recent years) might wait for a

favorable economic environment to implement their adjustment policies. This could be

seen as an endogenous change in fiscal policy but it is not directly motivated by the

economic cycle.

        From an econometric point of view, we can summarize the behavior of fiscal

policy by using a fiscal policy rule such as



                         Balt = α + β Cyclet + λ Debt t−1 + φ Balt−1 + εt                      (1)



Where Bal is a measure of fiscal policy, Cycle is a variable that captures the state of the

economy. Debt is gross government debt as percentage of GDP.4 The logic of this rule is

that fiscal policy is a function of the level of debt (the parameter λ can be seen as related

to the indicators of sustainability) as well as a function of the current state of the cycle

(captured by β). Any change in fiscal policy that is not directly related to the state of the

economy or the level of debt will be part of the residual, which we will identify with

exogenous discretionary fiscal policy.

        There are two alternative approaches to estimating this policy rule: if fiscal policy

is measured as the actual budget balance then the parameter β captures both the automatic

stabilizers and the endogenous changes in discretionary fiscal policy. If instead we use a

cyclically-adjusted measure of the budget balance on the left-hand side, the parameter β

is reflecting the endogenous response of fiscal policy to the business cycle.




4
 The inclusion of debt in fiscal policy rules is advocated among others by Favero and Giavazzi
(2007).


                                                                                                 18
3.3 The endogenous response of fiscal policy to the cycle

We start by looking at the behavior of cyclically-adjusted balances as a measure of the

discretionary response of governments to the business cycle. We use the structural

balances constructed by the OECD. For details on this methodology see Girouard and

Andre (2005). The drawback of this methodology is that it heavily relies on the process to

extract the cyclical component out of fiscal policy that requires strong assumptions on

potential output, cyclical elasticities of different fiscal variables and could potentially

create a bias in the results. Blanchard (1993) and Mohr and Morris (2007) discuss the

potential drawbacks of cyclically-adjusted measures of fiscal policy.5

        From an econometric point of view there could be a problem of endogeneity when

it comes to the estimation of the above policy rule. To deal with this problem we use

instrumental variables as previously proposed by Gali and Perotti (2003) and Alesina,

Campante, Tabellini (2007). There are cases where we discuss how the IV results relate

to the OLS estimates because we feel that the OLS estimates might provide a useful

perspective. The instruments for the output gap are one lag of the own output gap as well

as the current value of the US output gap. For the US we use the lag of own output gap as

well as the lag of the output gap of the euro area.6

        Table 1 presents the results. The top panel shows the estimates for the euro area as

well as three large countries that we use as benchmarks of comparison. The reason for


5
  Generally speaking the elasticities used to adjust the budget balance assume that the cyclical
adjustment is happening mostly through revenues and not spending (see Girouard and Andre
(2005)). There is however evidence that spending also adjusts to the cycle in a countercyclical
manner (Melitz (2006)).
6
  Our instrumenting strategy assumes that the US gap does not react contemporaneously to
developments in other countries, while output in other countries is influenced by the US output
gap. Under this assumption current foreign gaps will be inappropriate instruments for the US gap
and therefore we use the lagged euro gap as an additional instrument for the US reaction function.


                                                                                               19
comparing the euro area to these three countries is that they are the largest three countries

with similar level of GDP per capita and therefore the closest benchmark we can find.

The bottom panel shows the estimates for each of the individual EMU countries as well

as seven additional economies, for the purpose of benchmarking. We present the results

of estimating the equation above both by instrumental variables and OLS.

        We note first that the coefficient on debt in all cases is positive, as expected.

Among the first four countries, the largest coefficient is in the USA followed by the UK

and the euro area. The coefficient for Japan is several times lower than the coefficients

for other countries. It is hard to reach strong conclusions just from the size of this

coefficient but fiscal policy in the US, UK and in the euro area seem to be more

responsive to concerns of sustainability.7 If we look at the results of the individual

countries, the coefficient on debt remains positive for all countries with the exception of

New Zealand (when estimated by OLS). There are large variations in this coefficient. If

we ignore Luxembourg that displays a very large coefficient, we find the largest

coefficients in Italy and outside of the euro area.

        If we now look at the cyclical behavior of the balance (the coefficient β ),

comparing the OLS and IV estimates reveal that, for many of the countries, OLS

estimates for the parameter are lower than the instrumental variables ones. In principle,

one might have expected the opposite. The OLS estimates are likely to be biased

downwards because fiscal policy expansions (decrease in the budget balance) are likely

to lead to increases in output. This reverse causality is likely to lower the OLS estimates




7
 Of course, a positive coefficient may also capture that once debt becomes low, fiscal policy
becomes expansionary.


                                                                                                20
of the cyclical elasticity of fiscal policy (the parameter β above), but our results point in

the opposite direction.

       If we focus on the top panel of the table, and regardless of the estimation method,

the euro area displays the most procyclical policy out of this group, in contrast with the

US that shows acyclicality or mild counter-cyclicality. The UK results are closer to that

of the euro area while Japan is closer to the US.

                                [Insert Table 1 about here]

The procyclicality of the euro area is confirmed when looking at the individual euro

countries. The majority display negative coefficients, some close to -0.4 (Italy). In

contrast, for the non-euro countries and with the exception of Norway, the coefficients

are all positive and in some cases large (Sweden and New Zealand).

       Another important insight from this table is that many of the coefficients on the

output gap are not significant. This was also the case in Gali and Perotti (2003). In some

sense, this could be expected given that the cyclically-adjusted balance has been

constructed by purging the cyclical component from the budget balance. However, the

method used is not simply an econometric one but one that relies on information on

elasticities of the different fiscal components. So as long as governments engage often,

and in the same direction, in fiscal policy decisions that are discretionary and related to

the cycle, we should expect these coefficients to be significant. The fact that the

coefficients are not significant could be an indication that this is not a behavior that we

observe often. It could also be that the behavior is not consistent: maybe in some years

fiscal policy behaved procyclically and in others countercyclically.




                                                                                              21
        One of the questions that academics as well as policy makers are concerned about

is whether policy in the euro countries has changed as a result of the introduction of the

Euro. Here we need to be very careful as we will be looking at very short time series

when we split the sample into two. There are two possible ways of splitting the sample:

in 1992 when the Maastricht Treaty was approved and governments started dealing with

limits on budget deficits, even if they were just entry conditions, and 1999 when the

limits are actually enforced and there is a single monetary policy. We will show in the

main text of the paper the results where we split the sample in 1999 but an appendix

(available upon request) includes the results when the sample is split in 1992.

        Table 2 presents the results of estimating the policy rule in Table 1 by allowing

different elasticities before and after 1999.8

                                 [Insert Table 2 about here]

Overall, there is a clear pattern of policies becoming more countercyclical after 1999.

Among the top four large countries, the US shows the largest change towards

countercyclical policy.9 While in the first sample policy looks mildly procyclical, it

becomes very countercyclical after 1999. In the euro area there is practically no change in

the coefficient between the two periods.

        If we look at the individual EMU countries, when comparing the pre- and post­

1999 samples we do not see any clear direction of change – in six countries policy has

become less procyclical, while in the other six countries policy has become more

procyclical. Formal tests as indicated by p-values signal that there is no evidence of a

statistically significant shift in the cyclicality of fiscal policy in the euro area. Of all

8
 We only include in this table the IV results. The OLS estimates show a similar pattern.
9
 For the UK the change is even more dramatic in the IV estimates, but the standard errors are
very large and the OLS estimates do not confirm this large shift in policy.


                                                                                                22
countries in the sample, only in the US and in Denmark there is a statistically significant

shift towards more countercyclical policy.

        To some it might look like a surprise that the euro area fiscal stance is clearly

procyclical given that we have seen in recent years an improvement in the budget balance

during a period (post 2003) where the economy displayed increasing growth rates. It

might also look that these results contradict those in other papers that show acyclical or

even countercyclical fiscal policy for euro countries (for example Alesina, Campante and

Tabellini (2007)). It is important to emphasize that the results in Tables 1 and 2 are based

on the cyclically-adjusted budget balance, so we are ignoring automatic stabilizers.10 Our

methodology is the one used by Gali and Perotti (2003). Their results are closer to ours

but, still, there is a difference when it comes to the euro area, where we are showing that

fiscal policy is much more procyclical. Their estimates for the cyclicality of fiscal policy

at the aggregate level are coming from estimating regression (1) for each of the countries

and then aggregating the coefficients across countries. We are looking at the whole euro

area without taking into account individual behavior. In addition, our sample is longer

and all these factors could explain the differences in results.

        To understand better the strong procyclicality of fiscal policy of the euro area, we

have plotted the change in the cyclically adjusted budget balance against the output gap

for the years between 2000 and 2007. This is not exactly what is in our regression where

we have the level of the balance on the left hand side but the coefficient on the lagged

value is high (although lower than one) plus it is quite common in the literature to look at



10
  Table A1 in the appendix shows the results of regressing the primary balance on the output gap.
In that case, we observe acyclicality (if we use IV estimates) or even countercyclicality (OLS) for
the euro area, consistent with previous results in the literature.


                                                                                                23

Tabellini (2007)).

The difference between the two plots is shocking. While for the US there is a clear

positive correlation signaling strong countercyclical policy, for the euro area we see

exactly the opposite, a strong negative correlation. The evolution of the euro fiscal stance

is marked by decreasing balances after 2000 which reflect the relaxation of fiscal policy

after the launch of the Euro, a sign of fatigue after the strong pre-1998 decrease in

deficits to qualify for membership to EMU. After the recession of 2002/2003 and despite

the existence of a negative output gap, there is an improvement in the structural balance

that represents again procyclical policy. This improvement is due to two reasons: First,




                                                                                                    24
some of the euro countries were caught in levels of deficit that were too close to 3% (or

above 3%) and they had little room to adjust their fiscal policies. In addition, and this is

especially true in 2005, tax revenues increased faster than what many governments

expected. One interpretation is that the tax elasticities were larger than normal. Some of

this could be due to composition effects such as an increase in profits as a share of GDP

during these years (see European Economy, 2008). These increases in revenues and

elasticities were assumed to be permanent by governments and led to increases in

spending or decrease in taxes that in the years that followed (2006 and 2007) led to a

structural balance that remained too low despite the improvement in the cyclical

condition of the economy.

This reading of the behavior of fiscal policy during these eight years reveals that some of

it is due to special circumstances (such as the effects of the launch of the new currency)

but it is also difficult to avoid a sense that the fiscal policy framework did not work as

expected and it is likely that we will see similar behavior in the future.



3.4 Digging Deeper: Spending and taxes

To understand the source of changes in policy elasticities, we now look at the behavior of

cyclically-adjusted spending and taxes. Tables 3 and 4 replicate the results of Table 2 but

where the dependent variable is either the cyclically-adjusted spending or taxes.

                                  [Insert Table 3 about here]

                                  [Insert Table 4 about here]

In the euro area, spending has become more procyclical while taxes have become more

countercyclical. The same is true for the US and Japan.11 Consistent with previous claims

that procyclicality is driven by spending (Gavin and Perotti, 1997, and Tornell and Lane,

1999), we find that in most countries spending is pro-cyclical. Only Finland and France

have changed their policies towards more counter-cyclicality in the past ten years, as

evidenced by the p-value of the test for the equality of the coefficients before and after

1999.

        Tax revenues in some countries have also become or have remained pro-cyclical.

However for the euro area, Japan, UK and US tax revenues signal countercyclical policy

stance in recent years. The move is particularly pronounced in the case of the US, where

several expansionary tax packages introduced in the beginning of 2000s coincided

11
  For the UK, as in Table 2, we see a large change towards countercyclicality in both taxes and
spending. But the large coefficients and standard errors together with the fact that the OLS results
produce very different results makes the interpretation of these changes very difficult.


                                                                                                 26
(deliberately or not) with a negative output gap in the US economy. From Tables 3 and 4

we can conclude that the increase in counter-cyclicality in the US over the past ten years

is coming from the revenue side rather than from the spending side.

       It is also possible that the changes in the reaction of cyclically-adjusted tax

receipts over the past ten years in some countries signal that the elasticities used in

adjusting budgetary variables have changed. Indeed, recently the European Commission

has started paying special attention to time-varying elasticities as documented in

European Economy (2008).



3.5 Automatic stabilizers

We now look at the automatic stabilizers component of fiscal policy. In Table 5 we rerun

the regression above by using as dependent variable the component of fiscal policy that is

linked to automatic stabilizers. This is measured as the difference between the actual and

the cyclically-adjusted budget deficit. The regressions are estimated by OLS as they

recover the log-linear relationship between the gap and automatic stabilizers used by the

OECD in the process of adjusting budget to automatic changes in revenues and spending.

                                [Insert Table 5 about here]

This exercise produces very different results. First of all, the coefficient on the cycle now

becomes clearly significant, as one would expect. In addition, the coefficients for the euro

area now show clearly the countercyclical nature of fiscal policy. When comparing the

euro area with the US, we see that the size of the coefficient, in absolute value, is higher

for the euro area. One potential reading of this comparison is that European countries

have stronger automatic stabilizers built in and they have less need to use countercyclical




                                                                                           27
discretionary measures. This is consistent with the fact that European governments have

larger governments and that the size of governments have been associated to the

significance of automatic stabilizers. (Gali (1994) and Fatás and Mihov (2001).

        The coefficients on the gap are closely related to the elasticities used by the

OECD to derive the cyclically adjusted budget balance. The OLS regression should

uncover the weighted average of all elasticities (direct taxes, indirect taxes, social

security payments, etc.) with the weights being given by the significance of each category

in the overall budget. Since the OECD uses time-invariant elasticities, there is no point in

searching for time-variation in these coefficients. The R2 also shows that the errors in this

estimation are quite small, which implies that indeed this manipulation uncovers

relatively well a weighted-average estimate of the tax and spending elasticities used by

the OECD.

        The results at the national level confirm the ones for the euro area. Coefficients

are positive and highly significant. Coefficients in the euro area vary from a low 0.3

(Greece) to a high of 0.65 (Germany), while in the US and the UK these coefficients are

0.29 and 0.39 respectively. Thus in the euro area the increase of the gap by 1% generates

a budget surplus of about 0.46%, while in the US, the surplus goes up only by 0.29%.

        One question that emerges from this discussion is whether indeed automatic

stabilizers lead to lower output volatility. In Figure 5 we use the elasticities reported in

Table 5 and we plot them against output volatility (in logarithm). The correlation is quite

clear – countries like Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium with high elasticity of the

budget with respect to the output gap exhibit low levels of output volatility. The

relationship between elasticities and volatility is statistically significant with a slope




                                                                                               28
estimate of -3.3. This implies that an increase in elasticity by 0.1 leads to a reduction in

output volatility by about 30%.

As we mentioned above, there is no time-variation in these elasticities as they assumed to

be constant in the construction of the cyclically-adjusted balance. At the same time recent

research has shown that the empirical relationship between government size and the

volatility of GDP seems to have become weaker (as documented in Debrun, Pisany-Ferry

and Sapir, 2008). The fact that the relationship has become weaker is an indication that

there have been changes in the effectiveness of automatic stabilizers that have also

weakened the link between the size of the government and their smoothing effect. Given

the close link between government size and automatic stabilizers, it seems important to



                                                                                                                                              29
review the assumption of time-invariant elasticities. If one finds that elasticities have

changed, then researchers will be able to construct better measures of the structural

balance. If on the other hand it turns out that elasticities have not changed, then the link

between government size and stabilization has become indeed weaker, which will lead to

review of the desirability of having large governments. Larger governments, as much as

they might be able to provide a cushion to business cycle fluctuations can be associated

with crowding out and lower growth.



3.6 The use of (exogenous) discretionary fiscal policy

To establish whether exogenous discretionary policy has become more aggressive since

1999, we calculate the volatility of the residuals from equation 1. Table 7 compares the

volatility of discretionary policy before and after EMU as well as with US, UK and Japan.

We show volatilities calculated using a fiscal policy rule with a break in 1999.

                                [Insert Table 6 about here]

What is evident from the above numbers is that the euro area has the lowest standard

deviation of the residual, so the size and frequency of fiscal policy exogenous “shocks” is

much smaller than for the other countries. We also see a decrease in the volatility over

time. The fact that the volatility is lower for the euro area should not be a surprise as this

is an aggregate of national fiscal policies and it is difficult to think about coordinated

changes in fiscal policy. It might be that we observe such changes of policies at the

national level but they are not synchronized and therefore vanish when we aggregate all

the countries. However, and as we have seen in the previous section, we do observe some

significant changes in fiscal policy at the euro level. So one potential reading of these




                                                                                               30
results is that European countries are less willing to engage in discretionary changes in

fiscal policy. It is possible that this decline in aggressiveness is due to the increased

monitoring of national fiscal policies by the European Commission. On the margin,

changing fiscal stance for reasons unrelated to the state of cycle has become more

difficult as any change is carefully scrutinized by the Commission. Potentially this is only

a partial explanation, as the volatility in the US has declined even faster than in the euro

area.

        When we look at individual countries, most euro countries display low volatility

of exogenous discretionary policy, which is consistent with what we found for the

aggregate of the euro countries. We also see that this volatility has decreased in the

second half of the sample for all countries with the exception of Austria, Ireland, and

Luxembourg. Outside of the EU-15, only Canada and the US show substantial reduction

in policy volatility.



4. Does fiscal policy react to output growth or to the output gap?

Both in the construction of the cyclically adjusted balance, as well as in the estimation

reported above, there is an assumption that fiscal policy reacts to the output gap. There

are two issues: First, the reported gap might be a noisy and biased estimate of the actual

gap. Second, fiscal authorities might be more concerned with growth rather than the gap.

        We can illustrate the difficulty in interpreting regression results by redoing

Figures 3 and 4 (euro area and US correlation between cyclically adjusted balances and

the cycle) by using the output growth rate instead of the gap as a measure of the cyclical

position of the economy. Figures 6 and 7 plot the change in the structural balance against




                                                                                            31
real growth for the euro area and the US. It is interesting that while for the US the picture

looks very similar to the previous plot, for the euro area, we now see a much less clear

picture. While the years 2000-2001 show procyclical fiscal policy, the years that follow

2002-2007 we see a positive slope, signaling acyclical or countercyclical policy. This is

very different from what we saw in Figure 3, using the output gap, where Euro fiscal

policy was clearly procyclical.

The comparison between Figure 3 and Figure 6 opens the door for a different

interpretation of our results. There is still no doubt that US fiscal policy is more

countercyclical (and in a consistent manner) than the euro one. But whether the euro

fiscal policy has been countercyclical or procyclical (or has switched from one to the

other) remains an open question. The European Commission uses the output gap as the

cyclical indicator to assess the stance of fiscal policy, but it might be that politicians care

more about growth and react to the output growth rate.

There is even a deeper issue: Current practice in removing the cyclical component of the

budget balance uses as a starting point the automatic reaction of fiscal variables to the

output gap. That is the case for the measures we have used in this paper and produced by

the OECD or the structural balance used by the European Commission. What if in fact

tax revenues react more closely to the growth rate of output rather than to the gap? If this

is the case, then many of the results in the literature have to be reinterpreted. To evaluate

this possibility, we run a “race” between the gap and output growth. In Table 7 our

dependent variable is the primary balance as percent of GDP, while the key regressors are

the growth rate of real GDP and the output gap.

                                                [Insert Table 7 about here]

The results are quite interesting. With the exception of Denmark and Sweden, in all

countries where we have significant coefficients the key variable is output growth and not

the output gap. Importantly, in the euro area the gap enters with a negative, albeit



                                                                                                         33
insignificant, coefficient (implying procyclicality), while the growth rate enters with a

significant positive coefficient (counter-cyclicality). The estimates imply that the

primary balance – which includes both automatic stabilizers and structural balances –

reacts more readily to output growth rather than to the output gap. At this point, the only

thing that we can do is to raise a warning flag. To re-estimate the results in the previous

tables we need first to decompose the balance into cyclical and structural components by

using elasticities with respect to output growth and not the output gap. Furthermore, it is

quite conceivable that certain fiscal variables respond to the gap (e.g. unemployment

benefits), while others respond to the growth rate (tax revenues). And although this task

lies beyond the scope of the paper, Table 7 is still useful in both raising the issue and in

pointing out that the disparity of findings in the literature might be due to the difference

in the cyclical indicator used to evaluate the behavior of fiscal policy. It is certainly worth

considering in future work an alternative adjustment based on the growth rate. See

Blanchard (1993) for an in-depth discussion of the alternative adjustment methods.



5. Coordination of national fiscal policies. Is there a Euro-wide fiscal policy stance?

In the previous sections of the paper we looked both at the behavior of fiscal policy for

the aggregate of the twelve euro countries as well as for each of the countries. Although

there is no government behind the behavior of the euro aggregate, it is simply the

collection of twelve individual policies; these individual policies have been designed

within the institutional framework of the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth

Pact so the idea of Euro-wide fiscal policy is not entirely meaningless. The framework

has possibly introduced some commonalities across national fiscal policies. For example,




                                                                                               34
the run up to the euro launch led to fiscal consolidation efforts for many of the

governments. In addition, the interpretation and implementation of the Stability and

Growth Pact has led to increasing emphasis on coordination of national fiscal policies.

This coordination of national fiscal policies runs contrary to the intuition that with a

common monetary policy, fiscal policy should behave in an even less coordinated fashion

as it needs to deal with idiosyncratic national shocks. In this section we look at national

fiscal policies and ask the question of whether we have seen any move towards

coordination or synchronization.

                                                                                               35
Since 1999, there is a clear trend towards less dispersion among the euro countries that is

not evident for the rest of the countries. This trend can be the result of proactive

coordination but it could also be the outcome of some countries being close or above the

limits established for budget deficits.

       The trend towards more similar structural balances might be a result also of

synchronization of business cycles. Indeed, Figure 9 shows that the dispersion of the

output gap has been declining steadily since early 1990s. Interestingly, however, this

trend is visible both for the euro area and for the group of the non-euro area countries. If

we compare now Figures 8 and 9, it seems that there is more to the synchronization of

fiscal policy stances across euro countries than just synchronization of business cycles.

       Finally, Figure 10 reports synchronization of fiscal policy by looking at the

exogenous component. We measure the dispersion (using standard deviation) of the

residuals from equation (1) across both euro and non-euro countries. In this case we see

that there is a very small downward trend for both samples. We already know that the

typical size of these shocks has decreased over the sample period, so this could simply be

due to the fact that we see fewer and smaller changes in discretionary fiscal policy and,

therefore, an increase in synchronization for many countries. Of course, this needs not be

the case, as it is possible that many large and coordinated changes in fiscal policy lead to

a small cross-country standard deviation.

6. Concluding Remarks

The 1992 Maastricht Treaty recognized the importance of providing a framework for

fiscal policy in EMU and established limits to deficits and debt in order to “avoid




                                                                                            37
excessive government deficits” (Article 104). At the same time it defined an Excessive

Deficit Procedure in case of violations. The Stability and Growth Pact (1997) developed

the original ideas of the Maastricht Treaty into a set of more detailed rules and processes

to ensure budget discipline and enforcement. The principles of the Stability and Growth

pact were later amended by a report of the ECOFIN council in March 2005 that was later

endorsed by the European Council.

       This is the environment under which fiscal policy has been conducted in the euro

area, an environment that has been a source of criticisms and debates. Some have been

seen these limits as unnecessary constraints on national fiscal policy at a time when it

was needed the most, with negative consequences on the macroeconomic performance of

these economies. For those who had to implement the constraints and procedures

(European Commission) or those who were supposed to care about them (ECB), the rules

have not provided an easily-enforceable system and the outcome has been far from what

the system was designed for. Fiscal consolidation has not been large enough and national

policies have continued to display many of the prior biases (such as procyclicality).

       In this paper we have provided a characterization of fiscal policy at the euro and

the national levels and used countries outside of the euro area as benchmark. Our goal

was not to propose an alternative fiscal policy framework but more to validate or

disprove the conventional wisdom about how fiscal policy has behaved and the extent to

which the EMU fiscal policy framework has affected that behavior.

       Overall, our results have shown that the behavior of fiscal policy in the euro area

has not been too different from what we have seen in other countries and that the

introduction of the euro has not led to a significant change. The fear that fiscal policy




                                                                                            38
would become less disciplined because governments would not internalize the cost of

“bad” fiscal policy in the absence of national currencies is not validated by our results.

There is also very little evidence that the fiscal policy stance at the national level has

gotten worsen. Although cyclically-adjusted balances still show some tendency to be

procyclical for some countries in the euro zone, it is still true that the automatic

stabilizers do most of the countercyclical adjustment in the union. The other positive

reading of our results is that governments have not abused their discretion and that the

size of frequency of politically-motivated fiscal policy changes has decreased among the

European economies.

       Coordination of fiscal policies has received much recent attention by the

European Commission as a way to justify the strong surveillance mechanisms that they

impose on national countries. The notion of coordination is some times linked to that of

economic convergence but this link is theoretically not founded as we should expect the

opposite: as countries have abandoned monetary policy, there is a stronger need to rely

on fiscal policy as an automatic stabilizer. Of course, if business cycles become more

synchronized, we will see coordination but there is no need to impose that coordination

as one lets automatic stabilizers run their course. This is indeed what our results show.

But it also seems that there is something beyond business cycle synchronization since a

similar decline in dispersion for the countries outside the euro zone has not be met with a

decline in the dispersion of their structural balances. Other measures of fiscal policy,

those that also include the discretionary component, do not show any tendency to become

less coordinated. If any, there seems to be more coordination and synchronicity at that




                                                                                             39
level, which supports the view that governments have not taken advantage of the euro

fiscal framework to push different political agendas through the use of fiscal policy.

        Our analysis of the Euro-wide aggregates provided us with the perspective that

the ECB and monetary policy have about fiscal policy. In some sense, it could be argued

that this is the relevant dimension in which to discuss fiscal policy in the euro area. As

much as national fiscal policies can show biases and behaviors which are not optimal,

when it comes to monetary policy and the currency, what matters is the behavior of fiscal

policy at the aggregate level (of course, the aggregate is made out of the sum of all the

national fiscal policies, so their understanding can still provide very useful insights).

        When looking at the euro-wide fiscal policy we see a behavior that is different

from what we have seen in the US. Fiscal policy is more procyclical in the euro area than

in the US (where it is strongly countercyclical), but it is also true that the automatic

stabilizers are larger in the euro zone. In addition, and this should be welcomed by the

ECB, fiscal policy is less volatile at the euro level when it comes to exogenous changes,

those that are not motivated by the economic environment.

        Last but not least, it is important to emphasize that many of the findings in the

literature are sensitive to the cyclical indicator used in the regression analysis. In this

paper we show that the primary balance reacts more readily to the growth rate of real

output rather than to the output gap. Reassessing the construction of cyclically-adjusted

variables might lead to significant changes in the way that researchers view fiscal policy

stance in the OECD economies.
