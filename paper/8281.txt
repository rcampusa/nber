1       Introduction

From any perspective, the U.S. is a land of contradictions. It is the land

of plenty, yet it is also the land of poverty and crime. From 1960 to 1991,

the crime rate in the U.S. has approximately tripled. The clearance rate,

the ratio of arrests to known crimes, has fallen from around 31% to 21%, the

median time served has fallen, as has the probability of imprisonment.1 Yet as

Freeman (1996) points out there has been mass incarceration, so much so that

“All told, 7 percent as many men were under the ‘supervision of the criminal

justice system’ (incarcerated, paroled or probated) as were in the work force.”

He points out that in 1993, the number incarcerated alone was about the same

proportion of the labor force as the long term unemployed who are on the

dole in many European countries. The incarcerated are disproportionately

young black men, with low educational status. The numbers are frightening.

For example, 34% of black high school dropouts between the age of 25 and

34 were incarcerated in 1993.2 The costs of dealing with such levels of crime

are enormous. Freeman (1996) points out that California spent 9.9% of its

state budget in 1995 on prison while it spent 9.5% on higher education. In

comparison, in 1980 these numbers were 2% and 12.6% respectively. He

estimates that about 2% of GDP is spent on controlling crime by private
    1
    See Ehrlich (1996) Table 1 for details.
    2
    There is recent evidence that the crime wave is receding. The 1999 Þgures from the
FBI show the uniform crime index as being the lowest since 1973 and having fallen by 8%
from1998 and 27% from 1990. Preliminary data for 2000 shows a fall of only .3% suggesting
that this improvement may be levelling oﬀ. Whether this is a short run aberration or a
longer term trend is hard to know at this time.


                                                    2
individuals and public agencies while the cost incurred by society of criminal

behavior could be another 2%.

   Thus, public policy in this area is of great importance. Criminal behavior

involves choices which impact on the future, and on the payoﬀs from choices

made in the future. Hence, explicitly dynamic models of individual behavior

need to be constructed and estimated. Individuals form expectations on

future beneÞts and costs of crime and take them into account when making

choices. Dynamic deterrence works through the threat of future adverse eﬀect

on payoﬀs when caught committing crimes. Thus, if one wishes to uncover

overall deterrence eﬀects of policy, it is hard to do so without using a dynamic

model. For example, consider the eﬀect of rehabilitation in prison. While

this would reduce crime upon release by raising the payoﬀ of not committing

crimes, it would tend to increase crimes early on because of a reduction

in dynamic deterrence. However, much of the work by economists has been

static and/or reduced form in nature, see for example, the seminal theoretical

work by Becker (1968), and recent empirical work by Tauchen et. al. (1994),

and Grogger (1995). While such work is undoubtedly useful, it may give

diﬀerent policy insights than a dynamic model would, as discussed above, as

well as being less amenable to counter factual policy experiments than would

a more structural approach.

   There is evidence that dynamic aspects are important in understanding

criminal behavior. For example, since juvenile records are sealed at age 18



                                               3
and juvenile courts sanctions are much milder than those in adult courts,

there is reason to expect crime to be higher below age 18. Levitt (1997)

shows that states where juvenile punishments are relatively mild compared

to adult ones see a sharper drop oﬀ in the age arrest proÞle after 18 than

states where juvenile punishments are relatively harsh. This is consistent

with anticipatory behavior on the part of individuals. There is also evidence

that Þnes are relatively ineﬀective deterrents compared to punishments that

are more publicly visible, such as social service. If the latter have longer

term eﬀects, such as eroding social status, they may act as a strong dynamic

deterrent.

   The only paper we are aware of that begins to take a dynamic structural

approach is that of Williams and Sickles (1997). However, their focus is

on how diﬀerences across individuals in the extent of initial social capital

translate into diﬀerent behavior and hence diﬀerent paths of social capital and

career choices. This explains how criminals and non criminals can face similar

wages yet make diﬀerent choices. They estimate a model of continuous choice

of hours of criminal activities using the Euler equation GM M approach.

They focus on hours worked versus spent on criminal activity and omit any

individuals below the age 18 from their data. In contrast, we use a maximum

likelihood approach and emphasize the choice of whether to commit a crime

or not and the consequences on future employment outcomes. We also include




                                              4
both criminal choice during high school and beyond into our estimation.3

       Since we allow criminal behavior to aﬀect employment outcomes, we can

model the vicious cycle whereby crime and unemployment serve to reinforce

each other. There have been studies, such as Grogger (1995) and Kling

(1998), which estimate the eﬀect of past arrests on current employment and

wages. They conclude that after taking account of the unobserved hetero-

geneity via Þxed eﬀect or instruments, the wage and employment eﬀect of

past arrests are small and temporary. However, in their work, it may be

the Þxed eﬀects which capture the vicious cycle of crime and unemployment.

This may well also be why wage and employment eﬀects of past arrests are

small and temporary in such estimations. Despite this, the cumulative eﬀects

of crime and unemployment could be large in a dynamic model. Recently,

Grogger (1998) estimates a static model of wage and employment as well

as criminal behavior. He concludes that wages signiÞcantly aﬀect criminal

behavior. However, such an approach cannot capture any expectational ef-

fects. For example, in the static model, an increase in unemployment results

in an increase in crime. In contrast, in the dynamic model, a permanent an-

ticipated increase in unemployment reduces crime. Why? Current criminal

activity adversely aﬀects future employment outcomes. This acts as dynamic
   3
    The Euler equation GMM estimation technique used by Sickes and Williams (1997)
works well with continuous data, and not so well with the discrete crime data they use,
because they have to infer the number of hours allocated for criminal activities on the
basis of arrests. In addition, they do not focus on dynamic deterrence or counterfactual
experiments.




                                                    5
deterrence to crime. A permanent reduction in unemployment reduces the

deterrence eﬀect of greater future unemployment as a consequence of being

caught and hence raises criminal activity.

      Lochner (1999) uses a 2 period model to look at some simple dynamic

relations between education, work and crime. The correlations suggested

by this model are examined using data from the 1980 crime survey and the

other panel data of the NLSY. In his paper, he emphasizes the role of human

capital accumulation on criminal behavior. But he only uses a one year

crime survey, and thus cannot adequately deal with the issue of unobserved

heterogeneity. There have also been simulation studies of criminal behavior

based on calibrated dynamic models of representative agents. Among them

are Flinn (1986), Leung (1994), Bearse (1997) and Imrohoroglu et. al. (2000).

However, there has been little eﬀort devoted to actually Þt a dynamic model

to the data.

      We model the choice of whether to commit a crime or not as a function of

wages and employment today as well as future wages and employment, which

are aﬀected by the outcome today. Our contribution is to explicitly consider

the eﬀect of increased criminal records on future wages and employment op-

portunities. This serves as a dynamic deterrence against crime.4 That is, we

explicitly solve the dynamic choice problem faced by agents. We also allow

for unobserved heterogeneity insomuch as there are 4 types of individuals.
  4
   Previous work has focused on more standard deterrence variables such as police ex-
penditures and sentencing, among others.



                                                  6
Which type an agent is likely to fall into is determined by the data. In other

words, type probability assignment is estimated to maximize the likelihood

function. We Þnd that although current wages and employment opportuni-

ties have a relatively weak eﬀect on current crime, there is a strong dynamic

deterrence eﬀect. Our approach also allows us to conduct counter factual ex-

periments. The paper proceeds as follows. The data are described in Section

2. The model speciÞcation is discussed in Section 3, and estimation results

are in Section 4. Section 5 presents some simulation exercises including pol-

icy experiments. Section 6 contains some concluding remarks. The details of

the model and its solution algorithms are presented in the Appendix.


2    Data

We estimate our model using data from the 1958 Philadelphia Birth Cohort

Study developed by Figlio et. al. (1994). However, instead of converting

the data into an annual panel, as is usually done, we construct a monthly

panel of arrests and employment activities. In this way we obtain a more de-

tailed panel history of the employment transition of each individual and his

criminal activities. We think this diﬀerence is important. If we used annual

data, almost everybody works positive hours. But with monthly data, we ob-

serve the long unemployment spells and job transitions which young workers

frequently experience. The data provides detailed juvenile as well as adult

arrest records, basic demographic information, and employment and school-


                                              7
ing records,5 among others. The demographic information includes variables

such as sex, race, date of birth, church membership, and the socioeconomic

status of the individual. Juvenile arrests records from age 14 are compiled

from rap sheet and police investigation reports provided by the Juvenile Aid

Division of the Philadelphia Police Department. Adult arrest records up to

age 26 come from the Municipal and Common Pleas Courts of Philadelphia.

Data on education, employment, health, and some self reported variables on

criminal activities, etc. were collected in a 1988 follow-up survey interview.

       The unique characteristic of this data set is that it contains information

on the individual’s criminal activities and background variables, as well as

variables such as schooling and employment. The data is drawn from the

general youth population of Philadelphia. This is in contrast to many data

sets on crime, which only focus on delinquents. In Figure 1, we plot the aver-

age age arrest proÞles of the male and female sample. We can see that the age

arrest proÞle of females is much lower than that of males. In our estimation

exercise we chose only the male sample because males are signiÞcantly more

criminally active. For this reason, public interest, as well as past empirical

studies, focus their attention on the criminal behavior of young males.

       Figures 1 to 5 depict how arrests, unemployment, wages and incarceration

are related to age. From Figure 1, we see that the arrest rate of males peaks
   5
     We drop all agents going to college from the sample. 76 individuals out of 440 sample,
i.e. less than 20 percent of the sample went to college. We also ignore the choices of
individuals who went to trade schools and other similar institutions, since attendance was
sporadic.



                                                      8
at 18.6 In Figure 5, we see that the age incarceration proÞle increases sharply

until age 17. Thereafter it remains roughly constant until 26. Hence, the age

incarceration proÞle cannot by itself explain the age pattern of arrests of

young individuals. Some sample statistics are shown in Table 1. In Figure

4, we plot the age arrest proÞles for individuals with diﬀerent past criminal

records. Note that these proÞles shift up with past arrests. This is consistent

with the fact that repeat oﬀenders account for large proportion of arrests. In

Figure 3, we plot the mean and median age wage proÞles. The mean wage

proÞle is far above the median. This is typical of wage data, since wages are

known to have many outliers. Since maximum likelihood estimation tries to

Þt the distribution it is robust against the outliers, and as we will see later,

the model Þts the data well in terms of the median.


3       Model SpeciÞcation

In each period an individual chooses whether or not to commit a crime. His

objective is to maximize the expected present value of lifetime utility. In

the terminal period, T , at age 33,7 he receives a payoﬀ of VT (ncT ) which

depends on his past arrests ncT . The criminal history in the terminal period

is summarized by the index ncT . The Þnal period value function is assumed
    6
     It is interesting that in the original work of Quetelet more than 15 years ago, the age
crime proÞle peaked at age 24 or therabouts. This is reported in Leung (1991).
   7
     We chose this somewhat early age, because we only have the data of young individuals
until the age 26. Since the parameters estimated are based on data from age 14 to 26, it
makes little sense to solve the model too far out.




                                                      9
to take a simple polynomial form:



                                     VT (ncT ) = f ncT

      In each period, his past arrest records depreciate at rate 1 − δ. If he

commits a crime and gets caught, then his criminal record is augmented by

unity. That is,



                                     nct+1 = δnct + 1

otherwise,



                                       nct+1 = δnct .

At age 18, we allow for a single period change in δ to δ 18 . This allows us to

capture the eﬀect of juvenile records being sealed at adulthood. This leads

us to expect a lower value for δ 18 than δ.8 Let st ∈ St be the state space

vector for period t. This state space expands as an agent reaches maturity

to reßect the additional choices made by an adult as opposed to a child.

      In each period t, before the age 16, st = (t, nct , iht , ²Nt , ²Ct ), where iht = 1

if in the data the individual attends high school in period t and 0 otherwise.

²Nt is the utility shock of not committing a crime and ²Ct is the utility shock

of committing a crime. We assume both of them follow the i.i.d. extreme

value distribution. At or after the age 16, the individual starts working,
  8
      As expected, our estimates show δ 18 = 0.76, while δ = 0.98.


                                                        10
and the state vector is augmented by labor market information. Hence,

st = (t, nct , iht , iut , Wt , ²Nt , ²Ct ) between the ages of 16 and 18, where iut = 1

if the individual is not employed in period t and 0 otherwise and Wt is the

real wage rate. High school age unemployment is not exogenous and the

probability of being unemployed at age 16 has the following logit form:



                          Phu = exp(θhu )/[1 + exp(θ hu )]

where

                                  θhu = h0 + h1 nct .

   Then, after the Þrst month of age 16, he experiences job transitions, and

the probability of staying unemployed depends both on his past criminal

history and the employment status. That is,



                          Put+1 = exp(θut )/[1 + exp(θut )]

where

         θut = b00 I(age < 18) + b01 I(age ≥ 18) + b1 t + b2 ih + b3 nct

                   +[b40 I(age < 18) + b41 I(age ≥ 18)]iut .

   I(age < 18) is an indicator function which equals 1 when the agent is

below 18, and 0 otherwise. All the other indicator functions are analogously

deÞned. The above speciÞcation allows us to have diﬀerent unemployment

probabilities and persistence before and after 18. At age 18, the individual

                                                   11
either graduates or does not graduate from high school. We set ihg = 1 if

he graduates from high school, and 0 otherwise. Hence, the state vector at

and after the age 18 is further augmented by high school graduation, i.e.

st = (t, nct , iht , ihg , iut , Wt , ²Nt , ²Ct ) after age 18. At the age 18, the individual

graduates from high school with probability



                              Pg = exp(θg )/[1 + exp(θg )]

where

                                     θg = g0 + g1 nct .

    The starting wage of the individual at the Þrst month of employment

follows the log normal distribution



                             log(Wt+1 ) ∼ N (µb (nct ), σ b )

where



                                µb (nct ) = µb0 + µb1 nct .

    Furthermore, the wage growth for the individual on a job is assumed to

be log normally distributed such that



                       log(Wt+1 ) − log(Wt ) ∼ N(µgt (.), σ g ),

    where


                                                      12
µgt (.) = µg01 I(16 < age ≤ 19) + µg02 I(20 < age ≤ 23) + µg03 I(20 < age)

              +[µg11 I(16 < age ≤ 23) + µg12 I(24 < age)]t + µg2 nct .

       We solve for the optimal choice of whether to commit a crime or not.9

The value of not committing a crime is

                  VNt (st ) = uN (st − ²t ) + βEVt+1 (st+1 |st ) + ²Nt

where st ∈ St is the state space vector, and st − ²t denotes the variables in st

having removed those in ²t = (²Nt , ²Ct ) and uNt (st − ²t ) is the deterministic

component of the utility of not committing the crime. Of course, in the event

of not committing a crime, nct+1 = δnct .

       The value of committing the crime is

                  VCt (st ) = uC (st − ²t ) + PC βE[Vt+1 (st+1 )|st ]

                                 +[1 − PC ]V Nt (st − ²t ) + ²Ct

where V N t is the deterministic part of the value of not committing the crime

and PC is the probability of getting caught after committing a crime and

uC (st − ²t ) is the deterministic component of the utility of committing a

crime.10 The probability of catching the oﬀender is not identiÞed, and we
   9
     The main reason why we do not solve and estimate the jointly optimal choice of
employment and crime is because of the high computational burden. Our horizon for the
DP problem is from age 14 to age 33, which gives us 240 monthly periods for which we
have to evaluate the value functions. This is already quite computationally demanding.
  10
     The term uC (.) includes the expected loss from being caught and punished. For this
reason there is no cost of punishment that multiplies the probability of being caught above.
In any event, this expected cost of punishment would not be seperately identiÞed.

                                                      13
therefore set it to be



                                       PC = 0.16.

This number is consistent with other facts. Clearance rates, that is the ratio

of arrests to reported crimes varied from 92% for murder and non-negligent

manslaughter to 20% for larceny in the U.S. in 1960. In 1991 the range for

clearance rates was about 67% for murder and non-negligent manslaughter

and 13.5% for burglary.11 We chose 16% as a reasonable weighted average.12

Note that we assume that when, despite committing a crime, an agent is not

caught, it is as if he never committed it. It is not the crimes you committed,

but the crimes for which you are arrested that aﬀect future payoﬀs. Since

crime and arrests are linearly related due to our speciÞcation, we use the

words crimes and arrests interchangeably from here on.

       We assume that the utility function takes the form


  11
    These numbers are based upon Table 1 in Ehrlich (1996).
  12
    This speciÞcation ignores the possible endogeneity of the probability of getting caught
which could vary with the seriousness of the crime. Those aspects are pointed out by
Tauchen et. al. (1994) and others. Lochner (2000) estimates the manner in which beliefs
about being apprehended are aﬀected by past arrests and other information.

where Ij (Wt ), j = l, m, h are the indicator functions for low, medium and

high wage groups13 and I(age < 18) is the indicator function for being below

age 18. We introduce this diﬀerentiation before and after age 18 to reßect the

diﬀerences in treatment of juveniles and adults under the law. In general,

the criminal justice system treats individuals under and over age 18 quite

diﬀerently. α allows for convexity or concavity in the eﬀect of criminal history.

       As is well known from the discrete choice econometric literature, we can-

not separately identify the utility of not committing the crime and the utility

of committing the crime just on the basis of data on criminal choice. Hence,

we set



                                     uC (st − ²t ) = 0.

       After the utility shocks ²Nt , ²Ct are realized in period t, the agent chooses

    Low wage group individuals are those with real wages below $5. Medium wage group
individuals are those with real wages between $5 and $8. High wage group individuals are
those with real wages greater than or equal to $8.




                                                     15
whichever option yields the higher value. Hence,

                          Vt (st ) = M ax{VNt (st ), VCt (st )}.

In the section on Bellman equations in the Appendix, we elucidate on the

value functions of the individuals at various ages.

       The unit of time in our paper is months. Since no individuals have mul-

tiple arrests in our data, we abstract from multiple crimes and assume that

the individuals only have two choices, either to commit a crime or not to

do so. Because of this, the eﬀect of incarceration on crime/arrests is not

identiÞed. Incarceration is interpreted as being unemployed and at the same

time, unable to commit any crimes.14 The richer model incorporating as-

pects such as the severity of crimes is hard to put into an error structure

that results in easy dynamic logit computation, such as that of Rust (1987),

which we use below. The analysis of the richer dynamic model is, in our

view, a very interesting topic for future research. In fact, some topics, such

as the eﬀects of alternative sentencing requirements can only be addressed in

a model with multiple crime choices resulting in behavior which is aﬀected

by the sentencing structure. We see our work as a start in this direction.15
  14
     Because of this, the eﬀect of past crimes on unemployment will be biased upwards
and the eﬀect on crimes committed by the unemployed biased downwards. Since in our
results, past crimes raise unemployment and past unemployment raises crimes, the former
might change signs after the bias is removed, but the latter would not. However, in any
case, we believe the bias to be small since the probability of incarceration in the data is
small (see Fig. 5).
  15
     While we see oﬀenses with various severity - ranging from drunk driving to murder, we
excluded minor oﬀenses such as drunk driving and other traﬃc oﬀenses. Oﬀenses included
are: homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, theft, other assaults, arson,
forgery. See appendix for the detailed description of the oﬀenses.

                                                     16
    We also include some unobserved heterogeneities. We take a minimal-

 ist stand and assume 2 criminal types and 2 unemployment types. We have

 crime type 1 and 2 and unemployment type 1 and 2. The agent’s type is mod-

 eled as a random eﬀect, and the probability of an agent’s type is estimated

 so as to maximize the likelihood function. Crime type 1 and unemployment

 type 1 turn out to be the high crime/high unemployment types. As in other

 estimation exercises such as Keane and Wolpin (1997) or Eckstein and Wolpin

 (1999), we do not include any observed heterogeneity. As a check, we later

 look at the regression relationship between the unobserved heterogeneities

 and the observed diﬀerences in individual characteristics and conclude that

 the unobserved heterogeneities estimated from the data capture the observed

 diﬀerences in individual characteristics.

    The Maximum Likelihood estimation involves a number of steps. Not

 only must the Dynamic Programs be solved, but the likelihood has to be

 computed. The steps are as follows.


Step 1 Solution of the Dynamic Programming problem. For any given pa-

      rameters, and any state vector, st − ²t ∈ St , it is standard to solve

      the Dynamic Programming problem to obtain the values V Ntj (st − ²t ),

      V Ctj (st − ²t ), which are the deterministic components of the values of

      type j. As usual, the solution proceeds from the last period T back-

      wards. As a result of this, for the given parameters, we know what

      the value of committing verses not committing the crime would be if

                                              17
        we knew the state variables. Now, we want to get some idea of how

        likely the parameter chosen is with respect to the data. To do so, we

        compute the likelihood function.

Step 2 Computing the likelihood components. Given the data sdit = (td , ndcit , idhit , iduit , Witd )

        for individual i and period t, and the parameters in θ, we integrate over

        the taste shocks ²t to calculate the probability of committing a crime.

        That is, we calculate




              Pj (VCt (st ) > VNt (st ))
                              Z
                            =   I[V Ctj (sdit ) + ²Ct > V Ntj (sdit ) + ²Nt ]dF (²t ).


              This gives the probability that individual i when he is of type

        j, commits a crime in period t . This is then done for each period

        t, and then repeated for each individual and type. The latter is re-

        quired since each individual is not assigned a type, but rather a set

        of probabilities over types. This gives the 4 probabilities associated

        with the individual committing the crime if he was of the given type.

        Of course, the probability of being a particular type remains to be

        estimated. In this manner, we obtain the criminal choice component

        of the likelihood, LitjC (θj ). The other components of the likelihood

        are the probability of unemployment and the wage density component,

        which are jointly denoted by LitjE (θj ), and the high school graduation

                                                      18
       probability component denoted by Li18jHS (θj ) in the Appendix. As

       before, these probabilities are calculated for all individuals i, periods

       t and types j for the given parameter θ. Of course, the probability of

       high school graduation is only calculated at age 18. The probability of

       unemployment and the high school graduation probability components

       have the standard logit form. The wage density component also has

       the standard log-normal form.

Step 3 From the previous steps, we can get the values of the likelihood com-

       ponents for diﬀerent parameter values. The likelihood function is the

       type probability weighted sum of the likelihood components.

Step 4 We choose the values of the parameters and the prior type probability

       parameters π 1 , π 2 , π 11 , and π21 , namely the probability of the 2 crime

       types and the conditional probability of being an unemployment type

       1 conditional on crime type, to maximize the likelihood. This gives us

       the parameter estimates. As usual in maximum likelihood estimation,

       standard errors are calculated from the inverse of the sample informa-

       tion matrix.


     In general, solving and estimating dynamic discrete choice models, such

 as this, is computationally demanding. Recall that in order to solve for the

 Bellman equation described in more detail in the Appendix, we needed to

 solve for the expected values, E[Vt+1 (st+1 )|st ]. To derive these expected value


                                                 19
functions, we needed to integrate over the shocks ²Nt and ²Ct and over the

wage and employment shocks. This integration had to be done for each point

in the state space st − ²t at each period t. On top of this, the above Dynamic

Programming problem had to be solved once at each likelihood evaluation,

when we assume no heterogeneity, and several times when we introduce some

unobserved heterogeneities. As a result, the programming and computation

were non trivial. Details on model estimation are to be found in the section

on the Solution Algorithm and the Likelihood in the Appendix.16


4        Estimation Results

Parameter estimates are presented in Table 2. Notice that the intercept of

the net utility of not committing crime for both types is lower before age 18

(ci01 < ci02 , i = 1, 2). This together with δ 18 < δ is how our model explains

the fact that in the data, arrest rates drop sharply at age 18. In the current

criminal justice system, juvenile oﬀenses have more lenient sentences, and

juvenile records are sealed. Note that the estimated relationship between

arrest rates and wages is not monotonic.17 This could be why the wage

coeﬃcients of crime choice model in past research such as Lochner (1999),

Grogger (1998) have been of mixed sign.

       The depreciation rate (1 − δ) is about 2% per month, which amounts

  17
    The dummies for low, medium and high wages in the utility function are not necessarily
increasing in wage levels.




                                                    20
to an annual depreciation rate of about 21%. Our estimates are consistent

with past work such as Grogger (1995), Kling (1999), who have pointed out

that the eﬀect of past criminal history on current variables such as employ-

ment and wages is temporary. The depreciation rate of the juvenile criminal

record at age 18, or (1 − δ 18 ) is about 24%. This, combined with the annual

depreciation rate of 21% implies that juvenile crime records have a relatively

small eﬀect on the adult behavior.

   Before age 18, the parameter estimates indicate that overall for low crime

types, being employed increases crime, i.e., c1l1 , c1m1 , c1h1 < 0, whereas for

high crime types, being employed tends to decrease crime, i.e., c2l1 , c2m1 > 0,

and c2h1 < 0 but insigniÞcant. Furthermore, attending high school decreases

crime for the low crime type (c11 > 0), but increases it for the high crime type

(c21 < 0). One would expect that employment and high school attendance

would reduce crime. However, suppose the low crime types who work instead

of going to high school tend to be the low achievement types, perhaps, be-

cause they are less academically gifted, and the high crime types who stay in

high school rather than work tend to be lazy and hence low achievers. Then

this result makes sense, since Eckstein and Wolpin (1999) show that the low

achievers tend to be more criminally active. In short, we need to be more

careful about the unobserved and observed characteristics in explaining the

criminal, labor market and schooling behavior of youth together. Unfortu-

nately, compared to the NLSY data used by Eckstein and Wolpin (1999), our



                                              21
panel data has only limited information on schooling as only the Þnal year

of school attendance is recorded.

   Other parameters have either the expected signs or are not signiÞcant.

For example, the state dependence eﬀect indicates that a history of criminal

activity reduces the utility of not committing a crime (c6 < 0, α > 0). While

the high school graduation dummy has a negative sign, it is not signiÞcant.

Nor is the negative sign of the arrest record coeﬃcient in the initial unemploy-

ment probability (h1 < 0). The criminal type (type 1) has higher probability

of being of a high unemployment type as evidenced by π 11 > π 21 . π 11 is the

conditional probability of being a high unemployment type (type 1) given

that the agent belongs to the high crime type (type 1) and π 21 is the condi-

tional probability of being a high unemployment type (type 1) given that the

agent belongs to low crime type (type 2). Moreover, high school graduation

reduces unemployment transition probability (b2 < 0) while a longer criminal

record increases it (b3 > 0). Unemployment rate probability intercepts are

lower for employment type 1, both before and after 18 (b100 < b200 , b101 < b201 ).

Also, for both employment types, the unemployment probability falls with

age (b11 < 0, b21 < 0). This is also evident from the age unemployment proÞles

in Fig 2. Wage growth increases with age (µg1i < 0, i = 1, 2) and decreases

with past criminal records (µg2 < 0). The starting wage increases with past

criminal records, but the coeﬃcient is insigniÞcant (µb2 > 0).

   We follow Keane and Wolpin (1997) and Eckstein and Wolpin (1999) and



                                                22
do not include the observed characteristics in our model. Our results show

that the criminally at risk type is about 28% of the sample. Moreover, these

types clearly aﬀect behavior, as is evident in the diﬀerence in their crime,

unemployment and wage proÞles depicted in Figures 6 − 8. We argue that

the unobserved types, in particular the unobserved criminal types, reßect

the eﬀect of the observed characteristics on the crime rate. In Table 3, we

report the results of a logit type regression which relates the odds of the

individual being of crime type 1 with several observed characteristics. That

is, we estimated the following equation.



                       ln[Pc1 /(1 − Pc1 )] = β 0 + β 1 X.

   Most of the signs are reasonable. Being white increases the non-criminal

type probability. So does the father and mother being in household from age

12 to 18, socioeconomic status of the family when young, growing up in a

loving household. On the other hand, the father having been unemployed

when young, ever being a gang member, any of the parents ever being ar-

rested, all increase the probability of being the criminal type. Furthermore,

the probability of being a criminal type increases with the number of friends

who are arrested. It is interesting to note that mothers working outside the

home when the individual grew up actually increases the probability of being

a low crime type. The coeﬃcients of the religion dummies are relative to the

unknown religious beliefs. Being Jewish or being Catholic reduces the crimi-


                                               23
nal type probability compared to other religious beliefs. But as the standard

errors indicate, most of the coeﬃcients are insigniÞcant. Both R-squares

and the adjusted R-squares are low, so that much unexplained heterogeneity

remains.


5     Simulation Exercises

This section has two distinct components. The Þrst deals with how well the

data and the simulated model track each other. The second deals with the

eﬀects of some policy experiments.

5.1    Generated and Actual Data

In Figures 1 to 3 and Figure 9 vs. Figure 4, we compare the simulation results

with the data. The model Þts well with regard to the overall age arrest proÞle

and the age unemployment proÞle. It Þts the age median wage proÞle much

better than the age mean wage proÞle. This is quite natural since maximum

likelihood is robust against outliers, and tries to Þt the distribution of wages

instead of its mean. In contrast to most age wage proÞles in empirical labor

economics, real wage growth here is sluggish until the age 24, even showing

occasional decreases. This, we suspect, is due to the fact that our panel data

consists of a single cohort which experienced a business cycle downturn in

the period 1978 to 1982. Figure 9 depicts the simulated age arrest proÞles

with diﬀerent past criminal records. Notice that the simulated arrest proÞles

for individuals with more past arrest records lie above those with fewer ones.

                                              24
This corresponds to the actual proÞles, as depicted in Figure 4. That is,

proÞles indicate that repeat oﬀenders commit more crimes than others. Thus,

greater criminal activity by repeat oﬀenders comes naturally from our setup.

   Figure 6 plots the simulated age arrest proÞles of the four types separately.

Notice that there are large diﬀerences in arrest rates among the types. In

particular, the arrest rate of the at-risk youths (criminal types with both

low and high unemployment) seem to be 2 to 4 times as high as that of

the others. This is also consistent with repeat oﬀenders committing most

crimes. Also, notice from Figure 6, that it is the arrest rate of the criminal

types (criminal type 2) that shows a rapid decline after age 18 so that it

is the criminally prone types who improve dramatically after age 18. This

is consistent with the arrest rate decreasing with age after 18. Figures 7 −

8 plot the simulated unemployment and wage proÞles for the 4 diﬀerent

types. The types do look diﬀerent. Note that just as the diﬀerence in age

arrest proÞles is greatest for the criminal types in Figure 6, the diﬀerence

between the age unemployment and age wage proÞles are largest for the two

unemployment types in Figures 7 and 8. Hence, there seems to be evidence

of an interaction between being more prone to committing crimes and being

unemployed. Both crime types for the high unemployment type lie above

the low unemployment type, but there is more separation between the two

crime types in the high unemployment group, and the separation increases

with age. This is consistent with crime and unemployment reinforcing each



                                              25
other.

5.2      Simulation Exercises

Next, we conduct some counter factual simulations to better understand some

policy issues of interest. First, we try and look at the extent of dynamic de-

terrence. As explained earlier, dynamic deterrence occurs to the extent that

agents are deterred from crime by looking forward and considering the eﬀects

of their current actions on future outcomes. In the simulation, both static

state dependence and dynamic deterrence are present. Criminal history af-

fects employment outcomes as well as choices. At the same time, individuals

take into account the eﬀect of current choices on future outcomes. In order

to get an idea of the extent of static state dependence versus dynamic de-

terrence, we conduct two experiments. In experiment A, we look at what

the outcomes would have been if criminal history did not aﬀect employment

outcomes, though individuals expected it to do so. The diﬀerence between

the original simulation and this counter factual exercise captures the extent

of state dependence. We implement this counter factual exercise by setting

the coeﬃcients for the number of past oﬀenses in the unemployment probit

in the likelihood calculation to zero. Notice that in this exercise, to make

the policy unanticipated, we still keep the coeﬃcients in the DP routine

unchanged.

   In experiment B, in order to get an idea of the extent of dynamic de-

terrence, we look at what the outcomes would have been if criminal history

                                             26
did not aﬀect employment outcomes, and individuals did not expect it to

do so. The diﬀerence between the second simulation and this counter fac-

tual captures the extent of dynamic deterrence. We implement this counter

factual exercise by setting both the coeﬃcients for the past criminal history

(in the unemployment probit in the likelihood calculation) and the coeﬃ-

cients in the DP routine corresponding to the anticipated eﬀects of current

criminal outcomes, to zero. A loose interpretation might be that experiment

A corresponds to the case where all criminal records are destroyed, but no

one knows about it. As a result, there would be no state dependence, em-

ployment opportunities of criminals would be better, and for this reason, we

would expect crime to fall. However, if they know about it, which would

correspond to experiment B, crime would rise because dynamic deterrence

would be eliminated.

   The results of experiment A are found in Figures 10 − 12 where we plot

the ratios of the proÞles generated by this experiment to the original simu-

lated proÞle. We see that as expected, the unemployment ratio lies below

unity. This makes sense as the impact eﬀect of this experiment reduces the

unemployment rate. In addition, there is an induced eﬀect on the arrest ra-

tio and the wage ratio. The arrest ratio also falls as being employed reduces

the probability of committing a crime after age 16. However, this eﬀect is

small. The arrest ratio can be seen as a measure of the extent of the state

dependence eﬀect, or the stigma eﬀect, of past criminal records on current



                                             27
employment and consequently on current criminal behavior. Wages Þrst fall

then rise as does the wage ratio. This comes from lower wage agents accept-

ing employment which pulls the wage down initially. As past employment

raises wages, wage ratios in the future rise.

       What if, in addition, this elimination of criminal records were anticipated?

In Figures 10 − 12 we can see that anticipated elimination also reduces un-

employment because of the elimination of past arrest records. But the arrest

rate rises. That is, erasing past criminal records to promote employment

raises the incentives to commit crimes as there is no adverse eﬀect expected

on employment. The diﬀerence in the two crime ratios in experiment B and

A gives an idea of the extent to which future unemployment induced by crim-

inal acts prevents them. This is because B has no dynamic deterrence and A

does, so that their diﬀerence (scaled by the original simulated proÞles) gives

the extent of the dynamic deterrence eﬀect. This diﬀerence is large which

indicates that the prospect of future unemployment works as a strong deter-

rence against committing crimes. This suggests that the dynamic deterrence

eﬀect is stronger than the static state dependence eﬀect. Not only do they

work in opposite directions, but the dynamic deterrence more than cancels

out the static state dependence eﬀect.18

       As is well known, crime rates have fallen in the past decade but show
  18
    The astute reader might ask whether the results are immune to changing the order of
the experiments, i.e., whether the path matters. When this was checked, no substantive
diﬀerence was found.

signs of levelling oﬀ. An important question in the policy arena is the extent

to which this is due to the booming economy of the period. To get a partial

handle on this, consider another policy experiment, where, given the current

state variable, we reduce the one period ahead unemployment probability

after the Þrst month of age 18, by 5%. That is,



                    Put+1 = 0.95 × exp(θut )/[1 + exp(θut )]

The results on the unemployment, arrest rate and real wage ratios are plotted

in Figures 13 − 15. Because of the persistence of unemployment, unemploy-

ment rates are reduced by more than 5%. When the reduction is unantici-

pated, unemployment falls so the ratio is below unity. Since the employed

commit fewer crimes, the induced eﬀect on the arrest ratio also pulls it be-

low unity. The wage ratio initially falls below unity and then rises for similar

reasons as in experiment A. In contrast to this, if the policy is anticipated,

the reduction in unemployment transition probability increases crime. Again

this is due to the strong dynamic deterrence eﬀect since it is the prospect

of future unemployment which deters crime. This exercise thus makes it

hard to argue that the boom in the 900 s alone can be seen as responsible for

the reduction in crime. However, to the extent that this boom, due to its

length and depth managed to bring those at the very bottom into the labor

force, our approach may be under-estimating the eﬀect of crime reduction.

Bringing such agents into the labor force, thereby providing some a dynamic


                                               29
deterrence eﬀect where none existed before, could well reduce crime.

       One way to obtain larger eﬀects on the crime ratio is to consider the ef-

fects of an anticipated boom followed by a bust. In this case we get higher

eﬀects on crime ratios as depicted in Figure 16. Given the current state

variable, we reduce the one period ahead unemployment probability by 5%,

after the Þrst month of age 20, for 2 years.19 After this the unemployment

transition probability is assumed to increase by 5%, compared to the original

one for 2 years. Behavior is aﬀected even before the onset of the reduction of

the unemployment transition probability because individuals anticipate the

reduction in future threat of unemployment. Before age 20, expectations of

a good labor market, makes crime and hence arrest rise. As a result, the

arrest rate ratio rises above unity, and once the boom begins, expectations of

a slump to follow reduces crime, and hence, the arrest rate ratio drops below

unity quite considerably to begin with. As the slump occurs, expectations

of normal times raise crime and the arrest ratio. The policy maker, failing

to understand the deterrence aspect of the unemployment eﬀect, could erro-

neously conclude that low unemployment is the cure for crime. However, a

permanent reduction in unemployment raises crime! Note that if this antici-

pated boom-slump were the reason for the observed decline in crime seen in

the 90’s, we should expect an increase once the slump comes.
  19
     We choose the age of 20 so that the change in the behavior of adults as well as juveniles
anticipating this boom and then slump can be iullustrated. It makes no diﬀerence to the
earlier simulations if the same age (of 20) is used there.




                                                       30
       What about the eﬀect of greater enforcement? This policy, joint with

harsher sentencing, has been the standard approach to combatting crime. In

our next experiment, we increase the anticipated probability of being caught

by 10%. As shown in Figures 17 − 19, the eﬀect is to raise the crime ratio for

the young and reduce it for the old. This occurs as the young face weaker

penalties as their criminal history depreciates at age 18, and they inter-

temporally substitute towards crime. It reduces the unemployment ratio for

adults below unity since adults commit fewer crimes. It reduces the wage

ratio for the young and raises it for the old as a result of the eﬀect of the

policy on their criminal behavior.

       We also look at the eﬀect of not sealing juvenile records. This roughly

corresponds to making δ 18 = δ.20 The arrest ratio is depicted in Figure 20.

As expected, the young commit fewer crimes, realizing that their criminal

record is more permanent. The old commit more crimes as they cannot get

away from their juvenile records.

       Finally we look at the what happens if we increase both δ and δ 1 by

0.1%. This corresponds to decreasing the depreciation rate of past crimi-

nal histories. There are large diﬀerences between countries in the extent to

which an agent’s past haunts him. In Japan for example, a criminal record

is relatively permanent. In the U.S. on the other hand, criminal history is
  20
    Of course, if juvenile records were completely eradicated, and there were no other
eﬀects such as diﬀerences in criminal and other human capital among juvenile oﬀenders
and others, then δ 18 should be zero. This is why making δ 18 = δ only roughly corresponds
to the opening of the juvenile records.



                                                    31
much easier to disguise. In fact, only in recent years have there been laws

such as Megan’s Law, on informing neighbors of sex oﬀenders who move in.

The results are shown in Figure 21. We notice that even a small decrease in

depreciation rate generates a large decrease in the crime rate. This highlights

the importance of dynamic deterrence. The work of Glaeser, Sacerdote and

Scheinkman (1996), or Williams and Sickles (2000) on social human capi-

tal suggests that such eﬀects could be important even though they do not

directly look at depreciation as we do. Casual observations across diﬀerent

countries and regions reinforce this conclusion. In countries where people

live in a closely knit communities, where it is often said that “everybody

knows everybody”, so that there is no depreciation, crime is lower. In these

communities, even though legal consequences of oﬀenses may be lenient and

temporary, past misconduct of their members are not forgotten, and hence

the long memory among the other community members work as a strong

deterrent against crime. These are issues that could be further investigated

by conducting international comparisons of criminal behavior.

   In sum, our results emphasize the role of future unemployment as an im-

portant factor holding people back from committing crimes. Even though

much attention has been paid to the relationship between labor market out-

comes and crime, we think this dynamic deterrence aspect has been neglected.

When researchers consider the eﬀect of unemployment and wages on crime,

they mainly focus on the direct state dependence eﬀect on criminal behav-



                                              32
ior. Instruments and other methods are used to avoid endogeneity problems

due to state dependence or heterogeneity. However, correcting endogeneity

in this manner does not give all the structural parameters of interest, and

hence only incompletely addresses the eﬀect of government policy since ex-

pectational eﬀects cannot be incorporated. Our results agree with many past

results insofar as unemployment and wages have small direct eﬀects on crime.

What is new in our work is that despite such small direct eﬀects, government

employment and wage policies could change criminal behavior signiÞcantly,

mainly through changing peoples’ anticipations about their future.

   As is the case with all structural estimation results, we need to interpret

the above results with caution, and more work needs to be done to assess

the robustness of the results with respect to various alternative model speci-

Þcations. For example, we assumed that the individuals only choose between

committing a crime and not committing a crime and we treated all crimes

as the same. Obviously, the criminal justice system pursues the oﬀenders

of diﬀerent crimes with diﬀerent intensities, and punishes and records them

with diﬀerent degrees of severity. Hence, the both the state dependence and

the deterrence eﬀect should be diﬀerent depending on the types of crimes

committed. Such issues could be addressed in the future, with better data

sets.




                                             33
6     Concluding Remarks

Our estimation and simulation exercises show the following. First, note that

our generated data match the actual age arrest, age unemployment and age

median wage proÞles remarkably well, despite the parsimonious model struc-

ture and parameterization. Second, the parameter estimates have the ex-

pected signs or are insigniÞcant. Third, unobserved as well as observed het-

erogeneities are very important in explaining the data. In fact, the criminally

prone type, which is about 27% of our population, is estimated to have an

arrest rate up to 4 times as high as the rest of our population. In all of our

simulation results, it is the criminally prone types who decrease their crime

rates faster than the other types after the age 18. This runs counter to the

assertions that criminal behavior cannot be corrected afterwards. Fourth,

employment status has a negative, although small, direct eﬀects on crime.

It is the possibility of future unemployment which works as a strong deter-

rence against committing crime. Fifth, the simulation exercises show that

the anticipated consequences of committing crimes are very important in

understanding peoples’ criminal behavior. For example, the increase in the

arrest rate, the traditional deterrence measure, leads to both less crime and

unemployment on average, though it raises youth arrest rates slightly while

lowering the adult ones.

    What are the implications of our work for the conduct of public policy

towards crime? Our structural dynamic approach provides a uniÞed under-


                                              34
standing of a number of Þndings in the traditional literature. Kahan (1995)

claims that eﬀective anti-crime policies are those that change people’s antic-

ipation of future punishments. This is exactly our point, and these future

punishments seem to come from the labor market! There have been sev-

eral papers showing that early intervention programs such as the Job Corps,

The Perry Preschool Program, The Syracuse University Family Development

Plan and the Quantum Opportunity Program are very eﬀective in reducing

crime21 , see Lochner (1999) for a summary of such results. This is exactly

what would be expected from our model, since anticipated later interven-

tion allows criminals to look forward to negating the consequences of their

actions. Hence, the dynamic deterrence eﬀect via future employment is re-

duced. Early intervention has no such adverse eﬀect on dynamic deterrence.

This suggests that early prevention is more eﬀective than redemption.

       Much more needs to be done on this area of structural estimation of

criminal behavior. First, more needs to be done in checking the robustness

with respect to diﬀerent speciÞcations. In particular, in future work, we need

to relax the assumption that individuals can only choose between committing

and not committing crime, and to increase the degree of choice over the extent

of crimes. It is natural to think that certain crimes carry more stigma than

others, and putting all crimes into one category is undesirable, as they are

bound to have diﬀerent eﬀects. In addition, this would allow us to include
  21
    The Perry Preschool Program for disadvantaged minority children reduced arrests
through age 27 by 50%.



                                                35
sentencing policies in our model since sentencing variation is across a variety

of crimes. Finally, the relationship between high school attendance, work

behavior, and crime before age 18 needs to be better understood. Since

our crime data only has years of last schooling, and lacks any measure of

actual school attendance until then, or achievements with respect to grades,

with our data set it is impossible to conduct an empirical exercise on youth

behavior before the age 18 comparable to the kind of work done by Eckstein

and Wolpin (1999).

8.2    Bellman Equations


The value function of the individual before the age 16 of not committing a

crime is



                VNt (st ) = uNt (st ) + βE[Vt+1 (st+1 )|st ] + ²Nt .

   where



                               st = (t, nct , iht , ²t ),



                                   nct+1 = δnct ,



                                  ²t = (²Nt , ²Ct ).

   The value function of not committing a crime at or after the age 16 before

age 18 is:



VNt (st ) = uNt (st − ²t )

             +[1 − Pu (st )]

             βE[Vt+1 (t, nct+1 = δnct , iut+1 = 0, Wt+1 , ih, ²t+1 )|st ]

             +Pu (st )βE[Vt+1 (t, nct+1 = δnct , iut+1 = 1, Wt+1 = 0, ih , ²t+1 )|st ]

             +²Nt .

                                                     42
   That is, it is the utility of not committing a crime today and having an

arrest record of δnct tomorrow. In the next period, you are unemployed with

probability Pu (st ) and have an expected payoﬀ in present value of



           βE[Vt+1 (t, nct+1 = δnct , iut+1 = 1, Wt+1 = 0, ih , ²t+1 )|st ].

   If you are employed in the next period, the analogous expression arises.

The value function of committing a crime is similarly deÞned.

   The value function of the individual at the Þrst month of age 18 of not

committing a crime is has 4 elements, which consists of the continuation

payoﬀs from the 4 combinations of graduating or not, and being employed

or not. That is,




VNt (st ) = uNt (st − ²t )

             +Pg (nct )(1 − Pu (t, nct , iut , ihg = 1))

             EVt+1 (t, nct+1 = δnct , iut+1 = 0, Wt+1 , ihg = 1, ²t+1 |st )

              +Pg (nct )Pu (t, nct , iut , ihg = 1)

             EVt+1 (t, nct+1 = δnct , iut+1 = 1, Wt+1 = 0, ihg = 1, ²t+1 |st )

             +(1 − Pg (nct ))(1 − Pu (t, nct , iut , ihg = 0))

             EVt+1 (t, nct+1 = δnct , iut+1 = 0, Wt+1 , ihg = 0, ²t+1 |st )

             +(1 − Pg (nct ))Pu (t, nct , iut , ihg = 0)

             EVt+1 (t, nct+1 = δnct , iut+1 = 1, Wt+1 = 0, ihg = 0, ²t+1 |st ) + ²N t .

                                                      43
After the Þrst month of the age 18, the individual has either graduated from

high school or not. Hence, the value of the individual not committing any

crime is just a combination of the payoﬀs from being employed or not. That

is,




VNt (st ) = uNt (st − ²t )

             +[1 − Pu (st )]βE[Vt+1 (t, nct+1 = δnct , iut+1 = 0, Wt+1 , ihg , ²t+1 )|st ]

             +Pu (st )βE[Vt+1 (t, nct+1 = δnct , iut+1 = 1, Wt+1 = 0, ihg , ²t+1 )|st ]

             +²Nt .

8.3    The Solution Algorithm and the Log Likelihood

In order to solve for the dynamic programming problem at each DP solution

step, we need to integrate the value function with respect to the taste shock

(²Nt , ²Ct ) and the wage shock. We follow the steps described below.


1) Integration with respect to the taste shock: Rust (1987) suggests a method

      which allows for the analytical integration of the value function when

      we assume that the shocks ²Nt , ²Ct have i.i.d. extreme values distribu-

      tions. In this event he points out that the expected value function in

      period t has the following expression



             E{²} [Vt (st )] = log[exp(V N t (st − ²t )) + exp(V Ct (st − ²t ))]


                                                   44
     since they have been integrated over. V Nt (st − ²t ), and V Ct (st − ²t )

     are the value functions net of the taste shock ²t at period t and state

     vector st . This eliminates the need to numerically integrate the value

     function with respect to the taste shocks ²Nt ,²Ct .

2) Integration with respect to the wage shock: The expected value function

     at period t is

     E{W,²} [V (st )|st−1 ] = E{W } (log[exp(V Nt (st −²t ))+exp(V Ct (st −²t ))]|st−1 ).

     We approximate this integral by taking Þnite grid points over the wage

     distribution and evaluate the density weighted sum of the value function

     as the integral (See Rust 1998). That is,

               E{W } (log[exp(V N t (st − ²t )) + exp(V Ct (st − ²t ))]|st−1 )
                               Z
             = (1 − Pu (st−1 )) log[exp(V Nt (., iut = 0, Wt , .))

                  +exp(V Ct (.iut = 0, Wt , .))]f(Wt |st−1 )dWt

                  +Pu (st−1 ) log[exp(V N t (., iut = 1, Wt = 0, .))

                  +exp(V Ct (., iut = 1, Wt = 0, .))]



                                      M
                                      X
                = (1 − Pu (st−1 ))          log[exp(V N t (., iut = 0, Wtm , .))
                                      m=1
                      +exp(V Ct (.iut = 0, Wtm , .))]f (Wtm |st−1 )

                      +Pu (st−1 ) log[exp(V Nt (., iut = 1, Wt = 0, .))

                      +exp(V Ct (., iut = 1, Wt = 0, .))].

                                                    45
   Since we assume that past criminal records depreciate at rate (1 − δ),

the past criminal history variable nct is a continuous one. Since we cannot

evaluate the expected value function at inÞnite state space points of nct ,

we solve for the expected value function at Þnite q Chebychev grid points

(nct,1 , ..., nct,q ) and then interpolate them using the Chebychev Polynomial

Least Squares Interpolation (for details, see Judd (1999) ).

   After integrating out ²t , the probability of committing a crime and get-

ting caught for individual i under the parameter value θ given sit is




                                               exp(V Ct (sit − ²t ))
     P (iC = 1|sit − ²t , θ) = PC
                                    exp(V Nt (sit − ²t )) + exp(V Ct (sit − ²t ))

where iC is deÞned to be 1 if the person gets caught in committing the crime,

and 0 otherwise. PC is the probability of getting caught. If individuals are

of diﬀerent types, then the above needs to be indexed by type as well so that

the likelihood increment for individual i of type j in period t is

LitjHS (θj ) = I(age 6= 18) + I(age = 18)P (ihg |sit − ²t )ihg (1 − P (ihg |sit − ²t ))1−ihg .

   LitjC (θ j ) is the crime increment of the likelihood function. If the indi-

vidual commits the crime, then the likelihood is given by the Þrst term, and

if he does not, by the second term. LitjE (θ j ) is the employment and wage

increment of the likelihood. If he is below 16, it equals unity. If he is above

16, and is unemployed, the likelihood increment is P (iut |sit , θj ). If he is em-

ployed, then the likelihood increment is the product of the probability of

employment and the wage density. LitjHS (θj ) is the high school graduation

increment of the likelihood, which is deÞned similarly.

   In our data, only employment spells of 6 months or more, and only unem-

ployment spells of 2 months or more are recorded. Hence, if we just estimate

the employment dynamics directly from the data, our results will be biased.

Using the steps below, we try to recover the missing employment and unem-

ployment spells through the model of employment dynamics.


1) Missing data after an employment spell must contain an immediate un-

      employment spell of less than 2 months. Had the unemployment spell

      not been immediate, it would have been recorded as employment. Had

                                                       47
      it been longer than or equal to 2 months, it would have been recorded

      as an unemployment spell. Similarly, missing data after an unemploy-

      ment spell must contain an immediate employment spell of less than 6

      months. If the blank data after an employment spell is of one period,

      then we infer it has to be an unemployment spell. If it is of 2 periods, it

      must be an unemployment spell followed by the employment spell of a

      month. If a blank data after an unemployment spell is of one month, it

      must be an employment spell. If it is more than one month, we cannot

      say.

2) In all other cases, we use the probability of employment in the entering

      state to run the employment/unemployment probabilities forward. To

      be consistent with the data, the augmented employment spells are re-

      stricted to not exceed 6 months and unemployment spells are restricted

      not to exceed 2 months.


   The likelihood increment for individual i is the product of the likelihood

increments for all quarters and types so that

where Θ is the vector of parameters for all types. Also π j is the probability of

the individual being of crime type j, while π jl is the conditional probability

of the individual being of unemployment type l, given he is of crime type j.
