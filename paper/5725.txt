            We present a model in which a government’s current capital controls policy signals future

policies.     Controls on capital outflows evolve in response to news on technology, conditional on

government attitudes towards taxation of capital. When there is uncertainty over government types,

a policy of liberal capital outflows sends a favorable signal that may trigger a capital inflow. This

prediction is consistent with the experience of several countries that have liberalized their capital

account.

      Controls on international     capital flows are a common form of financial regulation.

Changes in the extent of these controls are also common.             Of 182 countries surveyed by the

IMF in 1995, 129 were classified as restricting international         capital transactions.      At least 50

of them had significantly      altered these regulations in the previous 12 months.

      Despite the widespread use of capital controls and the frequency with which such

restrictions are modified, little work has been done to model the impact of changes in these

regulations on capital flows.      Perhaps this deficiency reflects the view that the effect of lifting

or imposing controls is clear from basic economic theory.            Consider, for example, the

removal of restrictions    on capital outflows.    If controls are binding when the liberalization        is

implemented     (so that offshore returns exceed onshore returns), a liberalization           should lead to

a capital outflow, as funds flow to where returns are highest, 1 while removal of nonbinding

controls should have no effect.

      Actual experience with lifting controls, however, tells a different story.          Many countries

that have removed controls on ouflows         have experienced rapid and massive inflows of

capital.2 A popular explanation,      motivated by the work of Dooley and Isard (1980), was

formalized by Lab5n and Larrain (1993).           Controls that prevent investors from withdrawing

capital from a country act like investment irreversibility.         Their removal makes investors more

willing to invest in a country, as it easier to get their capital out in the future.

      However, the link between capital controls and investment flexibility, though essential

to any model of capital controls, provides a partial explanation         of capital inflows.      This

explanation depends crucially on expected persistence of current policies, but, unlike

technological   constraints,   policies may change.       In fact, governments   that succeed in attracting



                                                      1
foreign investment have a strong incentive to lock the door once the fattened calves have

come inside.       To make sense of the flexibility argument and motivate the persistence of

policies affecting capital mobility, one needs a model that captures the interaction between

optimizing, forward-looking      investors and governments.

        Our approach to modeling capital controls and explaining the observed inflows

following the adoption of a regime of liberal outflows views capital controls as potential

signals of future government behavior,        Specifically,   we suggest that besides providing greater

flexibility for current allocation of capital, a regime of free capital mobility may signal that

imposition of controls is less likely to occur in the future and, more generally, that future

policies are likely to be more favorable to investment.         Our argument rests on the belief that

investors have imperfect information      on governments’      intentions and constraints,   and may

therefore use the observation     of current policies toward investment      to infer the course of

future policies.     This gives governments   an incentive to allow free capital mobility so as to

provide a favorable signal on future investment policies.         If the signal is successful, capital

flows in.

        A signaling model must make this motive consistent with the ultimate purpose of

capital controls, which is often to broaden the domestic tax base.         Countries with poorly

developed tax systems often rely on revenues from financial repression, enforcing a

differential between onshore and offshore returns to capital by regulations         aimed at “trapping”

capital onshore.     In our model, it is precisely those governments      that depend most on such a

tax base that impose controls, even though such controls may lead to a lower expected tax

base.
          To make the argument convincing,      we must show that governments       use capital controls

as an equilibrium     response to information   they receive:   the choice of an open capital account

signals good news about the future, and vice versa.         However, if adoption of a regime of free

capital mobility is expected to lead to a capital inflow, why would a government           that expects

bad times not attempt to take advantage of this?         (Formally, the question is: Why does a

separating equilibrium     prevail, rather than a pooling equilibrium      in which all governments

choose not to impose controls.)      To answer this question, we show that some governments

choose to impose capital controls, even though they know this is interpreted as an unfavorable

signal.

          The argument behind this result is simple,     Consider a government that raises revenue

from several sources, including capital taxation, to finance the provision of public goods.

Suppose that revenues (and hence expenditures)          have a stochastic component and that

government welfare is highly concave in the level of expenditure,           so that low expenditure

implies very low welfare.      A government that anticipates low revenues from other sources is

especially sensitive to the possibility   of low capital tax collection.     It will then impose

controls to self-insure against bad states of nature (when capital would flow out), thereby

assuring a minimum level of revenues in all states of nature.         It will impose controls, even

though, by doing so, it may forgo higher revenues on average across all states,

          Our approach has both strengths and limitations.      First, in contrast to most previous

studies, we model capital controls as a dynamic component of governments’              problem rather

than as exogenous constraints applying over the whole horizon.             Second, unlike the standard

symmetric modeling of controls on inflows and outflows, we recognize that real-world



                                                    3
controls are typical] y asymmetric:     stricter either on inflows or--more frequently--on      outflows,

Greater realism in these respects comes at the cost of simplification        elsewhere.   For instance,

we do not distinguish      between restrictions on short-term (or portfolio) and those on long-term

(or FDI) flows, nor between restrictions on residents and nonresidents,         although one may

imagine situations where liberalizing residents’ portfolio activity alone may send a favorable

signal, thereby indirect] y promoting other inflows.        Also, we focus solely on policies affecting

capital mobility, although we are aware that capital account liberalization        is often only one

element of broader reform programs.        However, by focusing on a single motive for inflows,

we can make the clearest case for the signaling role of policies affecting capital mobility.

Our model suggests that imperfect information about a government’s             intentions may provide

an incentive to use free capital mobility to enhance the credibility of a broader reform

program.      It is to a reformist government’s    advantage to show an early commitment        to an

open capital account, by exposing itself to risks that less committed governments          cannot

afford.

          The paper is structured as follows.     The next section reviews the liberalization

experience of a number of countries, pointing to stylized facts that are consistent with our

model of capital controls but may be more difficult to explain by alternative models.            The

model is described in Section 2 and solved in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the results, and

Section 5 concludes.


               1. Capital controls:   Some stylized facts and liberalizations       episodes


          We begin with a few stylized facts.      First, capital controls are much more common



                                                      4
among developing countries than among industrial countries.           At the beginning of 1995, for

instance, capital controls were used by 126 of 158 developing countries, against only 3 of 24

OECD countries (Greece, Norway, and Turkey).

      Second, capital controls are predominantly         aimed at restricting capital ouflows.    These

controls take a variety of forms, including quantitative       restrictions and outright prohibition   of

outflows, requirements    to surrender a portion of the outflow to a low interest rate account,

and dual exchange rates.        Though these regulations look different, in practice all aim at

stemming outflows by making their cost prohibitive.

      Third, capital controls appear to play two main roles, either in support of governments’

attempt to broaden the tax base for a capital levy, inflation tax, and various forms of

“financial repression”,   or in support of fixed or managed exchange rate policies.

      Finally, liberalizations     of capital outflows are often accompanied    by a sharp increase in

net capital inflows, as the experience of some countries that have recently liberalized their

capital accounts illustrates.      (See Figure 1 for summary data.)    The four episodes we review

are those of Italy, New Zealand, Uruguay, and Spain.

      Italy began to dismantle its system of controls on capital outflows in November             1984.

The compulsory     zero-interest    deposit on portfolio investment abroad was reduced for residents

and abolished for mutual funds.        The surrender requirement    was further reduced in 1985 and

1986 and abolished in 1987, and the crediting of banknotes to capital accounts was liberalized

in August 1986. Though the liberalization        was completed only in May 1990, its main steps

occurred in 1986 and 1987, after which remaining restrictions ceased to be binding (see

Bartolini and Bodnar, 1992 and Giavazzi and Giovannini,            1989, for analysis of this episode).



                                                     5
Large inflows were recorded from 1987, and private investors were primarily responsible for

them.3

         In November     1984, New Zealand abolished the exchange and capital controls that had

been in place since 1938, as part of a broad policy of financial liberalization.             In contrast with

the policies followed by Italy and Spain during the 1980s (where the liberalization              was part of

a policy of greater exchange rate fixity), New Zealand floated its exchange rate soon after the

liberalization.    The capital liberaliza-tion    was rapid and focused on the lifting of restrictions

on outflows, including the surrender of foreign exchange receipts and limits on holdings of

foreign securities and on raising of domestic funds by foreign companies.              Interestingly,

although the financial market was liberalized in June and July 1984, capital inflows did not

surge until year-end, when the capital account was liberalized.            In fact, the net inflow

recorded in 1984 appears to have occurred wholly in the last two months of the year.                    Capital

inflows surged      n 1985, 1986, and 1987, with private investors playing, once again, the

principal role.4

         After nearly two decades of inward-looking        policies and financial repression, Uruguay

began to implement radical reforms in the mid- 1970s, including trade and financial

deregulation,     and--foremost--liberalization    of capital flows.f   The liberalization   of capital

flows proceeded at the fastest pace and before other major policy changes:               in September

1974, exchange rate controls (primarily on outflows) were eliminated and residents were

permitted to hold dollar accounts with domestic banks for the first time, and repatriation of

capital and profits connected with FDI was permitted.            Large capital inflows were recorded in

the four years beginning in 1974. Private investors (mainly from Argentina and the U. S.)



                                                       6
played an essential role also in this episode, a feature we document in Figure 1 by netting

official net loans from net capital inflows (assuming negligible official acquisitions           of equity

and real estate, and negligible foreign investment of the domestic public sector).

       After its entry into the EC in 1986, Spain liberalized capital flows, as part of a broader

plan of fiscal and monetary reform.        Both capital outflows and inflows were liberalized.b

Evidence from offshore-onshore        interest differentials,   however, shows that prior to the

liberalization,    controls on outflows were more stringent than on inflows (Vifials, 1990). In

fact, after the liberalization,   the positive offshore-onshore     interest differential disappeared    and

then turned negative when temporary controls on inflows were introduced to stem the rapid

inflow recorded in 1987. Excluding measures affecting FDI, the main steps in the

liberalization    included the lifting of restrictions on residents’ direct and portfolio investment

abroad, on forward exchange operations, and on real estate investment abroad.                Although the

liberalization    was completed only in 1992, net capital inflows (net of FDI) surged

immediately       after the initial steps of 1986, and continued unabated until the ERM crisis of

1992. Once again, private investors played a primary role in the inflow, as documented                  in

Figure 1, which nets changes in the stock of official loans from total capital flows (excluding

FDI;   see also Schadler et al., 1993, for a discussion of this episode).

       These episodes can be summarized         as follows:     the liberalizations   focussed on removing

restrictions on capital outflows;     they represented early ingredients of broad reforms that

included the lifting of various elements of financial repression;           and they were accompanied

by a surge in net capital inflows.      In the next section we present a model capturing several of

these stylized facts.
                                              2. The model



       Consistent with the arguments outlined in the introduction,       in our model decisions on

capital controls are driven by governments’      desire to increase the stock of domestic capital.

Our main results require government behavior to display two basic features:            first,

government utility (net of the cost incurred when imposing capital controls) should increase in

the stock of domestic capital;     second, the willingness to incur the costs of controls should

differ across governments      in a way (at least, partially) unknown to investors.

       Many of the motives for (and costs o~ capital controls suggested in the literature could

meet these requirements     and fit into our framework.      For instance, utility from domestic

capital could reflect a government’s     interest in maximizing    domestic output, tax base, or

official reserves.’   Costs of controls could reflect concern with distortionary      effects on capital

allocation, penalties enforced by other countries for engaging in beggar-thy-neighbor           policies

(penalties that may include limits on trade credit, exclusion from participation        in coordinated

policies, etc.), or other economic and political factors that affect the importance governments

assign to capital mobility.8    Governments    may also be concerned with the effects of controls

on residents’ ability to smooth consumption       through capital flows, although the practical

relevance of this motive has been questioned.9       A different and important argument concerns

the use of controls to insulate a country from external shocks.        The difficulties associated

with the recent large inflows and subsequent outflows in Latin America, which culminated in

the Mexican crisis of late 1994, underscore the importance of this motive, whose analysis

would require, however, a substantial y different model.        Although analytical clarity dictates

our focus on a single motive for controls, we later discuss how our results may extend beyond


                                                    8
our specific model.

       To capture these considerations       formally, we present the simplest model we could

design to yield our main results.

      We consider a two-period model of a small open economy where a single nonstorable,

homogeneous       good Y, is produced at time t with onshore capital K,, using a concave

technology      Y,= plK~ , where p, is a stochastic productivity   shock and 0<~< 1. The stock of

onshore capital Kf reflects the decisions of competitive,      risk-neutral   investors.   In each period,

investors allocate capital either offshore (at a fixed return r) or onshore, to maximize total

expected returns, discounted by the factor p= 1/(1+r), over the residual horizon. 10 (For

simplicity we also set the government’s        discount factor at p.) Absent adjustment costs, the

return to physical and financial capital is equalized and we make no distinction between the

two. For simplicity, and given the ambiguous evidence in support of capital flows for

consumption-smoothing        purposes (see Footnote 9), we ignore this motive in our analysis.

(Formally, this treatment would follow from the assumption of households’              linear utility;   see

Frenkel and Razin, 1987, for a complete discussion.)         We thus focus on investors’ capital

allocation decisions in response to technology shocks, given endogenous             constraints on capital

mobility. ]l

       The government taxes capital wealth (for simplicity, only at the end of period two), at a

predetermined      rate ~, collecting revenues TK2.’2 Governments       differ by the value they

attach to this revenue,     This heterogeneity   may reflect differences in preferences for

expenditures,     in willingness   to tap revenues other than capital taxation, or in the importance

assigned to free capital mobility, differences which cannot be signaled simply by



                                                      9
announcement.        We parametrize      these differences by a variable x ● ( –~,co), and assume

governments       to have greater information on x than investors.      Although many factors may

differentiate governments’      willingness   to use controls (especially their commitment      to non-

interventionist    policies), for concreteness    we treat x simply as revenues (or obligations,    when

x<O) other than capital taxation, to which the government has access or is willing to use (or

service) at the end of period two. At the end of period two, the government            transforms the

sum ~ Kz +x into nonmarketed          public goods and derives utility W(.) from their supply.      This

function is increasing, continuous,      concave, and satisfies the regularity conditions

   lim W’(z) =-m,      lim W’(z) =m, and lim W’(z) =0 .’3 Thus, government utility
~+–m                Z’–m                     Z+m
from onshore capital is increasing in ~Kf +x (so that a potentially larger captive tax base

tempts governments       to impose controls), but at a decreasing rate (so that a larger x reduces

the incentives to trap a given stock of capital).        We model asymmetric     information by

assuming that governments        are informed about x at the beginning of period one, whereas

investors learn this only at the beginning of period two. We refer to x as a government’s

type; a higher x identifies governments          with greater outside resources or greater willingness

to tap those resources,     Investors have a prior cumulative probability distribution       over types,

G(x).

        We model the direct costs of controls very simply.         (Naturally, “reputational”   costs are

an integral part of our story and are analyzed below.)          Similarly to other models in the

signaling literature, we interpret the cost of controls simply as the cost to the government          of

breaking a commitment        to free capital mobility: 14 whenever controls are in place, the

government pays a cost ~ >0. This approach simplifies the exposition by making the cost of



                                                       10
controls independent      of whether or not controls turn out to bind ex post.’5

       The model’s timing is summarized          in Table 1. The initial state is summarized     by the

initial capital stock, KO, and G(x). At the beginning of each period, before observing current

productivity,      the government    announces whether capital flows are free or restricted in

period t. When controls are imposed, the end-of-period            stock of domestic capital, K,, is

constrained to be at least as large as at the beginning of the period, that is, Kf2K,_ ~, with

KO>0.’6 (We use a dummy variable c, to denote the period t regime, letting c, =F and

cl= R denote the cases of free and restricted mobility, respective y. ) For economy of

exposition, we shall often refer to the adoption of a regime of free capital mobility simply as

a “liberalization”     though, strictly speaking, this term should be reserved to describe a switch

from a regime with capital controls to one without controls.           In Section 4, we discuss when a

“liberalization”     in the strict sense may indeed emerge endogenously        in our model.

       After the government         has announced the financial regime, nature reveals current-period

productivity    p,, which may take the values {O,~}. We initially assume p, to be serially

uncorrelated    and write the probabilities    of p,= O and p,= p as 1-rc and n, respectively.    We

later discuss some implications        of the more realistic assumption that p, is serially correlated.

After p, has been revealed, investors choose K, (in accord with the announced regime) and

profits (as well as taxes, in period two) are collected at the end of the period.


                                                  3. Solution



       Solving the model backward from period two leads us to a unique Perfect Bayesian

Equilibrium,    a standard equilibrium      concept in the signaling literature.   (See, for example,



                                                       11

A. Period-two equilibrium.       After observing   pz, investors compare the marginal return from

investing offshore (inclusive of principal),   p ( 1+r), to that from investing onshore,

V2=p (PZ~ KZP-l+ ( 1– ~) ) (inclusive of the scrap value of a unit of capital).   With free capital

mobility, profit maximization    equalizes p( l+r) and V2, yielding the optimal level of onshore

investment


(1)


which equals zero if pz=O. If, instead, capital controls are in place in period two, investors

may be unable to attain this solution, since the domestic stock of capital must satisfy the

constraint     K~2K1. Then,


(2)                                   K2 = max{K1, Kz’(p2)} .


       Thus, depending on the inherited stock K,, capital controls may or may not bind in

period two in the high state p, =p.    However, controls certainly bind (and the corner solution

K2 =Kl prevails) in the low state p, =0, if a positive K, is inherited from period one. This

possibility,   given investors’ period-one uncertainty about the risk of controls in period two,

plays a crucial role in the period-one equilibrium      studied below.

       At the beginning of period two, the government decides whether or not to impose

controls, given the inherited stock K,.    The government’s     problem can be summarized      by the

function V2 ‘W2( ~, >~)~which defines a tYPe ~’s exPected utilitY gain from imPosing controls.

Types for which ~z>O impose controls in this period, while the remaining types allow free


                                                   12
capital mobility (wit no loss of generality, indifferent types allow free mobility).             Vz is

defined as



(3)   V,(~l,X) = PE2[W(TK2+X)        IK,,c2=R]    -p~        -PE2[W’(TK2+X)     IK1,c2=F]

               = p n[W(TK1+X) -W(TK;(p)          +X)] I’+(l-n)[W(TK,          +X)- W(X)]-~ 1 ,
                  [


where the indicator function I‘ -I (Kl>Kz*(p)) equals one when K1 exceeds the optimal period-

two stock in the high productivity     state pz =p, and zero otherwise.

      Under the model’s assumptions        (in particular, the concavity of W(.)), ~z =VZ(K1,X)

decreases monotonically      in x from ~ to -pg.        Hence, the period-two equilibrium        features a

low range of types (those for whom Vz>0), who impose capital controls in period two, and a

higher range of types with sufficient outside resources that V2<0, who allow free capital

mobility.    This property is intuitive:   capital controls raise expected tax revenues in period

two (the tax base is higher with binding controls and unchanged otherwise), thus raising a

government’s     expected utility from public expenditure.          The concavity of W(.) implies that

this utility gain falls with x, though.    For sufficiently large x, the gain from broadening the

tax base is outweighed     by the cost of controls.      Also, W2 rises with the inherited stock of

capital K]: a higher K, provides a potentially larger captive tax base, and hence stronger

temptation to impose controls.      Based on these properties, we now study the equilibrium

prevailing in period one.


B. Period one:      signaling equilibrium.       In period one, investors also compare the expected

returns from onshore and offshore investment.            In so doing, however, they must consider the

probability that capital controls may be imposed in period two, a probability               that reflects their


                                                        13
current beliefs over government      types, conditional on the policy chosen by the government               at

the beginning of period one.

       To study this problem, denote the probability that controls may be imposed in period

two after having been imposed in period one as yR-yR(KO, K1) =Pr( C2=R Ic1=R ) and the

probability that controls may be imposed in period two after not having been imposed in

period one as yF-yF( KO,K, ) = Pr ( Cz=R Ic1=F ). (These probabilities        depend on both KO and

K,, as these affect the incentives of governments          to impose controls in period one and two,

respectively.)

       Next, the marginal return from investing offshore in period one is p r+ p2( 1+r):               in

equilibrium,     by going offshore in period one, investors earn the risk-free rate in both periods.

The expected marginal return from investing onshore in period one, V,, is



(4) V1(K,, P,, C,,KO) ‘PDKF-’P,       + p2(l+r)[Pr(c2=F)       +Pr(c2=R,not     binding)]

                    + p2 1 -z+ ~K~-1El[p2 IC2=R, binding ]] Pr(c2=R, binding)

                                  —
                                  - p~K~-’p,   +p2(l+r)      - p2yC][(r+~)( l-n(l-I’        ))-npj3K~-’I’]        ,



where I‘ = 1 if KL>Ka*(p) and zero otherwise, and y“ stands for either yF or yR, depending

on whether c1 =F or c1 =R,

       The term - p2yCI(r+~)( 1-m( 1-I’ )) -nP~K~-lll]             in the last line of (4) captures the
                      [

“political risk” faced when investing in a country subject to potential capital controls.             If the

probability of controls in period two, y“, is zero, then the period-one marginal product of

onshore capital, ~ K~ - lp, , equals the offshore rate r, as both onshore and offshore capital

yield p r +p2 (1+r).    In contrast, when the probability of controls in period two is positive,


                                                    14
then the stock K, falls in period one, thus raising the period-one onshore return flow (the

marginal product of capital) above the offshore rate.

      The probabilities     yR and yF are obtained by Bayes’ rule from the prior probability that

Cz=R, conditional     on the policy observed in period one. To clarify the updating process,

denote by R1 the set of types imposing controls in period one, and by ~            the set of types

imposing controls in period two. These sets are defined by R1-R1( KO)- {x: ~l(KO ,x)>O )

and Rz=Rz(Kl )= {x: V,(K1 ,x)>O }, where Vz is defined in (3), and V] is similarly defined in

(7) below.     Also, denote by G(R, )-
                                    ~dG(x) the prior probability of c, =R, by
                                   ‘R,
G(RZ)- [dG(x) the prior probability of CZ=R, and by G(R1nRz)-       f dG(x) their joint
           ‘R,                                                     R:~R,
probability: Then, by Bayes’ rule,


                                                    Pr(cl=Rlcz=R)                 G(R1n~)
(5)          YR~ Pr(c2=Rlc,    =R) = Pr(~2=R).                       = G(R2).
                                                       Pr(cl=R)                  G(RI)-G(R2)    “


      Equation (5) illustrates the effects of the persistence of government policies on the
                                                                           G( R,nR2 )
perceived probability     of period-two controls.    The update factor                   multiplies the
                                                                         GAG
prior G( Rz ): should capital controls’ decisions be independent         across periods, then

G( RlflRz ) = G( R, ) -G(R2) and the posterior probability of period-two controls, yR, would

equal its prior, G( Rz ). When G{ RI nR2) > G( RI )-G( R2), instead, then capital controls

provide an unfavorable      signal of future policies, as governments    imposing controls in period

one are also more likely to do so in period two. In this case, the posterior probability of

period-two controls rises above its prior.     The intuition behind the upgrade of yF, is

symmetrical.

      Next, note that VL is a continuous and decreasing function of KL, for both c1=F and


                                                     15
cl =R, going from infinity for K] ~0,     to –p2~ for K, + m .17 The unconstrained        period-one

profit-maximizing    capital stock, K1*=K,*(PI, KO,c1), is then defined as the unique solution for

KL of


(6)                               pr+p2(I+r)     = VI(K1, P,, C,, KO) .



        Finally, since the term in square brackets in (4) is positive (offshore returns exceed

onshore returns with binding controls), then any rise in y“ reduces the return to K1, and

hence KL* itself.    This key link underlies our signaling equilibrium:     when governments

evaluate policy options at the beginning of period one, they know that actions leading to a

higher perceived probability    of controls in period two will induce a lower desired capital

stock in period one.

        We can now close the model by examining the problem faced by a government               of type

x in period one. This problem is summarized by the function ~, =~l(KO ,x) that defines a

type x’s expected utility from imposing controls in this period one, as a function of the

existing capital stock:


(7)           V,(KO,X) = P’E,[~(TK2+X Ic, =R) - ~(TK2+Xl C,= F)]-           P< - P2~I”     t


where expectations     are taken over realizations of pl and p2, and the indicator function

I” =1( C2=R ) equals one when controls are in place in period two and zero otherwise.

        The properties of W(. ) assure that      lim    V1(KO,X)=~,   and    lim   ~l(Ko,x)=-p~
                                               x+–m                         x+~
for all KO>O. Within these extreme values, the behavior of the (continuous)          function Vi

determines government      policies in period one, just as ~2 does for period two:       types for



                                                   16
which VI >0 impose controls in period one, while types for which V1<0 do not. While the

relative generality of our model does not allow us to characterize the solution for period one

as simply as for period two, 1Xwe can nonetheless characterize government               behavior in

several important respects and study its implications         for capital flows.    Proposition    1

summarizes an important property:         the adoption of free capital mobility in period one

provides a favorable signal, by reducing the posterior probability of controls in period two:


Proposition     1. In equilibrium,   yF(KO,K1*(p,KO,c,= F))<y~KO, Kl*(p, KO,c, =R)), for all KO>O

and p> O: the probability      of controls in period two is higher conditional        on capital controls

than on free capital mobility in period one.


      The intuition behind Proposition        1 (whose proof is in Appendix) is simple.           Since

capital control policies are positively correlated across periods, the observation of free

mobility in period one provides a favorable signal of future policies (that is, it reduces the

posterior probability    of controls in period two).      The formal argument behind this correlation

is best made by contradiction,       by assuming that policies are negatively (or not at all)

correlated and noting that in this case low x types would be more inclined to impose controls

in period one than high x types.       Indeed, if the probability of period-two controls falls upon

observing controls in period one, then imposing controls in period one would always raise the

end-of-period    capital KI, and the eventual tax base Kz: in bad states of nature (where capital

controls trap capital above its desired level), and in good states (where the assumed favorable

signal provided by capital controls increases the desired stock itselfl.           In this case, however,

lower x types would be more inclined to impose controls (just as they do in period two),



                                                     17
since the concavity of their utility function strengthens their taste for a broader tax base.

Hence, observing controls in period one would increase, rather than decrease (as assumed),

the likelihood of controls in period two.

       Based on Proposition      1 and on the solution to investors’ problem, Section 4 further

discusses the first period’s equilibrium       and its implications   for capital flows,


                                    4. Properties of the equilibrium


A. Who imposes controls?          Our model embodies predictions on what type of governments

and circumstances     are likely to lead to capital controls.     These predictions    emerge clearly in

period two, due to the simple solution available in this case:          ceteris paribus, governments

with fewer outside resources, x, or facing greater temptation to impose controls (in terms of a

larger, potentially captive, capital tax base, K[ ), are more likely to impose controls.         Similar

predictions emerge in period one, although the interaction between direct and indirect effects

of x and KO in the signaling equilibrium         blurs the impact of small changes in these two

variables,    Nonetheless,   the effects of x and KO eventually dominate:         free mobility prevails in

period one as x+      ~ or KO~ O, whereas controls prevail as x-            --   or KO~ cu.

       These predictions     seem realistic.   Although the parameter x could capture any of many

factors that affect capital account policies, the interpretation       we emphasize--that   x represents

revenues other than from capital taxation which the government may tap in the future--seems

empirically    appealing.    Both casual evidence (showing more frequent use of capital controls

in developing than in industrial countries--see        Section 1), and evidence from panel studies

(see, for instance, Alesina, Grilli, and Milesi-Ferretti,       1994), indicate that countries are more



                                                       18
likely to impose capital controls when their expected revenues from financial repression are

high relative to expected revenues from other sources (here represented by X).19 Thus, our

model’s implication    that a larger KO should provide stronger temptation to impose controls,

must be read in a relative sense:    developing countries are more likely to use capital controls,

not because their stock of taxable capital is high in absolute terms but because it is high

relative to other revenue sources they can tap.


B. Capital flows.     Several important properties of the model’s equilibrium       should be noted.

First, as long as KO>O, a separating equilibrium prevails, whereby governments            for which

VI ‘WI( ~o ~~)>0 imPose controls at the beginning of Period one and all remaining

governments   allow free capital mobility .20 Figure 2 illustrates the equilibrium       in this case,

by plotting an illustrative curve ~1 (ignore the curve V: and the point x R, for the moment).

      We have been unable to rule out the possibility of a nonmonotonic           behavior of the

curve V] (although we expect the curve to be decreasing in most plausible cases).             In any

case, the essence of Proposition    1 is that, even if the ranges of governments     choosing      c1 =R

and c1 =F may not be connected, in equilibrium there will be enough probability             mass

attached to c1 =R at low values of x to make capital controls in period one an unfavorable

signal of x, and hence of future policies.    With this caveat, henceforth we shall refer to low x

types as being more likely to impose controls in period one.

      Next, observe that the profit-maximizing       capital stock K[*(p, K., F) in the high state

pl =p conditional on free capital mobility lies strictly above its restricted-mobility    counterpart, K]*(p, K., R)

(the stocks are clearly both equal to zero in the low state p, =0 ). This property clearly

reflects the separating nature of the equilibrium:      the observation of free capital mobility in


                                                   19
period one triggers a discrete upward revision in investors’ beliefs over government       types,

relative to their prior beliefs, and therefore an ex ante increase in expected returns to K1.

Symmetrically    when capital controls are imposed in period one. The persistence of policies

necessary for this result reflects the fact that low-x governments    are more likely than high-x

governments     to impose controls in both periods.

       The wedge K,*(p, KO,F) - Kl”(p, KO,R) affects the response of capital flows to policies.

Since Kl*(p, KO,F)> Kl*(p, KO,R) and KI’(O, KO,F)= KI*(O,KO,R)=O, for all KO, then

E1[K1*(P1,KO,F)]= nK1*(p, Ko, F)> nK1*(p, Ko, R)= E1[K1*(pl,Ko, R)], for all KO. Hence, there

is always a nontrivial range of initial states KO, for which a policy of free capital mobility

causes an expected inflow (i.e., El ~K1*(p,, KO,F)]>KO), even though capital controls would

lead to a desired outflow averaged across states (KO>E1[K]*(p,, KO,R) ]). Intuitively,

governments     with few outside resources impose controls as their decision is dominated by

welfare under the worst scenario (p=O, in our simple setup), while high x governments          are

influenced more evenly by the whole distribution      of pt. Low x governments     impose controls

because of the large costs associated with possible outflows, notwithstanding      the potential

benefits of free capital mobility.

      The model also predicts the circumstances       in which the choice of an open capital

account will more likely cause a capital inflow.      The likely outcome depends on the strength

of the signal provided by that policy.    The improvement     in investors’ beliefs over types, upon

observation of c1 =F, is sharper (and hence an inflow is more likely), the lower was the prior

likelihood of an open capital account and the greater is the extent of policy persistence across

periods.   Clearly, for investors to attribute value to these news, they must attach sufficient



                                                 20
importance to future policies:       as (4) and (6) indicate, as the discount factor p becomes small,

the signaling effect of policies vanishes, investment converges to its one-shot outcome, and a

removal of binding controls on outflows always causes an outflow.


C. The role of asymmetric        information.    To clarify the role of asymmetric      information   in

our model, consider the case where investors are informed of x at the beginning of period

one. Clearly, there is no scope for signaling in this case:        investors already know whether the

host government      will impose controls or not in period two at each K,.         Desired period-one

capital would then be independent        of the regime (i.e., K1*(I-I1,
                                                                     KO,R)= K1*(vl, KO,F)), and a

removal of binding controls on outflows would always cause an outflow.               Thus, the

possibility of an inflow following the removal of binding controls on outflows rests crucially,

in our model, on the signaling role of policies.

        Asymmetric    information    equilibria also exhibit “mimicking”:   some governments

exploit informational    asymmetries    to pool with higher x types and liberalize capital flows in

period one, a policy they would not have adopted with symmetric information.               To understand

why this is true, consider the highest x (xR, say, see Figure 2) just indifferent between controls

and no controls in the asymmetric        information case (thus, all types higher than XRstrictly

prefer free capital mobility).      With asymmetric information, XRknows that if it imposes

controls, investors will pool its type with types in a range with upper bound XR(and hence

reduce their desired investment),      when forming their best guess of the host government’s

type.   Hence, aside from the benefits from trapping the given stock of capital onshore (which

are identical with and without asymmetric        information),   with asymmetric    information   the type

# also faces a signaling cost when imposing controls in period one. No such cost arises with


                                                    21
symmetric information:      investors already know the host government     to be of type XR. Hence,

if XRis indifferent between controls and no controls under asymmetric information,          XRmust

strictly prefer controls under symmetric information.      Combining   this observation    with the

fact that the symmetric information     case features a simple split between governments

imposing controls in period one and governments         not imposing controls, (see Figure 2, where

v;( KO,x) denotes the gains-from-controls      function in the symmetric information      case), then

the types choosing free mobility with symmetric information form a strict subset of those

choosing free mobility with asymmetric       information .21 Thus, in our model, incomplete

information     about government   attitudes toward capital mobility yields a bias toward liberal

markets.


D. Extensions.      The model of the previous sections is highly stylized, and several extensions

could be considered.     The main problem in pursuing some of these may be the loss of

tractability:   signaling models are notoriously hard to solve, and most of the signaling

literature has resorted to simplifications   such as quadratic loss functions, two-period or two-

type models, etc., in order to obtain tractable solutions.    In other cases, augmenting     the model

to endogenize some parameters may not justify the cost of blurring its message.           This is

likely to be the case, for ins~ance, for more structural models of the motives and costs of

capital controls to the extent that these yield reduced forms similar to those that we have

simply assumed (whereby governments          have an imperfectly known taste for domestic capital,

but suffer a cost from imposing controls).

        In some respects, our model is less restrictive than it may appear at first sight.     The

cost of controls ~, for instance, could be allowed to vary across periods, to differ across


                                                   22
governments,    or to be incurred only when controls are binding (e.g., to rise as a function of

the gap between onshore and offshore returns).        When the cost ~ is viewed as government-

specific, the model’s prediction that governments        with minimal outside resources are more

likely to impose controls on capital outflows must be viewed as a ceteri.s paribus prediction:

governments    less able (or willing) to tap outside revenues are more likely to impose controls

than governments     facing similar costs of imposing controls, but with easier access to outside

revenues.

      A positive cost ~, however, is essential;      otherwise the trade-off faced by governments

in their policy decision disappears.22 Therefore, in situations where controls are seen as

beneficial (for example, to insulate domestic markets from external shocks), other costs of

disrupting capital mobility ought to be introduced in the model, for the government          to face a

meaningful decision problem.

      Another simplifying       assumption   is that the capital stock invested onshore in period one

remains intact until period two. When K, is viewed as physical capital, this assumption            is

equivalent to that of no capital depreciation;23     writing the capital controls’ constraint as

K,~K,_l , is also equivalent to assuming controls to be fully effective.       Neither of these

assumptions    is very realistic.   However, it is easy to extend the model by rewriting the

controls’ constraint as K,>( 1- 5) K,_1, and equations (2) to (4) with ( 1-6 )Kl in place of the

stock K1 inherited from period one. All qualitative results remain unchanged,           as long as 8<1,

that is, as long as capital does not depreciate fully from period to period, and controls are at

least partially effective.   In the degenerate case of S= 1, investors need not be concerned with

capital controls:   their pr ncipal is fully lost (or fully transferable   offshore) in a single period



                                                    23
anyway.    In the more realistic case of 0<5<1, instead, controls would be effective only in the

short run, This is sufficient, however, to make investors afraid that a stock (1 -6) K1 may

remain trapped onshore earning a low return, leading to a signaling equilibrium         of the type

studied above.

        The payoffs to a more general model may be significant but tractability problems

overwhelming,     when extending the analysis to a multi-period      model.   It is clear from Section

3.B that our model has a recursive nature, and that government          and investors would face a

very similar problem in each period of a repeated game of duration T. However, whereas we

could exploit in our solution for period one the semi-closed form solution available for period

two, that strategy would only help for period T-1 in a multi-period        model.   Nevertheless,   the

two-period case has implications       for some results one may anticipate for the multi-period

case.

        First, in our two-period model, while a true “liberalization”     (in the sense of a removal

of capital controls following their endogenous      imposition)   can occur in period two, a period-

one liberalization   would be conditional on inheriting a regime of restricted capital mobility

from period zero.     Clearly, a multi-period   extension could produce richer patterns of

liberalizations   and re-impositions   of controls, particularly when combined with a more general

treatment of technology.      In this respect, allowing for a continuous distribution   for the

technology shocks would needlessly complicate the model, but allowing for serially correlated

shocks would have interesting implications .24 For instance, the stronger the correlation of

the shocks, the more information       on future tax revenues the government     obtains from current

shocks.    A high correlation and a high value of p, would virtually eliminate the need for



                                                    24
controls in response to a positive technology shock:          there is no need to insure against bad

states of nature if such states can be ruled out a priori;        conversely in response to the arrival

of bad news on future productivity.

         We expect policies to respond to the same incentives in a multi-period         model:

governments     with low outside resources, who expect a narrow tax base in the future (because

they expect a series of bad productivity         shocks) would initially try to trap capital onshore by

imposing controls.      Subsequent      arrival of good news on future tax revenues, in the form of a

large, highly correlated technology shock, would make these governments              liberalize capital

flows.

         Finally, a multi-period     model may make the impact of reputational      effects on capital

flows even more dramatic.           As discussed above, there are governments     who would impose

restrictions if their type were known, but allow free capital mobility under asymmetric

information in order to be perceived as more likely to adopt liberal policies in the future.

The intuition from our two-period and other signaling models suggest that this reputational

effects could be long-lived.


                                           5. Concluding    Remarks


         We have presented a model in which governments            can use policies affecting capital

mobility to signal a favorable future fiscal situation.        In our model, governments    with the

most to lose from a capital outflow are more likely to fall prey to the temptation           of trapping

capital onshore;     governments       with less to gain from a capital inflow are more likely to

withstand such temptation          and to allow free capital mobility.   Investors recognize these



                                                       25
incentives and the persistence of policies affecting capital flows:       governments   liberalizing

capital flows today are more likely not to impose controls tomorrow, and vice versa,

Ironically (but intuitively),   govel-nments with less need for a large tax base are more likely to

experience a capital inflow.     These predictions    are consistent with the observed experience of

a number of countries that have liberalized their capital accounts.        Our model suggests to

view those policy shifts as enhancing the credibility of those countries as hosts for foreign

investment.   A desired inflow upon liberalization,       the model suggests, was fully consistent

with a desired outflow conditional     on a repressed capital account.

      While capital controls are motivated in our model by their role in broadening           the

domestic tax base, the model’s insight should extend to related problems.          The main

alternative would be to explore the role of capital controls to defend an exchange rate target.

We expect this motive to lead to similar predictions on the response of investment to capital

controls policies.   Investors fear being trapped onshore earning a low rate of return and would

welcome with an inflow news suggesting lower likelihood of controls in the future.

Governments     with less to lose from a balance of payment crisis would try to signal their

commitment     to free capital mobi Iity by exposing themselves to greater chances of a crisis.        In

so doing, they would differentiate     themselves from those governments       that cannot afford to

take chances, thus validating the signaling content of the liberalization.

2 Giavazzi and Spaventa ( 1990). Williamson         (1991), Mathieson    and Rojas-Suarez     (1993), and

Labin and Larrain (1993), among others, review a number of such episodes.

3 As documented      in Figure 1, (net) capital flows minus (net) loans to the public sector surged

beginning     in 1986-87.   (Although Italy does not classify capital flows by characteristics        of

foreign investors, flows from official agencies and other governments           should be almost

entirely included among foreign loans to the public sector.)

~ Although the hands-off approach following the liberalization          limits data availability,   net

flows to the private sector were noted as growing faster and to a higher level, than those to

the public sector (see New Zealand, Reserve Bank, January           1986 and July 1986 Bulletins and

OECD, 1987). Even flows to the public sector originated wholly at market terms, mainly

through sale of Government        Stocks and Kiwi Bonds.

5 See Banda and Santo (1983), de Melo (1985), and P6rez-Campanero                and Leone (1991) for

reviews of the Uruguay episode.

b Liberalization   of inflows affected mainly FDI in selected sectors;        hence, to avoid

overstating    our case, since the FD1 growth may reflect the lifting of these restrictions,        Figure

1 reports data net of FDI.

7 Alesina, Grilli. a~ld hfilesi-Ferretti   ( 1994) list four main motives for capital controls (i. limit

volatile capital flows; ii. maintain the domestic tax base; iii. retain domestic savings, and

iv. sustain structural reform) and study their determinants       across countries and over time.

They identify in governments’       attempt to collect revenue from financial repression the main
motive for controls.      See also Giovannini     and de Melo ( 1993) and Aizenman and Guidotti

( 1994).

8 Alesina and Tabellini ( 1989). for instance, include the loss of capitalists’      electoral support to

governments       that impose controls among the political costs of capital controls.

9 Allowing for consumers’       risk aversion, for instance, Lucas (1987) and Mendoza (1991)

estimate a loss of utility from inability to smooth consumption          through international

diversification    in the order of .10 percent.    Backus, Keohe, and Kydland (1990) report similar

results.

‘0 See Bartolini and Drazen ( 1996) for a model (with a different information           structure) where

government policies respond to changes in external conditions,

11As suggested by a referee, our model could also be interpreted as a model of international

investment in physical capital. where the multi-period         horizon reflects the gestation lag

necessary for direct investment      to become fully productive.

12The issues that arise when the government          is unable to pre-commit    to a fixed tax rate were

studied by Fischer ( 1980). We simplify the model by assuming commitment                to a fixed tax

rate at time zero.

13Exponential      utility would satisfy all these regularity conditions.

14See for instance, Rogoff ( 1987), where the cost of breaking a no-inflation          commitment    is

modeled as independent of the intlation rate itself, and Barro (1986), where a government’s

cost is zero for zero inflation and prohibitive      for positive inflation,

‘~Little is lost with this assumption,     since governments’     utility is already a function of K, and

x, and could be redefined net of other costs that depend on these variables (e. g., as a function
of the gap between     offshore   and onshore returns).    Explicit role for residents’ welfare could

also be included, by defining government’s          welfare as utility from public consumption     plus

consumers’ utility from domestic output, produced with onshore capital and a fixed stock of

labor.

16We focus on controls on capital o~~~ows. As it will become clear later, in this model there

are no incentives    to restrict inflows.

‘7To see this, note that ~K, ~-’ falls with K, from infinity to zero;         that y“ is increasing in

K,, given KO, and for both c1=R and C1=F (since VZ(K, ,x) rises with K, --see Section 3.A);

and that the term in square brackets is positive and continuous          (including where ( 1) holds

identically with pz= p and K,= K1, and I‘ switches from zero to one).

18In particular. it does not seem possible to rule out, in general, multiple intersections

between the function     ~l(KO,.r) (as tl is goes from +-      for x~–~,      to –p~ for x+ +-)        and

the horizontal axis,

19See also Gordon and Levinsohn ( 989) and Giovannini and de Melo (1993), ,who argue that

financial repression   in developing countries       dominates other forms of taxation that are too

costly to organize and administer.          Value-added or consumption     taxes, for instance, require

sophisticated   methods of assessment. border controls, and other measures that may simply be

beyond the reach of many poor countries.

20When K()=0 ‘ all governments        (other than, trivially, the type x = -~)    allow free mobility, a

pooling equilibrium     prevails in period one, Kl”(pl, KO,F)= Kl”(pl, KO,R), and signaling plays

no role in the ensuing capital flow,         We focus here on the case of KO>O.
21The argument showing that V; is decreasing             in x is similar to that for Proposition   1: with

symmetric       information,   there is no role for signaling, and K,”(pl ,KO,R)= Kl”(pl ,KO,F).

Then, controls can only increase K, and K,;             hence, low x types, who benefit more from a

larger tax base, are more inclined to irepose controls in all periods.

22All governments        would impose controls in period two and, lacking signaling or direct cost

of doing otherwise, also in period one.

23When K, is regarded as a financial claim on returns from physical capital, the same

assumption      is equivalent to that of no default risk.

24In our two-period model this extension would only require to specify the transition

probabilities     for the technology shocks as conditional     on previous states, e.g.,

nP-Pr(p, =p !p,_,=p), nOEPr( p,=p ~p,. ]=0), with 1-nP and 1-n” defined accordingly;                 then,

XP> l/2>n0       yields positively correlated shocks.     All results would remain qualitatively

unchanged.
