     THE EVOLUTION OF UNJUST-DISMISSAL LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED STATES


                                     ABSTRACT
     In the last ......., state cnnts in IIIiU1Y areas of the United states have

ruled in favor of eqlloyeeB alleqin;J they were inptcp::rly disnissed.           Many

eccn::IIIi.sts have c:::a1t:endIBd that any j.xJicial or legislative departure fran the

eqlloyDBlt-at-will doctrine is 1&:JL       iw arxl inefficient because it restricts
eqlloyDBlt flexibility arxl !leedau of a;liuact.       'Ihis paper advarres an

eIItlluti.a1aIy theaIy of unjust-di .....ipsal leqislatial in   ~d1   eqlloyer   gro.lpS

eventually Sll(:pOl't unjust-d1snissa] leqislatial in respalSe to the threat of

1aJ:ge arxl variable damage awards inp:sed by the judicial system.        Legislation

is scu;)ht to clearly define prcp!rty rights arxl to limit eqlloyer liability.

In   ~         to the   CXiWUI   law, the unjust-diSllissal laws that have been

p",poeed. are likely to result in SIIIa1ler awards, reduce uncertainty, resolve

displtes rapidly, arxl reduce legal arxl other transactialS costs.        An

institutialal arxl E!IIpirical analysis Sl!pp"'T'ts the ccnclusial that the pIqXlSal
of unjust-di sni sm l leqislatial is a respCllSe to cx:urt rulin3s that weaken and

cbfusc:ate the eqllcyers' right to disn i ss eqlloyeeB at will.       'Ihis evideooe is

i.ncc:naistent with the cx:nvent:iala1   political--=a~    view of unjust-disnissa1

    P the last 100 years, jth secirity in the Uhit1 States has been
governad by the o    law "ip1oynit-at-will" doctrine.1 unier this
doctrine, an loyer can l'fly di ii an loyee for a go reason, a
bad reason, or r reason at all. The ployer's urinitigatad right to i ni
at-will eaployees, Iever, has been wsaksrd by autc*s state rt
r'1ins in severs]. juri.sdictia in the 19808. In iticzi, legislation to
require sane form of "just "e" to di iii at-will ez,1oyees has been
intrxt in t state legislatures.2 Jirxl in 1987, 1tana passad larxtnark

legislative dartuxea fran the                      doctrine sild be resisted

     As a brk, it is ueeful to xzider the cxzxUtia tner whicth
d,artures friczn the lnt-at-will ctrine will affect nic

rights are cleari.y defined ai tradeable with zero t anaacti ts, then
eiic efficicy is i eident of the original distrib.zticri of prtçerty

distribiticxia].   e       for the partiee invo].ved, b.tt will nct affect the
afloti of resr or the Pareto tiiielity of a irket euuy. This
has inçortant iiçlicatia for the legal xitroversy over aploynnt—at-will.
    In particular, if the rights to jcte (e.g., the restricti az review
proores that govern firii) are clearly defined, tradeable, ar if
tranaacticn a,sts are lneiificant, then a direct aplicatia of the ase
principle i1d izply that ecuic efficixy is inenient of tether the
right to terminate an xployment relatihip at will, is originally assigr
to the ployer or to the ezployee. 1b illustrate this point, ider the
equiva1 of the foildx           exanplee.
     In the firet eiiple, ezployers have the legal right to arbitrarily fire
apoyees at will. Suçe that ployees value protecticzi fx arbitrary
ilii4    &th as arded by grievan proures at $100 per year, az
ployers value the cptiai to fire eloyeee arbitrarily (e.g., to avoid
haviz grievaz prcrea to reviøi di.itai discaxg) at $50 per year.

    A relatel is&* is dther jth terminatia rights can be clearly defines

     13Pxfessor St. Antoine (1985, p. 563) has claiii1 that, '9be nt
significant relcnt in the le field of labor law during the past decade
was the grwin willingness of the rts to nify the traditicrial doctrine
of ploynnt-at-will." In ad1iticii to the three legal eatia to the
loynt—at-will trmne axiderei here, less crIIuI1 causes of action
have been based '                       o negligent infliction of ettiona1
distress (see Shard at al., 1989,      127—147).

blic policy, sxi as serving jury duty, filing a iorkers' cxsiçeration
claim, or reftsing to xmDit perjury (the "p.iblic policy excq,tion"). Serd,
nny state ts have held that an irplicit orntract exists between an
eployer ar his ip1oyees id birt the ployer to statEnts nde in
persc*,nel harooks, any rials or oral prcinises (the "in1i&1 xTtract
exo,tion"). Pbr exaix1e, s jurisdictia will k1d an tp1oyer liable for
danages if he or she fires an apl'ee so is abeent frczn work five tiiis if a
persca,nel harbook states that six a are regoired for a d1 ni 1.
      Thixd, a minority of states have ruled in favor of loyees in unjust-
di i4 1 cases unier the 1l theory that an iip1ied ooc.renant of good faith
ard fair dealing exists bebieen an ployee ard ip1oyer (the "good faith
            14
ep.ion")         In esse, the good faith e),tion requires an loyer to
treat his 1oyees in a fair ard reasonable nner, whicth is the essere of a
just cause firir clause in a union orntract. An exançle of    a preent
ild be a cx*.irt ru1irx agai.nat a fixm that fired a worker for no other reason
bit to avoid paying the worker a thrisths bczis. The good faith exception is
prthably the ist redical departure frcin the trediticnal ai,loyment-at-will
doctrine because it I1ds aployers to a stazdard of behavior that is not
prescribed by piblic policy ard not set forth in an oral or written statant.
     Table 1 reports the year in whicti a jzitcial prent urder eacti of
thes. three legal theories wes first established by either the state prne
cirt or by another 1rt in the state.       There is iderab1e variation in

     14it shctild be noted that the good faith ani fair dealing exception ard
the lipi.icit cxxitract exception are extaicr of the existing law that
atplies to earcia]. tracts to the esployut re1aticrhip.
     For the present analysis, whether a
                                     pr      dent is set by a State Suprx
Cirt or by a ler t is of little ecp. because both erode the
p1omt-at-will doctrine, create urcertainty, ard reallocate prcçerty rights.

given in this paper.
    'the tiiniz of the recxgniticri of exxxptia to elçloymant at will
provides sane leverage to determine causality in this case. The basic prenise
for the analysis is that if the erosiat of the traditictial n law cusei
suort for leislatia, then the erosicm of the cxm-i law sha.ald pree,
rather than -',eei, the proposal of just-di i al leislattcn (see
Graner, 1969). Table 5 presents a variety of estimates of the determinants
of propos 1jislatim usirv different lags aril leads of the vx law
variables to examine causality. The eqiatias use the total nunter of        iicn

variable is a siiipler "y than sarata duimny variables for ead

    The rlts in Table 5 lerd sane ort for the view that the erion of
the ploymant-at-will doctrine causes a state lagislathre to prtpose unjust-

     In many states the .iiwr law a1oymant-at-will doctrine has been ered

taneacti ts ani highly variable awards a* the parties.
    Evide is presented shcwin that ust-diisal legislatia is ztre
likely to be prcçosel in states where the darthre fran the treditional
rploymant—at-will doctrine by *he irts has been t extr. When
pztre1, this legislation is typically designed to limit xployer liability,
expedite dispute settlaints, red legal ts, ar clarify prqerty rights.
There is a sibiity, of xse, that at least initially unjust-diissal
legislation cild irrease urrtairity arxl disputes over prcperty rights.
      As a practical matter, unjust-dii al legislation may be Pareto
superior to the withered etplayt-at-will doctrine. The aital eviderre
that          graipa in sa states actually suçort ani or unjust-
di i 1 legislation to limit liability suggests that sixi "rx-fault-firirg"
legislation is a viable political ar1 &nical alternative to the
rt systen. If state zrts itin.ie to dilute the eçloymant-at-will
doctrine, the analysis presented in this paper ld predict that many states
will follcw )xitana by prcposin ani enactin legislation to limit ertployer
liability, clearly re-define prcçerty rights, aixl redi.e legal sts.
     A natural estion to raise is, why has only a state been susful so
