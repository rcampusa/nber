We evaluate the effects of inequality, fiscal policy, and COVID19 restrictions in a model of
economic slack with potentially rigid capital operating costs. Inequality has large negative effects
on output, while also diminishing the effects of demand-side fiscal stimulus. COVID restrictions
can reduce current-period GDP by more than is directly associated with the restrictions
themselves when rigid capital costs induce firm exit. Higher inequality is associated with larger
restriction multipliers. The effectiveness of fiscal policies depends on inequality and the joint
distribution of capital operating costs and firm revenues. Furthermore, COVID19 restrictions can
cause future inflation, as households tilt their expenditure toward the future.

         “Low-income households have experienced, by far, the sharpest drop in employment, while
         job losses of African-Americans, Hispanics and women have been greater than that of
         other groups. If not contained and reversed, the downturn could further widen gaps in
         economic well-being that the long expansion had made some progress in closing” –Jerome
         Powell, testimony to Senate Banking Committee, June 16th, 2020.

1. Introduction
While painful, the economic restrictions associated with the COVID19 pandemic have served as
a grand natural experiment with the potential to shed light on fundamental relationships in the
economy and to inform us on the design of optimal policies. Specifically, employment and income
losses have been concentrated among low-income households and – as suggested by the Fed
Chairman Powell – the rise in inequality is a clear and concerning development. However, it is
less clear how inequality transmits macroeconomic shocks, including those associated with the
pandemic. Relatedly, what is the economic effect of the fiscal policy response to the COVID19
crisis, and how does inequality mitigate or amplify the effects of fiscal policy? While this is a truly
$2 trillion question, there is little clarity on how the stimulus works in the current conditions.
Indeed, one may think that fiscal policy is more stimulative in recessions 1 but e.g., Brunet (2018)
documents evidence suggesting that fiscal multipliers were smaller during World War II because
the government imposed restrictions on how households could spend their income.
         To shed light on the role of inequality in transmitting macroeconomic shocks, we examine
COVID19-related restrictions and fiscal policy in a model of economic slack in which inequality
and capital costs play a central role. 2 We extend the negligible-marginal-cost (NMC) framework of
Murphy (2017) to examine heterogeneous (rich and poor) households that consume a variety of
goods and services. The central feature of the NMC framework is that additional output does not
require additional factor inputs, which implies that aggregate demand – rather than aggregate supply
– determines aggregate output. Furthermore, inequality and the firm entry margin play a central role
in magnifying macroeconomic shocks, which distinguishes the NMC framework from other recent
models of firm-level slack (e.g., Michaillat and Saez 2015).
         The mechanism through which inequality affects output is a formalization of the relationship
conjectured by Krugman (2016) and Summers (2015) that declines in the labor share pull down

 Theories of economic slack posit that workers and capital experience periods of idleness that represent wasted resources
(e.g., Michaillat and Saez 2015, Murphy 2017). For empirical evidence of the relevance of models of slack, see e.g.
Auerbach et al. (2020a, 2020b), Demyanyk et al. (2019), Egger et al. (2020), and Boehm and Pandali-Nayar (2017).

aggregate demand. Households have non-homothetic preferences over NMC-sector goods/services
(i.e., goods/services that have production characterized by negligible marginal costs) and a numeraire
good such that the rich satiate their demand for goods/services in the NMC sector (and therefore
their per-product demand is invariant to macroeconomic conditions), whereas poor households’
spending on NMC goods/services is limited by their income (which in turn depends on spending by
the rich and on fiscal transfers). Therefore a lower income share for the poor (and hence higher
inequality) is associated with lower spending by poor households and hence lower aggregate income
and output. Inequality has strong effects even though all households can access credit.
        The model provides a lens through which to understand changes in the spending preferences
of rich households, a prominent feature of the pandemic (Chetty et al. 2020). Cuts in rich-household
spending are associated with large Keynesian multiplier effects, with the size of the effect increasing
in the income share of the poor. The larger is the income share of the poor (the lower is inequality),
the more a spending shock circulates back to the poor as additional income (and hence additional
spending). Therefore, the model implies that while inequality has had a direct effect of reducing
output, it has weakened the (nonetheless strong) effects of rich-household spending cuts.
        We model the economic restrictions associated with COVID19 as a temporary decrease in
the share of varieties of goods/services that can be exchanged. The effect of COVID19 restrictions
depends on the steady-state level of transfers to poor households, as well as the extent to which firms
face fixed capital operating costs. If there are no steady-state transfers and capital operating costs are
flexible (such that the price of capital adjusts to prevent firm exit), then the output loss is proportional
to the fraction of varieties that are directly subject to COVID19 restrictions – that is, the restriction
multiplier is unity, and consumption of unrestricted products remains the same. This is because the
direct reduction in household spending on restricted products equals the reduction of household
income from selling those products (and hence no additional adjustments are necessary).
        Positive steady-state transfers to the poor lead to a smaller restriction multiplier. Households
allocate their expenditure across varieties and across time. When fewer varieties are available in
the current period, households reallocate their transfer income (if any) toward the remaining
existing products during the pandemic and toward products available in the future. This higher
per-product spending leads to higher output per product in the current period, which mitigates the
aggregate output effects of the restrictions. The model also predicts that the restrictions cause
future nominal spending to increase beyond what it would have been in the absence of restrictions


                                                     2
(due to the expenditure reallocation across time). If prices are flexible in the future, the restrictions
cause future inflation even in the absence of additional government stimulus. However, inequality
dampens this channel, since transfers multiply into output less when poor households earn less of
each dollar spent. Therefore, the model predicts a rise in future inflation, albeit less than what
would have occurred in the absence of rising inequality.
        Restriction multipliers are much larger when firms’ fixed operating costs are rigid.
Restrictions on a subset of firms’ products pulls down firm revenue, which causes firms for which
fixed operating costs are high relative to steady-state revenues to exit and therefore cease production
of other unrestricted goods and services. For example, restaurants are restricted from serving
customers in the establishment but are able to provide carry-out and delivery services, and airlines
shut down some routes (and/or passenger seats) but maintain others. If restrictions cause some
restaurants’ revenues to decline below their fixed costs, then these restaurants will cease producing
carry-out services. Likewise, airlines with revenues below fixed costs will cease flying entirely. This
firm exit channel leads to large indirect (multiplier) effects of economic restrictions and provides a
strong rationale for policies aimed at mitigating fixed operating costs. In the absence of these
multiplier effects or significant re-entry costs, it might be optimal to allow firms to temporarily exit
and then re-enter once restrictions are lifted. But the large multipliers imply that such exit can be
very costly.
        We examine the effect of fiscal transfers in this environment. Government transfers to low-
income households have multiplier effects, which can offset the adverse secondary (multiplier)
effects of the COVID19 restrictions. However, the transfers can have smaller multiplier effects
during the presence of COVID19 restrictions, since there are fewer products on which to spend.
Transfers also increase low-income households’ total spending capacity, which leads to a larger
nominal spending (inflation) boom after restrictions are lifted.
        All fiscal policy is not equal, however. In our framework the government has various fiscal
levers that it can pull: direct transfers to households, direct transfers to firms, as well as various
targeted transfers. The preferred policy depends on inequality, the joint distribution of firm
revenues and fixed operating costs, and the extent to which the government can target households
and firms.
        Targeted transfers to low-income households can increase spending on unrestricted items,
thus supporting income during the restrictions. However, the transfers have stronger effects on


                                                   3
expenditure in the future. Furthermore, the output effect of transfers is falling in inequality, as
spending multipliers are increasing in the income share of the poor. One of the prominent features
of the COVID recession has been an increase in inequality. Our model predicts that transfers can
help offset the adverse effects of rising inequality. But the transfers are also less effective as
stimulus the higher is inequality, as less of the initial spending induced by the transfers circulates
back as income for the poor (and hence leads to less additional spending).
        The strongest effect of fiscal stimulus is through targeted transfers to multiproduct firms for
which the restrictions push their revenues below their fixed operating costs. Such targeted transfers
prevent firm exits that lead to large secondary (multiplier) output declines. In practice it may be
difficult to identify and target such firms, although the model offers some guidance. The firms most
at risk of exit are those with relatively low profitability and for which fixed operating costs are the
largest or most rigid. As documented by Gilje et al. (2020), rigid capital contracts can arise from
asymmetric information regarding firms’ ability to cover capital costs. In our context, the asymmetric
information friction is perhaps the most severe for smaller businesses that are not subject to the same
reporting requirements as public firms. Direct loans and transfers to small private businesses may
therefore target the firms on the margin of exit and have large benefits per dollar spent.
        While targeted transfers to firms have the largest potential benefit, untargeted transfers to
firms have among the least benefit. Not only is some income spent on firms that are not in danger
of exit, but a large share of the income received by the firms accrues to high-income households
for whom spending is less sensitive to transfers.
        This paper is broadly related to emerging work evaluating the indirect economic effects of
COVID19, with different papers focusing on different transmission channels. For example, Baqaee
and Farhi (2020) focus on the production network, Fornaro and Wolf (2020) focus on productivity
growth, and Caballero and Simsek (2020) examine the role of asset prices. Using a large calibrated
HANK model, Auclert and Rognlie (2020) find that, for standard business cycles, inequality has
relatively mild effects on output, while we find that the effect of inequality can be quite large in the
NMC setting. 3 Most closely related is Guerrieri et al. (2020), who model COVID19 as a restriction
on labor supplied to a subset of firms. They argue that COVID19 restrictions can cause a further
fall in output in the presence of strong complementarities between restricted goods and other goods


3
 While Auclert and Rognlie (2020) focus primarily on the role of income risk in a New Keynesian framework, we
abstract from income risk and focus on permanent earnings differences between rich and poor households.

(elasticity of substitution across products, EOS), a large intertemporal elasticity of substitution
(IES), and large shares of credit-constrained households–parameters for which there is strong
disagreement in the literature. If these conditions are sufficiently strong, the economy can exhibit
a multiplier whereby output falls by more than the size of the direct supply restrictions. Our
approach to modeling the COVID19 restrictions is similar in that a subset of firms cannot sell
output to consumers but the transmission mechanisms in our model are quite different (e.g., our
model does not rely on credit constraints, high IES, or low EOS). 4 A distinguishing feature of our
analysis is that we examine these restrictions in a model environment in which inequality, fixed
operating costs, and multiproduct firms play a central role. We find that output effects of the
restrictions are potentially large even if credit is unrestricted. We furthermore show that large
output effects are limited to the direct effects of restrictions on a subset of goods and services
unless firms face fixed capital operating costs. Finally, we evaluate the benefits of alternative fiscal
stimulus measures, including (targeted and untargeted) transfers to households and firms. The
relative effectiveness of alternative fiscal stimulus measures depends on a number of conditions,
including inequality and the joint distribution of firms’ revenues and capital costs. In this sense
our framework can guide empirical work examining the relative merits of alternative stimulus
measures. More generally, our model sheds light on the potentially large adverse effects of
inequality on GDP.


2. Baseline Model
To study fiscal policy, we develop the heterogeneous-household version of the negligible-
marginal-cost (NMC) model in Murphy (2017). This version of the model features rich and poor
households, denoted by ℎ ∈ {ℝ, ℙ}, each of which receives different shares of income from the
NMC sector and consumes services from the NMC sector. The model also features an endowment
that is owned and consumed by the rich. The endowment represents land or other factors of
production that are used to produce goods consumed primarily by the rich (e.g., beach homes and
other luxury items). The endowment pins down the interest rate and the consumption path of the



4
  The firm exit margin is the driving force behind large effects of COVID restrictions in our model. In Guerrieri et al.
(2020), firm exit amplifies the effects of restrictions operating through credit constraints, a low EOS, and a high EIS.
In other words, in their model the consumer spending channel is necessary for the firm exit margin to matter, whereas
in our model the firm exit margin is driven by multiproduct firms and does not rely on consumer spending multipliers.

rich household. Agents trade bonds to satisfy their desired time paths of consumption, subject to a
no-Ponzi constraint that the present value of their asset position must be weakly greater than zero.
        We assume that time can be split into two periods: 𝑡𝑡 = 0 which captures the crisis and 𝑡𝑡 =
1 which correspond to the post-crisis time. We evaluate policy responses to a one-time restriction
in spending at date 𝑡𝑡 = 0. Without loss of generality, we subsume all future periods into a single
date 𝑡𝑡 = 1.


Households. There is a unit mass of homogenous varieties in the NMC sector. Households
inelastically supply labor to the NMC sector, and there are zero marginal costs of labor associated
with increasing output. 5 In this sense there is firm-level slack. In the initial period, a share 1 − 𝜉𝜉
of the varieties is restricted from being sold. We interpreted a reduction in 𝜉𝜉 as either direct
restrictions imposed by the government or choices by households to avoid certain services due to
health concerns. 6

potentially 𝜓𝜓𝑡𝑡 < 1). 7 For simplicity we assume that reductions in 𝜉𝜉 are associated with equal
restrictions for poor and rich households, although there is some evidence that rich households
may have been more likely to avoid spending due to health concerns (Chetty et al. 2020). 8 Π𝑡𝑡ℎ is
agent ℎ’s income from the NMC sector of the economy, 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡ℎ and 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡ℎ are ℎ’s endowment and
consumption of the numeraire, where 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡ℙ = 0. 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡ℎ is net transfers from the government. 𝑄𝑄 is the
price of a bond 𝐵𝐵 that pays a unit of the numeraire in period 1. Since agents can smooth
consumption (and hence the effect of the present value of future net transfers is the same as the
effect of present-period net transfers), we will write the present value of total net transfers as 𝑇𝑇 ℎ ≡
𝑇𝑇0ℎ + 𝑄𝑄𝑇𝑇1ℎ .
          A convenient feature of the quasilinear utility function is that agents consume only the
good from the NMC sector when their income is sufficiently low (depending on 𝜃𝜃 and 𝛾𝛾). 9 This
feature, along with the assumption that poor agents are not endowed with the numeraire, 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡ℙ =
0 ∀ 𝑡𝑡, simplifies the analysis and maintains the focus on demand-determined output in the NMC
sector. We assume parameter values such that only the rich household consumes the numeraire
endowment good. One implication of this assumption is that, similar to the Lucas-tree model,
variation in endowments 𝑒𝑒 pins down 𝑄𝑄 to the discount factor 𝛽𝛽 of the rich, that is 𝑄𝑄 = 𝛽𝛽. This
assumption is a reduced-form attempt to model the economy when interest rates are fixed at some
level (for example, the effective lower bound).


Firms. Output in the NMC sector is produced by firms who hire workers as fixed costs and pay a
fixed capital operating cost 𝑓𝑓𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . Firm 𝑗𝑗 faces demand for product 𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 from household type ℎ

at the levels 𝑝𝑝̅𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗0 that we would observe if firms set their prices on their expectation that 𝜉𝜉 = 1.

   Given the separability of preferences, shutting down access to any 𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 element has symmetric effects on all other
𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 elements and hence there are no changes in the composition of remaining commodities (and hence no direct
demand spillover effects on unaffected producer-commodities).
                                                                                                       ℝ

   As discussed below, spending adjustments by the rich only map into reductions in 𝜃𝜃 ℝ (and hence 𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗0 ).
9
   While the rich households’ marginal propensity to consume (MPC) on NMC goods/services is zero, their MPC that
includes spending on the endowment 𝑒𝑒 is equal to the poor households’ MPC on NMC goods/services (the poor do
not spend anything on endowment good 𝑒𝑒). Hence, the “total” MPC is the same for the poor and the rich.

This price remains fixed in the presence of shocks in period 𝑡𝑡 = 0. We write 𝑝𝑝̅𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗0 with an overbar
to emphasize that these prices are rigid. The degree to which prices in period 𝑡𝑡 = 0 are rigid
determines the extent to which shocks affect real GDP. With rigid prices, real GDP is more
responsive to shocks. Prices in the post-crisis period 𝑡𝑡 = 1 are fully flexible.

and the poor. The profit-maximizing price charged to household type ℎ is

firm-commodity is a function only of exogenous parameters and we therefore treat 𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 as
exogenous for the remainder of the analysis. This invariance of rich-household expenditure to
macroeconomic conditions greatly simplifies the analytic derivation of results. One can interpret

𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 as “autonomous” spending in the economy.

 We assume that cost 𝑓𝑓𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is fixed in nominal terms in period 𝑡𝑡 = 0 but it is free to adjust in period 𝑡𝑡 = 1 so that the

mass of firms cannot be greater than 1.

                                                                     8
same proportion to their share of firm profits and so we roll capital income into profits (i.e., Π
includes profits and 𝑓𝑓𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ). A firm exits for period 𝑡𝑡 if 𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 < 𝑓𝑓𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . We assume that the distribution of
fixed costs is such that the unit mass of firms all produce if 𝜉𝜉 = 1 and that only a share 𝜓𝜓0 (𝜉𝜉) < 1
continue to produce in the initial period if 𝜉𝜉 < 1. If there are additional costs to re-entry once
restrictions are lifted, then 𝜓𝜓1 < 1. In the absence of such costs to re-entry, 𝜓𝜓1 = 1.
          The poor household receives a share 𝜅𝜅 of the revenues from the NMC sector in each period,
while the rich household receives the remaining 1 − 𝜅𝜅 share. The poor household also owns a
share 𝜅𝜅 of the capital stock (and therefore earns a share 𝜅𝜅 of the payments from firms for fixed
capital operating costs). It can be shown that there exists a threshold value 𝜅𝜅̅ such that ∀ 0 < 𝜅𝜅 <
𝜅𝜅̅ , the poor consume output only from the NMC sector. 𝜅𝜅̅ depends on model parameters and fiscal
policy. We assume parameter values such that 𝜅𝜅 < 𝜅𝜅̅ .
          Output (real GDP) 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 is defined as the product of quantities consumed per product and total
mass of available products:

Equilibrium. Equilibrium consists of prices and quantities such that households maximize utility
(1) subject to budget constraints (2) and (3), firms’ prices are given by equation (5), and 𝜓𝜓𝑡𝑡 is
determined by the number of firms for which revenues exceed fixed capital operating costs
(specified below). 11


The interesting aspects of the equilibrium are based on the expenditure of poor households (since
the rich household’s expenditure is effectively exogenous). Total expenditure by household ℎ in
period 𝑡𝑡 is the sum of expenditure on the varieties. Given the assumptions about 𝜉𝜉𝑡𝑡 , we can write

   Note that in general, the market for the endowment good clears even with taxes and transfers and no change in its
price. For example, when the government taxes the endowment of the rich, the taxed portion eventually ends back in the
hands of the rich as poor households spend the transfer on the NMC sector. If a poor household is given a dollar in
transfers, it will spend the dollar on NMC goods/services. 1 − 𝜅𝜅 share of the dollar will become income of the rich (who
will spend it on the endowment good) while 𝜅𝜅 share will become income of the poor. This “second-round” income of the
poor will be spent on the NMC goods/services again so that (1 − 𝜅𝜅)𝜅𝜅 will become income of the rich and 𝜅𝜅 2 will become
income of the poor. These rounds of spending will continue and, in the end, the rich will get their $1dollar in taxes back
in income (1 − 𝜅𝜅) + (1 − 𝜅𝜅)𝜅𝜅 + (1 − 𝜅𝜅)𝜅𝜅 2 + ⋯ = 1 which they spend on the endowment good.

Let 𝐶𝐶 ℙ be the present value of the poor household’s total lifetime expenditure. Then substituting
(9) into (2) and (3) and simplifying implies that the present value of the poor household’s total
lifetime expenditure is
                                                                   ℙ               ℙ

                ℎ
To be clear, 𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 represents the equilibrium level of spending, which is the same for any 𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
produced in equilibrium. To save notation, from now on, 𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 denotes spending on any variety. The
poor household’s lifetime income 𝐼𝐼 ℙ is

which reflects the fact that the poor household earns a share 𝜅𝜅 of total expenditure. Since
households own capital in the same proportion to their share of firm profits and households (as
firm owners) are both liable for firms’ capital operating costs and receive income from payments
to capital, capital costs and income are netted out of household income.

NK vs. NMC frameworks.
To draw contrast between the NMC framework and the mainstream New Keynesian (NK) approach,
note that a simple way of capturing the mechanics of a New Keynesian model is to assume
                                             𝑌𝑌0𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 = 𝐶𝐶0 ,        𝑌𝑌1𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 = 𝑌𝑌�,                   (13)
where the superscript indicates the New Keynesian representation of the model. Here, future output
𝑌𝑌1 is determined by the endowment 𝑌𝑌�, reflecting the supply-side dominance of New Keynesian
models at horizons after which price rigidities have dissipated. To solve the model, one must
simply determine 𝐶𝐶0 , which in general will be based on consumption smoothing and an
intertemporal budget constraint. A simple version of consumption smoothing can be written as
                                                        𝐶𝐶0 = 𝐶𝐶1 ,                                  (14)
and the budget constraint can be written (assuming 𝛽𝛽 = 1) as
                                              𝐶𝐶0 + 𝐶𝐶1 = 𝑌𝑌0𝑁𝑁𝐾𝐾 + 𝑌𝑌1𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 ,                        (15)
Substituting the equilibrium conditions from (13) and solving for 𝐶𝐶0 yields

                                                               10
                                             𝐶𝐶0 = 𝑌𝑌� ⇒ 𝑌𝑌0 = 𝑌𝑌�,                              (16)
Therefore, in the presence of consumption smoothing (the absence of credit constraints), output in
the demand-determined period depends on the future supply side of the economy. In short, in the
absence of credit constraints, the supply side dominates. As a result, credit constraints (and
associated high MPCs) and the strength of intertemporal substitution are key considerations for
policymakers in thinking about the macroeconomic effect of the restrictions (e.g., Guerrieri et al.
2020). If policymakers are persuaded by recent evidence that many low-income households are
not credit-constrained but rather have low MPCs (see, e.g., Miranda-Pinto et al. (2020a) for a
survey), or if they are persuaded by evidence that the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is well
below unity (e.g., Cashin and Unayama 2016; Schmidt and Toda 2019), then they may conclude
that output effects of the restrictions are not a reason for policy intervention.
        Now consider a situation in which future output is demand-determined. 12 In this case, the
equilibrium conditions can be written as
                                                   1
                                              𝐶𝐶0 = (𝑌𝑌0 + 𝑌𝑌1 ),                                (17)
                                                   2
where 𝑌𝑌0 = 𝐶𝐶0 and 𝑌𝑌1 = 𝐶𝐶0 (by consumption smoothing). Here, any level of desired consumption
is a potential equilibrium. This is similar to the indeterminacy of equilibria in some NK models
featuring liquidity traps (e.g., Benhabib et al. 2002). Our NMC model avoids this indeterminacy
problem because a share of consumption (in particular, that of rich households on the NMC sector)
is determined by exogenous parameters and is independent of income.


3. Demand Shocks and Fiscal Policy in the NMC model
To study properties of the model described in the previous section, we linearize the model around
the steady state with no shocks (i.e., 𝜉𝜉 = 1, 𝜓𝜓0 = 𝜓𝜓1 = 1) and no transfers to the poor (i.e., 𝑇𝑇 ℙ =
0). For some exercises, it will be instructive to consider cases where 𝑇𝑇 ℙ > 0 in the steady state.
As a first step, we explore how structural parameters such as the share of income going to the poor
(which also controls the level of inequality in the economy), spending by the rich (“autonomous”
spending), and transfers to the poor affect key endogenous variables in the model. Then we



12
  In the NMC model, households smooth over changes in expenditure (to a first-order approximation) and future
nominal expenditure is demand-determined (since in equilibrium future output is pinned down by demand
parameters).

                                                       11
introduce the COVID19 shock to the model and investigate how this shock propagates in the
economy. Finally, we study how various fiscal policies can counter the COVID19 shock.
         The effect of different transfers depends on how they are financed. It is clear that taxing
low-income households (which decreases 𝑇𝑇 ℙ) will reduce GDP (all else equal). An alternative
source of funding is to exclusively tax the rich. As long as the rich maintain enough post-tax
consumption of the numeraire, there will be no effect of this taxation on GDP in the NMC sector
for either period. There is also the possibility that the transfers could be money financed through
the central bank (e.g., Galí 2019) if, for example, one interprets the numeraire as money (which
the government can print) or more generally if the government has a technology to create the
numeraire. Interpreting the numeraire as money is consistent with models of monetary non-
neutrality driven by money in the utility function. In our model money-financed transfers would
have the same effect as taxing the rich. For the remainder of the analysis we assume that transfers
are financed either through taxing the rich or through printing money, and we will examine the
relative effectiveness of different types of spending. 13


3.1. Inequality, rich-household spending, and government transfers.
Inspection of equation (12) implies that poor-household expenditure (and hence aggregate
expenditure) is falling in inequality and increasing in spending by rich households and in transfer
income. In general, any factor that increases the income of the poor generates an increase in spending
and aggregate output, as output is limited only by poor households’ spending (which is limited by
their income):


Proposition 1: GDP and poor-household expenditure are increasing in the income share of the poor
(falling in inequality), spending by the rich, and transfers. The effects of rich-household spending
and transfers are increasing in the income share of the poor. In particular, in the absence of steady-
state transfers 𝑇𝑇 ℙ:




13
   It might seem that an alternative policy is for the government to lend to poor households. However, since the
households in this environment are already able to smooth their consumption, the lending has no effect. Therefore,
one can think of our model as an environment in which monetary policy has extended credit to households to an extent
that is sufficient for them to smooth consumption. The benefits of fiscal transfers are evaluated above and beyond the
credit-enhancing benefits of monetary policy.

Proof: Appendix.


As the income share of the poor 𝜅𝜅 increases (inequality falls), poor households spend more in both
periods. Due to rigid initial-period prices, this additional spending translates into higher initial-
period consumption by the poor (and hence higher real GDP). The effect of inequality is
                                                                       ℙ

        Rich-household spending and transfers from the government also increase income for the
poor, which in turn induces higher spending by the poor and higher GDP. These relationships are
consistent with recent evidence from Chetty et al. (2020). They document that fiscal transfers
associated with the CARES Act increased spending for low-income households. Furthermore,
spending cuts during the pandemic were largest among low-income households working in areas
that were most exposed to the decline in rich-household spending.
        The effect of transfers on GDP is higher the larger is the income share of the poor (the
lower is inequality). The relationship between the fiscal transfer multiplier and inequality reflects
the fact that the general-equilibrium effects implied by the model are much larger than would be
implied by examining the partial equilibrium response of poor-household spending alone, since in
general equilibrium the initial spending causes additional poor-household income, which generates
additional spending, and so on. For example, the partial-equilibrium effect of transfers on poor-
                          𝜕𝜕𝐼𝐼 ℙ
household income is                = 1. But the general-equilibrium effect – accounting for the effect of

poor-household spending on their own income – is 𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇ℙ = 1 + 𝜅𝜅 𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇ℙ , which is rising in the income

share of the poor. We discuss this relationship in more detail below when we compare alternative
fiscal policies.

                                                                     13
3.2. COVID19 shock
The social distancing restrictions associated with COVID19 can be modeled as a decrease in 𝜉𝜉
from an initial value of 1, reflecting the restrictions on the exchange of services such as restaurant
meals, movie theaters, and sporting events. The size of the restriction multiplier – the net effect of
restrictions (𝑑𝑑𝑌𝑌0 /𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑) relative to the direct effect (𝜕𝜕𝑌𝑌0 /𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕) – depends on the extent to which
restrictions cause firms to exit. In the absence of firm exit (e.g., due to flexible capital costs), the
restriction multiplier is bounded by unity.


Proposition 2: In the absence of a firm exit margin, the decline in output is bounded by the share
of products that are restricted (the restriction multiplier is unity). Firm exit causes a larger fall in
output – a restriction multiplier greater than unity:

Proof: Appendix.


        In the absence of transfers, restrictions decrease poor-household aggregate spending to a
degree that perfectly balances the decrease in poor-household aggregate income. Given product
symmetry, there is no adjustment within product categories. 14 This also implies that in the absence
of a firm-entry margin, there are no multiplier effects from product-level restrictions. In other words,
                                                                                                              𝜕𝜕𝑌𝑌0

Chetty et al. (2020) document higher rates of small business closure in places in which spending

effect of firm exit on consumer income and spending.
        The multiplier effects of COVID restrictions are smaller in the presence of positive steady-
state transfers. This is because, in the presence of positive transfers, the poor household responds


14
   There would be within-product adjustments if 𝜉𝜉 varied by household. For example, Chetty et al. (2020) document
that rich households were more likely to avoid purchasing goods/services with a high risk of infection. In our model,
                                                                                     ℝ

to the restrictions by spreading its transfer wealth over the fewer available initial-period products
and the products available in the future. This per-product spending increase is associated with
higher output per product in the initial period (when prices are fixed) and higher prices in the future
period (when prices are flexible). We formalize this point in the following proposition.


Proposition 3: (Economic Restrictions and Future Inflation). In the presence of positive steady-
state transfers, spending restrictions cause future inflation, as households reallocate spending
across the remaining set of goods/services available in the current and future periods:

Proof: Appendix.


       Intuitively, with positive transfers, the poor households’ reduction in income is
proportionally smaller than the reduction in the number of commodities they buy, so it increases
their demand for all remaining commodities. When households must forgo spending on a subset
of products, they reallocate their wealth (transfers) across the remaining available products in the
initial period and in the future. The increase in per-product expenditure causes higher per-product
output in the current period (when prices are rigid) and higher prices in the future (when prices are
fully flexible). If we were to expand the model to include an intermediate period 𝑡𝑡 = {0 → 1} in
which prices are only partially flexible, then the initial-period restrictions would be followed by a
boom in output, as households would consume more per product and (if 𝑑𝑑𝜓𝜓{0→1} = 0) would have
the full set of products available to purchase. This prediction of the model is consistent with the
behavior of the U.S. economy following World War II. Inflation surged to nearly 20 percent within
a year-and-a-half of the end of the war, consistent with households transferring spending power
from during the war (when spending was restricted) to after the war.
       Note that equation (20) implies that restrictions increase per-product spending (initial-
period output and future-period prices) by more the greater the income share of the poor 𝜅𝜅 (lower
inequality), holding fixed the number of firms in the economy. This is because the poor household
recycles its purchasing power more the higher is its income share. COVID restrictions increase
per-product spending on nonrestricted products (e.g., streaming video services, computer games),
and this increased spending is multiplied more the larger is the income share of the poor. Therefore,

                                                      15
economic restrictions reduce aggregate output by less (more) in the presence of higher (lower)
poor-household income shares, which correspond to lower (higher) inequality. Even accounting
for the endogenous response of firm entry, the output response to COVID restrictions can be shown
to be increasing in inequality.


Proposition 4: In the presence of steady-state transfers, inequality is associated with stronger
output effects of COVID restrictions.

3.3. The Response of Firm Exit.

The discussion above makes clear that COVID restrictions have large multipliers (>1) in our model
only if firms exit. To study this margin, we must specify 𝑓𝑓𝑗𝑗 , the cost of operating firm 𝑗𝑗. Let the
PDF of the distribution of 𝑓𝑓 be 𝑣𝑣 and the CDF be 𝑉𝑉. Then

                                                     𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗0
                                          𝜓𝜓0 = �            𝑣𝑣(𝑓𝑓)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 𝑉𝑉�𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗0 �
                                                     0

and

                                               𝑑𝑑𝜓𝜓0 = 𝑣𝑣�𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗0 �𝑑𝑑𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗0 ,
                    ℙ         ℝ                   ℙ
where 𝑑𝑑𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗0 = �𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗0 + 𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗0 �𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + 𝜉𝜉𝜉𝜉𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗0 . The COVID shock thus affects the number of firms
directly: COVID restrictions (𝜉𝜉 < 1) reduce the number of products that firms can sell and thus
push some firms into the red forcing them to exit. There is also an indirect channel: the COVID
shock increases the spending of the poor household on remaining products, which helps to mitigate
firm exit. In the absence of steady-state transfers to poor households (𝑇𝑇 ℙ = 0), the indirect channel
is not operational and firm exit is entirely determined by the distribution of firms’ fixed costs:




                                                                16
                                 𝑑𝑑𝜓𝜓0                        ℙ         ℝ
                                       �      = 𝑣𝑣�𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗0 ��𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗0 + 𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗0 �.           (21)
                                  𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑇𝑇 ℙ=0
As discussed in Section 3.2 (below Proposition 2), in the absence of transfers, restrictions decrease
poor-household aggregate spending to a degree that perfectly balances the decrease in poor-
household aggregate income. Given product symmetry, there is no adjustment within product
categories.
       If transfers 𝑇𝑇 ℙ are positive in the steady state, the increase in per-product household
spending induced by the restrictions can help mitigate firm exit in response to COVID restrictions.
The poor household spreads their transfer wealth over the fewer remaining products, which helps
to support firm revenues and mitigate firm exit.
       If we interpret fixed operating costs as the rental cost of the existing capital stock, then 𝑓𝑓𝑗𝑗0
is the price of capital and firm exit is associated with a reduction in demand for the existing capital
stock. If prices 𝑓𝑓𝑗𝑗0 are rigid, there will be excess supply of capital. However, if prices 𝑓𝑓𝑗𝑗0 are
flexible, then then they will adjust downward to mitigate the effect of falling revenues on firm
profits. Given the inelastic supply of capital and the symmetry of firms, the capital market clears
once the mass of operating firms is at its steady-state level (𝜓𝜓 = 1). We collect these results in the
following proposition.


Proposition 5: If fixed operating costs are rigid, COVID restrictions induce firm exit. If fixed
operating costs are flexible, there is no exit (and hence the restriction multiplier is bounded above
by unity).
Proof: Appendix.


       Clearly, if costs of operation can be adjusted in response to the COVID shock (e.g., set
𝑣𝑣�𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗0 � = 0), firm exit can be avoided entirely and thus the adverse effects of the COVID shock
minimized. However, there are plenty of reasons to expect that capital costs may not be flexible,
at least in the short run. Asymmetric information between capital owners and the firms that rent
the capital is among the reasons for rigid capital prices. If capital is imperfectly substitutable such
that owners have pricing power, then capital owners may be reluctant to adjust if they cannot
identify which firms can pay and which cannot. Indeed, recent empirical evidence documents a



                                                      17
strong role for asymmetric information in preventing renegotiations between capital owners and
firms even when such renegotiations would otherwise benefit both (Gilje et al., 2020).
        The experience of the pandemic to date is consistent with rigid costs. The number of small
business owners plummeted at the fastest rate on record between February and April 2020 (Farlie
2020). The adverse experiences of small businesses has led to a sharp fall in household wages and
income, especially for households with low income (Canjer et al., 2020). Household evictions have
also accelerated according to data from the Eviction Lab, indicative of rigid housing rental prices. 15
        Note that the disproportionate fall in income for poor households documented by Canjer et
al. (2020) is consistent with the model. Rich households receive income from their ownership of
the numeraire and from the NMC sector, whereas poor households receive income only from the
NMC sector. Therefore, adverse shocks to the NMC sector disproportionately reduce the income
of poor households. 16
        Inequality and Firm Exit. The effect of restrictions on firm exit is stronger the higher is the
income share of the poor, unless the distribution of fixed costs is strongly decreasing at 𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗0 – that

        Higher income of the poor is associated with higher spending on each product and hence a
greater revenue loss for each product that is restricted. If the higher spending does not sufficiently
reduce the number of firms on the margin of exit, then in the face of high poor-household-income-
shares, restrictions pull down revenues more and induce more firm exit. Therefore, higher
inequality can mitigate the adverse effect of restrictions on firm exit.


3.4. Fiscal Policy
Government transfers to households and/or firms can mitigate the adverse effects of the
restrictions.



15
   We do not explicitly model housing. However, one could interpret “firms” in the model as workers who produce a
range of goods/services. Firm exit would then be similar to exiting the workforce (e.g., due to homelessness).
16
   The endowment good that is owned and consumed exclusively by the rich could be interpreted as high-end property.
Anecdotally, rich households have continued (or increased) their consumption of vacation properties during the
pandemic even as they have cut back on spending on services.

                                                              18
3.4.1 Transfers to Households.
Consider first transfers to low-income households. One can show that the effect on real GDP is

Transfers to low-income households of sufficient size can in principle fully offset secondary
economic effects of the COVID-related restrictions. Transfers stimulate output through two
channels. First, they increase spending on existing firms. Second, they induce firm entry, and this
entry causes additional private-sector spending on the products of the entering firms. This firm
entry margin is consistent with recent empirical evidence of the effects of fiscal stimulus
(Auerbach et al., 2020b) and more generally with the effect of aggregate demand shocks (Campbell
and Lapham, 2002).
        Inspection of equation (18) implies that the effects of demand shocks on poor-household
spending and consumption are falling in inequality. This, along with equation (22), implies that
the effect of transfers on GDP is falling in inequality: the smaller is the income share of low-
income households, the less spending circulates back as income to low-income households (and
hence the less they can spend).


Proposition 6 (Fiscal multipliers and inequality): Transfers induce firm entry, amplifying the
fiscal multiplier. Furthermore, the fiscal transfer multiplier is falling in inequality (rising in the
                                𝑑𝑑2 𝑌𝑌
                                    0
income share of the poor κ): 𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 ℙ𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 > 0.

Proof: See Appendix.


Intuitively, lower inequality increases the multiplier because the larger is the income share of low-
income households, the more spending circulates back as income to low-income households (and
hence the more they can spend). This is a rather surprising result, given that inequality has often
been associated with large shares of credit-constrained households (and hence potentially large
fiscal multipliers, as in Brinca et al. 2016 and Lee 2020). However, recent empirical evidence
documents an inverse relationship between fiscal effects and inequality (Miranda-Pinto et al.
2020b; Yang 2017). Our theory and this evidence implies that household-level transfers are less
effective during the recent episode of rising inequality.

3.4.2 Transfers to Firms.
An alternative to household-level transfers is to provide transfers 𝑇𝑇 𝔽𝔽 to firms. If the government
cannot target the firm transfers but instead must allocate across all firms, then firm-level transfers
are unambiguously less effective than household-level transfers: for a firm-level transfer, low-
income households (which drive spending multipliers) only end up with a share of the transfer 𝜅𝜅.
More formally,
                                                        𝑑𝑑𝑌𝑌0             𝑑𝑑𝑌𝑌0   𝑑𝑑𝑌𝑌0
                                                                     = 𝜅𝜅       <       ,
                                                      𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 𝔽𝔽:𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴      𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 ℙ 𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 ℙ
where 𝑇𝑇 𝔽𝔽:𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 is untargeted transfers across firms. Such transfers stimulate spending and firm entry,
but their effect is diminished because a share 1 − 𝜅𝜅 of the transfer ends up with the rich households,
who do not contribute to spending multipliers.
         While untargeted firm-level transfers are the least effective form of stimulus, targeted firm-
level transfers are potentially the most effective. In particular, transfers that are targeted to firms
on the margin of exit (those for which fixed costs are a large share of their revenues, 𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗0 ≈ 𝑓𝑓𝑗𝑗0 )
prevent firm exit, which as discussed above is the mechanism though with COVID restrictions
cause large multiplier effects. In particular, for each dollar targeted to marginal firms, the
                                                       1
government would create 𝑑𝑑𝜓𝜓0 = 𝑣𝑣(𝑅𝑅                           firms. Equivalently, if the mass of marginal firms is
                                                        𝑗𝑗0 )

                                                                                    0               𝑑𝑑𝜓𝜓            1
𝑣𝑣�𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗0 �, the government must spend that amount to keep them alive. So 𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 𝔽𝔽:𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 = 𝑣𝑣�𝑅𝑅 �. If the
                                                                                                                        𝑗𝑗0

government can target such firms, the extra multiplier from targeted transfers 𝑇𝑇 𝔽𝔽:𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 (relative

For example, if fixed costs 𝑓𝑓 are uniformly distributed on [0, 𝑈𝑈], the marginal targeted tax dollar
creates 𝑌𝑌0 /𝑈𝑈 additional units of GDP compared to the marginal untargeted tax dollar.
         In the absence of large changes in the distribution of fixed costs as revenues change, lower
inequality (higher 𝜅𝜅) is associated with larger relative benefits of targeted transfers. Each firm is



                                                                     20
associated with higher GDP the larger is the income share (and hence spending) of poor
households. Therefore, saving these marginal firms is associated with larger net output gains.
          The relative benefit (in terms of GDP per dollar spent) of targeted transfers to firms versus
transfers to low-income households firms depends on how many firms are kept afloat with each
dollar spent:

In this sense, the benefits of targeted transfers to firms (relative to transfers to the poor) are
proportional to the indirect costs of the COVID19 restrictions (i.e., endogenous firm exit). If there
                                                       𝑑𝑑𝜓𝜓0
are large restriction multipliers �1 +                         � (based on the joint distribution of fixed capital costs and
                                                        𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

firm revenues), then the relative benefits of targeted transfers are large and these benefits could be
even larger if there are costs of reentry. Furthermore, lower inequality (higher 𝜅𝜅) is associated with
larger relative benefits of targeted firm-level transfers because as discussed above 𝑌𝑌0 is increasing in
𝜅𝜅. Poor households also receive a higher initial (direct) share of the firm-level transfer, although this
effect is offset by the fact that the effect of household transfers on output is increasing in 𝜅𝜅.


Proposition 7 (The optimal composition of transfers): Targeted transfers to firms can be the most
cost-effective means of mitigating a restriction multiplier above unity. The relative benefit of
targeted transfers depends on the joint distribution of firm revenues and capital operating costs.
The relative benefit is higher the greater is the income share of the poor (lower inequality) as long
     𝑣𝑣′�𝑅𝑅 �
as � 𝑣𝑣�𝑅𝑅 𝑗𝑗0� � is not too large.

Proof: Appendix.


          In practice it may be difficult to identify and target marginal firms, although the model
offers some guidance. The firms most at risk of exit are those with relatively low profitability and
for which capital operating costs are the largest or most rigid. Because of low profit margins, small
businesses are likely to be particularly prone to exit (consistent with the evidence in Fairlie 2020),
therefore implying an important role of targeted transfers to firms. If the government attempts to

                                                                       21

target firms but can do so only imperfectly, the multiplier will be in the range �𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇𝔽𝔽:𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 , 𝔽𝔽:𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 �, with
                                                                                                 𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇

a larger effect the more of the stimulus goes to marginal firms.
         An alternative policy to firm-level transfers is government loans to firms. But firms still
need to cover their future-period fixed costs. Firms for which the present value of revenues in both
periods falls below the present value of fixed costs will not be helped by loans (specifically, 𝜓𝜓0
and 𝜓𝜓1 can fall below 1 even if the government offers loans). Loans are only effective for the firms
that cannot cover their fixed costs in the initial period but nonetheless earn profits in present value.
Chetty et al. (2020) document a limited impact of loans to small businesses on firm employment
and suggest that liquidity injections are insufficient for restoring employment at small businesses.
Their evidence, interpreted through the lens of our model, is consistent with a decline in the present
value of revenues sufficient to push firms to exit.


4. Conclusion
The COVID crisis has both raised immediate policy questions and highlighted key structural
relationships in the economy. Inequality has risen, rich households have cut back spending on
services, and firms have been pushed to the brink of exit in the face of rigid capital operating costs.
We develop a model capable of addressing the roles of inequality and other key features of the
pandemic economy. Our results have general implications for the macroeconomic effects of
inequality and fiscal policy, while also providing guidance on the relative merits of alternative
fiscal policies in the face of COVID restrictions on economic activity.
         Our framework implies that rising inequality will drag down GDP, as will any additional
reallocation of spending by rich households away from service sectors in which low-income
households work. In the absence of these developments, the strongest macroeconomic threat
associated with COVID19 is firm exit resulting from restrictions on the exchange of services and
rigid capital costs, a pattern clearly observed in the data. Our model suggests that the adverse
effects may be offset by transfers to households and firms. Furthermore, we show that transfers to
firms on the margin of exit are particularly effective in countering economic contraction.
         Our framework indicates a number of metrics that will be useful to monitor as the COVID19
crisis evolves. In the absence of rising inequality or reductions in spending by high-income
households, nominal GDP will rebound to a level at or potentially beyond what it would have been
in the absence of COVID. Rising inequality or reductions in spending by high-income households

                                                           22
can mitigate this boom or cause a prolonged slump. Fiscal stimulus will be especially useful in the
event of a slump, although its effect per dollar spent is decreasing in inequality. The other important
metric is the prices of firms’ operating capital, especially for firms that have large fixed operating
costs relative to revenues and for multiproduct firms. Downward adjustment of capital prices can
mitigate large restriction multipliers.

The following relationships are referenced throughout the proofs. First, in equilibrium the bond
price 𝑄𝑄 equals the discount factor 𝛽𝛽. This follows from the rich household’s first-order-condition
with respect to the bond and the fact that 𝜆𝜆ℝ𝑡𝑡 equals the marginal utility of the numeraire. In
particular, the first-order condition for either household is 𝑄𝑄𝜆𝜆ℎ0 = 𝛽𝛽𝜆𝜆1ℎ . Since 𝜆𝜆ℝ𝑡𝑡 = 1, it follows
that 𝑄𝑄 = 𝛽𝛽. Furthermore, it follows that 𝜆𝜆ℙ0 = 𝜆𝜆ℙ1 .
         Second, in the steady-state (in the absence of shocks) households smooth their

Expenditure smoothing (in steady-state) follows from 𝜆𝜆ℎ0 = 𝜆𝜆ℎ1 .
         Third, the responses to shocks of product-level poor-household consumption at time t=0,
prices at t=1, and poor-household expenditure in either period all move in the same direction.
This is because the response of each can be captured by the response of the budget multiplier:

we can infer the direction of output per product in the initial period and the direction of prices in
the future from the direction of spending in either period (or equivalently, from the response of the
budget multiplier).

Proof of Proposition 5: The effect of restrictions in the presence of rigid capital costs follows from
(21). When capital costs are flexible, the price of capital will adjust to clear the capital market: Let
𝑟𝑟 be the rate at which capital is rented out to firms, and let 𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗 be the fixed capital requirement of
firm 𝑗𝑗 (so that 𝑓𝑓𝑗𝑗 = 𝑟𝑟𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗 ). If the capital market is flexible, then the rate will adjust so that the rental
rate equals the revenues of the marginal firm. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the
                                                                                                                                                             1
rental rate in the absence of COVID restrictions is such that there is a unit mass of firms: ∫0 𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 =
𝐾𝐾. Covid restrictions shifts in the demand for capital (as firms’ revenues fall). Given the inelastic
supply of capital, a flexible capital market implies that 𝑟𝑟 adjusts so that in equilibrium there
remains a unit mass of firms, with the price determined by the firm on the margin of exit. ■

Equivalently, if the mass of marginal firms is 𝑣𝑣�𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 �, the government must spend that amount to
