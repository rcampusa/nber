              International Liquidity and Monetary Control



                                ABSTRACT



      This paper deals with the relations among international liquidity,

 the exchange—rate regime and the effectiveness of monetary policy. The

 first part of the paper contains an empirical study of the demand for

 international reserves. It is shown that (i) reserve holdings are a stable

function of a limited number of economic variables, and (ii) the move to

greater flexibility of exchange—rates has   not   changed drastically the

patterns of reserves holdings. The empirical work deals with developed

and developing countries and it allows for country—specific and time—specific

factors as well as for dynamic adjustments. The second part of the paper

deals with the more general issue of the constraints that the openness

of the economy imposes on the effectiveness and proper conduct of monetary

policy, as well as the dependence of these constraints on the
                                                                  exchange—
rate regime. In this context the roles of various exchange—market inter-

ventions are discussed. The analysis then explores alternative guidelines

for monetary policy where it is argued that the conduct of policy can be

improved by paying attention to the relation between exchange rates and

interest rates. This relation is then used to interpret the recent evolution

of interest rates. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the

role of the International Monetary Fund in the provision of liquidity.

        This paper deals with the relations among international liquidity,

the exchange—rate regime and the effectiveness of monetary policy. A

typical argument for the choice of a flexible exchange rate regime is that

such a regime provides countries with an added degree of freedom in the

pursuit of macroeconomic policies. It is claimed that the added degree of

freedom (or the added policy instrument) stems from the elimination of the

legal commitment to peg the exchange rate and, thereby, it reduces the

need for internatioTial reserves. In practice, however, pne of the striking

features of the international monetary system since the early l970s has been

the continued use of international reserves even though, legally, countries have

been allowed to adopt a flexible exchange—rate regime. In spite of the

change in the legal framework associated with the breakdown of the Brettón

Woods agreement and formalized by the various amendments to the Articles of

Agreements of the International Monetary Fund, countries have continued to

use international reserves and have continued to intervene in the markets

for foreign exchange. As a matter of fact, an observer of the patterns of

countries' holdings and usages of international reserves would be hard

pressed to detect a drastic change in the patterns of holdings of inter-

national reserves corresponding to the drastic changes in the legal commit-

ment concerning exchange—market intervention. The change in economic be-

havior has been much less pronounced than expected on the basis of the theory

concerning the benefits from the additional degree of freedom granted by the

flexible exchange rate regime.

        Section I of this paper reports the results of an empirical study

on the demand for international reserves during the period 1963—79. The

main findings are that (i) countries' holdings of international reserves

can be characterized with reasonable accuracy as a stable function of a

limited number of economic variables, and (ii) the move to greater flexi-

bility of exchange rates has not changed in a fundamental way the general

patterns of reserve holdings. It follows therefore that, in contrast to

earlier predictions, the questions concerning the provision of international

reserves, and the discussions concerning the role of the International

Monetary Fund in this context, are as relevant at the present time as they

were during the Bretton Woods era.

        Section II extends the scope of the discussion to the more general

issue of the constraints that the openness of the economy imposes on the

effectiveness and proper conduct of monetary policy, as well as the depen-

dence of these constraints on the exchange rate regime. Section III dis-

cusses the question of whether the monetary authorities possess the capacity

to sterilize the monetary implications of the balance of payments and the

monetary implications of interventions in the foreign exchange market. This

question is relevant for determining the extent to which monetary control

can be regained in view of the international constraints. In this context

the distinction is drawn    between sterilized and non—sterilized

interventions.

        The discussion in Sections II and LII deals with the influence that

external constraints exert on the effectiveness of monetary control.
                                     3




Section IV turns the question on its head by examining ways by which monetary

policy can influence the external constraint. Issues that are discussed in

this context include the role that monetary policy should play in affecting

exchange rates as well as the role that exchange rates should play in guiding

monetary policy. Here it is argued that monetary policy can use information

provided by the foreign exchange market in order to improve its conduct.

Thus, it is argued, while the openness of the economy imposes severe con-

straints on the effectiveness of monetary controls, it also provides a

potentially useful source of information.

        Section V concludes the paper with a brief discussion of the role

of the IMF as well as some proposals for institutional reform.

                        I. INTERNATIONAL RESERVES



        This section analyzes the determinants and the wtterns of reserve

holdings under alternative exchange—rate regimes. It contains an empirical

analysis of the demand for international reserves in which cross—sectional

estimates of the demand for reserves by developed and less—developed countries

as well as estimates of pooled time series and cross sections are presented.

In this context, the differences in behavior patterns of developed and less—

developed countries are analyzed. The analysis then turns to the empirical

question of timing, of when the system moved from pegged to floating rates.

The interest in this question stems from the belief that the timing of changes

in economic behavior need not correspond to, or be associated with, the

timing of changes in legal commitments. One of the conclusions emerging

from the analysis is that the extent of the change in economic behavior (as

far as the holdings of international reserves is concerned) has not been as

large as might have been expected.



The Determinants of the Demand for International Reserves

        Earlier studies of the demand for reserves considered the variability

of international receipts and payments as an important argument in the demand

function (e.g., Kenen and Yudin, 1965; dower and Lipsey, 1968; Archibald and

Richmond, 1971). In addition, it has been suggested that the demand function

also depends on the propensity to import (e.g., Heller, 1966; Kelly, 1970;

Clark, 1970a; Flanders, 1971; Frenkel, 1974a, 1974b, 1978; Hipple, 1974; lyoha,

1976). These other studies have recently been surveyed by Grubel (1971),

Williamson (1973), Claassen (1974), Cohen (1975) and Cumby (1982), and the

general issue of the role of and needs for international liquidity were dis-

cussed in IMP (1970).
                                          5




           The choice of a variability measure as an argument in the demand

 function stems directly from the role of international reserves in serving

 as a buffer stock accomodating fluctuations in external    transactions.
 Consequently, it has   generally   been expected that the demand for reserves

 is positively associated with the extent of these fluctuations.

           The rationale eor the use of the propensity to import as an argu-

ment is more involved. It stems from an application of the Keynesian

model of the foreign trade multiplier. According to that model, an external

disequilibrium that is induced by a decline in export earnings could be

corrected by a decline in output proportional to the multiplier. The cost

of output adjustment could be saved if the monetary authorities are able to

run down   their   stock of international reserves, thereby enabling them to

finance the external deficit. Since the foreign—trade multiplier (and thus

the required output dampening due to the fall in exports) is inversely related

to the marginal propensity to import, this approach argues that the cost of

not having reserves, and hence the demand for reserves, is inversely related

to the marginal propensIty to import (see references op cit.).    ifl   the absence
of data on the marginal propensity to import, earlier empirical studies have

replaced it by the ratio of imports to income, i.e., by the average propensity

(typically referred to as the degree of 'Topenness" of the economy). The co—

efficient of the average propensity to import frequently appeared with the

"wrongt' (positive) sign when used to estimate the demand for reserves. Thus,

Hipple (1974) and lyoha (1976) argue that the average import propensity should

not be interpreted as a proxy for the cost of output adjustment but rather as

a proxy for "openness," thus measuring the extent to which the economy is

vulnerable to external disruptions. Accordingly, the positive coefficient on
                                            6


the average import propensity reflects the fact that the demand for reserves

is a positive function of external vulnerability.
                 Using an adjustment mechanism which emphasizes the role of relative

prices, price level and demand for money, it was previously shown (Frenkel,

1974a) that under certain assumptions, the demand for reserves was expected

to be associated positively with the average propensity to import. This

association was shown to be consistent with data for the period 1963—1967

for both Developed and Less—Developed Countries (Frenkel, 1974b). A simplified

derivation of the association between reserve holdings and the propensity to

import is presented in Frenkel (1978) where it is shown that the relationship

between these two variables is, in general, not clear cut, although, under

some assumptions this relationship is expected to be positive.

                 In what follows, cross—sectional estimates of the demand for inter-

national reserves are presented. Included,in addition to the above mentioned

variables, is a scaling variable as one of the determinants of the demand.1



Cross—Sectional Estimates of the Demand for International Reserves

                 The empirical analysis includes data from 22 Developed Countries (DC's)

for the period 1963—79 and 32 Less—Developed Countries (LDC's) for the period

1963—77. Appendices I and II contain the list of countries and definitions of

variables used in the analysis. The classification of countries as Developed

and Less—Developed is based on that of the IMP. The choice of countries and

the period of analysiswere determined by the availability of continuous series
             2
of   data.
                      .
                   As indicated above, the demand function was assumed to depend on

three variables:          (i) a measure of variability of international receipts and

payments denoted by            ; the value of c for each year was estimated by
                                     7



computing the standard deviation over the previous 14 years of the trend—

adjusted annual changes of the level of reserves;3 (ii) a scaling variable

measuring the size of international transactions represented by the level

of GNP, Y; in the few cases where this was not available, it was replaced

by Gross Domestic Product,- (GDP), and (iii) the average propensity to im-

port, m = DAlY, where IM denotes imports.

        The functional form of the demand function was assumed to be:


        2nR=a0+cz1                                                      (1)



where u denotes an error term. Finally, and in contrast with most of the

earlier empirical formulations, the demand for reserves is specified in real

terms. Thus, as indicated in Appendix II,       denotes the real value of

international reserves.

        Tables 1 and 2 present for each year the cross—sectional ordinary—

least—squares estimates of the demand for reserves by Developed and Less—

eve1oped Countries. In all cases the coefficients have the expected positive

sign and In most cases these coefficients are statistically significant at the

95 percent confidence level.

         In summary it should be noted that the overall fit of the regressions

reported in Tables 1 and 2 (as measured by the coefficients of determination

R2) is very satisfactory. This point is noteworthy since these, results

pertain to cross—sectional estimates.    Of special interest is the good fit

of the cross—sectional regressions for the last few years reported in Tables

i. and 2. During the latter years of the sample period, the international

monetary system moved towards a greater. flexibility of exchange rates.      This

move was expected to result in different as well as in less stable estimates

of the parameters of the demand for reserves. Since, as will be shown below,

the cross—sectional estimates seem to have remained stable (at least during

the periods 1963—72 and 1973—79), more efficient estimates may be obtained

by pooling the time series with cross sections.



Pooled Time—Series and Cross—Sections:
Pegged - Versus Floating Exchange Rates

        In orderto examine the effect of the move to a regime of flexible

exchange rates, the sample was divided into two periods: the pegged exchange

rate period (1963—72) and the flexible exchange rate period (1973—79). A

formal justification for this division is provided subsequently.

        To the extent that the coefficients of the cross—sectional equations

remained stable within each of the periods 1963—72 and 1973—79, one may obtain

more efficient estimates by pooling the time—series with the cross—sections.

Table 3 contains the ordinary—least—squares estimates of the pooled regression

for both periods. In all cases the coefficients are positive and significant

at the 95 percent confidence level.

        I turn now to a comparison of the regression coefficients between

Developed and Less—Developed countries during the two periods. The first method

used for this comparison was the dummy variables method as outlined by Gujarti

(1970). According to this method, each and every coefficient was allowed to

differ between Developed and Less—Developed Countries by including dummy

variables pertaining to data for Developed Countries. The estimated coeff i—

dents of the dummy variables (not reported here) reveal that for the first

period the coefficients of the constant term and of income are significantly

lower for Developed Countries while the coefficient of the variability measure

is higher. For the latter period, however, the behavior of the two groups with

respect to international reserves is much more similar.

        The dununy variables method focuses on comparisons between individual

coefficients. The second method that was employed in the comparison between

Developed and Less—Developed Countries was that of the Chow—test, and also

this test leads to the conclusion that the difference between the behavior of

Developed and Less—Developed Countries concerning the holdings of international

reserves had diminished significantly during the second period. It is of

interest to explore in greater detail the patterns of the move to the floating

rates regime, as are implied by the characteristics of reserve holdings.



International Reserves and the Change in Regime

          The analysis in the previous sections made a distinction between

the periods 1963—72 and 1973-79. The presumption was that the evolution

of the international monetary system from pegged exchange rates to floating

exchange rates might have resulted in a structural change in the demand for

international reserves. In the present section I examine formally the timing

and extent of the structural change following the method proposed by Quandt

(1958, 1960)


          Consider a situation in which a structural change occurred at year t*

within the period 1,...,T and assume that the demand for reserves corresponding

to the two regimes (before and after t*) can be characterized by two distinct

regression equations like (2) —   (3)

                  =
                      x1 + u1.,          t <     t*                          (2)




                          + U2,          t   >   t*                          (3)
                                          13



where         and u     are the error terms that are assumed to be distributed as

N(O.       and N(O,), Bi and 82
                                     are   the vectors of the regression coefficients

corresponding to the two regimes, and where I =            1,...,NderlLotesthe         countries

 (for the Dveloped Countries N = 22 and for the LDC's N =              32).       The analysis of

the timing of the     structural change   amounts to searching for the value of t*.

Quandt's   method of estimating t*        the following: first, a maximization
                                     involves

                                                                                    1


(where N denotes the number of countries and T denotes the number of years), and
second, determination of the breakpoint t* as the value which yields the highest

maximum likelihood L(ylt*). The application of this procedure to determining

the breakpoint in the demand for reserves, yields 1972 as the estimate for t*

for Less—Developed Countries. For the Developed Countries the breakpoint is less

clear and the choice between 1972 and 1973 as the relevant breakpoint is some-

what arbitrary.

           Based on these results, 1972 is used as the estimate of the break point

 for both the Developed and the Less Developed Countries, implying that from the

 viewpoint of reserve holdings, 1972 marks the end of the first subperiod. The

 validity of this assumption was tested by applying the likelihood—ratio test

 to the null hypothesis that no switch took place between 1972 and 1973. The

 likelihood   ratio statistic is                           N(T—) /0

where       is the estimated standard deviation of the residuals from the single

regression estimated over the entire period 1963—79 for Developed Countries

and 1963—77 for LDC's.

        According to the null hypothesis, —2 2n       is distributed x2 with

degrees of freedom corresponding to the number of constraints. The null hypo-

thesis was rejected for both groups of countries at the 99 percent confidence

level.6 The practical implication is that for the purpose of estimation, data

from the period 1963—72 should not be pooled with those from the subsequent

period and that the structural change occurred by the end of 1972.

        In addition to the above test one may also use a Chow—test to test for

the equality of the regression coefficients between the two periods. The

resulting values of the F—statistics relevant for testing the null hypothesis

were well above the critical values at the 99 percent confidence level for both

groups of countries. Thus, the Chow—test as well leads to the rejection of

the null hypothesis. The overall inference is that the system had changed by

the end of 1972. It is this conclusion which provides the rationale for the

pattern of the intertemporal pooling that is employed in Table 3.     As may be

seen from Table 3, the main changes in the estimated coefficients occurred in

the constant term and in the coefficient of       .   For both groups of countries

the constant term declined with the move to greater flexibility of exchange

rates indicating that for given characteristics of the other economic variables,

the holding of reserves (in real terms) declined during the second period. Like—

wise, both groups of countries revealed higher sensitivity to the variability

measure during the second period. In general it is relevant to note that the

results concerning the patterns of reserve holdings are consistent with the

findings in Suss (1976) and in Heller and Khan (1978). Finally it is important
                                       15


 to emphasize that the above discussion associated the structural change with

 the change in the exchange rate regime; it could of course reflect other (not

 necessarily unrelated) phenomena which occurred in the early 1970's like the

 oil crisis and the commodity price boom.



 Country—Specific and Time—Specific Factors

           The estimates of the demand for international reserves in Table 3 com-

bined cross—section and time—series data using ordinary—least—squares (OLS)

estimation. Implementing this estimation method requires that the residuals

In equation (1) be uncorrelated among countries at a point In time as well as

over time. This assumption, however, may not be fully justified in view of

earlier findings (e.g., Frenkel 1974b, 1978) that there are countries whose

reserve holdings exhibit persistent positive residuals (Switzerland and Austria)

and there are countries whose holdings exhibit persistent negative residuals

(the U.K. and New Zealand). This phenomenon suggests that there might be some

country—specific and possibly also some time—specific factors which determine

the demand for international reserves. These country—specific factors may be

the result of historical, political and social influences that are not captured

by the conventional set of arguments in the reserves function. Although it may

not be possible to explain these factors, it is important to take account of

their influence On the error structure. An incorporation of these factors in

the estimation procedure should increase the efficiency of the estimated para-

meters, and the improved estimates should be useful in assessing the 'adequacy'

of international liquidity and its distribution among countries.

        In what follows the possibility that the residuals from the estimated

demand for reserves contain country—specific factors and time—specific factors

is allowed for by applying the error—components model (see Balestra and Nerlove

(l966)).
                                                            16


In order to emphasize the possibility of country—specific factors, equation (1)

is written below as (5) without suppressing the country index 1.

where as before R.t denotes the real value of reserves held by country i at

time t,            denotes the variability measure for country i at period t,

    designates the scale variable and the openness of the economy is measured

by the average propensity to import m. .                              The subsequent analysis focuses on

the 22 developed countries.

          The error term u is assumed to be composed of three independent

parts (i)           the country—specific factor, which is assumed to be invariant

with time, (ii) A, the time—specific factor which is assumed to be coon

to all countries in the cross—section and (iii)                                    a serially uncorrelated
identically distributed random variable. Formally, the error—components

model can be specified as


              =    'j. +        + ci                   (1    1,2,...,N; t =     1,2,...,T)         (6)



where ,     X   and             are independent normal variables each with zero mean

such that

                                                   =

                                                   =        and t =   t'

The specification of the errors implies that u. is homoskedastic and that

 its   variance   is the sum   of   the variances of the three components:

                                                                                 (7)




          The assumption that the errors are correlated requires the application of

a generalized—least—squares (GLS) estimation method. Table 4 reports the GLS

estimates of equation (5) for the pegged and the flexible exchange—rate regimes.

A comparison of the parameter estimates in Table 4 with the corresponding esti-

mates in Table 3 reveals the extent of the differences. In comparison with the

OLS estimation method the GLS estimation method yields lower estimates of the

coefficients of the measures of variability and openness. The GLS estimates also

reveal that the variance of the error             a2 is mainly due to the variance of the

country—specific factors,            ,   which underlie the cross—sectional regressions.

In contrast, thevarianceof the time—specific component,                ,which underlie the

variations in the time series, plays a relatively minor role.



Forecasts

          The previous results demonstrated that as a statistical matter the

system underwent a structural change by the end of 1972, and that allowance

for country—specific factors alters the numerical value of the estimates of

the various parameters. The relevant question is, what is the operational

relevance of these findings? Do they imply that the move to the second

regime rendered the estimates that were based on data from the first regime

obsolete? This question is of some practical importance since quite fre-

quently a relatively long period of time elapses before sufficiently new

data are accumulated, and before additional research efforts yield new esti-

mates. Likewise, does the fact that GLS estimates differ from the corré—

sponding OLS estimates imply that the latter are useless? To gain perspec-

tive into this question, the accuracy of forecasts of reserve holdings during

the second regime based on parameter estimates from the first regime (1963—72)

are examined.

        We start with computing the series of forecasts based on the GLS

estimates of Table 4. Since the time—invariant cross—sectional component

of the errors plays a major role in accounting for the overall residual

variance, one should be able to exploit this information in forecasting

reserve holdings. For that purpose the country—specific factor p.    is first

estimated as

                     T                     T
             =   (          th    —

                     t=l




where GLS denotes the vector of the GLS parameter estimates of equation (5)

and where x denotes the vector of the right—hand—side variables of

equation (5). Noting that the expected values of       and of    are zero,

it is assumed that



        T              T
                                 =0     (for all i)
       c=l            t=l


and tkus j. (which was estimated from data corresponding to the period

1963—72) is treated as an estimate of the expected residual for the ith
                              a
country for the second period. The forecast of reserve holdings for country
i for the second period is therefore

where the superscript (*) indicates that the right—hand—side vector is based

on data for 1973—79. This forecast utilizes the fact that the expected

 residuals u from the GLS regressions for the period 1973—79 are correlated

 with the residuals from the GLS regression for the period of 1963—72.

 In contrast, for the OLS regressions the corresponding best forecast is


 OLS it
          Table 5 contains the results of an evaluation of various forecasts

of   reserve holdings for the flexible exchange—rate regime on the basis of
the information from the period of the pegged rate regime. These forecasts
were derived from the parameter estimates of the OLS and the GLS regressions
for 1963—1972 as reported in Tables 3 and 4. As may be seen, the correla-
tion coefficients between the series of predictions and actual outcomes are
quite high——ranging from 0.84 for the LDC's OLS estimates and 0.96 for the
Developed Countries GLS estimates. Generally, the forecasts based on the
GLS estimates are superior to those based on the OLS estimates. For example,
comparing the quality of the forecasts for Developed Countries, the root mean
square   error and the mean error are 0.66 and —0.40   for the OLS forecast while
the corresponding errors for the GLS forecast   are only 0.46 and —0.23

respectively.
        An additional procedure for the evaluation of the quality of the
various forecasts follows Theil (1961). Consider a series of predictions
            and a series of the corresponding actual outcomes

        U =




according to which U = 0 in the case of perfect forecast (P. = A.    for all 1),

and U = 1 in the case of extremely poor forecasting. The variance of the

forecast errors (the square root of which is the numerator of U) can be

decomposed as




            (P. — A.)2 =   (   - A)2   + (s — sA)2 + 2(1 — r)sPsA




where , A, s and SA are the means and the standard deviations of the
series of predictions and actual outcomes respectively; and where r is their

correlation coefficient. Denoting the denominator of U by D, Theil defines

     (P —   A)/D,     (s —     A1' and    U 12(l_r)sPsA7D and thus


                    +u+u=u2                                            (10)


where the three terms on the left—hand side of equation(l0) are referred to

as the partial coefficients of inequality due to unequal central tendency,

to unequal variation and to imperfect covariation, respectively. Normalizing

these terms by U2 yields


               uM +uS+uC=l                                             (11)



where uM U/U2, u uIU2 and U U/U.
                                    23



In equation (11) tiM, uS and U' are the proportions of the inequality due to

the above mentioned three different sources that are termed by Theil as the

bias, the variance and the covariance proportions, respectively. It is clear

that in the absence of perfect forecasting a desirable distribution of the

inequality over the three sources is U =   0, U = 0 and U = 1   since small

proportions tiM and U indicate that systematic errors do not play a major

role in forecast errors.

        As may be in Table 5, Theil's inequality coefficients are very low,

ranging from 0.03 to 0.06. Furthermore, the forecast errors possess the

"desirable" properties that most of the errors are not systematic, as

indicated by the fact that their largest fraction is due to different

covariation. Also in this respect it seems that the quality of the GLS

forecasts for Developed Countries are more satisfactory than those of the

corresponding OLS forecasts in that the fraction of the forecast error due

to bias and to different variation is lower than the GLS forecasts. Based

on the magnitudes of the sources of the error, it seems that the quality of

the forecasts is somewhat better for the Less—Developed Countries than for

the Developed Countries. Consistent with the previous results, it seems

that the behavior of the developed countries with respect to reserve holdings

underwent a more drastic structural change than that of the Less—Developed

Countries. In fact, on the basis of the relatively good forecasts, it seems

that the structural change, while statistically significant, was not of

sufficient magnitude to make the old estimates completely obsolete.

        The relative stability of the patterns of reserve holdings suggests the

following interpretation: during the pegged rate regime the rate was adlust—
                                    24



able rather than fixed and during the so—called floating rate regime the rate

has been managed rather than free. Economic behavior seems to be more stable

than legal arrangements. Central banks have revealed that their choice is

for neither of the extreme exchange rate systems, but have rather, preferred

to have the intermediate system of managed floating. Since managing the

float requires international reserves, one would expect to find a relatively

stable demand for reserves, which might not differ greatly from the demand

estimated for the adjustable peg regime.



The Dynamics of Adjustment

        The analysis up to this point assumes that countries were "on"

their long—run demand function. The following discussion draws a distinc-

tion between short—run and long run demand function and examines the speed

of adjustment of reserves to their long—run desired value. While cross—

sectioned studies have identified the key variables which determine the

holdings of international reserves, some work on the dynamics of adjustment

found that the speed at which actual reserves adjust towards target

reserves is very slow and is often not significantly different from zero

(see for example Clark 11970b1 and lyoha [l976]). If correct, then these

findings cast some doubt onthe usefulness of the cross—sectional studies

for the analysis of the adequacy of international reserves since evidence

of a stable long—run demand function is of little value if it cannot be

used to show that discrepancies between actual and desired stocks are

eliminated over time.
                                           25.




        In Bilson and Frenkel (1979a, 1979b), however, it was shown that

the earlier estimates of the speeds of adjustment were biased downwards

and that in fact the speeds of adjustment for both the Developed Countries

as well as theLDC's were reasonably high. Here, this framework is extended

so as to allow the dynamic adjustment of international reserves to reflect

both the Central Bank's excess demand for reserves and the public's excess

demand for money. In that way the ch.anges in the stock of international

reserves reflect considerations which were emphasized in the literature on

the demand for reserves as well as those which were emphasized in the

literature on the monetary approach to the balance of payments. Equation

(12) describes one general form of the reserve—adjustment equation:


                                                         — 9n Mt_iJ + uj (12)
         A 2,n R.t =     R —       2.n   Rt_i] + [2.n


where     and M*t denote respectively the desired levels of reserves and

money for country i at period t, and where c. and       denote the speeds of

              11
adjustment.

        In order to estimate these speeds of adjustment it is necessary to

obtain an estimate of the desired level of reserves and money as well as

to specify the properties of the error term             The previous findings

revealed that country—specific factors play important roles in governing

countries' holdings of international reserves. Time—specific factors,

on the other hand, have played only an insignificant role. Accordingly,

it is assumed that the properties of the error term can be characterized

by equation (6) with
                        ——   the   time specific factor —— supressed to zero.

        Under the assumption that on average the holdings of international
                                     26.




reserves and of real money balances equal their target level, these target

levels can be estimated from equations (13)—(14).

                     + l i. 2
where     denotes the average level of reserves for country i (where an

average over time for country i is denoted by '1.'). Equation (14) is a

conventional demand for money expressed as a function of income, Y, and

the rate of interest, i. In equation (14) M denotes the monetary base

and I the short—term nominal rate of interest. The choice of the monetary

aggregate was made for two reasons. First, most countries do not pay

interest on the monetary base whereas financial practices for broader

monetary aggregates differ widely across countries.       Second, the monetary

base may be considered as the more appropriate aggregate for balance of

payments analysis.

        The first stage of the estimation procedure involves estimating

equations (13)—(14) from the sample averages of the time—series—crOSS

section data base. The resulting estimates for the sample of the 22

developed countries over the two sub—periods are reported in Table 6. The

estimates of the parameters of the average demand for reserves are very

similar to those reported in Table 3, and the estimates of the demand f or

money reveal a unit income elasticity and a negative interest elasticity.

During the second period the interest elasticity declined (in absolute

value) and its magnitude did not differ significantly from zero.

worthy that in contrast with the previous studies, the definitions of the

target levels of reserves and cash balances in equations (15)—(16), In-

clude the country—specific factors. The conventional approach to the

analysis of the dynamics of adjustment has been to append the equilibrium

specifications of the demands for reserves and for cash balances with a

lagged dependent variable. The obvious problem with that approach arises

from the existence of a country—specific factor. If this factor is not

accounted for in the specification of the target levels of reserves and
                                    29




cash balances, the coefficients of the lagged dependent variables would be

biased towards unity so that the estimated speed of adjustment would be

biased downwards. As should be evident the two—stage procedure outlined

here is not subject to this bias.

          Using equations (15)—(16) to construct the target levels of

reserves and cash balances the estimates of the speeds of adjustment in

equation (12) are reported in Table 7. The results support the specifica-

tion in the adjustment equation (12). They demonstrate that the actual

changes in reserves are influenced by both the excess demand for reserves

by the Central Bank and by the private sector's excess demand for money.

The speeds of adjustment are higher than those typically obtained by

estimates of the coefficients on lagged dependent variables.

          Finally, somewhat surprisingly, the estimated speeds of adjustments

are higher during the flexible exchange—rate regime than during the pegged—

rate regime. As seen in Table 6 the adjustment coefficient to an excess

demand for international reserves rose from 0.370 to 0.488 while the

adjusted coefficient to an excess demand for money rose from 0.298 to

0.357.



An Overview

         This section contained an analysis of the role of international reserves

under a regime of pegged exchange rates and under a regime of managed float.

It presented evidence on the stability of the demand for reserves during the

periods 1963—72 and 1973—79. It was shown that the demand for reserves by

Developed Countries differs from that of Less—Developed Countries and that the

system underwent a structural change by the end of 1972. In view of the drastic

changes in the international monetary system, the extent of the structural

change (in particular with reference to the behavior of developed countries)

has not been as large as one might have expected. This finding led to the

observation that economic behavior seems to be more stable than legal arrange-

ments. The evidence indicates that countries have continued to hold and use

international reserves, and they have chosen to manage their exchange rates

rather than let them float freely. This suggests that the move to the floating—

rate regime has not reduced significantly the need for international reserves,

nor has it removed the need to establish clearly the means and mechanisms for

the provision of such reserves.12 The section concluded with an analysis of

the dynamics of adjustment to disequilibrium reserve holdings. It was shown

that changes in the holdings of international reserves reflect both the excess

demand for reserves on the part of the Central Bank, as well as excess demand

for money on the part of the private sector. The estimated speeds of adjust-

ment were shown to be larger than those reproted in earlier studies.

       While much of the discussion in this section evolved around the details

of econometric specifications and estimation procedures, the central implications

should not be lost. The stability of the demand for international reserves and

the adjustment mechanism that is triggered once reserve holdings differ from

the desired level suggest that governments have chosen to include international—

reserves target in the list of targets which guides and constrains the conduct

of macroeconomic policies. The evidence suggests that the move to greater

flexibility of exchange rates has not removed this constraint in any material

way. The next section deals with the more general questions of the constraints

that the openness of the economy imposes on the effectiveness of policies and

the impact of the exchange—rate regime on the effectiveness of these constraints.

      II.    THE INTERNATIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON MONETARY CONTROL



       The discussion     in the previous section ended with the conclusion that

the evidence on the stability of the demand    for international reserves across
exchange—rate regimes indicates that attempts to attain desired reserve
holdings have influenced and constrained the conduct of monetary policy.

This section addresses the broader issue of the nature of the international

constraints on monetary policy.13

       Generally, macroeconomic policies for open economies differ in

fundamentally important ways from the corresponding policies for closed

economies. The openness of the economy imposes constraints on the effective-

ness and proper conduct of macroeconomic policies in general, and of monetary

control in particular. These constraints stem from the interdependence between

the economy and the rest of the world. The open economy is linked to the

rest of the world primarily through three key linkages: through international

trade in goods and services; through international mobility of capital; and

through international exchanges of national monies (see Frenkel and Mussa (1981)

for a detailed analysis of the implications of these linkages for macro—economic

policies.)

       International trade links prices in different national economies. While

the evidence on purchasing power parities reveals that this link is not rigid,

it is evident that a country cannot choose its long—run trend in the inflation

rate independent of the long—run courses of monetary policy and the exchange

rate. This relation thus imposes a severe constraint on monetary policy.

      International mobility of capital links interest rates on financial

assets. En    addition,   by permitting countries to finance current—account im—
                                       33




balances, it provides for a channel through which macroeconomic disturbances

are transmitted internationally. The international mobility of capital limits

the power of monetary policy. Under a fixed exchange-rate regime,a monetary

expansion in excess of money demand is likely to have only a limited success

in sustaining the change in the nominal money stock. Any temporary reduction

in the domestic rate of interest will induce capital outflow and a loss of

foreign exchange reserves, and any attempts to sterilize the monetary con-

sequences of the loss of international reserves is unlikely to be viable in

the long—run (more on this in Section (III). Under a flexible exchange rate

regime the monetary authority regains control over the nominal money stock

but the international mobility of capital still imposes a severe limitation

on the ability of monetary policy to significantly affect the evolution of

output and employment. A monetary expansion is likely to induce a rapid change

in the exchange rate which leads to prompt adjustment of prices and wages.

        The implication of capital mobility on the efficiency of policies is

illustrated in Figure 1 [adapted from Frenkel and Rodriguez (1975)] which

describes the effects of open market operations under fixed exchange rates.

Consider a portfolio which is composed of real cash balances M/P (where P denotes

the price level) and common stocks, K, and let the price of a security in terms

of goods be     .   It   is assumed that the economy is small and fully integrated

in world capital markets. As a result, since the foreign rate of interest is

assumed to be given, the relative price of securities in terms of goods, k' is

also assumed to be fixed for the small open economy. The price level for the

small open economy, P ,    is   assumed to equal SP* where S denotes the exchange

rate and *    denotes the given foreign price. Thus, under fixed exchange rates

the price level is given. The value of wealth, W, is thus



          W- +PkK                                                        (19)

Suppose that the desired money/securities ratio depends negatively on the

rate of interest as in equation (20).


                    =              K.                                                   (20)


              Portfolio equilibrium is described by point A in Figure 1. The nega-

tively sloped schedule describes the wealth constraint and the positively sloped

schedule describes the desired composition of assets given the rate of

interest. An open market purchase moves the economy from point A to point B

at which the money supply has risen and the holdings of securities by the

private sector has fallen. Since at point B the composition of the portfolio

has been disturbed and since asset holders have access to world asset markets

at the given rate of interest, they will restore portfolio equilibrium

instantaneously by exchanging the incteased stock of cash for foreign

securities      and thereby returning to point A. Thus, the              fact that world

capital   markets         are integrated and that open market operations are conducted

in assets that are traded internationally at a given price, enables the private

case open market operations amount to an exchange of                 foreign   exchange reserves
for securities          between the monetary authorities and foreign asset holders, and

the entire process of adjustment is effected through the capital account of the

balance of payments. The leverage of monetary policy can be somewhat enhanced if

it operates in financial assets that are isolated from world capital markets

since, in the short—run, the link between the rates of return on such assets with

the world rates of interest is not as tight.

          The same figure can be used for the analysis of a once and for all rise

in the quantity of money that is brought about through an unanticipated transfer
                                  36




of cash balances which moves the economy from point A to point C. The

impact of this policy is to raise the value of assets and to raise the rela-

tive share of money in wealth. Portfolio composition equilibrium is restored

by an immediate exchange of part of the increased monetary stock for equities

as individuals move to point D. This exchange is effected through the capital

account of the balance of payments. Since at D the value of assets exceeds the

equilibrium value at A, individuals will wish to run down their holdings of

both equities and real cash balances by increasing expenditures relative to

income. This part of the process will be gradual. The transition towards

long—run equilibrium follows along the path from D to A and is characterized

by a deficit in the current account, a surplus in the capital account and a

deficit in the monetary account of the balance of payments.

        Under flexible exchange rates,adjustments of real balances occur through

changes in the exchange rate. Using the same diagram the effects of monetary

policies are very different. An open market operation which brings the economy

from point A to point B in Figure 1 cannot be nullified through the capital

account since under flexible exchange rates money ceases to be an internationally

traded commodity. Portfolio equilibrium is restored by an immediate rise in

the exchange rate(i.e., a depreciation of the currency) which moves individuals

from point B to point E. As maybe seen, the percentage rise in the exchange

rate exceeds the percentage rise in the money stock; this is the overshooting

phenomenon. Since at E the value of assets falls short of the long—run equili-

brium value, individuals will wish to accummulate both equities and real balances

by reducing expenditures relative to income. This part of the process will be

gradual, and the transition from E to A is characterized by a surplus in the

current account, a deficit in the capital account and an appreciation of the
            14
currency.

        In contrast, when the rise in the quantity of money is brought about
                                      37




through a transfer which moves the economy from point A to point C, the new

equilibrium will be restored instantaneously through an equiproportionate

depreciation of the currency which restores equilibrium at A.

           The previous analysis of open market operations assumed implicitly that

the    returns on government holdings of securities are rebated to the private
sector (in a lump sum fashion) but that the private sector does not capitalize
the expected future flow of transfers. As a result the open market operations
did not change the wealth position of      individuals who moved from point A to

point   B along the given wealth   constraint. Under the alternative assumption that

asset   holders anticipate and capitalize the flow   of transfers and treat

them   as any other marketable asset, they effectively conceive of    the equities

that   are held by the government as their own. In    that case the open market

purchase   only raises the supply of real cash balances and moves the economy
from point A to point C. The effects of this policy are identical to the
effects of the pure monetary expansion that is brought about through the
governmental transfer.
          The analysis of   these two extreme cases implies that when international

capital markets are highly integrated, the effectiveness of the constraints on

monetary policy under fixed and flexible exchange—rate regimes depends on the

degree to which the private sector capitalizes future streams of taxes and

transfers as well as on the marketability of claims to such streams.15 When

such claims are not fully perceived by individuals or by the capital market, the

effects of open market operations are nullified rapidly under fixed exchange rates

while the adjustment is gradual under flexible exchange rates. In constrast, when

individuals and capital markets do fully perceive these claims, the adjustment

to open market operations is only gradual when the exchange rate is fixed while

it is rapid when the exchange rate is flexible. These cases illustrate that the
                                 —38—



ranking of alternative exchange—rate regimes according to the speeds of adjust-

ments to monetary policies is not unambiguous since it depends on the mechanism

of monetary policy and on the public's perception of such policies.
      The international exchange of national monies and the requirement of

monetary equilibrium also impose a severe limitation on the effectiveness of

monetary policy. As stated before, under a fixed    exchange   rate regime the

authorities lose control over the nominal money stock while under a flexible rate

regime the requirement of monetary equilibrium ensures that in the long—run

changes in the nominal money stock lead to a proportionate change in all

nominal prices and wages. Because of the rapid change in the exchange rate,

the constraint on monetary policy that is implied by the homogeneity postu-

late is likely to be manifested much more promptly in an open economy with

flexible exchange rates than in a closed economy.

      An additional consideration constraining the conduct of monetary policy

follows from the dynamic linkage between current exchange rates and expectations

of future exchange rates (see Mussa (1976,1979)). This dynamic linkage implies

that the effect of monetary policy on the exchange rate, and thereby on other

economic variables, depends on Its effect on expectations concerning future

policies. These expectations, in turn, are influenced by the past and by the

current course of policy, and it is likely that the mere recognition of this

dynamic linkage will influence the conduct of policy. For the government, being

aware that the effectiveness of any particular policy measure depends on the way

by which it influences the public's perception of the mp1ications of the measure

for the future conduct of policy, may become more constrained in employing

the instrument of monetary policy.

      In suary, the openness of the economy imposes constraints on monetary

policy. These constraints are reflected in either a reduced ability to influence

the instruments of monetary policy (like the nominal money supply under fixed
                                     39




exchange rates), or in a reduced ability to influence the targets of monetary

policy (like the level of real output), or in an increased prudence in the use

of monetary policy because of the potentially undesirable effects on expectations.

          This discussion suggests that while the exchange—rate regime affects the

nature of the constraints on policy, the constraints themselves stem from the

openness of the economy. Furthermore, the choice of the exchange—rate regime

does not alleviate the fundamental constraints even though it influences the

manifestation of these constraints. With this perspective one may rationalize

the findings (reported in Section I) that economic behavior with respect to

reserve holdings has been more stable than what would have been predicted on

the basis of the large changes in the legal arrangement. Policy makers seem

to have recognized that a move to a regime of clean float which could have re-

duced the need for reserves, would have imposed significant costs associated with

prompt translation of monetary changes into exchange rate changes as well as

with large changes in real change rates. In view of these costs, policy makers

have   chosen not to enjoy fully the "degree of freedom" granted with the move
to   clean float.

        The constraints on the conduct of monetary policy depend on the exchange—

rate regime. Therefore, the question of the country's choice of the optimal set

of constraints on monetary policy can be answered in terms of the analysis of the

choice of the optimal exchange rate regime. Such analysis reveals that the

optimal exchange rate regime depends on the nature and the origin of shocks that

affect the economy. Generally, the higher is the variance of real shocks which

affect the supply of goods, the larger becomes the desirability of increased

fixity of exchange rates. The rationale for the implication is that the balance

of payments serves as a shock absorber which mitigates the effect of real shocks
                                     —40—



on consumption. The importance of this factor diminishes the larger is the degree

of international capital mobility.      On the other hand, the desirability of

exchange—rate flexibility increases the larger are the variances of shocks to

excess supply of money, to foreign prices and to deviations from purchasing

power parities (see Frenkel and Aizenman [1982fl.



                  III. EXCHANGE—MARKET INTERVENTION

      The analysis of the international constraints on monetary policy is closely

related to the analysis of the questions of whether the authorities can sterilize

the monetary implications of the balance of payments and the monetary implications

of interventions in the market for foreign exchange. It is the need for occasional

interventions in the market for foreign exchange that provided some of the rationale

for the continued stable holdings of international reserves which were discussed in

Section I. In this context, however, the difficulties in analysing that question

start with definitions since exchange—market intervention means different things

to different people (see Wallich [19821). Some, especially in the United States,

interpret foreign exchange intervention to mean sterilized intervention, that is,

intervention which is not allowed to affect the monetary base and thus amounts

to an exchange of domestic for foreign bonds. Others, especially in Europe,

interpret foreign intervention to mean nonsterilized intervention. Thus, for the

Europeans an intervention alters the course of monetary policy, while for the

Americans it does not.

         The distinction between the two concepts of intervention is fundamental

and the exchange—rate effects of the two forms of intervention may be very

different depending on the relative degree of substitution among assets. In

principle, sterilized intervention may affect the exchange rate by portfolio—

balance effects (see Allen and i(nen J98(fl, Bransn [19791 and Henderson [19771),
                                    —41—



and by signaling to the public the governments intentions concerning future

policies, thereby changing expectations, (see Mussa (1981)). To the extent

ihat sterilized intervention is effective in managing exchange rates, the con-

straint on the conduct of monetary policy would not be severe since the undesir-

able exchange rate effects of monetary policy could be offset by policies

which alter appropriately the composition of assets. In practice, however, the

evidence suggests that nonsteilized intervention which alters the monetary

base has a strong effect on the exchange rate while an equivalent sterilized

intervention has very little effect (see Obstefeld [1983]).       These findings are

relevant for both the theory of exchange rate determination and the practice of

exchange rate and monetary policies. As to the theory, they shed doubts on the

usefulness of the portfolio—balance modal. As to the practice, they demonstrate

that the distinction between the two forms of intervention is critical if the

authorities mean to intervene effectively, and that it may be inappropriate to

assume that the open—economy constraints on monetary policy can be easily over-

come by sterilization policies.

       The preceding discussion defined interventions in terms of transactions

involving specific pairs of assets. In evaluating these transactions it might

be   useful to explore the broader spectrum of possible policies. Figure 2 sum-
marizes the various pattern., of domestic and   foreign   monetary policies and foreign

exchange interventions. These policies are divided into three groups as follows:

               I :   Domestic nonsterilized foreign exchange intervention
               1*: Foreign nonsterilized foreign exchange intervention
              II :   Domestic monetary policy
              11*: Foreign monetary policy
             III :   Domestic sterilized foreign exchange intervention
             111*: Foreign sterilized foreign exchange. intervention

This classification is based on the types of assets that are being exchanged.

Thus, when the authorities exchange domestic money (M) for domestic bonds (B),

the transaction is refered to as domestic monetary policy (as in II), while

when the authorities exchange domestic bonds (B) for foreign bonds (B*), the

transaction is being refered to as domestic sterilized foreign exchange inter-

vention (as in III). Some have characterized pure foreign. exchange interven-

tion as an exchange of domestic money (M) for foreign money (M*) rather than

the exchange of domestic money for foreign bonds. To complete the spectrum

this type of exchange is indicated in Figure 2 by I' and I'*, respectively.

      This general classification highlights two principles. First, it shows

that the differences between the various policies depend on the different charac-
teristics of the various assets that are being exchanged. These different charac-

teristics are at the foundation of the portfolio—balance model. Second,it shows

that domestic and foreign variables enter synimetrically into the picture. Thus,

for example, a given exchange between M and B* can be effected through the

policies of the home country or through a combination of policies of the foreign

country. This syetry suggests that there is room (and possibly a role) for

international coordination of exchange rate policies. It also illustrates the

"(n—i) problem" of the international monetary system: in a world of n currencies

there are (n—i) exchange rates and only (n—l) monetary authorities need to

intervene in order to attain a set of exchange rates. To ensure consistency the

international monetary system needs to specify the allocation of the remaining

degree of freedom (see Mundell (1968)).

      By and large the evidence on the effectiveness of sterilized intervention

has been based on a comparison between patterns I and III within a single—country

framework. It is possible that some of the findings emerging from the single—
                                     —44—




country studies may be modified once the foreign countries' behavior is taken

into account. But, until presented with such evidence, it is reasonable to

conclude that it is very difficult to conduct effectively independent monetary

and exchange rate policies.



                      IV.   GUIDELINES FOR MONETARY POLICY


      The analysis in Section II emphasized the constraints that are imposed

on monetary control in the open economy. Under fixed exchange rates these

constraints may be somewhat alleviated through sterilization policies, but the

evidence sheds some doubt on the effectiveness of such attempts. As was also

indicated, under flexible exchange rates the rapid changes in exchange rates

also impose a constraint on the effectiveness of monetary policy in that they

speed up the translation of monetary changes into changes in prices and wages.

Furthermore, the recent volatility of exchange rates and the accompanying large

divergence from purchasing power parities have been costly and have resulted

in an increased perception that exchange—rate changes reduce the leverage of

monetary policy. Attempts to alleviate some of these constraints have given

rise to various proposals concerning rules for intervention in the foreign—

exchange market. Some of these proposals are variants of a PPP rule according

to which the authorities are expected to intervene so as to ensure that the

path of the exchange rate conforms to the path of the relative price levels.

These proposals, if effective, amount to guidelines for the conduct of monetary

policy.
      There are at least four difficulties with a PPP rule. First, there are

intrinsic differences between the characteristics of exchange rates and the p-rice

of national outputs. These differences, which result from the much stronger
                                   —45—




dependence of exchange rates (and other asset prices) on expectations, suggest

that the fact that exchange rates have moved more than the price level is not

sufficient evidence that exchange—rate volatility has been excessive.


      Second, the prices of national outputs do not adjust fully to shocks in

the short run and thus, intervention in the foreign exchange market to ensure

purchasing power parity would be a mistake. When commodity prices are slow

to adjust to current and expected economic conditions, it may be desirable to

allow for "excessive" adjustment in some other prices.

      Third, there are continuous changes in real economic conditions that require

adjustment in the equilibrium relative prices of different national outputs.

Under these circumstances what seem to be divergences from purchasing power

parities may really reflect equilibrating changes.

      Fourth, if there is short—run stickiness of prices of domestic goods in

terms of national monies, then rapid exchange—rate adjustments, which are capable

of changing the relative prices of different national outputs, are a desirable

response to changing real economic conditions. An intervention rule which links

changes in exchange rates rigidly to changes in domestic and foreign prices in

accord with purchasing power parity ignores the occasional need for equilibrating

changes in relative prices.

      While it might be tempting to "solve" the problem of divergences from PPP

by adopting a rigid PPP rule, this would be a mistaken policy course.

      What should be the role of the exchange rate in the design of monetary policy?

Generally, given that monetary and exchange—rate policies should not be viewed as

two independent instruments, consideration of the external value of the currency

should play a relatIvely minor role in the design of monetary policy. The major

consideration that should guide the monetary authority is that of achieving price

stability.
                                   —46—




      While this prescription may seem to represent a revival of the "benign

neglect" attitude the opposite is the case. In the past, one of the major argu-

ments for the "benign neglect" attitude in the U.S. was that the U.S. economy was

relatively closed and the foreign trade sector was relatively unimportant.

The typical statistic which was used to justify this position was the low

share of imports in GNP. This argument was inappropriate in the past and

is even less appropriate under present circumstances. The U.S. has always

been an open economy. The relevant measure of openness to international

trade in goods and services is not the share of actual trade in GNP but rather

the share of tradeable commodities in GNP (i.e., of potential trade) which is

by far larger than that of actual trade. Furthermore, as stated in Section I,

one of the main linkages of the U.S. to the world economy is operating through

world capital markets with which the U.S. is clearly well integrated. The

same principle applies to the measures of openness of most countries.

      The prescription is based on the notions that the economy is open, that

the external value of the currency is important, that the restoration of price

stability is an important policy goal, and that policy which views the exchange

rate as an independent target or, even worse, as an independent instrument, is

likely to result in unstable prices. Furthermore, if monetary policy succeeds

in achieving price stability, it might be useful to allow for fluctuations of

the exchange rate which provide for a partial insulation from misguided foreign

monetary policies.

      Even when monetary policy is not guided by exchange rate targets it might

attempt to offset disturbances arising from shifts in the demand for money.

Such shifts in demand may be especially pronounced under a regime of flexible
                                         —47—




exchange rates. A policy which accommodates such demand         shifts   by offsetting

supply shifts, would reduce the need for costly adjustments of exchange rates

and national price levels. The difficulty with implementing this policy is in

identifying when a shift in money demand has occurred. As is obvious, the nominal

rate of interest is not a reliable indicator of money market conditions. The

more relevant indicators are the components of the nominal rate of interest ——

the   real rate of interest and the expected rate of inflation ——        but   these com-

ponents are unobservable.

         Here the exchange rate may be useful as an indicator for monetary policy

especially when frequent changes in inflationary expectations make nominal

interest rates an unreliable indicator of fluctuations in money demand. In

order to determine the way in which exchange rates may serve as a useful indi-

cator for the conduct of policy it is useful to start with an examination of

the empirical record concerning the links between interest rates and exchange

rates.



         Interest Rates and Exchange Rates


         One   of   the striking characteristics of the relation between the exchange

rate and the interest differential has been the dramatic reversal of the

relation which had taken place by the latter part of 1979. The empirical

record is illustrated by Figure 3 which shows the relation between the value

of the dollar in terms of a trade—weighted basket of foreign currencies and

the corresponding interest differential. As may be seen, there were generally

two phases to the link between the value of the dollar and the interest differ-

ential. First, during the period 1973 through mid 1979, a higher interest rate

in the U.S. (relative to foreign rates) was associated with a depreciation of

the dollar and second, since about mid 1979, a higher interest differential has

been associated with an appreciation of the dollar in terms of foreign exchange.

      The same inference can be drawn from a comparison of the correlation co-

efficients between innovations (news) in the interest differentials and the

various exchange rates. As shown in Table 8, the correlation coefficients

have changed sign since the latter part of 1979. This general pattern is

independent of whether the various interest rate news are correlated with the

level of the exchange rates or with the rate of change thereof. Nor does it

depend on whether one uses the various measures of the exchange rates or the

innovations (news) in these measures.

       The reversal of the relation between the U.S. interest and the external

value of the dollar which has taken place since mid 1979, indicates that recently

the prime cause for the fluctuations in U.S. interest rates has not been varia-

tions in inflationary expectations but rather variations in the real rate of

interest. This distinction between the real rate of interest and inflationary

expectations is the key factor in interpreting the empirical record.

       The relation between the exchange rate, the real interest rate and the

expected rate of inflation (relative to the corresponding foreign rates) can

be derived from the following basic parity conditions. Equation (21) describes

the interest parity condition that is implied by interest arbitrage:

In   deriving equation (25) it was assumed that the expected value of a variable
for period t,    based     on   the   information available in      period   t,   equals      the
actual   value of that variable, e.g., EtPaP.

      Equation (25) demonstrates the relation between the exchange rate and the

components     of the nominal rate of interest.              The first bracketed term in equation
                                    52




(25) suggests that a rise in the domestic rate of inflation relative to foreign

inflation is associated with a depreciation of the domestic currency (a rise

in st). The second bracketed term in equation (25) suggests that a rise in the

domestic real rate of interest relative to the foreign rate is associated with

an appreciation of the domestic currency (a fall in se). The additional terms

on the right hand side of equation (25) describe differences in expectations

concerning real exchange rates.16 The different relations between the exchange

rate on the one hand and the two components of the nominal interest rate on the

other, is the basis for the policy prescription that is specified below.



Policy Prescription


       The recommended policy prescription is based on the supposition that

data from the market for foreign exchange can be used in combination with data

on interest rates in order to provide the monetary authorities with useful

information on money market conditions. Such information can contribute to

the improved conduct of monetary policy in spite of the difficulties which stem

from the constraints imposed by the openness of the economy. Accordingly, a

combination of a high nominal—interest—rate differential and a depreciation of

the currency, that seems to have prevailed in the U.S. during most of the 1970's

may have indicated a rise in inflationary expectations. Our analysis indicates

that under such circumstances an increase in the supply of money may not be

desirable. On the other hand, a combination of a high nominal interest—rate

differential and an appreciation of the currency that seems to have prevailed

since the latter part of 1979, may indicate a rise in the demand for money.

Under such circumstances accommodation by an expansionary monetary policy may

not be desirable (this argument draws on Prenkel and Mussa (1980, 1981) and

Frenkel (1981)).
                                    53




      This prescription that is based on the relation between exchange rates

and interest rates can also shed light on the recent controversy concerning the

proper conduct of US, monetary policy in view of the high rates of interest

that have prevailed since 1980. The relatively tight tnonetary policy which

accompanied the high nominal rate of interest in the U.S. was justified on the

grounds that the high nominal rate of interest was primarily due to high infla-

tionary expectations. As a counter argument it was argued that the prime reason

for the high nominal rate of interest was the high real rate rather than infla-

tionary expectations. Obviously, the two alternative prescriptions call for

fundamentally different monetary policies. To combat inflationary expectations

monetary policy had to be tight but to combat high real rates of interest a case

could be made for a more relaxed monetary policy.

     Here again the relation between the exchange rate and the rate of interest

can provide the monetary authority with information that can be helpful in solving

the tVsignalextractionhlproblem. By and large, since the latter part of 1979,

the high nominal rate of interest in the U.S. has been accompanied by an appre-

ciation of the dollar. This suggests that since late 1979 through the present

(end of 1982), the important factor underlying the evolution of the nominal rate

of interest in the U.S. has been the evolution of the real rate of interest

rather than inflationary expectations. Under such circumstances the U.S. monetary

policy could have afforded to be more relaxed while paying even more attention

to the underlying reasons for the high real interest rates.

        Several factors have contributed to the rise in real interest rates.

First, there have been large current and prospective budget deficits in the

United States and in Lhe rest of the world associated with large borrowing
                                 —54—



needs for government finance. Second, especially in the United States, the

disinflation policies and monetary tightness created liquidity shortage and

induced upward pressures on real rates of interest. Third, stagflation lowered

the hedging quality of bonds. With a weak economy and high inflation, the real

interest rate on bonds declines. For bonds to be more attractive to bondholders,

they must bear a higher real yield. Fourth, high real interest rates represent

a rise in the risk premium, attributable to several factors:   (a) the projected

rise in future budget deficits creates uncertainty about how these deficits will

be financed; (b) the volatility of monetary policy since late 1979 may have

induced a rise in the risk premium; and (c) the fragility of the world financial

system, the sequence of banking crises, the increased perception of sovereign

risk and increased sensitivity to large exposures, and the increased reluctance

to extend additional credit have all contributed to the rise in the risk pre-

mium and in real interest rates. This rise in risk has been reflected in the

increased spread between high— and low—quality bonds. Fifth, it has been argued

that changes in the laws dealing with the treatment of depreciation and in those

dealing with bankruptcies have also contributed to the rise in real interest rates.

      This perspective suggests that monetary policy can use the information

provided by the foreign exchange market to identify the source of variations

in nominal rates of interest. Thus, the external sector,while imposing severe

constraints on monetary policy, is also providing it with useful information.

                  V.   THE ROLE OF THE IMF AND INSTITUTIONAL REFORM



         The unprecedented heights of the real rates of interest in the

United States and in the rest of the world coupled with world recession and

with the debt explosion of developing countries, resulted in severe difficul—.

ties in world credit markets and have served to focus attention on the pro-

vision of international liquidity, credit, as well as on the role of the lender

of last resort.

         The responsibility of the lender of last resort is to step in and lend

(possibly at penalty rates) so as to ensure that credit markets do not dry.

How is this responsibility related to the IMP? Generally, the task of the

lender of last resort for domestic banks must be assumed by each central bank,

keeping in mind, of course, that its purpose is to protect depositors and

alleviate a state of panic without necessarily protecting stock holders. With

respect to the role and size of the fl4F, it is relevant to note that the Fund's

lending operations are secondary to its main responsibility of maintaining the

smooth operation of the international payment mechanism. The instrument which

the Fund has at its disposal is the various conditionality measures which it

uses as criteria for lending. The application of the Fund's conditionality

measures may provide a signal to potential lenders that the risk of lending to

the   countries in question has been reduced and, thereby, may open up the other-
wise closed credit lines. Of course, this operation may not be as smooth in
the   short run during which the Fund itself may need to step in and prevent the

drying up of credit lines to countries which are seriously illiquid. For such

cases there is indeed a serious argument for an increase in the IMP financial
                                    56




resources, and even possibly for the institution of some collaborative arrange-

ments between the IMF and the major commercial banks concerning the proper

provision of credits. If such resources are not provided, countries might be

tempted to regain monetary control through the imposition of protective

measures that aim at insulation.

       Indeed, world recession and rising unemployment have led to the dangerous

growth of protectionism and of inward—looking policies. These policies have

reflected themselves in the imposition of barriers to the international free

flow of goods and capital as well as in attempts to manipulate exchange rates.

These measures were introduced as countries attempted to diminish the con-

straints that the openness of the economy imposes on the effectiveness of policies.

       In principle, the legal framework necessary for the prevention of such

measures is partially in place. The principles and procedures for IMP sur-

veillance of exchange—rate policies should contribute to diminishing the number

of incidents of exchange—rate manipulation which are aimed at preventing effective

balance of payments adjustment. Likewise, the rules of GATT are intended to re-

duce the number of incidents of policy induced trade barriers. Consequently,

it is extremely important that such international institutions be strengthened.

       There is, however, a need for an important institutional reform that

would provide for a key addition to the GATT and to IMP surveillance. The GATT

deals with interventions that affect the trade account of the balance of pay-

ments, and IMF surveillance deals with interventions that affect exchange rates.

Under a clean float, however, any policy that affects the current account of

the balance of payments must also be fully reflected in the capital account, and

vice versa. It follows that capital—market interventions may have protectionist
                                  —57—



trade effects as severe as those resulting from the imposition of more conven-

tional trade barriers.17 A third agreement is therefore required to deal

directly with interventions that affect the capital account of the balance of

payments. Without a capital—account analogue to the GATT——which maybe called

GACF——(f or General Agreement on Capital Flows)——or without a proper extension

of the principles of surveillance to the broader range of monetary policies

and capital market interventions, efforts to reduce protectionism maybe futile

as countries attempt to regain monetary control through the imposition of

barriers to the free flow of capital.

        'An   additional variable which in principle should have been included

in the list of the determinants of reserve holdings is the opportunity cost

of holding reserves. In practice, a large fraction of international reserves

is held in the form of short term interest—bearing assets and thus, the

opportunity cost is the difference between the alternative yield and the rate

of return on reserves. Previous studies faced serious difficulties in

estimating this cost. Clark (1970a) decided to exclude this variable from

his estimation. Heller (1966) assumed that the cost was the same for all

countries (5 percent). Kenen and Yudin (1965) used income per capita as a

proxy, and found that it had the t1wrong" sign and was not significant.

Kelly (1970) used,in addition to per capita income, the value of foreign

assets and liabilities as proxies, but found that in all cases the latter

appeared with the "wrong" sign while in some cases the former had the "wrong"

sign. Courchene and Youssef (1967) used the long—term interest rate as a

proxy, and found that in five out of nine cases its coefficient was not

significantly negative. All these attempts taken together provided the

rationale for not including this variable in the estimating equations. For

an incorporation of the rate of interest into a stochastic framework see

Frenkel and   Jovanovic   (1981).


        2From the list of countries for which data were available, two

countries——Canada and the United States——were excluded from the analysis.

Canada was excluded since it had a flexible exchange—rate system during most
                                   59




of the period for which the variability measure. was calculated. Since the

discussion focuses on the behavior of countries as demanders of reserves,

the exclusion of the United States as the main supplier seems justified.


            is indicated in Appendix II, in order to obtain a variability

measure that is free of scale, the standard deviation of the trend—adjusted

changes in reserves was divided by the value of imports.


        4it is also noteworthy that in most cases the income elasticity of

reserve holdings is about unity and is estimated with great precision.     This

suggests that countries' size is an important determinant of reserve holdings.

The unitary elasticity suggests that the dependence of the reserves/income

ratio on the measures of variability and openness is similar to the dependence

of reserve holdings on these measures.

        5For this and other methods of analyzing switching regressions see

Goldfeld and Quandt (1976, Chs. 1, 4). The same procedure was used in

Frenkel (1978). The application in the present paper uses an extended data

base and, more importantly, employs a specification of the demand for

reserves in which reserves are measured in real terms and the variability

measure is free of scale.

         1t should be noted that the application of this method to the prob-

lem at hand is not without conceptual difficulties since it requires differ—
                                                   *
entiating the likelihood function with respect to t .  It should also be

noted that the analysis assumes that the structural change has taken place

at a given point in time. An alternative approach would allow for a gradual

evolution, and would estimate regression equations with variable coefficients.

For references and discussion of the properties of the distribution of

—2 Zn    see Goldfeld and Quandt (1976, Ch. 1).

           7The subsequent discussion builds on Frenkel and Hakkio (1980).


           8Setting       A =   0 does not imply, of course, that we ignore the
                           t

 time   specific factor since it is implicit in the estimates of p.1    and
                                                                              GLS


          9The high degree of accuracy of the forecasts based on the parameter

estimates from 1963—72 is especially remarkable in view of the significant

changes in the roles played by gross and net measures of reserves and in view

of the different practices concerning the valuations of gold. On the role of

gold and on estimates of the demand for non—gold reserves see von Furstenberg

(1982).


          10For a study reporting a relatively high speed of adjustment see,

however, Edwards (1980).

          11This formulation draws on my joint work (in progress) with John F.O.

Bilson. For a recent attempt to integrate monetary and reserves considerations

see Levi (1983).

          12
               For analyses of the effects of the move to floating exchange rates

on the demand for and the optimal provision of international reserves see

Grubel (1976), Makin (1974) and Williamson (1976).


          13The subsequent analysis draws on Frenkel (1983). My assignment for

this conference has been to deal with monetary control; therefore, the subsequent

discussion focuses on the role of monetary policy. This focus should not be

interpreted to argue that fiscal policy considerations are of a lesser impor-

tance. For an analysis of the constraints on fiscal policies see Frenkel and

tlussa (1981).

        14While these are the general characteristics of the adjustment process,

the details of the precise path are somewhat more complicated since the expected

transitional changes in the exchange rates will alter transitorily the rate of

interest. Along the path between E and D the domestic currency appreciates

and, if this appreciation is expected, the domestic rate of interest is below

the world rate due to interest arbitrage. Therefore, during the transition

period the desired ratio of money to equities will exceed the one described in

Figure 1. The new equilibrium is reached at point A when the exchange rate

reaches its new level, and when the domestic and the foreign rates of interest

are equalized.

      15The importance of the degree of capitalization and marketability of

claims to future income s'treams were analysed in the context of a closed

economy by Metzler (1951) and Mundell (1960).

        16The distinction between the roles of the real and the nominal rates

of interest has been emphasized by Frankel (1979). The framework underlying

equation (25) is based on Isard (1983). See also the discussion in Edwards

(1983). The interpretation of the empirical record in terms of the three

bracketed terms in equation (25) should be only viewed as suggestive since

in practice these terms represent endogenous variables that also need to be

explained along with the exchange rate in terms of the exogenous variables.

        17While the protectionist impacts of capital account interventions may

be as severe as those arising from conventional trade barriers, there are im-

portant differences between the two forms of protection. Capital account in-

tervention tends to result in a closer synchronization between expenditures

and income and, thereby, smaller current account imbalances. Trade interven-

tion might also affect the size of the current account but its pronounced ef-

fects may be reflected in the commodity composition of trade.

Definitions and Variables
         All data sources are from the IFS tape obtained from the International
Monetary Fund (the Decenter 1979 version for the developed countries, and the
May 1979 version for the less-developed countries), except as indicated. Data
for the developed countries have been updated to the August 1980 IFS book.

  R—     International Reserves are measured in real end-of-period 106 u.s.
         dollars, using the U.S. GNP deflator P. Reserves are defined as
         the sum of gold, SDRS, foreign exchange and reserve position at
         the Fund. When reserves are reported in local currency, they were
         converted to U.S. dollars using the end—of—period exchange rate.
  IN -   Imports are measured as cif in 10 U.S. dollars. When reported in
         local currency, they were converted to U.S. dollars                   using    the period
         average exchange rate.
  Y—     Real income. GNP and GDP are reported in local currency units.
         These figures were converted to real 1O9 U.S. dollars using the
         period   average exchange rate and              the   U.S. ON? deflator, P.
  m—     The average propensity to import was defined                    as the ratio of imports
         to ON?. When the latter was unavailable, GD?                    was used instead.
    -    The variability measure. To calculate the value of for year T
         for a given country, the following regression was first run with
         reserves        in nominal terms:

                Rt
                     =   c ÷ Tlt + u over t = T           —    l5,...,T—l

         (except     for 1963 for which,        due to lack of data,           is based on the
         previous 14 observations). Then using                  the   estimated trend
                                                                                        T-l'
         was defined as

                                       —        —
                         t=T—l4
                                  (R       R1
         Thus        is defined as the variance           of   the trend-adjusted changes in
         the stock of international reserves. A plot of the time—series of
         reserves revealed that the assumption of a linear trend seems more
         appropriate than that of an exponential trend. In order to obtain a
         measure of variability that is free of scale, our variability measure
         for period T is the ratio of the standard error of the trend-adjusted
         changes in reserves to the value of imports. Thus = TI'LMT.
