                                         ABSTRACT

This paper employs a stochastic frontier approach to examine how climate change and extreme
weather affect U.S. agricultural productivity using 1940-1970 historical weather data (mean and
variation) as the norm. We have four major findings. First, using temperature humidity index
(THI) load and Oury index for the period 1960-2010 we find each state has experienced different
patterns of climate change in the past half century, with some states incurring drier and warmer
conditions than others. Second, the higher the THI load (more heat waves) and the lower the
Oury index (much drier) will tend to lower a state’s productivity. Third, the impacts of THI load
shock and Oury index shock variables (deviations from historical norm fluctuations) on
productivity are more robust than the level of THI and Oury index variables across specifications.
Fourth, we project potential impacts of climate change and extreme weather on U.S. regional
productivity based on the estimates. We find that the same degree changes in temperature or
precipitation will have uneven impacts on regional productivities, with Delta, Northeast, and
Southeast regions incurring much greater effects than other regions, using 2000-2010 as the
reference period.

   Impacts of Climate Change and Extreme Weather on U.S. Agricultural Productivity:

                                    Evidence and Projection



       In the past four decades, the frequency of adverse weather events has increased (Parry et

al. 2007; IPCC, 2007; Hatfield et al., 2014). Bad weather can result in higher unit production cost

when producers try to mitigate the heat stress on animals or drought effects on crop production.

It can also widen the distance between observed production and the feasible production frontier,

and lower productivity estimates. According to USDA agricultural productivity statistics (USDA,

2015), in 2013 farm output was more than 2.7 times its 1948 level. With little growth in input use,

the growth of total factor productivity (TFP) accounted for nearly all output growth during that

period. However, TFP growth rates fluctuate considerably from year to year in response to

transitory events, mostly adverse weathers. Since there is a growing consensus that climate

change is occurring and the average daily temperature and the frequency of extreme weather are

likely to increase in the future (IPCC, EPA, NASA, 2015), how climate change or weather

fluctuation affect agricultural productivity or economic activity have gained much attention in

recent studies.


       In literature “weather” is usually used to address short-term variation of temperature or

precipitation while “climate change” is usually referred to as the average level changes of weather

outcomes (e.g., degree of temperature) that cover a long period of time. While climate change and

weather variation are two different issues, one phenomenon of climate change is the increasing

frequency of weather shocks (extreme weather). Therefore, it is critical to consider the case of

extreme weather in addressing the effect of climate on agricultural productivity.

                                                2
       There are three major streams of literature studying the relationship between climate

change/weather effect and economic activities. One body of work focuses on biophysical impacts

through examining the relationship between climatic factors and individual commodity production

or productivity, such as weather and crop yield or livestock production (e.g., Cobanov, and

Schnitkey, 2003; Schlenker and Roberts, 2009; Lobell, Schlenker, and Costa-Roberts, 2011;

Hatfield et al. 2014; St-Pierre, Cobanov and Schnitkey, 2003; and Key and Sneeringer, 2014). A

second body of work focusses on adaptive response at the individual/firm level through evaluating

how an individual farm/firm/person reacts to climatic impacts, such as a farmer’s behavior under

uncertainty (risk management, see Schimmelpfennig, 1996; Kim and Chavas, 2003; Falco and

Veronesi, 2013; Yang and Shumway, 2015.) The third stream of literature addresses impacts at a

regional/national/sectoral scale, considering both biophysical effects and adaptation. They are

usually done by quantifying the effects of climate/weather changes on aggregate economic

performance using country/regional level data (e.g., Sachs and Warner, 1997, Dell, Jones, and

Olken, 2009, Dell et al., 2012) or sectoral data (e.g., Malcom et al., 2012; Hatfield et al., 2014;

Marshall et al., 2015).


       In the literature on identifying climatic impacts on aggregate economic performance,

researchers either employ an empirical approach based on historical data, or utilize simulation

techniques to project economic responses to climate/weather shocks based on baseline projections

and scenarios analysis, especially in agricultural study. While projecting climatic impacts can be

useful for informing policy or making policy recommendations, empirical studies can help identify

the relationship between climate/weather and economic activities and provide statistical evidence

in explaining economic phenomenon. Empirical studies can rely on either time series data or cross-

                                                3
sectional data. Although the latter contain information on geospatial differences, the statistical

results may be biased if regionally specific characteristics are not taken into account, such as

irrigation areas (Schlenker, Hanemann and Fisher, 2006). The advantage of incorporating time

series is that it captures the impacts of climate change and the farmers’ adaption to these changes

over time. Nevertheless, it could fail to capture varied effects across regions. Panel data, on the

other hand, can preserve both desired features and avoid their weaknesses and has become a

preferred approach in recent studies.


       Literature on the impact of climate change on crop production has shown that while

moderate warming may benefit crop and pasture yields in temperate regions, further temperature

increase can reduce crop yields in all regions (Carter et al., 1996; Lobell and Asner, 2003;

Schlenker and Roberts, 2009; Tubiello and Rosenzweig, 2008.) In addition, some studies suggest

that higher variance in climate conditions lead to lower average crop yields and greater yield

variability (McCarl, Villaviencio, and Wu, 2008; Semenov and Porter, 1995; Ferris et al., 1998;

among others). Weather extremes can also cause disease outbreaks and influence agricultural

production (Yu and Babcock, 1992; Anyamba et al., 2014). In livestock studies, evidence indicates

that when animals’ thermal environment is altered due to climate change it could affect animal

health and reproduction. The feed conversion rate can also be affected (St-Pierre, Cobanov and

Schnitkey, 2003; Morrison 1983; Fuquay, 1981). Mukherjee, Bravo-Ureta, and Vries (2012) and

Key and Sneeringer (2014) indicate that an increase in temperature humidity index (THI) could

help to explain the technical inefficiency of dairy production based on a stochastic frontier estimate.

In an aggregate economy study, Dell, Jones, and Olken (2012) uses historical cross-countries data

to identify the relationship between temperature shocks and economic growth. They find climatic

                                                  4
effects vary across countries with different economic development stage. They suggest that in the

long run, countries may adapt to a particular temperature, mitigating the short-run economic

impacts.


       In light of recent development in the literature, in this paper we use state panel data to study

the impact of climate change and extreme weather on U.S. agricultural productivity empirically,

from the entire farm sector aspect (including both crop and livestock production.) One major

challenge on quantifying climatic effects on the aggregate sector is constructing appropriate

climatic variables. Although Dell, Jones, and Olken (2012) uses historical fluctuations in

temperature within countries to identify its effects on aggregate economic outcomes and find

significant results, our climate variables are not limited to temperature and also include

precipitation and humidity estimates as precipitation is relevant to crop production. Scientific

literature suggests that a heat stress that exceeds livestock’s optimal thermoneutral zone (THI load)

can reduce fertility, feed efficiency, weight gain, etc. (NRC, 1981; Fuquay 1981; Hansen et al.,

2001, and West 2003). THI load has been shown to be an effective measure in evaluating the

environmental effects on livestock. The Oury index, on the other hand, is an aridity index that

combines temperature and precipitation in the measurement, and is effective in connecting climatic

effects to crop growth (Oury 1965, Zhang and Carter, 1997). A lower Oury index indicates drier

conditions that would be less favorable to crop production. Drawing from the literature we use

historical temperature, humidity, and precipitation data to form a temperature-humidity-index

(THI) and an Oury index (an aridity index) to construct desired climatic variables that can either

reflect the annual changes in average weather outcome (mean level of THI and Oury indices) or

capture the unexpected extreme weather effects (shocks of THI and Oury indies that measure the

                                                  5
degree of deviations from their respective historical (1941-1970) annual variations).


       Using constructed climatic variables and aggregate economic data within states, we

examine the relationships between the climatic variables and regional agricultural productivity.

Given that there may be spatial heterogeneity problems, we also include state characteristics

variables—including irrigated area ratio, state level R&D, extension, and road infrastructure in

alternative model specifications in addition to using a fixed effect approach. We further conduct

scenario analysis to project how future temperature and precipitation changes, under climate

change expectations, affect agricultural productivity using 2000-2010 as the reference period.


       In this study, we have four major findings. First, using THI load and Oury indices we find

the patterns of climate change varied from region to region in the last half century (1960-2010)

with some states becoming drier or warmer while some states have little changes on average but

have become more volatile in more recent years. Second, using mean level of THI and Oury indices

we find that higher THI load and lower Oury index (much drier condition) will lower a state’s

productivity. However, the results become insignificant when more state characteristic variables

are incorporated in the model specifications. Third, using THI shock and Oury shock variables the

results are more robust across model specifications in both signs and coefficient estimates. Positive

THI shocks and negative Oury shocks will lower state technical efficiency. It suggests that over

the long run each state has gradually adapted to state-specific climate condition (the average level

of temperature and precipitation, and the degree of weather fluctuations). It is the unexpected

weather shocks that are affecting regional productivity more profoundly. Fourth, using weather

shock variables we project potential impacts of increasing temperature and extreme weather (the


                                                 6
expected climate change phenomenon) on U.S. regional productivity. Results show that the same

degree changes in temperature or precipitation will have uneven impacts on regional productivities,

with Delta, Northeast, and Southeast regions incurring much greater effects than the other regions,

using 2000-2010 as the reference period.


       This paper is the first empirical study, we think, to estimate the climatic effect on

agricultural productivity from the perspective of the entire farm sector, including both livestock

and crop production. The study adds new insight into identifying the climatic effects on overall

agricultural productivity. Our evidence suggests that weather shocks have more consistent and

profound impacts on regional productivity when each state faces its particular weather condition.

The diverse weather impacts on regional productivity from the same degree of changes in

temperature and precipitation suggest the need for state-specific research programs to help

producers manage their own climatic situations and future challenges.


       We organize the remainder of the paper as follows: Section 1 introduces the empirical

approach. Section II describes the data and variables, and provides descriptive statistics. Section

III presents the empirical results and discussion. Section IV reports the projection of regional

productivity based on climate change scenarios. Section V provides concluding remarks.


I. Empirical Framework


       Among the literature discussing climate and its economic impacts, some studies

incorporate climate variables along with other input variables in one production function to test

for the climatic effects on crop yield, livestock production, or productivity growth. However,


                                                 7
input use can be endogenous on the climate variable as producers may try to mitigate output

losses by increasing their expense on capital, energy, labor, or other intermediate inputs. To

resolve this problem there are a few studies that model weather variables as factors impacting

technical inefficiency (e.g., Key and Sneering, 2014). In a study of climatic effect on U.S. dairy

productivity Key and Sneeringer (2014) assert that operators in a region under adverse weather

conditions will operate further from the production frontier (i.e. be less technically efficient)

even when technology similar to what other operators in different regions have are available to

them. The study employs a stochastic production frontier approach in its estimates where climate

variables are incorporated as determinants of a one-sided error that drive farm production from

its production frontier. In this study, we employ the same approach to evaluate the potential

impacts of climate change and extreme weather on U.S. regional agricultural productivity.


       The stochastic frontier approach was first developed by Aigner, Lovell, and Schmidt

(1977) and Meeusen and van den Brocck (1977) and has been applied to numerous studies. In

earlier applications, researchers tried to explain those inefficiency effects by conducting a two-

stage approach that requires predicting the inefficiency effects first, then running a regression

model that relates the inefficiency effects and the explanatory variables in a second step. Using

cross-section data, Kumbhakar, Ghosh and McGuckin (1991), Reifschneider and Stevenson

(1991) and Huang and Liu (1994) later proposed models that allow the estimation of technical

inefficiency effects with parameters simultaneously estimated in the stochastic frontier function

and inefficiency model. Bassete and Coelli (1995) further proposed a model to estimate the

technical inefficiency effects in a stochastic frontier production function for panel data. Since

Wang and Schmidt (2002) has theoretically explained that two-step procedures are biased, in this

                                                  8
study we follow Key and Sneeringer (2014) to employ a one-step procedure to test the climatic

effects on regional productivity using a state panel data of 48 contiguous states for the period

1960-2004. Each state is treated as an individual producer facing its particular climate patterns,

state-specific characteristics, and resources.


        Under the stochastic frontier production function framework, the model can be expressed

as:


ln(yit)=f(xit, ß)+vit-uit              (1)


where yit is the observed aggregate output of state i at time t, and f(xit, ß) is the maximum output

that can be produced with a technology described by parameters ß (to be estimated), and a vector

of inputs xi. The deviations (εit) from the frontier are composed of a two-sided random error (vit)

and a one-side error term (uit≥0). 𝑣𝑖𝑡 is a random error that can be positive or negative, and is

assumed to be normally and independently distributed, with a zero mean and constant variance

of ơ2𝑣 . uit is assumed to be half-normally and independently distributed, uit~N+ (0, ơ2𝑢 ).


        In a one-step approach we assume the technical inefficiency component is

heteroskedastic, that the variance ơ2𝑢𝑖 depends on a vector of exogenous variables zi and a set of

parameters γ (to be estimated), such as climate variables and state-specific characteristics that

can affect the individual state’s ability of adopting the best technology given its inputs level.


        ơ2𝑢𝑖 =exp(𝒛′𝒊 γ)               (2)


        Therefore, zi affect the mean and variance of the inefficiency term ui. If ui =0, then state i

                                                   9
is at the production frontier and is technically efficient. If ui >0 then state i is deviated from the

frontier, and is technically inefficient. The technical efficiency of state i (TEi) is defined as the

ratio of the ith state’s observed output to its feasible output (the maximum output it can produce

with given inputs). Once the technical inefficiency ui is estimated, technical efficiency (TEit) can

be obtained by the following formulas:


              𝑦𝑖
TEit=exp(𝑓(𝒙                  =exp(-uit)   (3)
               𝒊𝒕 ,ß)+𝑣𝑖𝑡 )




TEit ranges between 0 and 1 with 1 being on the frontier. In this study the empirical stochastic

frontier production function to be estimated is as follows:


                                                 𝐽
ln𝑦𝑖𝑡 = ß0 + ∑𝐾                                   𝑁
              𝑘=1 ß𝑘 𝑙𝑛 𝑥𝑘𝑖𝑡 + ß𝑡 𝑡+∑𝑗=1 ß𝑗 𝐷𝑗 + ∑𝑚=1 ß𝑚 𝐷𝑚 + 𝑣𝑖𝑡 − 𝑢𝑖𝑡                             (4)


where yi is an implicit quantity of state i’s total output; xki’s are implicit quantities of state i’s k

inputs, including labor, capital, land, and intermediate goods; t is a time trend to capture natural

technical changes driven by research development from both public and private sectors (public

R&D and private R&D) over time; Dj’s are state dummy variables (j=1…47), and Dm’s are time

dummy variables (m=1..43) to capture cross-state, time-invariant, unobserved heterogeneity. The

time dummy can also help reflect part of the development of technical change effects driven by

the overall knowledge stock that are not captured by the time trend but could have shifted the

overall production frontier unevenly across years. Equation (4) can be viewed as a log-linearized

form of the Cobb-Douglas (C-D) production function3. We estimate an inefficiency variance


3
  While translog form is a more flexible form, given that the preferred curvature condition cannot hold globally
using this form we chose the C-D functional form to approximate the underlying technology of the production
frontier in this study.

𝑙𝑛ơ2𝑢𝑖𝑡 = γ0 + ∑𝑁                              2
                𝑛=1 𝛾𝑛 𝑧𝑛𝑖𝑡 + 𝜔𝑖𝑡 ; 𝜔𝑖𝑡 ~𝑁(0, 𝜎𝜔 )           (5)


       z’s include climate variables, irrigation-ready land density that may help to mitigate the

impacts of adverse weather, and other control variables that capture the heterogeneity of

individual state.


       We include various forms of climate variables in our estimation, including THI load (for

livestock) and Oury index (an aridity index for crops), in their mean or “shock” (the unit of

standard deviation from its historical norm) measures. We also include state—specific

characteristics variables that may affect each state’s technical efficiency, including R&D stock,

extension capacity, and road density as these variables are suggested to have impacts on state

level productivity in the literature (Alston et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012; and Jin and Huffman,

2015 among others). We will explain how we construct those variables in the next section. The

stochastic frontier is estimated by a maximum likelihood (ML) procedure.


II. Variables, Data Sources, and Descriptive Analysis


       In this paper we employ a panel of state level aggregate agricultural output, as well as

inputs of labor, capital, land, and intermediate goods to form the stochastic frontier production

function. To identify the impacts of climate change on technical inefficiency changes we

construct climate variables that can capture either the impacts on crops or livestock production.

We also construct irrigated land area ratio and other local public goods variables—R&D,

extension, capacity and roads density—as control variables to test for the robustness of the
                                                11
climatic effects on state inefficiency.

Agricultural output and inputs

We draw state-specific aggregates of output and capital, labor, intermediate goods, and land

inputs from USDA’s state productivity accounts. Agricultural output and four inputs are implicit

quantities measurement based on the Törnqvist indexes approach over detailed output and input

information. A full description of the underlying data sources and aggregation procedures can be

found in Ball et al. (1999) and the USDA-ERS (2016) website.

Climate variables

       Since our purpose is to estimate an overall impact of climate changes on the agricultural

sector we need to consider climate variables that have strong relationships with livestock or

crops. However, there is no single measurement that can capture the weather impacts on both

livestock and crops as livestock production is more related to animals’ year-around thermal

environment, while crop production is affected by precipitation and temperature during the

growing seasons. In addition, researchers have found nonlinear temperature effects for

agriculture (Deschenes, and Greenstone (2007), and Schlenker and Roberts (2009)). To meet our

objective, we construct two different weather measures to capture their effects on either livestock

or crops. One is temperature-humidity index (THI), a combined measure of temperature and

relative humidity that has been shown to have significant impacts on livestock production; and

one is the Oury index, an aridity index that combines temperature and precipitation information

that can capture more impact on crop production than a single measure of temperature or

precipitation. We draw monthly temperature and precipitation data at the county level from a


                                                12
weather dataset produced by Oregon State University’s PRISM4 climate group (Daly et al.

2008). Since PRISM extrapolates between weather stations to generate climate estimates for

each 4km grid cell in the U.S. we are able to link county level weather information and

agricultural production to construct climate variables that could explain climate variations across

regions and over time.

         Livestock scientists have found that livestock productivity is related to climate through a

THI measure (Thom 1958, St-Pierre, Cobanov and Schnitkey 2003; Zimbelman, et. al. 2009).

THI can be measured using the following equation:

THI=(dry bulb temperature oC) + (0.36*dew point temperature oC) + 41.2                              (6)

         When animal stress is above a certain THI threshold, productivity declines. Following St-

Pierre, Cobanov and Schnitkey (2003) and Key and Sneeringer (2014) we generate a minimum

and maximum THI for each month and location based on minimum and maximum dry bulb

temperatures and dew point data from PRISM. To estimate the THI load, the number of hours

that the location has a THI above the threshold, we employ a method proposed by St-Pierre,

Cobanov and Schnitkey (2003) to estimate a Sine curve between the maximum and minimum

THI over a 24-hour period. We then estimate the number of hours and degree to which THI is

above threshold5 (See Key and Sneering (2014) appendix for details). To construct state-level

animal units derived from the Census of Agriculture (USDA, 2002) as the weight.

        “Weather” is a critical factor influencing the production of crops. While precipitation and

temperature are mostly considered in previous studies due to lack of information on other

factors, such as sunshine and wind velocity, Oury (1965) recommended the use of aridity index

in identifying the relationship between crop production and weather. Oury argued that it is hard

to define a meaningful relationship between crop production and weather based only on one

weather factor since they are interrelated. The proposed aridity index, which is termed the Oury

index, is defined (Oury, 1965; Zhang and Carter, 1997) as:

                                    𝑃
                          𝑊𝑠 = 1.07𝑠𝑇𝑠                                                            (6)


where W represents the aridity index (Oury idex), s is the month (s=1…12), Ps is the total

precipitation for month s in millimeters; and Ts is the mean temperature for month s in degrees

Celsius. The Oury index can be viewed as rainfall normalized with respect to temperature. We

draw county-level monthly temperature and precipitation data from PRISM to aggregate up to a

state level Oury index, using county cropland density drawn from National Land Cover Database

2006 (NLCD 2006) as the weight. The NLCD cropland pixels are composed of the combination

of NLCD classes 81 (pasture/hay) and 82 (cultivated crops), with the notion that pasture/hay is a

potentially convertible land cover to cultivated crops. The cropland area in the weight data is

therefore a representation of current and potential cultivated cropland.



6
  Climate estimates were limited only to cropland areas as defined by the combination of the Cultivated Crops and
the Pasture/Hay classes in the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD 2006). Therefore, it eliminates the effect of
urban heat islands, mountains, etc.

       While all months of the year were considered for the THI measures, only the primary

growing season months, approximately April through August, were considered for the Oury

aridity index. Both THI and Oury measures were generated for a 30-year normal spanning from

1941 to 1970 and for individual years from 1961 to 2004 (our study period).

Irrigation-ready land density (irrigation ratio) variable

Irrigation infrastructure can help to mitigate the impact of adverse weather. We construct an

irrigation-ready land density (irrigation ratio thereafter) variable to capture the impact of

irrigation system availability in production. The variable is constructed as the ratio of land area

with irrigation system to total cropland area. The cropland area and land area with irrigation

system are available for census years (USDA-NASS, 2013) on the state level. We employ a

cubic spline technique to interpolate the information between census years. The expanded

irrigated areas and cropland areas are used to construct a panel of irrigation-ready density

(irrigation ratio) variable across states and over time.

R&D, Extension, and Roads

To capture specific state characteristics that could have also impacted the state’s technical

inefficiency we included state level variables on public R&D stock, extension, and roads. The

annual agricultural research expenditure data and the research price index used to deflate

expenditures are provided by Huffman (2009). Extension variable is a measure of extension

capacity calculated as total full-time equivalent (FTE) extension staff divided by the land areas.

Data on FTEs by state were drawn from the Salary Analysis of the Cooperative Extension

Service from the Human Resource Division at the USDA. Road infrastructure is a road density

land area.

III. Patterns of state productivity growth and climate changes

           Table 1 provides a summary table of state level TFP growth during 1960-20047 (USDA,

2015), as well as the mean and standard deviation of the normal THI index and Oury index over

the historical period 1941-1970. In general, TFP growth varied across USDA’s production

regions and within the region. Still, some regions seem to have an overall higher TFP growth,

such as Northeast, Corn Belt, and Delta regions, than others during the study period. Given the

variances in geo-climate condition and natural resources, states tend to have notable differences

in their composition of livestock and crop production. For example, states in the Northeast region

tend to have a higher ratio of livestock production while the Corn Belt and Pacific regions tend

to produce more crops than livestock. Usually, a higher THI indicates more intensive heat stress

and can hinder livestock productivity growth. On the other hand, a lower Oury index indicates a

much drier condition that would lower crop production. If the Oury index is lower than 20, it

indicates a very dry situation that could be seen as a drought condition, and if the Oury index is

less than 10, it implies a “desertlike” state (Carter and Zhang, 1997).

                                               (Insert table 1 here)

           While the relative level of THI and Oury index could result in geospatial differences in

technical inefficiency, an unexpected climate “shock”, such as extreme weather, could cause

more of an impact as farmers will have expected climate changes to be similar to the past.

    USDA’s state productivity indexes only cover the period 1960-2004.
                                                         16
Farmers could have already invested in appropriate facilities, such as irrigation systems or

cooling systems, in areas with low Oury index or high THI load. It is the unexpected weather

changes that result in the inefficient inputs use as yields decline (or a waste of inputs when crops

cannot be harvested due to an extreme weather event), as well as a decrease in livestock

production due to unexpected heat stress. According to table 1, some regions may have much

higher variation in their Oury index than in their THI index, such as the Mountain and Pacific

regions. If famers expect dramatic variation from year to year in advance, they may have already

invested in an irrigation system to damper the impacts of climate changes on farm production.

       TFP growth estimates usually move closely with output growth. In 1983 and 1995, the

dramatic impacts from adverse weather events caused significant drops in both output and TFP

(figure 1). In figure 2 we map the normal Oury index, based on 1941-1970 data, and Oury

indexes in 1983 and 1995 at the state level. We find that Oury index varied for many states in

1983 and 1995 while the shocks (figure 3) from its norm show a different picture regarding

climate changes.

                           (Insert Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3 here)

       Figure 4 presents the normal THI load (1941-1970), as well as the THI indexes in 1983

and 1995 across states. When compared with the Oury index, however, THI load shows less

variation over time. Nevertheless, if we look at the maps of shock indexes in different years (figure

5) we may find that there are noticeable differences over the years.

                                (Insert Figure 4 and Figure 5 here)




                                                 17
       If bad weather is expected and farmers invested in facilities to reduce the potential damage

from adverse weather conditions, then the impacts of extreme weather on farm production could

decline. Figure 6 shows irrigation density changes over time. In general, pacific regions and

mountainous regions have more intensive irrigation systems than other regions.

                                       (Insert Figure 6 here)


IV. Empirical results

       We first estimate equation (4) and test the hypothesis of no inefficiency effects that H0:

𝜎𝑢2 = 0, against the alternative hypothesis of H1: 𝜎𝑢2 > 0. The result shows that the null hypothesis

is rejected at the 1% level indicating the stochastic frontier approach is valid in our study. We then

estimate the stochastic frontier model (equation (4)) and the inefficiency determinants regression

model (equation (5)) simultaneously using alternative weather variables and model specifications

as a robustness check. Empirical results of both production regression and inefficiency

determinants regression are presented in table 2. Model 1 and 2 evaluate climatic effects on state

inefficiency by only including weather variables and irrigation density variable as inefficiency

determinants. Besides weather variables and irrigation ratio variable, Model 3 and 4 also

incorporate state specific variables—public R&D stock, extension capacity, and road density

variables—as control variables to check the robustness of the estimated climatic impacts on state

inefficiency. The differences between Model 1 and 2 and between Model 3 and 4 are the measures

of weather variables. Model 1 and 3 use mean levels of THI and Oury indexes while Model 2 and

4 use THI shocks and Oury index shocks as weather variables. Since outputs and inputs are all in

natural logarithmic terms, the input coefficients can be interpreted as the output elasticity for

individual inputs. According to the estimates of production function on the top section of table 2,
                                                 18
the output elasticities for specific input across four models are consistent, with the output elasticity

of intermediate goods at its highest, about 0.6, and capital’s output elasticity at its lowest, about

0.07-0.08. Since the hypothesis of constant return to scale is rejected, we can infer a decreasing

return to scale with input coefficients totaling to less than one.


                                         (Insert Table 2 here)


       The signs of the coefficients of weather variables are as expected and consistent no

matter the measures. Results of the inefficiency determinants regressions indicate that the

combined effects of higher temperature and lower precipitation that result in a higher THI load,

or a lower Oury index measure can drive state production away from its best performance.

However, without controlling for state-specific variables the coefficient of THI load becomes

insignificant in Model 1. According to the results, a single unit increase in THI load could result

in a worse inefficiency, with inefficiency term (lnσu2 ) increasing by 0.00002 percent in Model 1

and 0.00006 percent in Model 3. On the other hand, one unit decrease in Oury index (drier

condition) could cause further inefficiency, with inefficiency term increasing by 0.026 percent in

Model 1 and 0.02 percent in Model 3. Using “shock” measures (units of standard deviations

relative to historical norms) of THI load and Oury index as weather variables in Model 2 and

Model 4, the estimates are all significant and the magnitudes of those coefficients are consistent

between the two models. According to both models, a single unit shock of THI load will result in

about a 0.3 percent deterioration in the inefficiency term while a unit of negative shock (drier

condition) will result in about a 0.18 percent deterioration in the inefficiency term.


       The results show that the deviation from the state’s historical norm in weather variations
                                                  19
have more consistent impacts on state production efficiency than the mean level changes of

weather variables. It implies that farmers in a region with more temperature or precipitation

variations may have adapted more to the environment by adopting technologies or practices that

can mitigate the damages from adverse weather. For example, drier regions, such as California

and Nevada, usually have higher irrigation-ready land density than other regions and that may

partially offset the negative impacts of bad weather. The negative coefficients of irrigation ratio

indicate that a state with a higher density in irrigation-system-ready land areas tends to be closer

to its best production performance when holding other factors constant. After controlling for

state-specific characteristics the irrigation density’s impacts on inefficiency are also larger in

Models 3 and 4.


       The signs of the coefficient estimates of state-specific control variables—R&D stock,

extension, road density are consistent with the literature, wherein higher knowledge capital

(R&D stock), extension capacity, and road density can enhance individual state’s productivity

and push its production toward its best performance using given inputs and the best technology.

Since R&D, Extension, and Road density variables are all in natural log (Ln) form, a 1% percent

increase in road density and extension capacity may have higher impacts on improving technical

inefficiency than a 1% increase in local R&D stock. This implies that while public R&D stock

can contribute to overall technical changes by pushing up the general production frontier for all

states, its contribution in improving a local state’s inefficiency may be less than that of other

local public goods. The state extension activity and intensified road infrastructure can help to

disseminate knowledge, reduce transportation cost, and improve a state’s technical efficiencies

by catching up with others.

                                                  20
        Based on the results from Model 4 we estimate Box-and-Whisker plots of individual

states’ inefficiencies. The mean and distribution of states’ inefficiency scores and rankings are

presented in figure 7. We find that over the study period, California ranks first in efficiency,

making it the most productive state among all 48 contiguous states. The top six most efficient

states also include Arizona, Florida, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and New York. According to

the predicted inefficiency scores, individual states’ productivity is strongly affected by its state-

specific characteristics such that even with similar weather patterns and natural resources

productivity can differ significantly8.

V. Potential Impacts of Future Climate Change on U.S. Agricultural Production: Scenario

    Analysis

       To estimate the heat stress- and drought-related production losses attributable to climate

change (mean level changes) and extreme weather (weather shock), we simulate the climate

change projections in temperature and precipitation in the 2030s that result in various THI load

and Oury index estimates. There are many global models projecting future climate changes, and

while the magnitudes of future temperature or precipitation may be different from one projection

to another, the direction of the projections consistently point toward more frequent heat waves,

warmer temperatures, and increasing incidences of extreme weather. Key and Sneeringer (2014)

project the potential impacts of climate changes on U.S. dairy production in 2030 based on four


8
  The results could also imply that if the major Federal/State water storage and allocation system that helped
support the high-valued irrigated agricultural sector in California is not to be as resilient in future years under
prolonged drought conditions due to absent significant new capital investment California may not be as efficient as
in the past.

climate change scenarios drawn from the projections of four General Circulation Models—

CNR, ECH, CSIRO, and MORPC (see Key and Sneeringer (2014) data appendix for details).

Under their scenarios temperature change during the period of 2010-2030 ranges from 0.65oC to

1.38oC. According to EPA9, earth's average temperature has risen by 0.83°C over the past

century, and is projected to rise another 0.3 to 4.8°C over the next hundred years. According to

the U.S. Global Change Research Program Report (USGCRP 2014)10, the overall temperatures

will continue to warm over the century in the U.S. with a projected average increase by the end

of the century of approximately 3.9 to 6.1° C under the high emission scenario and 2.2 to 3.6°C

under the low emission scenario. We draw information from various projected trends in future

temperature and precipitation changes to form three scenarios from mild to extreme. The

scenarios are as follows:

Scenario 1: we assume a mild climate change during the growing season of the 2030s with a 1°C

              increase relative to 1940-1970 temperature levels ;


Scenario 2: we assume a more serious climate change scenario in the 2030s with a 2°C increase

              relative to 1940-1970 temperature levels;

              increase and one-inch decrease in monthly average precipitation relative to 1940-70

              levels.


         We estimate the production response as if there are no changes in prices, input use,

technology, or farm practice11. The projections are conducted using Model 4 estimates where

weather variables are shocks of THI load and Oury index with state-specific control variables

kept constant as in the following equation:


     𝑙𝑛ơ2𝑢𝑖𝑡 = γ0 + 𝛾1 𝑧𝑇𝐻𝐼𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑐𝑘 ,𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾2 𝑧𝑂𝑢𝑟𝑦𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑐𝑘, 𝑖𝑡 + 𝑟3 𝑧𝑖𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜,𝑖𝑡 + 𝑟4 𝑙𝑛𝑅𝐷𝑖𝑡 + 𝑟5 𝑙𝑛𝐸𝑇𝑖𝑡 +
     𝑟6 𝑙𝑛𝑅𝑂𝑖𝑡 + 𝜔𝑖𝑡 ; 𝜔𝑖𝑡 ~𝑁(0, 𝜎𝜔2 )      (7)
                Since each state has its own genuine pattern of historical climatic variations, each

                 could have adjusted its farm production by adopting various production practices

                 or technologies to adapt to the weather it is facing (Shumway et al. 2015, Huang,

                 Wang, and Wang, 2015; Marshall et al. 2015; Heisey and Day-Rubinstein 2015).

                 Therefore, the unexpected same degree change in temperature and precipitation

                 may have different impacts on individual state’s THI shock and Oury index shock

                 estimates, resulting in varying effects on state production efficiency estimates.

                 The impact of temperature changes on estimated state inefficiency can be derived

                 by taking the first derivative of equation (7) with respect to temperature changes

                 as follows:

  This is so-called “dumb farmer” (a naïve case) assumption (Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, and Shaw (1994); Key and

conditions. The impacts may be reduced by allowing for some level of adaptation by producer.

          The impact of precipitation changes on state inefficiency can be derived by taking the

first derivative of equation (7) with respect to precipitation changes as follows:


𝜕𝑙𝑛ơ2𝑢𝑖           𝜕𝑙𝑛ơ2𝑢𝑖         𝜕𝑍𝑂𝑢𝑟𝑦𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑐𝑘 ,𝑖

          We predict the potential impacts of three climate change scenarios in the 2030s on state

production inefficiency using the average weather conditions during 2000-10 as the baseline.

The results are reported in table 3 and are grouped by production region (see notes in table 3 for

region details). All regions will move further away from the production frontier with increasing

temperature and declining precipitation. On average, a 1o C increase in temperature will cause

the production efficiency to decrease by 0.38 % in Pacific region and by 1.31% in Delta region

relative to the 2000-10 mean inefficiency level (𝑙𝑛𝜎𝑢2 ) (see table 3). When temperature increases

by 2oC the production efficiency will decrease further, ranging from by 0.73 % in Pacific region
                                                                         24
to 3.23% in Delta region relative to the 2000-10 mean inefficiency level (𝑙𝑛𝜎𝑢2 ) .


       The results imply that the impacts of temperature changes on production efficiencies are

not linear and vary across regions. According to the coefficient of variation (CV) estimates the

weather impacts are more consistent within the Lake States region and the Northern Plains

region than in other regions. While the temperature changes seem to cause a more serious impact

on the Delta region, the variation is also the largest within that region. Several factors can cause

these differences, including different historical climate patterns in those states and varying

degrees of irrigation development. Under scenario 3 (extreme weather), the temperature

increases by 2oC and precipitation decreases by 1 inch on average, and the impacts are more

consistent for states within the same region as the CV declines in almost all regions when

compared to scenario 2 (medium weather impact). This indicates that extreme weather, which is

beyond the expected climatic change pattern, can have more disastrous effects on all states.


                                        (Insert table 3 here)


       Responses of agricultural productivity to climate change (mean level changes of Oury

index and THI load) and extreme weather shocks (deviations from historical average variations of

Oury index and THI load) can inform agricultural policy decisions. For example, while farmers

are expected and sometimes observed to adapt to the shifting long-run climate pattern, Dell, Jones,

and Olken (2014) argue that certain governmental agricultural support programs (such as

subsidized crop insurance program) could have reduced farmers’ incentives to adapt. Therefore,

there could be a tradeoff between reducing farmers’ revenue risk and increasing agricultural

productivity. The diverse weather impacts on regional productivity from a certain degree of
                                                 25
temperature and precipitation changes suggest the need for state-specific research programs to help

producers manage their state-specific climatic situations and future climate change challenges. To

help agriculture adapt to climate change, Heisey and Day-Rubenstein (2015) suggest the use of

genetic resources to develop new crop varieties that are more tolerant to both abiotic and biotic

stresses. However, they also indicate that given the public-goods characteristics of genetic

resources there can be obstacles for private research and development. Creating incentives for the

private sector through intellectual property rules for genetic resources and international agreements

governing genetic resource exchanges could promote greater use of genetic resources for climate

change adaptation.


VI. Summary and Conclusions


       This paper employs state panel data for the period of 1960-2004 to identify the role of

climate change on U.S. agricultural productivity using a stochastic frontier production frontier

method. Climate/weather variables are measured using the THI load and Oury index at both their

mean levels and the degree of deviation from the historical variation norms (during 1941-1970)

at the state level. We also incorporate the irrigated land area ratio and the measures of local

public goods—R&D, extension, and road infrastructure—to capture the effects of state

characteristics and to check for the robustness of the estimate of climate variable impact.


       The state production data and climate information show noticeable variations across and

within production regions. Some regions seem to have faster overall TFP growth – the Northeast,

Corn Belt, and Delta regions – than others during the study period. Results indicate that higher

THI load can drive farm production away from its best performance. However, higher Oury
                                                 26
index, irrigated land area ratio, local R&D, Extension, and road density can enhance state farm

production and move it closer to the production frontier. Although the relative level of THI and

Oury index could result in geospatial differences in technical inefficiency, the unexpected

extreme weather “shock” seems to have more robust impacts on estimated inefficiency, and this

could be because farmers expect some degree of weather variation based on past experience and

would have already made preparations. Therefore, it is the unexpected climatic shocks that result

in either an increased use of input, or a drop in production.


       While most studies evaluating the climatic effect on agricultural productivity focus on

specific crop or livestock commodities, it is also important to identify the climatic effect on

overall agricultural productivity by region through its impacts on technical inefficiency.

Responses of agricultural productivity to climate change at the state level can then inform state-

specific agricultural policy decisions.
