        This paper considers why non-monetary         means of exchange,    such as barter and the


reciprocation of favors, are chosen by firms despite the usual benefits of monetary transactions. We

consider   the chosen    means of exchange     when both monetary and non-monetary        exchange

mechanisms are available. We illustrate three potential reasons for the emergence of non-monetary


trade. First, a willingness to barter may reveal information that cannot be revealed solely through


monetary trade.     Second, non-monetary trade may constrain the ability of agents to engage in


inefficient rent-seeking activities.   Finally, non-monetary trade improves the ability of agents to


impose trade sanctions on those who act dishonestly. We consider a number of applications of each


of these ideas.

1          Introduction

Firms often             use means of exchange                        which are non-monetary,                      settling      debts      through         some sort of

contemporaneous                  barter arrangement                    or promise of future repayment-in-kind                            rather than by money.

This preference                for non-monetary                exchange          occurs despite standard                 economic          logic on the virtues ‘of

money,         which has the advantage                         of achieving            a double        coincidence          of wants (Jevon’s              [1875]’).     The

purpose         of this paper is to discuss why firms and their employees                                              use such non-monetary                      means of

exchange.’

       Let IIS begin by listing the range of trades which we consider.                                               First, considerable                trade occurs M

a direct        contractible          swap of goods,              where good A is exchanged                          either cent emporaneously                    for good

B or a l]ronlise               of good         B in the future.                  The inefficiencies            inherent       in such barter             arrangements

    11n other         work,    we consider          the effects      of non-monetary            exchange      on relationships       between        individuals     in social
seltings;      see Prenderg=t             and Stole      [1992,1996c]         For the most         part,    the theories      considered      in these     papers      do not

see this essay as the start of a broader               investigation       designed    to understand         the optimal      means of

exchange      in the economy,       In describing     the reasons for non-monetary              trade, we exclude a few obvious

reasons why agents would prefer to transact in non-monetary                        units. First, in some circumstances              non-

monetary       trade is more efficient than monetary               trade because       of the costs of contracting            explicitly

with money.        For example,       employees       are routinely      given minor job perks such as free local phone

calls during breaks in addition           to their wages. The most likely explanation                   is that such perks would

have been explicitly        purchased          with money     by almost       all employees        if a monetary     payment        were

required,     so the firm finds it simpler          to offer them as part of a standard                employee     package      with a

slightly lo~ver wage. Another           reason for non-monetary             trade which we exclude from our study is the

cost of coordination        and delay which would emerge if a firm used a decentralized                         price-breed     market

system      to allocate   resources     rather using its centralized           authority.5      In such an internal        “command

economy”       setting.   non-monetary          exchange    minimizes      transactions      costs, but in a rather direct way,

and so are ignored in our study.               Finally, in some circumstances,            agents simply don’t        have money to

trade, so that sonle form of non-monetary                  trade is technologically       efficient.    None of our analysis will

rely on Such liqlliditj’        constraints.

    1$’e l)a~,e organized       the paper around three themes which provide economic                      reasons why firms may

ljref’er to exchange      through      goods     and services rather than money, despite                 the obvious     deadweight

loss fronl tile possible        absence of double        coincidence      of wants.




      Theme         1: Non-Monetary              Trade     Reveals       Information         Not    Conveyed       By Mon-
      etary      Trade


    Our first theme, explored           in Section 2, illustrates         that a willingness       to barter may serve to reveal

(or conceal)     information       in a way that cannot occur with purely monetary                     trade. We begin in section

2.1 11~’noting      that barter      may act as a means of secret price cuts when it is difficult                       or illegal to

offer discounts,      Therefore,       barter may be a means of concealing                information        about prices.      Second,

Section     2.2 addresses       the role of reciprocal       trade analogous        to product      bundling,     for which Adams

and Yellen [1976] and McAfee,             McMillan       and W’hinston       [1989] have illustrated      that a monopolist         may

raise profits by offering bundles of goods at price discounts                     in addition      to pricing goods    individually.

Ill this subsection,      barter (through         bundled trades) reduces the aggregate uncertainty                   over a trading

partner’s     surplus in a way that increases firm profits. Third, we show that barter exchanges                              can act as

                                                                     2
a means of price discrimination.              Section 2.3 describes      how barter may indeed succeed in segmenting

the market.       Finally, a common         form of trade agreement        between developed          and developing     countries

is where the developing           country     buys technology       from a developed         country,    but only on condition

that the developed           country buys back output.         Such trades are called buy-backs.            Section 2.4 provides

a simple interpretation          of these arrangements        where a willingness        to barter reveals information         about

the quality of inputs.



         Theme      2: Non-Monetary             Trade       May   Constrain         Inefficient      Rent-Seeking


    Our second        theme in understanding          an attraction     of non-monetary           barter is that is may restrict

tile ability     of agents      to rent-seek.     Section     3.1 draws on Ellingsen          and Stole      [1996],   where    it is

argued that hart er may restrict firms form causing monopoly                       pricing distortions.     This arises because

the crlldeness      of barter     may paradoxically         increase trades,       which may more than offset the usual

disadvantages       of barter.        We conclude       the paper      in Section     3.2 by showing        that    non-monetary

transfers      n]ay Yestrict rent-seeking        by reducing      inefficient    plays for power.       In particular,    a recent

llaper I)} R aj an a]ld Zingales         [1995] notes that a division           may choose not to invest on projects            if it

llle;~ns tlla( ]llolle~’ goes to other divisions,         which can be used to harm the its interests.                 As a result,

         Theme      3: Non-Monetary             Trade       Improves     Trading        Sanctions


    ()1 11 final t hemp follows from the observation               that many trades are hard to verify and must be

s{’11’-f’llforcillg, often    through   the threat of exclusion         from future       trade in the event that an agent

atts {Iishollestly.       We begin in Section        4, by considering          the role of reciprocity     of favors of various

goods.      Ille consider,     for example,     whether     a firm should        allow its agents to trade money          between

tllelnselves     ill lieu of services provided.         We show that firms may prefer to ban monetary                     transfers

becallse if some trades are monetized,             it reduces the costs of acting dishonestly              on other dimensions.

The reason for this is that if money              is available,    an individual       or division    that acts inefficiently      to

maximize       its short-run     gain at the expense of its trading partner can no longer be credibly                     excluded

from all future trading activity.           Therefore,      trading sanctions       are reduced by the existence         of money.

     Sanctions     in relationships     can be provided       not only by exclusion        from the relationship       but also by

possibly     destroying       bonds   which the agents have put up. Section                4.2 addresses     how non-monetary

bonds      can aid the development            of relationships,     once again by affecting           credible   trade sanctions.


                                                                   3
Consider       a situation           where an individual             would like to join an organization                        or trading relationship

and is willing to pay to do so. What                           can he offer to gain admission?                       Our central point here is that

the only credible            currency       is likely to be non-monetary                      because         cash hostages        are too tempting            to

consume.




2      Non-Monetary                          Exchange                    Reveals             Information

A useful property              of trading         goods      for money          is the informativeness                of the resulting          prices.      Not

2.1         Barter      to     Co~lceal           Effective        Prices

It is generally        more difficult to discern transaction                         prices with barter than from monetary                        exchanges.

Barter transact ions differ from monetary                            exchange          in that they reveal only relative prices and not

absolute      prices.      .4 market observer,              for example,         may have difficulty               verifying     the effective       absolute

price being cllargccl by a firm if the good received                                  in kind is substantially               differentiated       so that no

ac(llratc’     market price exists.                As such, barter is an attractive                       alternative        to a firm that wishes to

s[l(retly lolver its effective            price without           detection.

gro~lljs would otherwise               have recourse           (e.g., because           of L4FN agreements                 or the incre=ed         likelihood

of arbitrage).          Barter        may allow for such secret price discounting.                                  Caves      [1974] has argued           that

bilateral     international           trade agreements            serve this purpose.i                 Later work by Caves and Marin [1992]

makes a similar argument                   that countertrade              can be used to third-degree                       price discriminate.           They


    ‘iIn the United        Statesl    for example,     price    discrimination         is illegal    under    the Robinson-Patman         Act     whenever    its

he has the requisite         market    power.)”     Caves     [1974, p. 23]




                                                                                 4

discounted              terms of trade through                such transactions,              as would be predicted               by this theory.

        Another            frequently       given motivation           for barter and business                  reciprocity          (where     buyers require

sellers to purchase                   some      goods    from       them)      is to evade price              regulation          and cartel          price      fixing.

Indeed,         Stigler [1969, p. 52] has argued, that reciprocity                                is ‘(important        chiefly where prices are fixed

by the state or a cartel. ”                      As an example              of this argument,             Bork    [1978, p.          376] suggests            that in

Lhc {.~,idel~ce supports           price discrimination         in international       countertrade       agreements,     no such support        can be found in

to liave higher elasticities            of demand,      nor is there and attempt             to engage     in or prevent     the arbitrage      which     one might

     ~’TILis idea is ILot novel and has been made in many other are=                            of industrial    economics,       For example,         the literature
on tying       agreements         and product       market      bundling    is full of such examples.           Indeed,     Bork’s     [1978,   ch,     19] discusses
tying     arrangeulents         and business      reciprocity      agreements         interchangeably.      See Tirole      [1988] and Carlton           and Perloff

between       the agent’s          valuations        of consumption            on market 1 and on market 2, as demonstrated                                         by

Adams       and Yellen [1976]. Furthermore,                       the result remains with much weaker conditions,                                       including

independently           distributed         valuations      as shown by McAfee,                 McMillan           and Whinston                [1989].

      It is straightforward               to extend       this argument             to the use of barter,              by simple relabeling                    of the

exchanges.        Suppose          that there is trade in two goods between two parties where each party produces

one of the goods.                Further       assume that one firm has all of the bargaining                                    power and is uncertain

about      both     the other firm’s costs of production                        and its valuation                of consumption.                Then         the firm

with bargaining            power will find it profitable                  to design the terms of trade to include                                 discounts        for

two-way       trades (i.e., barter)             in order to extract            more of its trading partner’s                       surplus.      The resulting

problem       is formally          identical    to the standard           bundling        cme, but where there is both monopoly                                   and

monopsony         power (rather than monopoly                         power over the two goods),                    though         now “bundling”               takes

the form of barter as the goods                      are exchanged         in a mixed-barter            agreement.

      These     benefits         of bundling         suggest      that the documented                extent         of reciprocity             – for instance,

among       the firms that Sloan [1961] studied,                        almost half sold more than 10 percent                                  of their output

to suppliers        - may be due to such monopoly /monopsony                                bundling         arrangements.               Moreover,            market

which   it had market          power)     to purchases     of punch    cards    (in which      it did not)       – in order       to more      effectively     extract
consumer      surplus    on the monopoly         market    by metering     usage.      Although     IBM did not use its monopoly                    in one market
to obtain     a monopoly          in another    (=    has been sometimes         incorrectly     argued),        it did use its presence           on one market
(computer      punch     cards)     in order to improve      its monopoly       profits   on the other.          See Bork        [1978] for a discussion.

         The           barter      networks       trade     a great diversity             of goods       and services.         Some     examples         include

rental cars,                    hotel   rooms,     office equipment,         business          services,     printing,      and vehicle       maintenance.

The exchanges                      are largely self regulated,           although         the IRTA provides          industry      standards         for IRTA-

member                 barter       networks.       The typical         barter     exchange        charges      10-15 percent         per transaction           as

well as an annual membership                              fee of $100-$600         and possibly           a monthly       maintenance         fee of $6-$30.

Transaction                     prices within      the exchange          are (in theory          at le=t)       identical      to outside     retail prices,

         Tilt’ fundamental                 question       which we address here is what function                         do barter exchanges               serve?

C)l)C ilnl~lediate                  answer is that they are apparently                       another       market   opportunity           for business       and

so it is Ilo t surprising                   that so many businesses                 participate.           This does not, however,             explain       why

reference     point,   @ = 1 in our cash market, in which all firms participate.                  We refer to 1 – @ as the

barter leakage due to a potential          lack of a double coincidence           of wants.

    A cost to bmtering           one’s wares is that a customer          who would have normally            purchased    on the

monetary       market    may instead      substitute     his trade on the barter          market.       We let a denote        the

endogenous      probability      of such a trade diversion.       Finally, let n(c) represent a typical firm’s expected

profit per potential       customer    as a function      of the firm’s underlying       marginal    cost, c E [c, C], and let

p E [u, ~] be the external          monopoly     price for a typical      good,    where p z E. Thus,         the net gain of

participating     on both the barter exchange           and the traditional       monetary    markets versus participating

only on the latter is given by



                                       @ =      [@v
                                                  – c – an(c)] –         max{u     – p, O}.



    To proceed,        Jve shall put some additional        structure    on the model to reveal sufficient         ingredients

for barter to arise as a means of revealing              a willingness   to pay. Most importantly,           we suppose       that

there is positiv(~ correlation        between    a firm’s valuation       for one good,       v, and its cost of producing

another.     c. .\s discussed in section 2.2, this can be motivated               by cash-flow    considerations    and excess

inventories     ~vllicll seem prominent      in the industry descriptions         of the firms that barter,     For simplicity,

collsi(l{~r l)(~rf(~rtpositive    correlation   between    cost and value in the following          form:




Ill a(l(lit ion, we make three further assumptions:               v > c, which implies that a double            coincidence     of

Ivan(s exists for all market participants;             @Q > g, which is equivalent        to assuming       that, absent trade

divrrsion,    the lowest valuation      firm prefers to utilize the barter exchange;             and 1 > ~~, which implies,

tl~at the value of tl~e barter exchange          to a firm with II < p (in the absence of trade diversion,               a = O)

is (Ieclilling as a firm’s cost and valuation          increwe.     Straightforward      calculations    show that the value

of barter for an otl~erwise non-purchasing              firm (ignoring    trade diversion)       equals zero precisely     at




where the inequality       follows from our assumptions.           Importantly,      if@ = 1 (so that the barter exchange

is as efficient as the cmh-market           exchange),     then no trade diversion        (a = O) implies that @ > 0 for
all v E [u, U]; that is, every firm will wish to barter if trade diversion                                       is absent. 15

      The following           result forms            the main result of this subsection                        and is easily derived              given      the

preceding         model. 16


        Result:        Suppose        that p > v*, Then there exists a Nash equilibrium                                   in which firms          with

         valuations      v < v“ utilize the barter exchange and no trade diversion                                        occurs     (i. e., a = O).


.4s a consequence,            barter will be used by all firms with low enough valuations                                       (and costs),     while high

valuation        firms will use the ‘money’                 market.



Example:             .4 simple numerical example illustrates the barter equilibrium.                                              Suppose that @ = ~,

q = 1, z is uniformly distributed on [10, 30], and average unit costs are E[c] = 15.                                                           lVith       these

parameter         choices,     I}” = ~0.
                                     -   @(v)           is graphed        below, assuming an external                    monopoly         price of p = 25.




      Note that this example                  illustrates       that those with high and low valuations                           trade in equilibrium,

though         tllost’ ~vith lo~t’ valuations            only receive welfare of @v from the good.                                Note also that those

\vitll valllatiolls      between 25 and 30 do not trade while those below do so, The re~on                                                  for this is that

tll~~{ost.~ and valuations             are correlated           so that those with low valuations                       also have low costs, making

11] tfIrllls of its Illeasured              size, the most            important         form of non-monetary                    trade   is countertrade.

This section        directly      addresses          two types of countertrade.                  First, in a typical            buy-back countertrade,

all exporter        sells plant or industrial                equipment           in exchange          for some cash and a promise                      to buy

back a specified             amount     of output          produced        using the exported                capital      inputs.       Counterpurchase

colultertrades        are similar to buy backs except                       that the secondary               purchases          are not output         related

to the initial purchases.1~              Our objective             here is to provide            some insights into these practices

  lGTo prove       the result,    suppose      that    a = O and no trade            diversion    occurs.    It is sufficient     to demonstrate       that    (1)
@ is decreasing      in I, (and    hence      c),    (2) @ > 0 at v = ~, and (3) @ = O at v = v“.                       In such    a cme,    because     v-   < p
by hypothesis,      a = O m assumed,                and the outcome       is a Nash equilibrium,            Condition     (1) is easily     demonstrated       by
substituting      v for c using the resumption           of perfect    correlation,     and then differentiating;         (2) is true by assumption;           (3)
is implied     by the assumption       that p > v“.
   I’Studies     vary considerably       as to the magnitude             of each form        of countertrade.        A survey     by the National      Foreign
Trade   Council      of 122 U.S.      firms    indicates    that   9 percent         were buy     backs,    and 55 percent         counterpurchases.          (See

form of countertrade                        in which a firm (typically                      from a developed               country)        sells plant or produc-

tion equipment                    to another          firm (typically               in a centrally-planned            economy          or an LDC)           in exchange

for money               and an agreement                     to purch=e             some portion         of the output           produced         from      the initially

transferred              capital         for a fixed price.               For example,           Mirus and Yeung                [1986] document             a buy-back

agreement               between Volkswagen                     and the former Emt Germany                         in which Volkswagen              agreed to deliver

a complete               engine production                    plant (capable           of manufacturing             286,000 engines per year) and East

Germany                agreed to deliver 100,000 engines per year after the plant became                                                  functional

       The question                   we address is why it is economically                        meaningful         to condition          current sales on future

buy-bacl{s’?              One explanation                   has been frequently              argued by economists                 – a buy-back            agreement         is

made in response to concerns by the purchasing                                           firm that the capital or plant delivered                        is possibly      not

of hig]l q~lality or efficiency                        (adverse selection),              or that the supplying                firm will fail to exert sufficient

effort in solving the numerous                               technical       problems       which typically          arise when bringing                 a plant on line

(moral hazard). 18 The response to this asymmetry                                               in information         at the contract           signing stage is to

give       a   stalie to the selling firm in the plant’s successful operation.                                       One route is through                 foreign direct

inves tmellt             (ei tl~er through             vertical         integration       or a joint venture)              which would give the supplying

firnl a direct st al{e ill the plant’s operation.                                    Barring the feasibility           of such contracts,           buy-backs           form

all i~lt(’rll~~tivc’ second-best                      solution.         By requiring        the supplying           firm to purchase            a fixed quantity           of

       This argument                    for buy-backs            suggests that buy-back                 contracts      should be observed                when alterna-

tive forms of organizat ion such as foreign direct investment                                              are not available and there is considerable

lu~(ertainty regarding                         the value of the underlying                 capital offered.          With this hypothesis                in mind, Hen-

llart al]d Anderson                     [1993] collected           data on 592 counter trade transactions                         as reported       in Counter-trade


Bussard          [1987 ].)     A related          survey     by Hennart       [1989] of all transactions          reported     in Countertrade         Outlook     from   mid
1983 to 1986 reveals                   that the percents         are 13 percent        buy backs     and 51 percent        counterpurchaae.
    I@Verbal           arguments        that     buy-backs       can solve contractual          difficulties   due to private       information      by the supplier        of
plants and capital is found in I<ogut [1986], Mirus-Yeung  [1986], Hennart [1989], and Hennart and Anderson     [1993].
   I~Tllere are also examples of arrangements   ~iml]ar to buy-back  transactions  which occur outside of international

trade,         Mmten      and Snyder             [1993] reconsider        the famous      United Shoe Machinery              Co~oration      antitrust    case which      was

in supplying            its shoe machines,            requiring         in some     cases that lease payments         to United        Shoe depended        upon      flows of
output         from the shoe-making                 machines.   M~ten  and Snyder argue that such an arrangement                               W= useful for aligning

3.1       Barter           to Restrict             Monopoly             Power

~loney has two features that typically affect the level of trade. First, it is a general claim on goods

which makes it, a desirable means of exchange. By contrast, barter requires a double coincidence of

wants which is the standard argument against its use. Second, money is highly divisible, so that

it is em y to fine-tune                 a demand         to exactly          the required             level.       On the other             hand,        barter       goods

may not be easily divisible                       without        substantial         loss in utility.              For instance,            there is little point

in trading         for the odd pages of a book,                       Similarly,          there is little purpose                 in a dentist            bartering        to

drill a patient’s           tooth     unless the filling is also provided.                        The purpose             of this section,            adapted          from

Ellingsell       and Stole [1996], is to show that such indivisibilities                                   may provide             an important              advantage

of barter over monetary                     transactions     because the crudeness of barter implies a reduction                                         in monopoly

l)rc)clllre(l 1~~the other division.                   For instance,          each division             may be considering                   hiring an employee

frolll tile other.          Suppose          that each division’s             value for the other’s                  product        is a random             variable       v,

and each firm has a random                        cost of production,               c1. With marginal-cost                  pricing,         the first-best           arises

Ivhere trade occurs on product                       i if and only if v, > Ci. With bilateral monopoly                                 pricing,          each division

chooses        its price to extract             rents in the usual fashion, with prices above marginal                                         costs, p, > c,,

      Consider       instead the outcome                 of a game in which the agents can no longer trade the goods                                                      for


    20hfarin     and Schnitzer       [1 995] additionally         predict    that    financial       constraints      are a necessary          condition          for the at-
tractiveness      of counterpurchmes,            and so an interaction         of debt ratios          and contractual           hazards     should      have predictive
power.    To the extent       that an additional          contractual       hazard       is the possible       default    on debt repayments             by the trading
firm exporting      consumer        goods     for marketing,      we might expect           a similar correlation         between     counterpurch~e                and debt
ratios based on the specific            investment     theory.    They provide           empirical     evidence      which is consistent         with these theories.
In their sample       of 230 countertrade            contracts    by firms producing             or located        in Austria,     they estimate          logit    and OLS

LDC or Eastern           European     firm was manufacturing            plant or machinery             (as a measure        of potential       contractual         hazards),

export   type.     The    interaction        term is always significant        and positive,          as is the class of export            which   is consistent        with
the theories.

money.           Instead,   they can only barter            the goods     at a relative       price of 1, since each division                only

has unit demand.                When evaluating       whether     or not to agree to barter,             each firm considers           its own

valuation         and costs,       and is willing    to bmter      if and only if V3 2            cl.    This    has one obvious            cost:

that trade can only occur when each person’s                      valuation        exceeds its costs.      This is the standard              cost

of barter,         where trade only arises with double              coincidence        of wants.        However,      it also erodes          the

monopoly           power    of both     sides as barter       is a far cruder        device    for monopolists        to manipulate            in

bilateral        markets.       This is the benefit of barter.      The relative benefits             of barter over monetary              trade

can be seen in the figures below.




      Tilese figures compare             three regimes:        marginal      cost pricing      (a benchmark),         monopoly         pricing

tril(li’~ ill tilt’ shacled areas: barter has the advantage                  of eliminating      monopoly        power, but at the cost

of r(’(lllirill~ dollble coincidence            of wants.



Rclrllark:           Ellillgscrl and Stole [1996] show that the introduction                   of barter opportunities            to a world

3.2            Non-Monetary            Exchange        to    Constrain          “Power”


The iclea that, competing               groups    within     an organization         may choose         between     spending       scarce     re-

sources on increasing              production     or on rent-seeking         is well known,     The resource        allocation       tradeoffs

facing such groups and the resulting welfare consequences                           have been well documented             (see Skaperdas

[1992], Hirshleifer         [1995], Rajan and Zingales [1995], and sources cited therein).                         An interesting          point



                                                                        13
made by Rajan        and Zingales         [1995], however, is that the presence of returns from accumulating                         and

exercising     power by groups constrains              the set of efficient trades which would otherwise                  be made.    In

short, inefficient     power activities         are normal goods.

      As an illustration,      suppose      that group B has a productive              decision     available which can increme

group A’s profit at very little cost to group B. Normally,                      we would expect group A to offer a Coasian

“bribe”     to group B to obtain the requisite                production.      But if group B h~        high marginal       returns to

power (compared            to other productive         activities),    group A can expect         B to mis-use        the transfer and

spend it on power accumulation,                 which may render the net trade unattractive                    for A, The result is

that some otherwise-efficient             activities    do not occur.         An example      consistent     with such phenomena

is Yale University’s         recent refusal of a $20 million gift earmarked                  specifically    for a course of studies

in ll~est ern Civilization,       The argument           of Rajan      and Zingales is that such money            would have been

used 1)!’ the Department          to garner additional           power (most likely through          many more endowed          chairs

and their resulting         faculty   votes in University         matters)      which arguably       would have negative        effects

on the L-lliversity as a whole.

      The relevance of this power-playing               inefficiency       to our own study is that non-monetary            exchanges

ma~ srrvc to reduce           the inefficient    consumption           of power.    In short, means of exchange            other than

palatable     to the administration.

It goes without       saying     that a huge amount               of trade within      firms occurs         through    the reciprocal

exchange      of favors.     Colleagues     routinely        help one another,      reading their papers,        dealing    with their

clients, forgiving     late delivery      of goods,      and so on, usually with no immediate                 repayment.      Instead,

repayment      occurs through the reciprocal              offering of a favor sometime          in the future when it is needed.

It is our contention        here that firms deliberately              choose not to monetize        some trades that they could

monetize,     either by allowing agents to trade or by explicitly                  putting prices on trades through           transfer

pricing.



                                                                      14
4.1.1         A Simple       Illustrative        Model        of Reciprocal      Exchange

Consider        two individuals        (divisions,    employees,     etc.)    who interact     over time, potentially         providing

inputs to each other’s             respective    projects.     Each party to the relationship         has two potential         projects

which may arise during any period                     of time, where the execution           of the project      requires     help from

the other        party.     The firm that the divisions             belong     to must make a decision            whether      to allow

monetary        transfers between         the two divisions.        We will denote one project           as “noncontractible”        and

use the 71 subscript,          and we will denote            the other project     as “contract ible”       using the k subscript,

By contractible,          we mean simply that if money                transfers can be used, a simultaneous              exchange       of

prociuction       in return for money            is contractible.     For instance,       one division     may need an employee

from the other            A reasonable     transfer price here would be his wage plus some portion                     of the surplus

value of the employee              to the offering      division.    Money      combined       with contractibility         is therefore

necessar!’      al~d s~lficient      for a once-off    legally enforceable       trade.    On the other hand, an exchange               of

money for tile execution             of the non-contractible        project    exchange    is not legally enforceable         and must

be self-rllfc)rc(~<~l]le. For instance,          suppose that one division asks the other to treat one of their main

clients wel]. For obvious            moral hazard reasons, the division may choose to renege on its promise                            to

tile client.     If there is no reliable measure of the client’s happiness                   with the division’s      behavior,     such

services art, lalgel~, noll-contractible             and can only be enforced         through     the goodwill     of all the parties

IJrol}abilit,y ~, dt (technically,        projects     arrive according       to a Poisson process).       This latter a,ssurnption

implies that a double           static coincidence           of wants (the simultaneous         arrival of two projects,        one for

each individual.          during    the same small interval of tilme) occurs               with insignificant      probability.       We

~sume         that each division        has a discount         rate of r, where 6 is the corresponding             discount       factor,

a=~~(o.1).

    It is resumed          that the firm cannot          write sophisticated       contracts     with its divisions.     Instead,      its

only choice       in this section       is to decide     whether     the divisions    should      be allowed     to transfer      money

between       themselves.     If money transfers are allowed, they are free to choose any transfer mechanism


                                                                     15

4.1.2       The Effect       of Monetizing           Exchange

We consider         two scenarios.       The     first is where money               transfers       are banned          and so the issue of

contractabilit      y is irrelevant:     trade can only be accomplished                         through      credible    but unenforceable

promises      of future reciprocation.          We then compare               this to a situation           in which the firm allows the

divisions     to contract     between       themselves         using money.        We find that depending                upon the discount

factor,   such monetization          can either be a blessing or a curse.



Exchange          without     Money.          Here, the divisions             enforce    reciprocal       trades through            the threat of

dissolution       of the partnership.       Assume that quantities               qk and qn are traded in equilibrium.                       Then if

one division       recluires q,, the relevant incentive compatibility                    constraint       is that the other is willing to

provide     it, which requires that

                                                      –C(qi)      +   V(qn,    qk) >0,



where 1‘(q., q~) ~ ~ [~k~(~~ ) + ~~v(q~)] is the present value of the relationship                                       to each division          in

ecluilibriulll.     \\’it h these these constraints,            equilibrium       trades can be characterized                     by two regions.

Fol large {Jnougl] J. neither constraint             binds at the first best level of trade, which is given by qeff = 1.

(l~li~lltit ies are below the efficient level, with traded quantities                         of both goods        continuously         increasing

ill cl.



Exchange          with Money.           Suppose now that the firm allows the divisions to trade among them-

sel~rcsusing nlonetary transfers. h40ney has two features that fundamentally affect the set of attain-

al)]e trades.      First, money is always valued by the divisions                        and so becomes            a source of payment             for

ser~ices,     Second,    money can be exchanged                 for the contractible            good simultaneously,               thus enforcing

tracles on q~. In terms of the relevant incentive compatibility                              constraints,    this implies three efiects of

money.      First, efficient trade always takes place on the contractible                           good,     qk =    q’ff    =    1, as there are

no enforcement        problems       when money can be exchanged                   immediately         upon delivery.             Second, punish-

ments are less severe as failure to cooperate                    can only be met with a dissolution                   of the partnership           on

the noncontractible          good;    trade always continues            at its efficient level on the contractible                      good.zl    As


   21\Ve take the position     that trade    on the contractible      good    is efficient    on- and off-the-equilibrium-path           because   we
see the repeated     game we study     m a metaphor       for a world       where information       is collected     on the   ‘(type”    of a trading




                                                                       16
a consequence,                      the introduction             of money has a deleterious                           effect by reducing         credible       punishments.

Third,          and more subtle,                    the introduction               of money            directly           affects trade on the non-contractible

good.          This occurs even though the non-contractible                                           goods cannot               be verified by anyone outside                 the

relationship               and it is not known that service has been provided                                                until after its delivery.            The re~on

for this is that money can be offered m a voluntary                                                   gift when quality has been observed.

         It turns out that the (weakly)                                 optimal      voluntary             gift of money              is equal to half the costs                 of

production.                   This       serves to relax incentive                    compatibility                   constraints       most .22     Since the costs             of

product.io]l            then effectively                 become      half the costs incurred,                        this makes non-contractible                trades easier

to cllfor([,.            Ho~vever, dishonesty                     on good n cannot                   be penalized            from exclusion        from trade on good

k so tll(’ I]et gain from honesty                                is future trade only on the non-contractibles.                                  The net effect is that

     For an illustrative case consider the setting in which ~k = ~ and A. = & in Figure 3. The solid

curves give equilibrium               outcomes          when monetary           trade is banned              and the dashed lines give similar

information       with money transfers.




     The quantities          traded are given in the bottom                     half while welfare is plotted             in the top graph.              The

transfers banned.            Wit bout money, both goods                      are traded at equal levels and converge                       to q, = 1 as

is (weakly)      lower than without               money due to the absence                    of multi-mmket            contact.       Welfare         in the

top part of the Figure is given by ~~~, and the difference                                     between        the two is given by the partial

line, illustrating        the non-monotonic               effect of money           in the discount           rate, where greatest             benefits     of

Remark:           The previous            analysis provides           an argument           for a principal         banning       the use of money

to l)roilibit    lllo~lctary trades everywhere                    – both on and off the equilibrium                    path – while we did not

assllllle sllch commitment               powers on the part of the individual                       players.     One plausible        reason the firm

llla~ lla~’e more commitment                   is that multiple            versions of the above bilateral                partnership           may exist

throughout        tile firm. Thus, if a division or employee                        in one of the partnerships                decides to cheat and

tllcreby     start a punishment              phase, the firm has an incentive                      to continue      its policy      of non-monetary

tr;~(ling on the punishment                  path, so as to deter other bilateral                      partnerships       from cheating.               Thus,

th(~ corporation          may want to create a reputation                      for itself, as has been argued elsewhere                        (see I<reps

[1990]).


  23The ambiguous          effects   of money    arise from the fact that it has effects              both    on and off the equilibrium         path.     The
idea that adding    strategies       must be evaluated        on and off the equilibrium           path arises from related       work on multi-market
contact     by Bernheim     and Whinston        [1990] who note that the addition             of another      market   on which     to punish       a deviator
will typically   incre=e      the amount       of feasible    collusion.     See also Baker,       Gibbons,     and Murphy        [1994,   1996],     Schmidt
and Schnitzer     [1995] and Bernheim          and Whinston        [1994].    Finally,   closest   in spirit to this analysis     is Kranton     [1995] who
considers    the role of money         in enforcing     trades,   though     her interest   in it whether      non-monetary       trade is self-enforcing
rather than on evaluating            welfare effects.

4.1.3         Transfer         Pricing

Although         some firms will sometimes                  find it optimal       to ban all monetary                transactions        between     em-

ployees or divisions              as our previous argument suggests, in other firms in which the central authorities

have more control over trades than simply allowing or banning all monetary                                             transfers, something          less

drastic is preferable.             These firms may design transfer pricing rules to regulate                                 the trades that occur

between        the two divisions,            The purpose        of this subsection           is to consider         briefly the role of transfer

pricing       in our setting above. 24 In our mathematical                        treatment        of this problem             in Prendergast        and

Stole [1996a], we allow the firm to attach a price of p for every unit of good                                           g~ that is provided          by

a division.          .Yote that the non-contractible                good cannot      be verified so that it is impossible                    to charge

a price for q,,, The relevant                  question      then becomes         the choice of the optimal                   transfer    price:    does

the firm       choose to set transfer            prices for the contractible           good at the efficient level?                   This represents

a )Iatllra] ~cneralization               of the results above.          We shcw two results.                  Firstl     the firm      never chooses

t TC171.7J(7prtces        to compensate          jully     the provider     of the service.              In other      words,    firms always use

]Icj]l-lllollt’f ar~ reciprocation            of some degree to allocate            contractible           resources      within its boundaries.

Tilt r(ason           for this is that the firm would like to use the threat of withholding                                     some trade on the

font la(t il )10 good as a means of inducing                    honesty on the non-contractible                      good,     and it cannot       do so

i~ it sots i~ transfer price that fully compensates                        for good      k. The second               observation         that arises is

.1.2        Non-Monetary,                   Relationship-Specific                 Expenditures

S(J1l-111(~11(’t;~r~
                  trade has at its essence the notion                           that agents pay for ‘goods’                   using a means other

tl]i~ll tllone~.        This section        continues      our interest in the role of trade sanctions                         by considering        how

1(’l:ltiollsllil]s      form      and the means by which agents                   (e. g., employees,             divisions,     or separate        firms)

art’ allo~re(l to access relationships.                    In other words, how do agents pay to join relationships?                                   We

address        this issue in the context             of posting       bonds.      A recurring            theme    in the economics           literature

is that, repeated           interaction        can be facilitated         by the posting          of reputational             bonds    or ‘ihostages”


   L4~,lex~lred       ~ransfer~ ~ithln      firms are of enormous     magnitude.      For example,         Mehafdi’s     [1990] study     of 33 multina-
tional     British    companies     found   that 21 percent    had internally     “priced”     transfers    valued     at 10-25 percent     of corporate
sales, and 24 percent          had internal    transfers   valued   at over 25 percent       of sales.




                                                                           19
to raise the costs to deviant                    behavior. 25 In this section,               we further       explore     this idea of making

investments         as a method         of facilitating       greater cooperation.            In particular,     we explore the usefulness

and limitations            of trade-enhancing            “hostages.”        The purpose        of this section       is to show that money

may be a particularly                bad currency       with which to attempt              to gain admission        to the relationship.           We

illustrate    this by considering               the role of an ideal hostage,             which is something            that has value only to

the original owner and is valueless to all others.                          In this sense, giving a hostage to join a relationship

must generally            be a non-monetary            transaction.



A    Simple        Model         of    Hostage         Exchange            Consider       again our repeated             interaction       model    of

exchange         from      section     4.1.1.     Suppose         for simplicity        that there is only one good              which      is non-

contractible,        q,,, and the model is otherwise                  unchanged.         If r is sufficiently    small such that first-best

exchangu cannot             l~e supported,        there may be a role for relationship-specific                    expenditures        to improve

mat ters. In pal titular, let’s amend our current game with an initial stage that allows each party to

silnultaneo~l, sly choose whether or not to invest H dollars in assets which satisfy three conditions:

     1. the availal~ility of one party’s                asset is controlled           by the other party;


    2. the :~sets are non-salvageable;                    and


    3. the assets are l]on-tradeable                   almongst the parties.

1]1order to ignore productive                   efficiency   questions,       we will assume that each investment                  generates       TH

dollars per period of time to the party that buys the asset, providing                                   that the other party acquiesces

to tI1[Jpayout            of this return.       That    is, the other party has some control                    right over the bond           which

(all Ije used to destroy              its value to the investing party.

     Yo]v consider           the following        equilibrium.       If both trading partners invest in their respective                     ljonds,

tile partners        pla~ tile surplus-maximizing                    subgame         equilibrium      from our model          in section      4,1.1.

Sl)e{ifically,      they exchange          qn at the most efficient level satisfying the incentive compatibility                             condi-

tion:




If either trading           partner fails to invest in the appropriate                     asset, or if at anytime          during the trading

subgalme either partner                fails to provide           qm when an opportunity              arises, neither party trades again.


    ~5~otable important papers in this vein include Telser [1980], I{lein and Leffler [1981] and Williamson                             [1983,1984].
I{lein and Leffler [1981] argue, for example,             that the loss of brand name capital          or non-salvageable     productive    assets by
a firm \vho offers low quality         products     can be a sufficient     deterrent    so as to guarantee    high quality   on the marketplace.
Williamson       [1983,    1984] adds additional       insights    in his analysis   of “hostages”.



                                                                            20
Given our assumptions regarding the relationship-specific expenditures, this means that the value to

the assets are lost forever. Because we have assumed that the investments are productively neutral,

H appears only on the left-hand side of the incentive compatibility condition, improving the ability

of the partners to trade efficiently. Prom the above analysis, the value of such investments is clear.

    Importantly, conditions (2) and (3) above regarding the specificity of the investments are nec-

essary for cooperation to be enhanced.               If, for example, assets were individually salvageable, the

deviator can take the other’s hostage, which will make deviation more desirable. Similarly, if the

assets are tradeable between the parties, then H disappears entirely from the incentive compatibil-

ity condi tion as the agents will swap their hostages at no cost following a deviation. This need for

non-salvageability and non-tradeability of hostages implies that the hostages must, be non-monetary.

    An example of such investments has been noted by Hennart [1989].                                 Consider       a repeated     in-

terac tion bet~vren t~vo !irms – one Western             and the other from a centrally-planned                     economy.     The

Western       firm may invest in CPE-firm-specific           marketing       channels     while the CPE-firm             invests in

~Testerll-firlll-sl]ecific     plant and equipment.      Thus, if the relationship         deteriorates,         the Western     firm

loses its invest lnellts marketing          the CPE firm’s      consumer      goods    and the CPE          firm loses ongoing

service allcl spare parts of its Western-made             plant.     Note that because           of difficulty     enforcing   hard-

to-verifl     exclla)lges     (such ~ quality of marketing      or plant service)      across these national           boundaries,

i]~ tile r~ellt of cheating        by one party, it is   unlikely     that   the   investments       can   be    efficiently   trans-


ferre(l are    conl])letely     salvaged.   Thus, the investments      strengthen      the firms’ ability to cooperate             on

~1[~11-(olltr;ict,il~ledimensions.




5      Conclusion

This essay is meant to be little more than exploratory.                As we have mentioned             throughout       the paper,

economists       are fond of extolling      the virtues of money over more barter-like               arrangements,        but firms

and individuals        continue      to use non-monetary      arrangements         to an enormous          degree.       There    has

l~een little ~vork that, has systematically         addressed      this issue, only some scattered              results in different

literatures     on this issue. The purpose        oft his paper has been to understand               some of the themes that

generate non-monetary             trade as an optimal    mechanism,      and to evaluate these in the light of existing

empirical      work.
