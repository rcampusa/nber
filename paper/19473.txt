This paper introduces a general equilibrium model of endogenous technical change through basic
and applied research. Basic research differs from applied research in the nature and the magnitude
of the generated spillovers. We propose a novel way of empirically identifying these spillovers
and embed them in a framework with private firms and a public research sector. After
characterizing the equilibrium, we estimate our model using micro-level data on research
expenditures by French firms. Our key finding is that standard innovation policies (e.g., uniform
R&D tax credits) can accentuate the dynamic misallocation in the economy by oversubsidizing
applied research. Policies geared towards public basic research and its transmission to the private
sector are significantly welfare improving.

Fostering economic growth is one of the primary objectives of economists and policymakers. The
amount of resources invested in research is often at the heart of the debate regarding how to best
achieve this. Less well known, however, is what role the composition of research plays in determining
growth, particularly when considering the breakdown between basic and applied research. In this
paper, we aim to fill this gap by studying the differential effects of basic versus applied research on
economic growth.
                             The distinction between basic and applied research is economically important and relates to the
breadth of the scientific examination being undertaken. According to the NSF, basic research invest-
ment refers to a “systematic study to gain more comprehensive knowledge or understanding of the
subject under study without specific applications in mind.” Conversely, applied research is defined as
a “systematic study to gain knowledge or understanding to meet a specific, recognized need.” Many
policy reports, most recently the Economic Report of the President (JEC, 2010, 2016), argue that
basic research is underfunded both by private and public entities.

 Notes: Figure 1 plots the composition of total research spending for the US and France. The data for the US come from the
National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics (NSF/SRS), while the data for France come from the French
Ministry of Research. Figure 2 uses 13,708 firm-year observations from French firm level data for the period 2000-2006. The
dependent variable is the ratio of total firm investment in basic research divided by total firm investment in applied research. The
red line represents a linear fit of the firm-year observations, after controlling for firm size (log employment). See Section 3.1 for
further details.



                             Three empirical features of basic and applied research are of special importance. First, in countries
such as France and the US, almost half of total research investment is allocated to basic research (see
Figure 1). Second, contrary to conventional wisdom, a significant share of basic scientific research
involves the private sector. In France almost 15% of total basic research in the economy is undertaken
by the private sector. Similarly for the US economy, Howitt (2000), estimates that around 22% of all
basic research during the period 1993-1997 was performed by private enterprises. Finally, there are

                                                                                                        1
significant differences in the incentives of firms to invest into basic research. Figure 2 plots the ratio of
basic to applied research according to the multi-industry presence of firms for a sample of French firms
between 2000 and 2006. The figure suggests that investment into basic research increases as the scope
of a firm’s activities expands, even after controlling for firm size. These stylized facts suggest that
ignoring the composition of research investment and the differential incentives behind each of them
might prevent economists and policymakers from designing the most effective policies for productivity
growth.
   Despite clear empirical importance and considerable policy interest, the differential nature of the
roles played by basic and applied research in the growth process is still relatively unexplored, and many
related questions remain to be answered: How sizable are the spillovers from basic research? What are
the potential inefficiencies in a competitive economy, and what are the appropriate government policies
to mitigate them and promote economic growth? This paper attempts to answer these important
questions.
   In order to understand the potential inefficiencies in research investment and to design appropriate
industrial policies to address them, it is necessary to adopt a structural framework that explicitly
models the incentives of private and public entities for the different types of research. We propose a
general equilibrium, multi-industry framework with private firms and a public research sector. In our
model, basic research has two distinct features relative to applied research. First, it generates spillovers
that affect subsequent innovations both within and across industries. Applied research, on the other
hand, only generates incremental innovations within a targeted industry. Second, the potential returns
from basic research depend on whether it was generated in the private or the public sector. In line
with the “Ivory Tower” theory of academic research, basic research by private firms in our model will
turn into consumer products faster than that undertaken by public research labs.
   To highlight the key economic forces, we first consider a benchmark economy with tractable func-
tional forms, characterize the dynamic equilibrium analytically, and discuss the resulting dynamics
and inefficiencies. Our ultimate goal in this paper is to undertake a quantitative investigation of
the impacts of various innovation policies on the aggregate economy. As such, we then generalize
our benchmark framework to allow for greater quantitative flexibility and estimate the structural
parameters.
   We estimate the structural parameters of our model using French firm-level data for the period
2000-2006. Information about research investment comes from the annual R&D Survey conducted
by the French Ministry of Research. The advantage of this data is that it includes information on
the basic and applied research expenditures of firms. To measure the breadth of a firm’s activities
we combine two datasets (“Enquete Liaisons Financieres” (LIFI), “Enquete Annuelle des Entreprises”
(EAE)) that allow us to precisely identify a firm’s links to different industries not only through product
lines within the same firm, but also through their ownership links. Finally we use the balance sheet
data from these firms to measure firm dynamics and NBER patent citation data to measure the quality
of innovation. The final sample is composed of 13,708 firm-year observations.
   These features of our data allow us to identify and estimate the key spillovers involved in each

                                                     2
type of research. We identify the cross-industry spillovers associated with basic research through the
investment choices of multi-industry firms. Consistent with our model, we observe that investment
into basic research increases as the scope of a firm’s activities expands. The intuition is that as
the range of a firm’s products and industries becomes more diversified, its incentive for investing in
basic research relative to applied research should increase due to better appropriability of potential
knowledge spillovers. Similarly, we identify the within-industry spillovers of basic and applied research
through their impact on subsequent innovations. We show that patents derived from basic research
efforts are associated with higher quality of follow-up innovations for approximately 8 years. To
further inform the model parameters on firm dynamics, we simultaneously target a rich set of firm
characteristics related to multi-industry presence, profitability, age, and entry/exit patterns.

   Our main result is the quantification of the inefficiencies due to dynamic misallocation in research.
We find that 89% of spillovers from basic research across industries are not internalized and that basic
research makes applied innovation 60% more productive. As a result, there is a dynamic misallocation
of research efforts, which reduces welfare by 3.6 percentage points in consumption equivalent terms.
One striking feature of the solution to the social planner’s problem is that the fraction of resources
devoted to research activities is not substantially greater than in the decentralized equilibrium. Indeed,
the dominant misallocation here is not that between production and research, as is common in this
class of models, but among the various types of research activities, in this case, applied and basic
innovation. Another striking feature is that in the case of applied innovation, there is actually an
overinvestment in the decentralized economy due to the strategic complementarity between basic
research spillovers and the returns to applied research.

   This raises an important question: to what extent can public policies address this inefficiency? The
first policy we analyze is a uniform research subsidy to private firms. In this environment, subsidizing
overall private research is ineffective since this policy oversubsidizes applied research, which is already
overinvested in due to competition. Therefore, the welfare improvement from such a subsidy is limited
unless the policymaker is able to discriminate between types of research projects at the firm level. We
thus consider a hypothetical type-dependent research subsidy and find that the optimal policy is to
subsidize basic research by 50% and applied research by 14%. Finally, we show that increased funding
to public basic research labs (e.g., universities) can have significant welfare improvements, especially
when the speed of the transmission of their research findings to the private sector is increased.

   Related Literature       Our main contribution is to the macro literature on endogenous technical
change. Although the different characteristics of basic and applied research, and public and private
research have been widely recognized to be of first-order importance by policymakers, these issues have
received insufficient attention from the economic growth literature. In particular, models of endogenous
technological change (see Aghion, Akcigit, and Howitt (2014) for a recent survey) mainly considered
a uniform type of (applied) research and ignored basic research investment in the economy. A few
exceptions are Aghion and Howitt (1996, 2009), Cozzi and Galli (2009, 2014), Gersbach, Schneider,
and Schneller (2013), Gersbach and Schneider (2015), Morales (2004), and Mansfield (1995), who

                                                    3
have considered theoretical models with both basic and applied research investment. We contribute
to this literature by building a model with rich firm dynamics as in Klette and Kortum (2004) and
Lentz and Mortensen (2008) that is estimated with new firm-level micro data on firms’ research
investment. In addition to including the private investment in basic research, we enrich the analysis
of the distinct features of basic research by introducing a novel method to identify within- and cross-
industry spillovers.
    Methodologically, our paper is related to the growing branch of endogenous growth with firm dy-
namics that estimates these models structurally using micro data. For instance, Lentz and Mortensen
(2008, 2016) use a panel of Danish firms, Acemoglu, Akcigit, Bloom, and Kerr (2013), Akcigit and
Kerr (2016), and Garcia-Macia, Hsieh, and Klenow (2015) use US Census of Manufacturing and Peters
(2015) uses Indonesian micro data, and Ates and Saffie (2014) use Chilean firm-level data to estimate
enriched versions of the quality-ladder models. A number of papers have also studied the role of
innovation policy in similar class of models. For instance, Atkeson and Burstein (2015) study the im-
pact of policy-induced changes in innovative investment by firms on growth in aggregate productivity.
More recently, Akcigit, Hanley, and Stantcheva (2016) use a mechanism design approach to solve for
the optimal design of innovation policy using a quality-ladder model with asymmetric information on
firm types. Finally, Garicano, Lelarge, and Van Reenen (2016) have used firm-level data to study the
impact of size-dependent policies on misallocation of factors of production in France. These papers
do not consider the distinction between basic and applied research, whereas our focus here is to esti-
mate the associated spillovers using French firm-level data and design relevant policies around these
spillovers.
    Consistent with our results, some papers show that the speed of technology diffusion is linked to
the ability of inventors to utilize ideas for production (Akcigit, Celik, and Greenwood, 2016), or to the
existing patent rights over those technologies (Galasso and Schankerman, 2015). In the same spirit,
Bloom, Schankerman, and Van Reenen (2013) identify technology and product market spillovers for
US manufacturing firms. They show that small firms generate lower social returns to R&D because
they operate in technological niches. Our paper, suggests that their result can be rationalized by
these firms’ lower incentives to invest into basic research which is more difficult to appropriate. In our
framework, more public basic research investment stimulates more private applied research. In that
regard, our results are parallel with the findings of Cozzi and Impullitti (2010) and Impullitti (2010)
which show that increases in the technological content of public spending encourages more private
R&D spending in the US.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The discussion of our theoretical framework con-
sists of two parts: In Section 2 we provide a benchmark version of the main model, characterize its
dynamic equilibrium in an intuitive manner, and discuss the main mechanisms. We then describe a
generalization of the benchmark model that we bring to the data and estimate. Section 3 describes
the estimation and identification of the model. Section 4 provides a detailed discussion of the welfare
effects of various policies on the decentralized economy. Section 6 concludes. The Appendix con-
tains omitted proofs and derivations (A), the data description (B), further details on within-industry

                                                    4
spillovers (C), robustness checks on the stylized facts (D), and further details on identification (E).


2     Theory: Growth with Basic and Applied Research

Our theoretical framework will depart from standard endogenous growth models in a number of ways.
First, we introduce a distinction in the appropriability of innovations from basic and applied research.
Following the influential literature on basic science, we consider the possibility that basic research not
only generates spillovers within an industry, but also across industries (Nelson, 1959). We thus model
an economy in which firms can operate in multiple industries, a feature that endogenously generates
incentives for firms to invest into basic research.
    A second key feature of our model is the distinction between embodied and disembodied knowledge
in the economy. Both private firms and public research labs are investing into basic research in this
economy. However successful basic research in the the private sector is more likely to be immediately
turned into a consumer product (embodied), as opposed to simply increase the stock of knowledge
available for future innovators (disembodied). This will induce a delay in the effect of public basic
research. The ivory tower nature of academic research has been widely discussed in academic and
policy circles, with a formal analysis being provided by Aghion, Dewatripont, and Stein (2008).1
    For ease of exposition and intuition, in this section, we will first outline a simplified baseline
framework with myopic (one-period-ahead maximizing) firms that highlights the key elements of the
main model. After deriving the theoretical results and discussing the main economic forces at play, in
Section 2.3 we will describe the generalizations we make to the benchmark model.


2.1     Baseline Model

We consider a representative household economy in continuous time. The household consists of a
measure M of workers. Each worker has one unit of labor that is supplied inelastically in the labor
market. There is a unique final good Z (t). The economy is a closed economy, there is no physical
capital investment and all expenses are in terms of the labor units. Therefore, Z (t) will also be equal
to household consumption at time t.


2.1.1    Production

Production is divided into three major sectors: downstream, midstream, and upstream. The upstream
sector produces intermediate goods (yij ) that are used to produce industry aggregates (Yi ) in the
midstream sector. Finally, the downstream sector combines these industry aggregates into the final
good (Z). We will now describe them in detail.
   1
     In their model the academic sector is a precommitment mechanism that allows scientists to freely pursue their own
interests. Consistent with our model, academic scientists may therefore end up working on projects with little immediate
economic value. An important difference however is that in their setup there is full appropriability of the innovation.
We relax this assumption and show that it generates a delay in the innovation process with consequences for economic
growth.


                                                           5
Downstream Sector The final good Z(t) is produced in the downstream sector by infinitely many
competitive firms that combine inputs from M different industries according to the following constant
elasticity of substitution (CES) production function
                                                                                       γ
                                                1 XM          γ−1 γ−1
                                        Z (t) =        Yi (t)  γ      .                                             (1)
                                                M  i=1

In this production function, Yi (t) is the aggregate output from industry i ∈ {1, ..., M }. The economy
consists of M ∈ Z+ industries. In the context of firm-level data, each industry i can be thought of
as a different 1-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code and Z(t) is simply the aggregate
GDP of the economy.2 We normalize the price of the final good to 1 at every instant t without any
loss of generality. For notational simplicity, time subscripts will henceforth be suppressed.

Midstream Sector Each industry aggregate Yi is produced competitively, combining inputs from
a continuum of product lines. Let yij denote the production of upstream good j in industry i by the
firm that has the best technology in that product line. Industry aggregate i is produced according to
the following CES production function
                                                                                ε
                                                      Z       1    ε−1
                                                                              ε−1
                                              Yi =                   ε
                                                                   yij dj            .                              (2)
                                                           0


Upstream Sector In product line j, the firm that has the latest (and also the best) technology
produces as a monopolist according to the following linear production technology that takes only labor
as an input
                                                      yij = qij lij                                                 (3)

where qij > 0 is the labor productivity associated with product line j and lij is the number of
production workers employed. Let us denote the wage rate in the economy by w in terms of the final

Definition of a Firm In this model, as in Klette and Kortum (2004), a firm is defined as a
collection of product lines in which it is the lead producer. These product lines can come from
multiple industries. In what follows, mf ∈ {1, .., M } will denote the number of industries in which
the firm actively operates, nif ∈ Z+ will denote the number of product lines firm f owns in a given
industry i, and finally nf will stand for the total number of product lines owned by the firm and will
             P
satisfy nf ≡ i∈m nif . For notational tractability, henceforth we will drop the firm index f , when it
creates no confusion.

    Note that we introduce this multi-industry structure in order to model cross-industry spillovers. To avoid any
additional theoretical complications, we will focus on symmetric equilibria in which industry aggregates assume a common
value.


                                                                   6
       A firm’s payoff in a given product line j in industry i depends on its productivity level qij . There-
fore, the payoff-relevant state of a firm is denoted by

                                                           q = (q1 , q2 , . . . , qm )

where qi = {qi,1 , qi,2 , . . . , qi,ni } is a multi-set keeping track of all the productivity levels of the firm
in industry i where it has the best technology.3 Working with such a large and complex state space
proves burdensome in practice. Later on, we will impose sufficient assumptions that allow us to use a
much simpler equivalent representation of a firm’s product portfolio.

Example 1 An example is helpful to summarize the description so far. Figure 3 illustrates an example
of an economy that consists of M = 3 industries. It also shows an example of a firm (f ) that operates
in m = 2 industries (i = 1 and i = 3) and has n1 = 3 product lines in industry i = 1 and n3 = 2
product lines in i = 3. This firm does not currently operate in industry i = 2.

       A firm’s portfolio of products will expand through successful innovation. Likewise, it will lose
product lines when other firms or potential entrants successfully innovate on one of its product lines
(thus stealing it). These innovations will be the source of economic growth in this economy. The next
subsection will describe the details of the innovation technology.

2.1.2      Innovation and Technological Progress

In this economy, there are two types of innovations (basic and applied) and two different groups of
agents (private and public sectors) generating productivity growth.
       Firms invest in both basic and applied research, thus generating innovations that drive produc-
tivity growth. As Nelson (1959) and Aghion and Howitt (1996) describe it, fundamental advances
in technological knowledge come through basic innovation and open up windows of opportunity for
future research. Applied innovation builds on these existing basic innovations, thus realizing these
opportunities. That being said, innovations eventually run into diminishing returns. If the latest basic
innovation in a product line becomes outdated, applied innovations in that product line become less
   3
    A multi-set is a generalization of a set that can contain more than one instances of the same member. For instance,
given j 6= j 0 , a multiset qif can contain qif (j) and qif (j 0 ) regardless of whether qif (j) = qif (j 0 ).


                                                                         7
productive until a new basic innovation introduces additional fundamental knowledge that can make
the applied innovation more productive again. Therefore, there will be complementarity between the
two types of innovation at the aggregate level.
      These innovations come from two sources: First, the private sector invests in both basic and applied
innovation with the goal of increasing their market share. Second, the government uses tax revenues to
fund public research labs to produce basic innovations. In what follows, we are going to describe firms’
research technology and the distinction between basic and applied research. Then we will describe the
public research technology.


Research by Private Firms Firms choose their flow rate of innovation and pay a labor cost that
is increasing and convex in this rate. Basic and applied research levels are chosen separately, and
there is no complementarity between them in terms of research costs. For the innovation production
function, we will follow the literature (see Klette and Kortum (2004), Lentz and Mortensen (2008),
Acemoglu, Akcigit, Hanley, and Kerr (2016), and Acemoglu, Akcigit, Bloom, and Kerr (2013)). Firms
undertake innovation by combining their existing, non-tradable intangible capital with researchers
(hired at wage rate w, as with production workers) in a Cobb-Douglas production function. In our
model, the intangible capital stock in a particular industry i is proxied by the number of product lines
ni that a firm owns in that industry. The production function for applied and basic research then
takes the following form

                                           1− ν1      1                     1− ν1     ν
                                                                                       1

                                   Ai = ni     a
                                                   Haiνa Ωa   and Bi = ni       b
                                                                                    Hbib Ωb

where Ωa , Ωb > 0 are scale parameters, νa , νb > 1 are the inverse of the innovation production function
elasticities with respect to researchers and Hai and Hbi denote the number of researchers that firm f
needs to hire in order to generate the Poisson flow rates for applied (Ai ) and basic research (Bi ) in
industry i.
      The above specifications, which are standard in this class of models, capture the idea that a firm’s
knowledge capital facilitates innovation.4 Let us define ai ≡ Ai /ni and bi ≡ Bi /ni as the applied
and basic innovation intensities. Similarly, let ha (ai ) ≡ Hai /ni and hb (bi ) ≡ Hbi /ni be defined as
the number of researchers per product line hired for applied and basic research. As a result, we can
summarize the cost of doing applied and basic research as

                              Ca (ai | ni ) = wni aνi a ξa    and Cb (bi | ni ) = wni bνi b ξb             (5)

                                              −νb
where w is the wage rate, ξa ≡ Ω−ν
                                a , and ξb ≡ Ωb . Notice that total cost is directly proportional to
                                  a


the number of product lines.
      Similar to Klette and Kortum (2004), Lentz and Mortensen (2008), Acemoglu, Akcigit, Hanley,
and Kerr (2016), and Acemoglu, Akcigit, Bloom, and Kerr (2013), both applied and basic research
are directed toward particular industries but undirected within those industries. In other words, once
  4
      It also simplifies the analysis by making the problem proportional to the number of product lines.

a firm chooses Ai and Bi , the realization of innovations will take place on a random product within
industry i.
   Innovation through basic research introduces a new generation of fundamental technical knowledge.
The utilization of this fundamental knowledge for production requires that the firm have what we
call industry-specific working knowledge. This translates one of the main insights on basic research
presented in the introduction into our model. Although the knowledge generated by basic research is
often applicable to many industries, the ability to turn it into patents and capture its full economic
value critically depends on the spectrum of activities and technologies operated by the firm. In the
model, we say that each firm has sufficient working knowledge for utilization only in the industries
where it has undertaken production (m). For now, we take the joint distribution Γm,n over m and n
as given but we will endogenize it in the generalized model in Section 2.3.
   Let qij (t) be the highest productivity technology for producing j in industry i. When a firm that
has working knowledge in i produces a basic innovation that has a direct application in industry i and
product line j, the same firm uses this basic knowledge for production and patents this new high-value
technology. As a result, the firm improves qij (t) by η q̄i (t)

                                        qij (t + ∆t) = qij (t) + η q̄i (t)                           (6)

where η > 0 is the step size, and q̄i is the productivity index defined in equation (4). When the firm
produces this new innovation, it adds this product line with the productivity improvement into its
portfolio q(t + ∆t) = q(t) ∪ {qij (t + ∆t)}, which generates per-period profit of π (qij (t + ∆t)). Going
back to Example 1, firm f would increase its total number of product lines from 5 to 6 with this basic
innovation.
   Moreover, basic research features two potential spillovers:

   • within-industry spillover : Each new basic innovation changes the evolution of the product line
      by introducing a radically new technology. The introduction of this new basic technology causes
      subsequent applied innovations to be larger until the latest basic technology becomes outdated
      through some random process. We refer to product lines just hit by basic innovation as hot
      product lines, as opposed to cold product lines, whose latest basic innovation has become out-
      dated.

   • cross-industry spillover : Each new basic innovation has the potential for spillovers into other
      industries. With some probability a basic innovation will generate an additional basic innovation
      in some other industry. If the firm has working knowledge in this other industry, it can use the
      innovation for production. Otherwise, the new technology contributes to the pool of existing
      basic knowledge and will eventually contribute to a new consumer product made by some other
      producer.

   These two types of spillovers lie at the heart of our analysis; therefore, we will now discuss each in
more detail.

                                                        9
Within-Industry Spillover from Basic Research                                        Applied research makes use of the within-
industry spillover from basic research and builds on the existing latest basic technological knowledge
in a product line. The productivity of each applied innovation is a function of how depreciated the
latest basic technology is. If the latest basic knowledge in j is undepreciated (i.e., still hot), a successful
applied innovation will benefit from it and improve the latest productivity qij (t) of that product line
by η q̄i (t), as in expression (6): qij (t + ∆t) = qij (t) + η q̄i (t). If the latest basic technology of the product
line is depreciated (i.e., cold), a successful applied innovation will improve the latest productivity only
by an amount proportional to λ < η so that

                                                qij (t + ∆t) = qij (t) + λq̄i (t).                                               (7)

We assume that a new basic technology depreciates (innovations run into diminishing returns) at a
Poisson rate ζ > 0. On the other hand, a new basic innovation reactivates the product line until the
next time it cools down again. Let us denote the arrival rate of basic innovations to product lines
by τb . Then during a small time interval ∆t, each product line will be subject to the transition rates
denoted in Table 1:

Cross-Industry Spillover from Basic Research                Basic research features an additional element
of uncertainty arising from random spillovers into other industries. When a firm successfully innovates
through basic research, the resulting new fundamental knowledge will be applied first by that firm to
increment the productivity of a random product in the target industry.
   The characteristic feature of basic research we wish to capture is that it often has applications in
many industries other than the one for which it was originally intended. Therefore, we will assume
that when a basic innovation occurs, it applies with probability one to the target industry, and with
probability p ∈ (0, 1), it generates an additional basic innovation in another industry determined by
nature at random. Thus, p is our measure of the intensity of cross-industry spillovers. Let 1i,i0 be an
indicator function that takes a value of one if a basic innovation in industry i has an application in
industry i0 and zero otherwise. Then the unconditional probabilities satisfy
                                                 (

The spillover innovation in industry i0 will be of step size η as well but will not generate additional cross-
industry spillovers. This new innovation will be used by the same firm f if it has working knowledge
in i0 . Otherwise the production potential of this innovation will be used by the next inventor in that
product line.
   This structure captures a hypothesis put forth by Nelson (1959). When a firm generates some
basic knowledge, it can turn this into an immediate application only in the sectors in which it has
working knowledge. In order to capture the full return from new basic scientific knowledge in industries
where a firm is not present but the knowledge could have an application, the innovating firm must
first patent and then license or sell the innovation to other firms in those industries. However, the
applications of significant scientific advances are often not immediate and firms can generally turn
them into patentable applications only in their own industries using their expertise in the field.

Example 2 Cross-industry spillovers are depicted in Figure 5. Firm f from Example 1 now produces
a basic innovation in industry 3. This adds a new product line to the firm’s portfolio and hence the
number of product lines of the firm goes from 2 to 3 in i = 3. In addition, this basic knowledge has a
potential application in industries i = 1 and i = 2 with probability p. The spillover in industry i = 1
is used by the firm since it has working knowledge there. However, the application in i = 2 is not
immediate to the firm due to lack of working knowledge and therefore it is not used by the current firm
but contributes to the pool of basic knowledge in i = 2, which can be used by another firm in the future.

   Recall that m denotes the number of industries in which a firm has working knowledge. Then the
probability of a utilized spillover for the firm is
                                                p (m − 1)
                                         ρm ≡             ∈ [0, 1).
                                                  M −1
This highlights the well-known appropriability problem of basic research. There is a significant chance
that the new basic knowledge will be relevant to multiple industries, but it is not always clear that a

firm will be in a position to exploit all of these avenues of production and patenting. However, firms
operating in more industries will have a greater probability of being able to directly use all facets of a
basic innovation. As Nelson puts it, firms that have fingers in many pies have a higher probability of
using the results of basic research. A broad technological base increases the probability of benefiting
from successful basic research.


Public Basic Research            In our model, the academic sector will be the other source of basic knowl-
edge creation. One of the main tasks of public research labs in an economy is to produce the necessary
basic scientific knowledge that will be part of the engine for subsequent applied innovations and growth.
We assume that the public research sector consists of a measure U of research labs per industry. Each
lab receives the same transfer R̄ from the government to finance its research which results in an overall
funding level of R = R̄ × U × M .
       We assume that each public research lab generates a flow rate of u by hiring hu researchers with
                                                                                                                    1

the same basic research technology as a one-product firm in (5), so that u = Ωb hub .5 This specification
implies that the government can affect the basic knowledge pool in the economy through the amount
of funds R allocated to the academic sector. The flow rate of basic innovation from the academic
sector will satisfy
                                                                                1
                                                                u = R̄/w        νB
                                                                                     Ωb                                         (9)

where u is the academic basic innovation flow per lab. In this economy, R is a policy lever controlled
by the policymaker. As with private firms, each basic innovation generated by the academic sector
applies to industry i and a random product line j and makes that product line hot. However, this
innovation by public labs will turn into output only upon a subsequent private applied innovation. In
addition to i, the same basic knowledge will contribute to the basic knowledge pool in another industry
i0 6= i and line j 0 with probability p ∈ (0, 1) . Note that the equilibrium fraction of hot product lines α
will be determined by the aggregate rates of public (u) and private (bm ) basic research as well as the
cool-down rate (ζ).
   5
    In reality, public research labs may have a different research technology than private labs. However, obtaining data
on both the inputs and outputs of individual public labs is difficult. The separate estimation of public and private
innovation production functions is left for future research.


                                                                       12
Remark It is important to note that we assume that innovation done by public labs is turned into
        consumer products only upon subsequent innovation by private firms. The lag between the
        creation of publicly funded innovations and actual goods production is empirically shown in a
        large literature.6 This important issue is generally overlooked in the theoretical growth literature.
        Inclusion of this feature generates some new and interesting dynamics, such as the importance
        of involvement of the private sector in basic research.


Entry and Exit          The research technology for a single outside entrant is assumed to be the same as
that of applied innovation for a firm with a single product line. Thus if an outside entrant hires he
                                                                          1
researchers, it produces a flow probability of entry of ae = heνa Ωa .
      There is a mass E of outside entrants per industry. Varying this parameter will control the relative
importance of outside entry in the economy. This will imply that creative destruction arising from
new entrants will be equal to E × ae .
      In our model, there will be both endogenous and exogenous channels for firm exit. First, a firm
that loses all of its product lines to other competitors will have a value of zero and thus will exit.
Second, each firm has an exogenous death rate κ > 0. When this occurs, the firm sells all of its
product lines to random firms at a “fire sale” price P.7 On the flip side, firms will receive a buyout
option with a probability that is proportional to their number of products.


Labor Market          Labor is split between production (Lp ) and research labor. Research labor can be
further subdivided into that devoted to private basic (Lb ), public basic (Lu ), private applied research
(La ) and firm entry (Le ). Since the total labor supply is M workers, the labor market clearing condition
is given by
                                          M = Lp + Lb + La + Le + Lu .

The labor utilization from each component can be expressed in a more concise form when we investigate
the properties of the dynamic equilibrium in the next section.


Household Problem             Finally, we close the model by describing the household problem that de-
termines the equilibrium interest rate in this model. The household consumes the final good and
maximizes the following lifetime utility
                                                   ∞
                                                                   C(t)1−γ − 1

where C (t) is consumption at time t, γ is the constant relative risk aversion parameter, and δ is the
discount rate. The household owns all the firms in the economy, which generates a risk-free flow return
of r in aggregate. The household also supplies labor in the economy, through which it earns wage
rate w (t). Finally, the household pays a lump-sum tax T (t) ≥ 0 every instant. Thus, the household’s

      The exact value of this price will not play any role for the equilibrium determination.

intertemporal maximization is simply to maximize (10) subject to the following budget constraint

                                    C (t) + Ȧ (t) ≤ r (t) A (t) + M w (t) − T (t)

where A (t) is the asset holdings of the household.

2.2    Equilibrium

In this section, we characterize the dynamic equilibrium of our model. Our focus is on a symmetric
balanced-growth-path (SBGP) equilibrium where all industries start with the same initial conditions
at time t = 0 and all aggregate variables grow at the same endogenous rate g.
    In this model, three variables affect the payoff of the firm: the number of product lines n, the
number of industries m, and the relative productivity

                                                        q̂ij ≡ qij /q̄i                                                (11)

of its product lines, which is the absolute productivity in line j normalized by the productivity index
q̄i in industry i. Thus, each incumbent firm is characterized by its state k ≡ (q̂, n, m) .
    More specifically, given a government policy sequence [T (t)]∞
                                                                 t=0 , an SBGP equilibrium is composed
of a sequence of intermediate good quantities, prices, the basic and applied innovation rates of private
firms and entrants, the wage rate and interest rate, the joint distribution of multi-industry presence
and product count, hot and cold product line productivity distributions, the fraction of hot product
lines, i.e., [yk (t) , pk (t) , bk (t) , ak (t) , ae (t) , w (t) , r (t) , Γm,n (t) , FH (t) , FL (t) , α (t)]∞
                                                                                                              t=0 , such that
all firms choose quantity and price to maximize their profits, incumbent and entrant firms invest in
research to maximize their firm value, the labor market clears, the household maximizes its discounted
sum of future utilities, and the distributions satisfy the relevant flow equations.


Solution of the Model            The standard monopoly profit maximization delivers the following familiar
equilibrium price and quantities (interested readers are referred to the Appendix Section A for the
detailed derivations)
                                                                                  1
                                          yj = q̂j Z      and            pj =         .                               (12)
                                                                                 M q̂j
Clearly, a monopolist’s quantity is increasing and price decreasing in the relative productivity q̂ of
the product line. Finally, the equilibrium profits of the monopolist are again increasing in its relative
productivity q̂ and the average market size Z/M :

                                                               q̂ ε−1 Z
                                                    π(q̂) =             .                                              (13)
                                                                   ε M
Next, only in this section, we focus on myopic firms that maximize their one-period-ahead returns (as
opposed to forward-looking firms that maximize the discounted sum of future profits). This will allow
us to provide some useful analytical results and highlight the key economic forces of our model. In
our quantitative analysis (Section 3), we will generalize this and focus on forward-looking firms.

                                                              14
Myopic Firms       Consider now a firm that has n product lines in m industries. Moreover, in an
SBGP, an α fraction of product lines are hot. Then the maximization problem when deciding for the
amount of basic research can be written as

                                   max nbm (1 + ρm ) V H − w̃nbνb ξb
                                      
                                    bm

                                                                                               w
where V H ≡ EH
             q̂ π (q̂ + η) is the expected return to a successful basic innovation and w̃ ≡   Z/M   is the
normalized wage rate. Several observations are in order. First, the expected return from basic research
investment is increasing as the firm has fingers in more pies as Nelson argued (higher ρm ). Second,
the innovations are undirected within industries; therefore, the firm has to form an expectation for
the expected profit EH
                     q̂ π (q̂ + η), which means that we have to keep track of the invariant relative
productivity distribution to compute V H . Finally, both the returns and the costs are proportional to
the number of product lines n, which makes the problem much more tractable and the quantitative
solution manageable. Now we can express the first-order condition as
                                                                  ν 1−1
                                                (1 + ρm ) V H
                                                
                                                                    b
                                         bm   =
                                                    νb ξb w̃
The most important result here is the fact that basic research investment is increasing in the multi-
industry presence of the firm. The strength of this positive relationship will be mainly governed by
the probability of the cross-industry spillover parameter p, which will help us match Figure 2.

Fact 1 A firm’s basic research investment is increasing in its multi-industry presence.

   Both private firms and public research labs are generating basic research in this economy. It
is useful to break down total basic research into its embodied and disembodied components. The
distinction is based on whether the basic knowledge is immediately turned into a consumer product
(embodied) or simply added to the stock of knowledge available for future innovators (disembodied).
We obtain the following aggregates


                                                    M
                                                    X
                            Embodied: τbe ≡               µm (1 + ρm )bm
                                                    m=1
                                                    XM
                         Disembodied: τbd ≡              µm (p   − ρm )bm + (1 + p)u                 (14)
                                                    m=1
                                 Total: τb ≡        τbe + τbd

where we define the mass of product lines owned by firms in m industries by µm , which can be computed
from the joint distribution using µm ≡ ∞                        e      d
                                        P
                                           n=1 n · Γm,n . Then τb and τb correspond respectively to the
embodied and disembodied components of basic research. Note that the disembodied component
includes both private spillovers that are unused and the results of public basic innovation. Finally, τb
is simply the overall flow of basic innovation, including all spillovers.
   Using this aggregate rate and the cool-down rate ζ, we can express the steady-state flow equation:
the number of product lines that become hot must be equal to the number of product lines that cool

                                                     15
down. In other words, we must have αζ = (1 − α)τb . As a result, the steady-state fraction of hot
product lines is
                                                    τb
                                                α=       .                                       (15)
                                                  ζ + τb
The share of hot product lines, those having basic knowledge that can be turned into better consumer
products (α), is increasing in the amount of basic research flow. This expression highlights the role of
public policy in affecting the knowledge stock. The more money is allocated to public basic research,
the higher will be the basic research flow from public research labs (u), which will then increase the
fraction of hot product lines through τb , as in (14) and (15).
   However, a bigger α is meaningful only when there is subsequent applied research that turns this
existing basic knowledge stock into consumer products. Therefore, we now turn to the applied research
decision of the firms. Their maximization problem is simply

                                max na αV H + (1 − α)V C − w̃naνa ξa

                                                                                C ≡ EC π (q̂ + λ) is that

from cold ones and w̃ =   Z/M   is the normalized wage rate. When investing in applied research, firms
form two types of expectations. The first one is due to the undirected nature of research: firms have
to form expectations over the relative productivity q̂ that they are going to land on. The second, and
more important one, is due to the complementarity between basic and applied research: firms take
into account the fraction of hot product lines. Firms invest in applied research according to
                                                                   1

The crucial observation here is the complementarity between basic and applied research. In equilibrium
V H > V C since hot product lines are associated with a larger step size η. Hence, if there are more hot
product lines (a higher α), each firm increases its investment in applied research.

Fact 2 Basic and applied research investments are complementary. In particular, higher public basic
research investment encourages firms to invest more in applied research.

   However, the fraction of hot product lines α is not sufficient to determine the incentives for applied
research alone due to the correlation between this product state and productivity. The incentives
will be a function of the fraction of hot and cold product lines and the average qualities within those
types. In particular, firms must know the values of EH
                                                     q̂ (q̂ + η)
                                                                ε−1 and EC (q̂ + λ)ε−1 due to the exact
                                                                         q̂
form of the profit function in equation (13). Therefore, Lemma 1 describes the laws of motion for the
type-specific productivity distributions.
   Let us denote the aggregate rate of applied innovation by τa such that
                                                M
                                                X
                                         τa =         µm am + Eae .                                 (16)
                                                m=1

Note that in the baseline model, am = a for all m, but this will not necessarily be the case in the
general model in Section 2.3. Recall that τbe denotes the arrival rate of embodied basic research, as

                                                      16
defined in (14). Now we can denote the aggregate rate of creative destruction (the rate at which firms
lose product lines to other firms) by τ :
                                                      τ ≡ τa + τbe .                                            (17)

Creative destruction is determined by the rate at which incumbents produce basic innovations which
can be embodied into production immediately (τbe ), and by the rate at which incumbents and entrants
produce applied innovations (τa ). Now we are ready to state the following lemma.

Lemma 1 Let FH (·, t) and FC (·, t) be the aggregate product cumulative measures by type (hot or cold).
The flow equations for these objects are, respectively,

       ḞH (q̂) = −τ [FH (q̂) − FH (q̂ − η)] + τbe FC (q̂ − η) − ζFH (q̂) + τbd FC (q̂) + g q̂[∂FH (q̂)/∂ q̂]
       ḞC (q̂) = −τa [FC (q̂) − FC (q̂ − λ)] − τb FC (q̂) + ζFH (q̂) + g q̂[∂FC (q̂)/∂ q̂]

Proof. See Appendix A.
   The labor market clearing condition can now be expressed in terms of the above endogenous
variables. One additional relationship we will exploit is that between the mass of labor devoted to
production and the normalized wage rate. This can be derived from the goods production specification
(see Section A in the Appendix for its detailed derivation)
                                                                      
                                                         Z       ε−1
                                                    Lp =
                                                         w        ε

Using this and the symmetric nature of the equilibrium, we express the labor market clearing condition
as an average over industries
                                                                         !
                          1        ε−1               X
                       1=                    + ξb        µm bνmb + U uνb       + ξa (aνa + Eaνea )              (18)
                          w̃        ε                m

This expression equates the labor supply per industry (= 1 since the total labor supply is M ) to labor
demand for production workers; private basic researchers, which is a function of the multi-industry
presence of the firms; public basic researchers, which is determined by public policy; incumbent applied
researchers; and entrant basic researchers.
   Finally, plugging the equilibrium intermediate good quantity (12) into the aggregate production
functions (2) and (1), we find that the aggregate output is

                                                      Z = q̄Lp /M                                               (19)

This expression simply says that the aggregate output is equal to the product of the number of
workers employed for production and the aggregate productivity index of the economy. In an SBGP
equilibrium, the labor allocated for production is constant. Therefore the growth rate of aggregate
output (and also output per worker) will be equal to the growth rate of the productivity index q̄. The
following proposition provides the exact growth rate of the productivity index.

                                                           17
Proposition 1 In an SBGP, the growth rate of the productivity index is
                 h                                            i     h                  i

                                                 ε−1

Proof. See Appendix A
   This growth expression shows that the engines of economic progress include both applied and basic
innovation. More important, the basic knowledge stock in the economy, represented by α, makes each
applied innovation more valuable and contributes more to growth (since η > λ). This expression shows
how public funding can contribute to growth through its indirect impact on private research.
   To sum up, let us briefly discuss the sources of inefficiency and what policy can achieve in this
model. First, as in standard quality ladder models, there are intertemporal spillovers within each
product line. Second, firms simply enjoy the expected duration of monopoly power due to the com-
petition channel of creative destruction. As a result, the private value of innovation differs from the
social value of innovation. It is also worth highlighting that in this model, there could be either
over- or underinvestment in R&D. In addition to the standard channels, our model features additional
spillovers due to basic research, both within and across industries. Finally, there are additional static
distortions due to monopoly power. However, since we are primarily interested in the dynamic inef-
ficiencies associated with innovation and basic research, we will consider the case of a social planner
who is still subject to monopoly distortions on the production side.
   All of these inefficiencies will generate room for innovation policy, and our estimated model will
govern whether there is over- or underinvestment in the various types of research expenditures in the
decentralized equilibrium. It will also provide a framework within which to evaluate the effects of
these innovation policies.

2.3   Generalizations of the Model

The previous section introduced a simplified version of the main model to highlight the key economic
forces in analytical forms. Our ultimate goal in this paper is to bring this general equilibrium frame-
work to the data. Therefore, this section generalizes the baseline model to provide richer and more
realistic dynamics (with forward-looking firms and heterogeneous innovation qualities, for instance)
for the economy and its agents and to give the model some more flexibility to match the data (e.g.,
introducing the fixed cost of doing basic research). Those not interested in the technical details can
skip directly to the quantitative Section 3.


Stochastic Innovation Step Sizes        Stokes (1997) argued that technological breakthroughs do not
necessarily derive from basic research. According to the “Pasteur Quadrant” hypothesis, applied
research efforts can potentially also lead to important technological changes. Our first generalization
takes this possibility into account by introducing stochastic innovation step sizes into the model. We
assume, as in Klette and Kortum (2004) and Lentz and Mortensen (2008), that these step sizes are
drawn from exponential distributions. For basic research, the mean of the distribution is always η.

                                                   18
For applied research, the distribution mean is η if the product line is hot and λ if it is cold. It is
important to note that we do not take any stand on the comparison of the average step sizes (η > λ
or vice versa) and let them be determined by the data.

Fixed Cost of Basic Research In our sample, some firms do not invest in basic research. To
capture this fact, we generalize the basic research technology by introducing a fixed cost of doing
basic research. At each instant, a firm with n product lines draws a fixed labor cost of doing basic
research nφ ≥ 0, where φ is distributed according to the distribution B(·). Then a firm that operates
in n product lines and has a fixed cost of basic research φ this period has the following cost function
Cb (bm | n, φ) = ncb (bm | φ). This implies that firms will follow a cutoff rule as a function of their
multi-industry presence φ∗m such that they will not invest in basic research if φ > φ∗m . Otherwise, in
addition to the variable cost, they will also pay the fixed cost.

Industry Expansion (Start-up Buy-outs) In the baseline model, we took the working knowledge
of the firms (m) as exogenously given. We now endogenize m by introducing the possibility of buy-out
offers for new entrants. The economy features E × ae flow of entry at any instant. We will assume
that a ς fraction of new entrants will meet a randomly selected incumbent firm. Thus, an incumbent
will have a flow rate of incoming buy-out offers

                                              x ≡ ςEae /F.

where F is the equilibrium measure of firms. If n̄ denotes the average number of product lines per firm,
then F = 1/n̄. Clearly this new company will be from a new industry with probability (1 − m/M )
or from an industry that already exists in the incumbent’s portfolio with probability m/M. Our goal
is to keep the M&A margin as tractable as possible, and we will achieve this by assuming that the
M&A price that the incumbent firm has to pay is equal to the full surplus of the new merger. The
resulting invariant joint distribution Γm,n over multi-industry presence m and firm product count n is
described in Appendix A.

Forward-Looking Firms         For expositional purposes, in the previous section we described the model
with myopic firms that maximize their one-period-ahead returns. For the rest of our analysis, we relax
this assumption and consider firms that maximize the discounted sum of future returns. The analysis
of this new model is very similar to that of the previous model except that the returns to innovation
take the form of a value function that takes into account all future contingencies. The following
proposition provides the exact forms of the value of a firm that has a productivity portfolio q̂ and
operates in m industries.

Proposition 2 Let the value of a firm with a productivity portfolio q̂ in m industries be denoted by
V(q̂, m). This value is equal to
                                                               

                                                                                 q̂,λ


Proof. See Appendix A
    This important result has a number of implications. First, the value of a firm has a tractable
additive form across product lines. Moreover, the firm value has two major components: the first
component is the production value V (q̂), which simply computes the sum of the future discounted
profits where the effective discount rate takes into account the rate of creative destruction τ , the
exogenous destruction rate κ, and the obsolescence of the relative productivity q̂ due to the growth of
q̄. The second component is the R&D option value Vm , which is a direct function of the multi-industry
presence due to the associated internalization of spillovers. Finally, because of the stochastic nature
of step sizes, the expectations now integrate over the productivity (which are type specific) and step
size.

Welfare     Finally, we close this section by describing the SBGP equilibrium welfare. In an SBGP
equilibrium that has an initial consumption C0 and a growth rate of g, welfare is computed as
                                                                             1−γ
                                                     1−γ                               
                               Z ∞                gt                         ε−1
                                             C0 e                1        C0          1
             W (C0 , g)SBGP =      exp (−δt)              dt =                        − 
                                0              1 −   γ         1 − γ   ρ − (1 −  γ) g  ρ

    We will report our results in consumption-equivalent terms. In particular, when two different
public policies T1 and T2 generate different SBGP equilibrium welfare values as W (C0T1 , g T1 ) and
W (C0T2 , g T2 ), we will report β such that

                                       W (βC0T1 , g T1 ) = W (C0T2 , g T2 ).

    In other words, β constitutes the compensating differential in initial consumption that equalizes
the welfare of the two proposed policy environments. It therefore provides an intuitive measure for
evaluating policy tools. This completes the description of the theoretical environment. Now we are
ready to move on to the quantitative analysis.


3       Quantitative Analysis
To test and estimate our model, we rely on a unique combination of datasets on French innovative
firms between 2000 to 2006. The final sample is composed of 13,708 firm-year observations, for which
we provide descriptive statistics in Table 12 of Appendix B. Details regarding data sources, and data
organization are provided in Appendix B.

                                                        20
3.1    Data

R&D Information Information about research investment comes from the annual R&D Survey
conducted by the French Ministry of Research. The survey is conducted in annual waves of cross-
sectional data, and covers a representative sample of French firms of more than 20 employees investing
in R&D. The questionnaire includes extensive information about the financing of R&D. It not only
breaks down R&D investment according to the source of the funds but also provides its allocation to
different types of research. The distinction between basic and applied research is based on the Frascati
manual, and is therefore similar to the NSF definition presented in the introduction


Multi-Industry Activity To measure multi-industry presence, we count the number of distinct
SIC codes in which a firm is present. Our data allow us to identify a firm’s links to different industries
not only through product lines within the same firm but also through its majority ownership links.
We use “Enquete Liaisons Financieres” (LIFI) to identify multiple activities within the same business
group. In addition, we use “Enquete Annuelle des Entreprises” (EAE) to identify multiple activities
within the same firm.
    The LIFI data is based on a yearly survey by INSEE. It covers all economic activities but restricts
its attention to firms that either employ more than 500 employees or generate more than 60 million
euros in revenue, or hold more than 1.2 million euros of traded shares. However, since 1998 the survey
is cross-referenced with information from Bureau Van Dijk and thus covers almost the whole economy.
The LIFI survey contains information that makes it a unique data set for studying multi-market
activity. Besides providing information on direct financial links between firms, it also accounts for
indirect stakes and cross-ownership when identifying the head of the group. This is important as it
allows us to precisely reconstruct the group structure even in the presence of pyramids. This feature
allows us to obtain a reliable account of the structure of business groups in the French economy and,
as a consequence, reliable measures of our key variable, their multi-market presence.
    Since, at the same time, each firm can also operate in several markets, we cross-reference the data
set with the EAE survey by the Ministry of Industry (“Enquete Annuelle des Entreprises”). The
survey is filled out by French firms with more than 20 workers and contains information not only on
the different markets in which a firm operates but also information on market dedicated sales for each
segment. The data cover the vast majority of French firms and span the period 2000-2006.


Balance-Sheet Information We use the firm- and industry-level data sets based on accounting
data extracted again from the EAE files. The data also include unique firm identifiers allowing us to
match them to the R&D and LIFI data.


3.2    Computer Algorithm Outline

An equilibrium of this model is described by a system of five equations in the five variables (τa , τbe , τbd , w̃, g).
This system can be evaluated using the following procedure:

                                                        21
  1. Calculate α and the distribution of q̂ using τa , τbe , τbd , and g according to equations (1) and (15).

  2. Calculate g using, τa , τb , and the distribution over q̂ with equation (20).

  4. Calculate V H = EH
                      q̂,η V (q̂ + η) and V
                                            C = EC V (q̂ + λ) using the relevant step size distribution
                                                 q̂,λ
        and the type-specific productivity distributions.

  5. Find am and bm using first-order conditions with w̃ from equation (21).

  6. Impose an upper bound on n and find the steady state Γm,n using the flow equations in A.

  7. Compute the updated values of τa , τbe , and τbd using (16) and (14).

  8. The difference between the conjectured and updated values of τa , τbe , τbd , and g in conjunction
        with the labor market clearing differential from (18) constitute the five desired equations.

      We use Powell’s (Powell (1970)) hybrid equation solver to solve this set of equations for a given set
of parameters. To minimize the SMM objective function, we perform a search over the parameter space
using a combination of a naive simulated annealing algorithm and a Nelder-Mead simplex (Nelder and
Mead (1965)) algorithm. See Zangwill and Garcia (1981) for more information on solving systems of
nonlinear equations.

3.3      Estimation

In this section we describe the estimation strategy used. We will assume that the fixed costs are drawn
from a lognormal distribution B(φ) with mean φ̄ and variance σ 2 . As a result, the set of parameters
of the model is
                             θ = {δ, γ, ε, p, η, λ, E, U, νa , νb , ξa , ξb , κ, φ̄, σ, ζ, ς} ∈ Θ.

      In our data set,h for each firm fi and each time period t, we have a vector of N observables from the
                                          0
actual data yf t ≡ yf1t . . . yfNt               including the number of industries in which the firm is present,
                                          N ×1
sales, profits, and labor costs. Let the entire data set be denoted by y.
      We use the simulated method of moments (SMM) for the estimation.8 Define Λ (y) and Λ(θ) to
be, respectively, the vectors of real data moments (generated from y) and equilibrium model moments
(generated for some vector of parameters θ). Since certain moments require knowledge of the joint
distribution of firms over the number of products and industries (m, n) and the portfolio of product
qualities q, which has no apparent analytic form, we simulate a large panel of firms to calculate Λ(θ)
to a high degree of accuracy.9
      Our proposed estimator minimizes a quadratic form of the difference between these two vectors

                                  θb = arg min [Λ(θ) − Λ(y)] · W · [Λ(θ) − Λ(y)]                              (22)
                                              θ∈Θ

  8
      See Bloom (2009) and Lentz and Mortensen (2008) for further description and usage information on SMM.

      For our results, we simulate 32K firms with a burn-in time of 100 years and 100 time steps per year.


                                                             22
where W is the weighting matrix. We use a diagonal weighting matrix with entries equal to the inverse
square of the data moment value, or in notational terms Wii = 1/Λi (y)2 and Wij = 0 for i 6= j. In
our estimation, we use 26 moments which we denote as Λ(1) − Λ(26). We pick moments that are most
informative for the unique features of our model.


Status Quo Policies We also take into account that, during the period we consider, there was
existing government support for R&D activities in France. In our data set 10% of coporate R&D is,
on average, publicly funded. Therefore in our estimation, we introduce a uniform subsidy to the total
R&D spending of the firm ψ = 0.10. The government has a balanced budget every period, so that the
sum of total subsidies (S) and public research funding (R) must be equal to tax revenues, that is

                                         M
                                     "                                   #
                                         X
                      T =S+R=ψ                 µm CB (bm | φ) + CA (a) + U CB (u | φ̄)
                                         m=1

where T is a lump-sum tax on consumers. In France, during 2000-2006, the fraction of GDP devoted
to public research labs and academic institutions was approximately 0.5%. Therefore, we pick R/Z,
which is the share of GDP devoted to public basic research, to be 0.5%.

3.4   Identification

In this section we explain the moments that are used to identify our parameters. Since we are minimiz-
ing the weighted distance between the theoretical and empirical moments according to the objective
function in (22), all parameters are identified jointly. Nevertheless, given the dynamics in our model,
we can still provide a heuristic discussion of identification. In Appendix E Table 15, we provide a
Jacobian matrix that reports the sensitivity of each moment to each parameter. This way, we verify,
at least locally, that the moments that we use to identify certain parameters are indeed informative.
   Note that here m̂ denotes the number of industries in which a firm has one or more products,
rather than the number of industries in which the firm has working knowledge (m). Since m is not
directly observable, we must compute the distribution over m̂ through simulation to in order to match
the data.


Basic Research Intensity by Number of Industries, Λ(1-8):                    We define basic research inten-
sity as the ratio of spending on basic research to spending on applied research. Since the effect of
multi-industry presence on this quantity is of critical importance to our model, we have one moment
for each m̂ ∈ {1, . . . , M }. Given a set of parameters and an equilibrium of the model, this moment’s
value for a given m̂ is
                                                               h̄m
                                                                    
                                                                 b

In our estimation, we use M = 10. However, in the data there are only a handful of firms with
m̂ > 8, so we have one moment for each m̂ ∈ {1, . . . , 7} and a final moment which is averaged over
m̂ ∈ {8, 9, 10}. The way in which this moment increases with m̂ identifies the cross-industry spillover

for the basic research cost parameters (ξb ,νb ) .

intensity of multi-industry firms.
                             Table 2 provides further evidence about the relationship between multi-industry presence and basic
research intensity, controlling for size. To account for zeros in the the dependent variable, we estimate
a Tobit model. In all specifications basic research intensity is increasing in the number of industries.
According to the benchmark estimation, presence in an additional industry increases a firm’s basic
research intensity by 3 percentage points on average. In terms of magnitude, this corresponds to a
50% increase in the average basic intensity of a single industry firm.10


Extensive Margin of Basic Research Investment by Number of Industries, Λ(9-16):                                                                           We
use the share of positive basic research spending by each m̂ to identify the mean φ̄ and variance σ 2 of
the fixed cost distribution basic research. This is simply the probability that the idiosyncratic fixed
cost draw is less than the cutoff for a certain m̂
                                                                                                     

Though not plotted here, one can see in the Jacobian matrix in Table 15 that the average fixed cost
parameter φ̄ strongly influences the level of this moment for all values of m̂. Furthermore, the fixed
cost variance parameter σ induces a tilt in these moments across different m̂ values. That is to say,
increasing σ raises the probability of performing basic research for low m̂ firms an lowers it for high
  10
     Table 14 in Section D of the Appendix provides a rich set of robustness checks in terms of control variables, alternative
measures of multi-industry presence, and estimation methods. Most important, it exploits historical ownership structures
and changes in government policies as instrumental variables. The IV estimates are larger in magnitude and seem to
suggest that the positive correlation is not driven by omitted variables.

distribution.


Distribution of m, Λ(17-18):                   We track two moments relating to the distribution of m̂, the mean
and mean squared. They are given by


                                                                       Λ(18) = Em̂ m̂2
                                                                                   
                                       Λ(17) = Em̂ [m̂]      and


Looking to the Jacobian matrix, one can see that the mean m value and the mass of potential en-
trants are closely linked, as successful entrants start with the lowest working knowledge value m = 1.
Similarly, the mean of m2 is strongly influenced by the entrant buyout probability parameter ς. In-
tuitively, when entrants are more likely to be bought out by incumbents, which results in industry
expansion with probability z, this will concentrate industry expertise in existing firms, thus increasing
the dispersion of m.
      Empirically, we calculate the share of firms as a function of the number of 1-Digit SIC industries,
which is the number of distinct SIC codes in which a firm is present. On average firms are present in 2
distinct industries as defined by 1-digit SIC codes. Although nearly 44% of the firms are operating in
only one industry, the remaining firms occupy a large spectrum of industries. The full distribution is
plotted in Figure 7, and the results are very similar when using more disaggregate SIC classifications
(up to the 4-digit SIC level) or when changing the definition of an industry link.11

Notice that there is one fixed component from static production side that yields information on the
value of ε and another from dynamic R&D expenditures that yields information on R&D cost and step
size parameters. Consistent with this, though this moment value arises from a multitude of factors,
the major determinants are ε and the various fixed and variable R&D cost parameters.


Exit Rate, Λ(20):        As exit occurs when firms either receive the exogenous destruction shock or
lose their last product, the predicted exit rate will be
                                                            X

However, for consistency, we simply use the value from the simulated firm sample. This moment serves
primarily to determine the value of the rate of exogenous destruction κ. Additionally, as the bulk of
equilibrium creative destruction τ arises from applied research, this also provides information on the
applied R&D cost parameters νa and ξa .


Total Research Intensity, Λ(21):           We have one moment to track the level of R&D overall: the
ratio of total research labor expenditures spending to total production labor expenditures. Since
research spending is proportional to n, R&D expenditures per product will be the same across firms
with the same m, while employment will be a function of the portfolio of product qualities. Because
the wage is common to both types of labor, this will simply be the ratio of R&D employment to
production employment given by

Conditional on innovation rates, this moment give us information on cost side of R&D, namely the
research production function parameters, as well the benefit side, in the form of innovation step sizes
for basic and applied research, η and λ (see Table 15).


Firm Growth, Λ(22):          We have a moment for employment growth amongst firms. This is cal-
culated conditional on the firm not exiting, since we do not observe the last period’s growth rate for
exiting firms. The moment is calculated by looking at the one-year growth rate of total employment
by a firm. This moment is sensitive to the overall rates of exit and creative destruction, and as such,
yields information on a broad array of parameters. As seen in Table 15, one parameter for which it
shows particular distinction is the CRRA parameter γ.

                                                      26
Aggregate Growth, Λ(23):                 The aggregate growth rate gives information on the effectiveness
of research spending absent effects coming from the distribution of firm size and its relation to firm
growth, particularly on innovation step sizes.
       In our model the household’s welfare depends crucially on the level of aggregate growth, and hitting
that moment is of particular importance. For that purpose, we boost the weighting on the aggregate
growth moment.12


Within-industry Spillover (Hot vs Cold Product Lines), Λ(24):                               In order to quantify the
spillovers associated with basic research, we turn to patent citation data. The model predicts that
innovations that build off of previous basic research should have a larger step size on average. If we
take citations as a proxy for step size, then patents that cite basic research should themselves have
more citations.
       This effect will diminish with the age of the patent due to product line cooldown. Thus the average
time after which a public innovation is indistinguishable from a private innovation should be

                                                              1  τa 
                                                   Λ(24) =
                                                              ζ τ

This yields direct information on the value of the cooldown rate ζ, as seen in the Jacobian matrix.
       To estimate the cooldown rate of innovations deriving from basic research, we use the NBER patent
data set covering the period 1974-2006. Two empirical issues need to be addressed: (i) distinguishing
patents derived from basic and applied research, and (ii) capturing the idea of successively less original
contributions. We address the first point by distinguishing between patents applied for by corporations
from patents applied for by public institutions. We address the second point by computing a citation-
based measure of the marginal contribution of citing patents over time.13
       For each patent we first identify citing patents across time. For each of the citing patents we
then compute their cumulative 10-years-forward citations. Our measure, Quality of Citing Patents,
captures the marginal importance of each successive citing patent. Table 3 tests the mean difference
of this measure between patents originated in the public sector, and patents originated in the private
sector.
       Table 3 confirms that public patents are followed up by higher quality patents relative to private
patents. The difference oscillates between 0.3 to 0.7 citations, and is statistically significant in the
first 7 years. The importance of citing patents is stable until the original public patent is 8 years
old, at which point there is a significant drop in citations of citing patents from 2.4 to 1.7. This
is when the difference between private and public, in terms of citations, becomes economically and
  12
    Increasing the weighthing factor to 3 was sufficient to align the aggregate growth rate in the data and the model.
  13
    The use of US patent data was linked to the availability for a long time horizon of publicly available data on patents
granted, depositor classification, and the associated citations. The analysis of our final data set will focus exclusively
on French patenters but the construction of the different variables uses information from the entire data set. While our
proxy is simple to measure in the data, it potentially misclassifies the contribution of private basic patents. However,
given that our interest lies in the relative difference between those two groups of patents across time, time invariant
errors in the classification should not impact our conclusions. Appendix C provides a more detailed explanation of the
construction of the variables.

statistically non-significant. The results are similar when using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.
This time pattern will yield direct information on the value of the cooldown rate ζ.


Firm Age, Λ(25-26):                Firm age is highly correlated with firm size. We track the average age of
firms for those above and below the median firm size. This yields information entry and exit patterns,
as well as on the rate of creative destruction. Moment Λ(25) is the average age of firms below the
median firm size, while moment Λ(26) is the average age for those firms above it.

3.5      Estimation Results

Table 4 reports the values of the estimated structural parameters. The estimated values of the discount
rate and CRRA utility parameters are within their standard macro ranges. The elasticity of substi-
tution parameter generates 17%(= 1/ε) gross profits, resulting in 7.9% net profits after subtracting
R&D expenses as a share of sales.

      One of the most important parameters of our model is the cross-industry spillover parameter
p = 0.11, which measures the probability that a basic innovation will have an additional immediate
application. This estimate affects the extent to which basic innovations contribute to cross-sectional
growth. In equilibrium, firms operate in two industries out of 10 on average. Therefore, any given
spillover is not embodied with probability 89%(= 8/9). Given that the probability of having a spillover
is 11%, the probability of having a disembodied spillover is 10%(= 0.11 ∗ 0.89).
      The estimated innovation size of basic research is η = 7.9% and the innovation size of each new
applied innovation is λ = 4.9%. This implies that basic research (hot product lines) makes applied

                                                               28
innovation 60%(= 7.9/4.9 − 1) more productive.
   Additionally, each basic innovation has a within-industry spillover. The cool-down rate of hot
product lines is estimated to be ζ = 0.12, which indicates that a basic innovation affects the subsequent
innovations in the same product line for almost 8.3(= 1/0.12) years on average.
   The elasticity of applied innovation counts with respect to the research dollars spent is estimated
to be 0.73 (= 1/νa ) and similarly the elasticity of basic innovation with respect to the basic research
investment is 0.65 (= 1/νb ). These values are close to the elasticity estimates in the literature, which
typically finds a value around 0.5 (Griliches (1990), Pakes and Griliches (1984) and Kortum (1992,
1993)).


3.6       Goodness of Fit

In this section, we will first focus on the moments that we targeted in our estimation and then turn
to the moments that we did not directly target but still find useful in understanding the model’s
performance.


Targeted Moments           Table 5 contains the moments from the actual data and our estimated model.

   The results indicate that the model performs very well in generating firm and industry dynamics
similar to those in the data. Consistent with our data, a significant fraction of innovating firms invest
in basic research. In particular, 29% of firms are investing in basic research, which was 27% in the
data. We also capture the positive relationship between the extensive margin of basic research and
multi-industry presence, as evidenced in Table 5 and Figure 8.
   The positive correlation between multi-industry presence of a firm and its basic research intensity
was one of the major predictions of our model. As explained previously in the text, multi-industry
presence plays an important role in increasing basic research incentives, by allowing a greater potential
to internalize the positive spillovers from basic research. In our reduced-form analysis, we confirmed the
significant and positive correlation between multi-industry presence and basic research intensity. This
has been the key moment to identify the cross-industry spillover parameter. Our model successfully
generates this positive correlation.
   In the data, firms operate on average in 2.2 industries, and the same is true in the model. Fur-
thermore, we find the mean squared in the model to be 7.2, compared to 7.0 observed in the data.

                     In addition, the mean profitability is 3.2% in the model and in the data. The prime determinants
of profitability are the step sizes for basic and applied innovation. However, these also affect the
investment levels for both types of research, since this increases the return to successful innovation.
Therefore, the step size parameters are set to be a compromise between hitting the profitability moment
and the research investment and growth moments.
                     We are targeting additional moments regarding research investments. The first is the average ratio
of total research labor to production labor by incumbent firms. The model comes very close to hitting
this ratio exactly (28.4% vs 26.0%), largely in order to hit the aggregate growth and return on sales.
                     All of these components of the economy determine the aggregate growth rate. Our model matches
the observed growth rate closely. Our model economy grows at a rate of 1.3%, while the French
economy grew at an average rate of 1.5% during the period studied (2000-2006).


Untargeted Moments In this part, we discuss our model’s prediction about some of the moments
that we did not directly target.
                     Interestingly, in the data the correlation between profitability and basic research intensity is not
significantly different from zero. The same implication emerges from our model. In the baseline
model, the correlation between profitability and basic research intensity is only 0.04. This result
emerges because basic research investment is determined through the multi-industry presence of the
firms, whereas profitability is determined by the share of hot and cold product lines, type of research
investment, and the productivity distribution F(q̂) in the economy.
                     Our model naturally generates a positive correlation between multi-industry presence and firm
size, which is also empirically true in the data. This arises since both of these moments are strongly
correlated with firm survival. In the model, we find a correlation of 0.52 between the log employment
and multi-industry presence. In the data, this value is 0.76.
                     Another stylized fact in our data is that the firm size distribution is highly skewed. This is a well-

                                                                          30
known feature that is documented extensively in the literature. For detailed references, see Aghion,
Akcigit, and Howitt (2014). In our model, we capture this fact with a skewness of the firm size
distribution of 4.12. This value is 3.07 in the data.
    Our estimates indicate that entrants play an important direct role in overall growth. The innovation
rate from entrants is 0.43%, whereas that number is 0.92% for incumbents. That implies that entrants
account for 32% of growth. Though our number is for the French economy, our number is in line with
Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan (2001) who find that 25% of productivity growth in the US comes
from new entry.
    We will now focus on the details of the equilibrium and the social planner’s problem to study the
efficiency properties of this economy. Then we will turn to various policies that could address this
inefficiency.

    In this table, τa denotes the aggregate rate of applied innovation by incumbents and entrants,
whereas τbe and τbd denote the aggregate rates of embodied and disembodied basic innovation, respec-

growth rate g, and the welfare in consumption equivalent terms β.
    In our benchmark economy, 85.6% of labor is used for production, and 14.4% is employed for
innovation activities. Among researchers, roughly 7% are engaged in basic research activities. Note
that this composition within innovation activities will be the central focus of the policy analysis, since
uninternalized (potential) spillovers are one of the main sources of inefficiency. In order to the study
the welfare properties of this economy, we normalize the benchmark welfare to β = 1.00 and compare
it to the social planner’s optimum, which we will analyze next.


3.8       Quantifying the Social Planner’s Optimum

In this section, we provide the solution to the social planner’s problem. Recall that while the basic
innovation done by the private sector turns into a consumer product immediately, those done by the
public sector (e.g., universities) come from the “Ivory Tower” and turn into a consumer product with
some delay. In order for this to happen, a private firm must do some applied innovation that builds
on the basic knowledge, which happens after 5 years on average (= 1/τa = 1/0.22). This introduces

                                                                         31
the possibility that policies relating to public-private sector partnerships or patenting rights of public
researchers could reduce this delay. We will consider this case in Section 5.
   Before going into the details of the solution, it may be useful to provide an overview of the potential
inefficiencies present in this economy, both static and dynamic:

   1. monopoly distortions on the production side,
   2. (in)efficient applied research investment by private firms,
   3. (in)efficient basic research investment by private firms,
   4. (in)efficient basic research investment by public research labs,
   5. (in)efficient level of entry.


   Since our focus is on innovation policies, we consider a social planner who controls the R&D
production in the economy while being subject to the same monopoly distortions on the production
side (hence we do not consider a production subsidy in our policy analysis either). Table 7 summarizes
these results.

                                                                 e       LSP
                                                                          a           α      g      β
  19.1         5.1        0.2         82.9     5.6      0.5      3.7      7.3        31.1   1.80   103.6



   One striking feature of the solution to the social planner’s problem under both scenarios is that
the fraction of labor devoted to research activities is not substantially greater than in the decentral-
ized equilibrium. In particular, the total labor allocated to production activities was 85.6% in the
decentralized economy, while it is 82.9% when set by the social planner. Hence, there is a slight
overinvestment in production labor relative to research labor, but this misallocation is quantitatively
quite small.
   Indeed, the dominant misallocation here is not that between production and research, as is common
in this class of models, but among the various types of research activities, in this case, applied and
basic innovation. In the decentralized economy, only 1.05% of the total labor force is devoted to basic
research, whereas in the social planner’s economy, this number rises to 6.1%. In other words, the
social planner devotes 36% of research labor to basic research, whereas this fraction was only 7% in
the decentralized economy. This happens on both the intensive and the extensive margins of basic
research. In fact, the planner finds it optimal to employ nearly all private research labs, regardless of
their fixed cost draw.
   Another interesting and important finding is that in the case of applied innovation, there is actually
an overinvestment in the baseline economy. The applied research labor utilization (including entrants)
is 13.6% in the decentralized case. This figure drops to 11% in the social planner’s solution. This is
in spite of the fact that the fraction of hot product lines rises from 7% to 31%, meaning the average

                                                       32
step size of an applied innovation rises by almost a third.
         The net result of the above changes is that growth rises from 1.34% to 1.8%. Overall, the decen-
tralized economy’s welfare corresponds to a decrease of 3.6% in consumption-equivalent terms from
the social planner’s optimum. The following policy experiments will try to bridge this gap.


4         Policy Analysis

In this section, we analyze the impact of different types of research subsidies when public basic research
features delayed applicability (the “Ivory Tower” effect).14 Given our distinction between basic and
applied research, it seems natural to propose different subsidy policies for different types of research
spending. However, this could potentially generate a moral hazard problem, since firms would have
an incentive to misreport the type of research they undertake, which is very difficult for a policymaker
to verify. However, it is still useful to consider this hypothetical case to form a benchmark.
         This section is organized as follows: Section 4.1 starts with this hypothetical case, Section 4.2
considers a uniform research subsidy as in the real world, and finally Section 4.3 combines both
uniform subsidy and public research funding using feasible policy tools.


4.1        Type-Dependent Research Subsidy

Assume first that the policymaker can distinguish between different types of research efforts and
accordingly provide differentiated subsidy rates. Let ψa and ψb denote the applied research and basic
research subsidy rates, respectively. The share of GDP allocated to public research (R/Z) is kept
constant by the policymaker. Note that an increase in the subsidy rate (ψa or ψb ) reduces research
costs for the firm and leads to an increase in research effort as a result. The following table reports
the optimal subsidy rates and resulting equilibrium variables.

                            Table 8: Type-Dependent Research Subsidy (in percentages)

 ψaT D        ψbT D   R/Z    τaT D   τbe,T D   τbd,T D   LTp D    LTb D   LTu D   LTe D   LTa D   αT D   gT D   βT D
    14         50     0.5    19.3     4.50      0.38     83.1     5.3     0.50    3.7     7.5     29.6   1.75   103.0


         Since the underinvestment is mainly in basic research, the optimal type-dependent subsidy dictates
a much larger subsidy rate for it, namely, ψb = 50% and ψa = 14%. Here, the major component of
policy is a fivefold increase in the subsidy rate for basic research, whereas the subsidy rate on applied
innovation remains roughly the same.
         The large value for the basic research subsidy is straightforward to understand. There are spillovers
associated with basic innovation that are not internalized by firms. By subsidizing this type of in-
novation, we can mitigate this effect. This policy can almost achieve the level of welfare seen in the
social planner’s case in Table 7 (103.6% vs 103.0%).
    14
   In Section 5, we will go to the other extreme and consider optimal policies when public basic research also has
immediate applicability.


                                                             33
   As discussed above, this policy is hard to implement in the real world due to the moral hazard
problem. Therefore, we focus on a policy providing a uniform subsidy across the economy.

4.2        Uniform Private Research Subsidy

With this policy, the government subsidizes a fraction ψ of each firm’s total research investment,
keeping the share of funds allocated to academic research constant. Note that such a policy subsidizes
not only basic research but also applied research similar to the current R&D subsidy policy in the
U.S. and around the world. Table 9 summarizes the results of the optimal uniform subsidy rate.

                                                                      e

                                                                            LU
                                                                             a
                                                                               P
                                                                                   αU P    gU P    βU P

   Our analysis of the baseline economy and the planner’s economy documented a slight underinvest-
ment in research overall and a large misallocation between the different types of research. A uniform
subsidy is therefore ill suited to address these issues as it cannot directly affect the allocation between
research types, and any attempt to subsidize basic research will only worsen the overinvestment in
applied research. Although the optimal type-dependent basic subsidy is 50%, the optimal uniform
subsidy is only 31%, due to cross-subsidization of applied research whose optimal level was 14%.
   Under this policy, we are allocating a larger fraction of the labor force to research relative to the
social planner’s economy. Overall, the researcher’s share goes up to 18% from 14%. As a result, we
have too few workers devoted to production of the consumption good (81.8%) relative to the social
planner’s allocation (82.9%), which reduces the initial consumption of the baseline economy. Even
though we have more labor working for research, the economy grows at a lower rate (1.7%) than the
social planner’s (1.8%). This interesting result emerges due to the misallocation of researchers between
basic and applied innovation. The welfare gain from this policy is 0.8 percentage points, which is only
27%(= 0.8/3.0) as large as that for the type-dependent policy.
   Although the underinvestment in basic research is sizable, the uniform policy partially makes up for
this at the cost of worsening the overinvestment in applied research. The main lesson to be drawn from
this is that when considering a uniform research subsidy, one should take into account the negative
welfare effects associated with oversubsidization of applied research. Finding a feasible method to
differentiate basic and applied research is essential for better innovation policies.

4.3        Optimal Feasible Policy: Uniform Subsidy and Academic Budget

Our final policy experiment combines optimal uniform subsidy rate with the optimal public funding
level for academic research as a fraction of GDP (R/Z). We will allow both the uniform subsidy rate
and the academic funding rate to be chosen by the policymaker. The advantage of considering both
types of policies is to introduce more freedom to control the incentives for both types of research in a
largely separate way. In particular, ψ and R/Z are going to be the choice variables in this exercise.

                                                       34
The following table contains the results of this experiment

                   Table 10: Optimal Academic And Uniform Policy (in percentages)

    ψ      R/Z      τa     τbe     τbd    Lp      Lb     Lu      Le      La       α        g        β

     When considered jointly, the optimal uniform R&D subsidy is 31% and the optimal fraction of
GDP allocated for public research is 0.7%. These figures are respectively only 10% and 0.5% in
France (and in the benchmark case). Such a policy increases the fraction of hot product lines from
6.9% to 15.5%. However, one should also note that this policy makes a rather limited contribution to
growth and welfare due to the Ivory Tower nature of academic research. The growth rate increases 0.02
percentage points relative to the optimal uniform policy of Table 9. These improvements are mitigated
by the delayed applicability of the academic research which is partly a consequence of missing property
rights for academic innovations. Policies that speed up this delay could potentially have important
contributions to growth and welfare, which is our focus in the next section.


5        Public Basic Research with Immediate Applicability

So far we have assumed that public innovations have a delayed effect on productivity in a particular
product line. A basic innovation by the public sector impacts the economy only after a private firm
utilizes it with its own applied innovation, which happens every 5 years on average. This generates
some disembodied basic innovations in equilibrium. However, one can argue that some policies enhance
the applicability of academic innovations by allowing universities to retain ownership of inventions
made using federal funds or by building joint ventures with the private sector. This is an interesting
policy question, which we can analyze in our setting. We will study this appropriability problem by
considering a scenario where basic academic research is immediately turned into an innovation. It
should be noted that academic research, as we have all experienced, has a much wider set of objectives
than purely generating consumer products (such as education, to say the least). Although we believe
that they are also very important, our analysis will abstract from those considerations and will mainly
focus on productivity consequences.
     Table 11 considers this new environment where public basic research functions very much like pri-
vate basic research in terms of its applicability. Therefore, in Panel A we again report the equilibrium
values of the status quo economy as in Table 6. When academic research has immediate applicability,
equilibrium welfare improves by 0.4 percentage point and becomes 100.4. In Table 11, we renormalize
this new benchmark to 100.0% (dividing it by 100.4) and the following panels report their welfare
numbers relative to this new benchmark.
     Panel B solves for the social planner problem. This time the welfare gap between the two is bigger
(=4.5%). This is due to the fact that the planner wants to allocate 2.3% of the workforce into public
basic research whereas the current policies allocate only 0.5% of the workforce. In addition, private

                                                   35
firms invest too much into applied research (La = 8.9% compared to 7%) and too little into basic
research (Lb = 0.5% compared to 4.6%).

   Panel C focuses on the optimal uniform R&D subsidy and the results are very similar to Table
9. Equilibrium welfare improves slightly by 0.6 percentage points. The contribution of R&D subsidy
is yet again mitigated by the fact that uniform subsidy increases the applied research investment to
La = 10.6, furthering the overinvestment.

   Panel D studies the optimal uniform subsidy together with the optimal fraction of GDP allocated
for academic research. Under this policy, the optimal rates are 26.1% and 3.3%, respectively. This
policy combination increases the growth rate to 1.92% and achieves the highest welfare result among all
policies considered. By using the level of academic funding to reach the proper share of researchers,
the policymaker is able to lower the uniform subsidy, thus reducing needless cross-subsidization of
applied research. Under the current policy 81.2% of the labor force is allocated to production, a
significant reduction over that of the baseline case in Panel A. This time around, the composition of
workers between applied and basic research is closer to the social optimum. The resulting welfare is
2.7% higher than the status quo economy and closes 60% (=2.7/4.5) of the gap between the social
planner and the decentralized economy.

   To summarize our findings, we first considered the most widely discussed policy, which is a uniform
subsidy. Using this tool optimally yielded limited improvement in welfare due to oversubsidization of
applied research, as the policy could not distinguish between research types with different spillover and
productivity implications. Considering a policy combination that governs both private and academic
research in which the researchers can appropriate the returns to their innovations could generate a
significant improvement. The first main conclusion to be drawn for innovation policy is the importance
of recognizing different types of research and the impact of policies on them. The second is that it is
important to take into account both the direct and indirect effects of academic research on productivity
growth and the role of researchers’ appropriability of their outcomes when considering growth and
innovation policies.

                                                   36
6    Conclusion
In this paper, we distinguished between basic and applied research and identified spillovers associated
with each. Our quantitative analysis highlighted the importance of this distinction. Indeed, in the
competitive equilibrium, applied research is overinvested in and basic research is underinvested in. As
a result, imposing a uniform research subsidy does not generate the expected welfare improvement
due to inefficient cross-subsidization of applied research. The key message of our paper is therefore
that standard R&D policies can accentuate the dynamic misallocation in the economy.
    Interestingly, our policy experiment relative to the uniform research subsidy closely resembles a
recent reform of French R&D policy. In 2008 the French government introduced a 30% tax credit
for all R&D related expenditures of firms. While the new system represented a significant subsidy to
private R&D, with an annual budget of 5 billion Euros, its effectiveness in boosting innovation has
been widely criticized [Larousserie (2015)].
    Our findings can account for the limited impact of such policies, and point to the need for targeting
basic research more directly. Our paper took a first step in trying to quantify the inefficiencies
regarding different types of research and innovation efforts. There are still important open questions
awaiting further study. In particular, the effect of university licensing and collaboration opportunities
between universities and the private sector are two examples. We hope further structural work will
be undertaken to enhance our understanding of the aforementioned issues, which can then guide the
relevant innovation policies.

A     Theoretical Proofs
As the downstream production technology is unchanged in the generalized model and we continue to
impose symmetry across the industries. This implies that
                                              1
                                Pi = P =              and   Yi = Y = Z.                            (23)
                                              M
Henceforth, we can drop the industry index i. The perfectly competitive firm that produces midstream
good Yi takes equilibrium prices P and pj as given while maximizing its profit
                                   ( Z              ε                )
                                          1 ε−1  ε−1     Z 1
                              max P         yj ε dj    −      pj yj dj .
                                yj           0                0

This maximization leads to the following inverse demand for upstream good j
                                                   1
                                                   Y ε
                                          pj = P        .
                                                   yj
Monopolist in product line j, j has productivity qj . The firm takes the demand function for its product
as given and solves the following maximization problem
                                                                 

                                     πj = max P Y yj − yj
                                                      ε  ε
                                           yj                 qj
This delivers the following optimal quantity
                                            1 ε − 1  qj  ε
                                                       
                                     yj =                    Z
                                           M    ε     w
Plugging this into the production function for midstream goods, we find a relationship between wage
                                    R           1

                                                       
                                                 1 ε−1
                                          w=              q̄                                    (24)
                                                 M    ε
With this, we can greatly simplify the expression of the firm’s quantity and price choices as a function
of its normalized productivity q̂j = qj /q̄
                                                                    1
                                     yj = q̂jε Z     and    pj =
                                                                   M q̂j
Denote variables normalized by Z/M with a “∼”. Then the normalized profit and labor are given by
                                    q̂jε−1                q̂jε−1 ε − 1
                                                                       
                              π̃j =           and    lj =                 .                       (25)

where w̃ is the normalized wage. Note that by construction q̂jε−1 dj = 1. As a result, we integrate 25

Finally, we combine 24 and 26 to find the final output as a function of aggregate productivity q̄ and
total production labor LP :
                                            Z = q̄LP /M.

Proof of Lemma 1 Let FH (·, t) and FC (·, t) be the aggregate product cumulative measures by type
(hot or hold) at time t. For a small time step ∆, hot distribution FH (·, t) will satisfy

    FH (q̂, t + ∆) =FH (q̂/(1 + ∆g), t) − ∆τ [FH (q̂/(1 + ∆g), t) − FH (q̂/(1 + ∆g) − η, t)]
                      + ∆τbe FC (q̂/(1 + ∆g) − η, t) − ∆ζFH (q̂/(1 + ∆g), t) + ∆τbd FC (q̂/(1 + ∆g), t)

Similarly, the cold distribution FC (·, t) will satisfy

         FC (q̂, t + ∆) =FC (q̂/(1 + ∆g), t) − ∆τa [FC (q̂/(1 + ∆g), t) − FC (q̂/(1 + ∆g) − λ, t)]
                           − ∆τb FC (q̂/(1 + ∆g), t) + ∆ζFH (q̂/(1 + ∆g), t)

Finally, for i ∈ {H, C}, calculating

                                                         Fi (q̂, t + ∆) − Fi (q̂, t)
                                            Ḟi (q̂) =
                                                                     ∆
and taking the limit as ∆ → 0 yields the desired flow equations. Note that for this we use

                                   Fi (q̂/(1 + ∆g), t) − Fi (q̂, t)
                                                                    = −g q̂[∂Fi (q̂)/∂ q̂]
                                                ∆
    Proof of Proposition 1.              Let F(·, t) be the distribution over q at time t. Similarly, let
FH (·, t) and FC (·, t) be the product type (hot/cold) conditional distributions. Thus, we will have
F(q, t) = αFH (q, t) + (1 − α)FC (q, t). The evolution of the aggregated productivity index q̄ is then
given by

                   =α         q ε−1 dFH (q, t + ∆t) + (1 − α)        q ε−1 dFC (q, t + ∆t)

                                                                  i

Thus the differential is

                                               0

and the normalized differential is

Finally, the growth can be expressed compactly as

    Derivation of Multi-industry Distribution Γm,n .
We assume that when a firm loses its last product in a particular industry, it maintains a foothold
there, in the sense that it still receives buy-out offers and can still directly use basic research relevant
to that industry. When a firm loses all of its products or receives a destructive shock, it ceases to exist.
We wish to find the joint distribution over the number of industries a firm is in and how many product
lines it owns. For notational convenience, let us denote the basic research flow from m-industry firms
by b̂m = B(φm )bm . Let us also denote the expansion rate of a firm into a new industry by em . Here
the expansion rate comes purely from buy-out offers by entrants. So given a per firm buy-out offer
rate of x, a firm in m industries will expand at rate

where we use the convention Γm,−1 = Γm,0 = 0 and e0 = 0. The first line equates the outflows from
(m = 1, n = 1) that happen once the firm loses its product at the rate τ + κ, acquires a new product
line at the rate κ, innovates a new good at the rate a1 + b̂1 on average or expands into a new industry
at the rate e1 . On the other hand, inflow happens from outsiders at the rate ae and from the firms with
2 products that lose one of their products at the rate 2τ . Similar reasoning applies to the subsequent
lines.
    Using values for the Γm,n distribution gives us the mass of firms in a given (m, n) state. The
                                         P∞

B     Data Organization
Data Organization
We first identify the ownership status of each firm in the economy and the head of the group with
which the firm is affiliated. Indeed, our data source (LIFI) defines a group as a set of firms controlled,
directly or indirectly, by the same entity (the head of the group). We rely on a formal definition of
control, requiring that a firm holds directly or through cross-ownership at least 50% of the voting
rights in another firm’s general assembly. We do not expect this to be a major source of bias in our
sample as most French firms are private and ownership concentration is strong even among listed
firms. Firms that do not conform to this definition are classified as stand-alone firms.
    We then match the ownership information to our balance-sheet data and to our survey on lines
of business within firms. We drop firms that appear in the ownership data but for which we cannot
find balance-sheet information. We also delete as outliers firm-year observations whose ROA falls
outside a multiple of five of the interquartile range and firms that report 0 employment or which have
negative sales. Based on our two sources of information we identify the main line of business from
the balance sheets and the different segments of the firm from the survey on lines of business. For
computational convenience we create a new firm-group identifier that allows us to aggregate at the
same time business groups, business groups with multi-divisional firms, exclusively multi-divisional
firms and true stand-alone firms. We then define four measures of multi-market activity. The first
measure counts each market in which the firm-group is present either via its ownership links or its
multi-divisional structure. The second measure counts each market in which the firm-group is present
with at least 9 employees via its ownership links or its multi-divisional structure. The third measure
counts each market in which the firm-group is present exclusively via its ownership links. The final
measure counts each market in which the firm-group is present exclusively via its ownership links and
excluding financial activities.

                                                    43
    We then define firm characteristics from balance-sheet data. There are three possible organizational
types and comparison issues might arise. Taking the firm as the economic unit of interest has the
advantage of simplicity since information is directly available in the balance sheets. However, this
method has the disadvantage of not being comparable across organizational types. Indeed, most
information for multi-divisional firms is aggregated across lines of segment, whereas firms belonging
to business groups have market-specific information. Similar to existing studies by the Ministry
of Research (Dhont-Peltrault and Pfister (2011)), we decided to aggregate the information to the
economic unit at the highest level of control: the firm level for stand-alone and multi-divisional firms,
and the business group level for firms affiliated through majority ownership.15
    In a final step we match the firms’ balance-sheet and patent information to information contained
in the R&D Survey. We focus on firms for which we have R&D information. Again we aggregate at the
highest level of control. As before, one has to be cautious in aggregating on the basis of variables that
might be prone to double-counting. When constructing information on the basic R&D intensity of a
firm this is not the case as we are focusing exclusively on “internal” research expenditures. Therefore,
if a member of the group contracts out research with another member of the group, then one will be
counted as “external” research expenditures and the other one as “internal” expenditures. To correct
for outliers in the dependent variable, we drop firm-year observations whose basic research intensity,
conditional on positive basic research, falls outside a multiple of five of the interquartile range. In
addition we exclude firm-year observations whose total R&D to sales ratio falls outside a multiple of
five of the interquartile range.16

Policy Environment
It is useful to describe the policy environment in France during the period of our data. The share of
GDP devoted R&D expenditures in France was on average 2.2% between 2000 and 2006. Innovation
policy during the sample period featured a mix of measures to support R&D investment of firms
through public financing. The main instrument to stimulate private innovation activity during that
period consisted of approximately 2.5 billion euros of yearly subsidies allocated to firms either through
ministries or government agencies such as OSEO-ANVAR. Note that our R&D survey allows us to
directly measure this form of public financing in our sample. Finally, the R&D tax credit system was
seen by the government as a secondary policy measure until a major reform in 2008 that increased the
base and the rate of the the tax credit.

Variable List
All variables are organized and computed according to the method set out in the previous section.
To summarize, we decided to aggregate the information to the economic unit at the highest level of
control: the firm level for stand-alone and multi-divisional firms, and the business group level for
firms affiliated through majority ownership. In the remainder of the document we will, for the sake of
notational convenience, refer generically to firms.

    • Basic Research Intensity: total basic research by firm i in year t divided by total applied research
      of firm i in year t. The formulation of the survey questions related to the type of research
      undertaken is directly derived from the definitions provided by the Frascati Manual;
    • # of Industries: sum of all distinct SIC codes within firm i in year t irrespective of organizational
      form (business group or multi-divisional structure). Industries are successively defined at the
      4-,3-,2- and 1-digit SIC levels;
    • # of Industries - Weighted Sum: weighted sum of all distinct bilateral 1-digit SIC links within
      firm i in year t. Weights are computed on the basis of the empirical frequency of each bilateral
      SIC link in each year t;
    • # of Patent Classes Applied: sum of cumulated distinct patent-class applications within firm
      i in year t. Cumulated patent-class applications are computed for the period leading from
  15
     In addition to the economic rationale for constructing the data at the highest level of control there is also a legal
argument. Indeed most public administrations and tribunals define the eligibility of firms for subsidy programs with
respect to the business groups to which they belong.
  16
     Alternatively, we exclude firm-year observations whose basic to applied R&D ratio falls above the 99th percentile of
the distribution. The results are qualitatively similar.

      Classification);
    • # of Patent Classes Granted: sum of cumulated distinct patent-class grants within firm i in
      year t. Cumulated patent-class grants are computed for the period leading from 1993 to year t.
      Patent classes are successively defined at the 5-,4-,3-,2- and 1-digit levels (EPO Classification);
    • Financial Int.: binary indicator equal to 1 if firm i in year t is present in a financial industry, 0
      otherwise;
    • Foreign HQ: binary indicator equal to 1 if the headquarters of firm i in year t are located outside
      France, 0 otherwise;
    • Market Share: weighted average of total sales of firm i, year t in industry k divided by total
      industry sales in year t. Weights are computed on the basis of the industry share of employment
      within firm i in year t;
    • Outsourcing to Univ.: binary indicator equal to 1 if firm i in year t has outsourced R&D to
      French universities, 0 otherwise;
    • Profitability - ROA: weighted average of EBIDTA divided by total fixed assets of all subsidiaries
      within firm i in year t. Weights are computed on the basis of the subsidiaries’ share of employ-
      ment within firm i in year t;
    • Profitability - ROS: weighted average of EBIDTA divided by total sales of all subsidiaries within
      firm i in year t. Weights are computed on the basis of the subsidiaries’ share of employment
      within firm i in year t;
    • Public R&D Funds: binary indicator equal to 1 if firm i in year t has received French public
      funds, 0 otherwise;
    • Research Area: weighted average of the share of respectively biotech / software / environmental
      research in research expenditures in firm i in year t. Weights are computed on the basis of the
      subsidiaries’ share of total R&D within firm i in year t;
    • Total Employment: total employment of firm i in year t;
    • IV - State Present in 1986: binary indicator equal to 1 if the French state had a non-zero equity
      stake in firm i in 1986;
    • IV - SOE in 1986: binary indicator equal to 1 if the French state had a controlling equity stake
      in firm i in 1986.
    Table 12 provides the descriptive statistics of the key variables.

C     Construction of Within-Industry Spillovers
Figure 10 provides a graphical intuition for the computation of the citation information.
    Patent A is granted in 1978. In 1981, when patent A is 3 years old, it receives citations from
both patent B and patent C, which was applied for in 1981. Patent B in the following 10 years was
cited by patents V, W and X, whereas patent C was only cited by patents Y and Z. The average
citation of citing patents for patent A at age 3 is therefore 2.5. The timing of the computation implies
that we need to be cautious with respect to possible truncation. We therefore compute our measure
for patents between 1975 and 1985. This implies that, inclusive of the 10-years-forward lag, we can
observe without truncation all our patents until the age of 10.

Robustness Checks Table 13 provides robustness checks for the estimates on the cool-down rate
of patents originating from basic and applied research. The top panel of the table measures Quality
of Citing Patents computing the 5-years-forward citations of the citing patents and is measured for
patents granted in the period 1975-1985. The bottom panel re-classifies university patents that were
defined as private depositors. In both cases results are unchanged, with a citation difference between
public and private patents that becomes statistically non-significant at year 8. Indeed, in France,
most of the academic patents are accounted for in the “public” category. French universities generally
manage their patents through public research institutions with which academics are typically affiliated,
one example being the CNRS.

distinct 1-digit SIC activities in which a firm operates but extends to finer SIC classifications. All
results are presented in Table 14.

Confounding Factors Columns (1) and (2) check robustness of the results with respect to con-
founding factors. Column (1) estimates the model only allowing for year and organization fixed effects,
whereas column (2) includes a set of potential confounding factors. Results in column (1) suggest that
presence in an additional industry, not accounting for other variables such as size, is associated on
average with a 1.4 percentage-point higher basic research intensity of firms. In column (2) the set of
regressors includes controls for size, profitability and headquarter localization. The impact of multi-
industry presence is slightly lower but remains statistically significant.17 Estimates on the localization
of headquarters are also statistically significant at the 5% level. Total employment and profitability
on the other hand are not.

Measures of Multi-Industry Presence Columns (3) and (4) provide alternative measures for
the multi-industry presence of firms. Column (3) defines multi-industry presence on the basis of a
firm’s technological spectrum. To do so we use EPO patent data for French applicants. We define as
the number of technology classes in which a firm is present as the cumulative distinct patent classes
granted to the firm between 1993 and t. The coefficient is very similar in magnitude and precision to
the one obtained using distinct 1-digit SIC industries. Column (4) measures multi-industry presence
as a weighted sum of all distinct bilateral 1-digit SIC links within firm i in year t considering only
distinct legal entities linked by majority ownership. Weights are computed on the basis of the empirical
frequency of each bilateral SIC link in each year t. Intuitively, if a given bilateral industry link is rare,
then industries are more likely to be very different. Multi-industry presence is still positively related
to basic research intensity, the different point estimate being linked to the different support of the
weighted industry variable.

Causality and Instrumental Variables Columns (5) and (6) address the potential concern of
reverse causality, i.e. basic research leading to a larger economic scope of firms. We exploit historical
ownership structures that affected a firm’s multi-industry presence as instrumental variables. The two
instruments are defined as State Ownership 1985-1987 and State Owned between 1985-1987.
    The rationale behind our identification strategy is as follows. In 1981 Francois Mitterrand was
elected president of the Republic and implemented a vast nationalization program across industries.
Even before that period the tradition of French state intervention resulted in a significant fraction of
the economy being under state control. Consistent with Colbertist policies, the state also modified the
economic scope of its firms by merging unrelated firms into large conglomerates of national champions.
In 1987, however, Jacques Chirac was elected prime minister on a liberal platform and this marked
the beginning of privatizations, which continued into the 90s. The embedded exclusion restriction
  17
     Further checks on control variables included market shares, R&D subsidies, collaborations with universities, the
presence of financial intermediaries, state in the capital of the firm, industry fixed effects and the use of a mean patent
scaling method.

Notes: Pooled data for the period 2000-2006. Basic Research Intensity is defined as the ratio of total firm investment
in basic research divided by total firm investment in applied research. Columns 1 and 2 re-estimate the Tobit model
with different sets of regressors. Columns 3 and 4 modify the measure of a firm’s multi-industry presence. Column
3 uses patent applications of French firms to the European patent office (1993-2003) to count the number of distinct
technological fields in which they are present (1-digit IPC classification). Column 4 weights each bilateral industry link
of a firm by the empirical frequency of this link in the French economy, thus giving more weight to less related industries.
Columns 5 and 6 re-estimate the model by instrumenting contemporary multi-industry presence by historical ownership
structures. More specifically, we exploit the nationalization wave of the Mitterrand era that preceded the privatization
of the 90s. The idea is that state ownership effectively increased the scope of a firm’s economic activities. Column 5 uses
state participation in the capital of a firm in 1986 as an instrument. Column 6 uses state ownership of a company in
1986 as an instrument. Both instruments accurately predict an increased multi-industry presence nowadays. Columns
7 and 8 estimate the relationship between multi-industry presence and basic research intensity by using a Heckman
model and a negative binomial model. Tobit estimates relate to the marginal effect of the regressors with respect to the
uncensored variable mean and are evaluated at the sample mean of covariates (except for categorical variables evaluated
for firms that are present in 1 industry, non-foreign owned, in 2002). Robust standard errors clustered at the firm level
in parentheses. See Appendix B for the definition of variables.

therefore requires that state control in the 80 be associated today with a greater basic research intensity
of firms only because of politically motivated mergers. The implicit assumption is that when these
firms became private they adjusted their research spending from the social to the private optimum
but did not adjust their multi-industry presence. First-stage estimates show that state ownership in
the 80s is associated on average with 1.2 more industry links for firms between 2000 and 2006. The
associated F-test are well above the critical levels related to weak instruments tables.18 Columns 5
and 6 present the instrumented LATE coefficients related to multi-industry presence of the second
stage. The coefficients are nearly twice as large in magnitude with respect to the non-instrumented
coefficients of columns 1 and 2.

Estimation Columns (7) and (8) use alternative estimation methods for the baseline model with co-
variates. Column (7) presents estimates of the Heckman selection model, whereas column (8) presents
estimates from a negative binomial model. In both cases estimates suggest a positive and statistically
significant relation between basic research intensity and multi-industry presence.

E      Identification: Target Moments and Parameter Sensitivity
In this section, we provide a sensitivity analysis. In particular, in Table 15 we report the percentage
change in the moment (row) for a 5% change in the parameter (column) from its baseline value, while
keeping the rest of the parameters at their benchmark values. We report the average of the +5% and
-5% changes. Therefore, these values can be interpreted as a double-sided discrete approximation.
