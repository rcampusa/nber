Expectation, Disappointment, and Exit: Reference Point Formation in a Marketplace

                                         ABSTRACT

We study expectation-based reference point formation using data from an online auction
marketplace. We hypothesize that exit from the marketplace is affected by disappointment from
abruptly losing an auction after being the leading bidder. Expectation-based reference points that
evolve over time imply that a bidder who spends more time in the lead prior to an abrupt loss will
suffer a higher degree of disappointment. We find that for every additional day in the lead,
bidders who lose abruptly are 6 percentage points more likely to exit. In contrast, losing bidders
whose expectations are informed by early, competing bids, show no effect at all. Also, consistent
with our theoretical model, more experienced bidders are less sensitive to time spent in the lead.

1     Introduction
The framework of prospect theory and reference-dependent preferences developed by the
seminal work of Kahneman and Tversky (1979) has o↵ered intuitive hypotheses for a
number of so-called “behavioral” puzzles, from loss aversion to the endowment e↵ect. To
the canonical model of preferences it adds a reference point, a useful degree of freedom
that distinguishes between a gain and a loss, or disappointment and elation. Moreover,
if behavior in real markets mirrors findings from the lab, reference points matter for the
way we make policy, manage firms, and design markets.
    But where do reference points come from, and how can they be manipulated? This
question is basic to both the positive and the normative implications of the theory, yet
we have little empirical evidence on the point. Kahneman and Tversky (1979) are am-
bivalent; they mostly focus on the status quo as a reference point, but they also suggest
that expectations may play a role. Following a line of thought that takes expectations
as reference points (Bell, 1985; Loomes and Sugden, 1986), Kőszegi and Rabin (2006)
propose an elegant and powerful solution in which reference points are given by ratio-
nal expectations of equilibrium outcomes, implying that reference points arise naturally
and endogenously within the context of the application.1 A practical theory of reference-
dependent preferences relies on the empirical challenge of understanding reference point
formation in context, i.e., in real market behavior.
    This paper documents reference point formation and disappointment aversion using
data from online consumer behavior. Unique data from eBay’s auction marketplace gives
us leverage on the difficult empirical task of teasing out variation in reference points. We
show how disappointment from losing an auction, mediated by variation in the anticipated
probability of winning, a↵ects a bidder’s likelihood of abandoning the auction platform.
The data support two critical ingredients of the expectations-as-reference-points approach.
First, a bidder should rationally expect a higher likelihood of winning the longer they are
in the lead. Second, expecting a higher likelihood of winning makes an abrupt loss more
disappointing, reducing the perceived benefit from participating in the auction platform,
which in turn leads to exit.
   1
     Kőszegi and Rabin (2006) make clear that their adoption of rational expectations is not for the sake
of dogmatism but modeling discipline: “...research on the nature of reference points themselves is quite
limited. While we hope that experiments and other empirical work will shed light on this topic, our
model makes the extreme assumption that the reference point is fully determined by the expectations a
person held in the recent past” (p. 1141, emphasis original).


                                                    1
       Using observational data to study reference point formation presents two salient mea-
surement problems: finding an observable reference point “shifter” and measuring ex post
disappointment. With those two challenges in mind, we use data from eBay’s hybrid Auc-
tion Buy-It-Now (ABIN) sales format. These auctions proceed similar to the standard
ascending online auctions on eBay, but potential buyers may execute the Buy-It-Now
(BIN) option and end the auction immediately to purchase the item at the pre-specified,
publicly-listed BIN price set by the seller. Bidders who participated in the auction before
a BIN event have no opportunity to counter or raise their bids in response. We focus
on bidders who hold the standing high bid in an auction but lose abruptly when another
bidder executes the BIN option. In our model, the time these bidders spend in the lead
is a proxy for their expectations about the likelihood of winning: over time, the leading
bidder places a higher probability on winning the auction, which puts them further in the
domain of losses should they abruptly lose.
       Our model formalizes the argument that, within this sample, bidders who have held
the high bid for longer will su↵er greater disappointment than those who held it only
briefly. This is because their reference point shifts over time as they come to rationally
anticipate a higher probability of winning the auction. Combined with a model of platform
exit, our main hypothesis is that they are more likely to exit the platform altogether.2
Our results confirm this: first-time bidders who spend more time in the lead before the
BIN event are significantly more likely to exit.
       To check that disappointment aversion is the mechanism and not, for instance, irri-
tation in proportion to time squandered, we validate this against a placebo sample of
bidders whose expectations are dampened by competition from other bidders—that is,
they are outbid and ultimately lose, but they had ample time to raise their bid. An
implication of our model is that, although these bidders have the same material outcome,
they do not su↵er disappointment because they had the option to win, and so anticipate
loss when they chose not to re-bid. This is confirmed in our placebo sample.
   2
    We are not the first to use platform exit as an outcome of interest. Ascarza et al. (2016) show
that recommendations for consumers who make suboptimal bundle choices on a platform can cause exit
and conjecture that the recommendations make expenditures more salient. Israel (2005) uses customer
retention in auto insurance to identify learning events for an experience good, and Ho et al. (2015) use
price changes and expensive medical events as price salience shocks to study substitution between health
insurance plans and, in turn, the pricing of those plans. On the eBay platform Backus et al. (2015) showed
that first-time bidders are substantially less likely to return to the platform when they are “sniped,” i.e.,
lose to a last-minute bid, and Nosko and Tadelis (2015) and Masterov et al. (2015) use buyer exit to
measure the quality of competing measures of seller reputation.


                                                     2
      The explicit model of exit choice also allows us to make predictions about how BIN
events a↵ect more experienced bidders. Bidders return to the site if the expected surplus
from doing so exceeds the value of their outside option. Experienced bidders have more
data and therefore less variance in their prior beliefs about future surplus, so they update
less severely on a negative experience. Moreover, they are selected on survival, which
implies that they are likely to have a worse outside option. Therefore we predict that
while time spent in the lead before a BIN event may a↵ect their exit rates, they will be
less sensitive than new bidders. The data confirms our hypothesis. This result is related
to arguments that experienced market participants are less likely to display behavioral
biases (List, 2003), but with an important di↵erence in interpretation. Our model does
not require that experienced traders have di↵erent preferences from inexperienced ones –
rather, it explains why nonstandard preferences are less likely to be expressed in the case
of experienced participants.
      Barberis (2013), reviewing three decades of research on reference-dependent prefer-
ences, argues that outside the areas of choice under uncertainty, namely finance and
insurance, a lack of empirical analyses casts doubt on the relevance of reference points,
and prospect theory more generally. This is a gap that our paper helps fill, and closest
to ours is Card and Dahl (2011), who use family violence as the outcome variable and
find that upset losses strongly impact family violence, while losses in games that were
expected to be close have small and insignificant e↵ects. Our study uses platform exit as
the outcome variable and expectations about winning as reference point shifters. While
we employ a di↵erent reference point shifter and di↵erent measure of disappointment, our
research design mirrors theirs in many ways. Our application, however, concerns market
behavior, a domain in which documentation of reference points tends to be indirect, e.g.,
the long series of papers concerning the labor supply of NYC taxi drivers (Camerer et al.,
1997; Crawford and Meng, 2011; Farber, 2015). We believe therefore that we o↵er the
clearest example of reference dependent preferences using observational data from real
market behavior to date.
      Our work is also related to the notion of a “quasi-” or “pseudo-endowment” e↵ect,
(Ariely and Simonson, 2003; Heyman et al., 2004; Wolf et al., 2005; Bramsen, 2008;
Cotton, 2009). This notion posits that as a consumer holds the standing high bid in
an auction, they become progressively attached.3 Accordingly, a losing bidder who has
  3
      This is related to an argument of Strahilevitz and Loewenstein (1998), that the endowment e↵ect


                                                  3
grown more attached should be more likely to return and bid higher when they do. This
contrasts with our basic hypothesis – and our empirical findings – that such bidders will
be less likely to return. Moreover, in Section 5.2 we show that bidders who do return do
not make higher bids, and in Section 6.3 we show that our results are robust to focusing
on “commodity” items, i.e., those for which there are likely to be many equivalent listings
on the platform that bidders could substitute to.
    While our primary interest is the documentation of reference point formation, our
results have implications for market design in online platforms. We show that employing
allocation mechanisms that risk leaving consumers in the “domain of losses,” i.e., dis-
appointed vis-à-vis their reference point, can cause attrition from the platform. This is
important for platforms because they face economies of scale via network e↵ects.4 These
e↵ects are strongest for newer bidders to the platform, which is intuitive: these bidders
are still engaged in learning to use the platform and forming expectations. Platforms
should be wary of user experiences that encourage unrealistic expectations; disappointed
consumers may leave the site entirely. It may be worthwhile to curate the experience of
new users on a platform because loss alone does not cause disappointment and exit; con-
sumers who expect to lose do not demonstrate the higher likelihood of exit, even though,
in our sample, they share the same material outcome: they go home with nothing.


2     Auction Buy-It-Now Listings on eBay
We examine Auction Buy-It-Now (ABIN) listings on eBay.com. This is a subset of the
auction listings in which a seller has elected to add the Buy-It-Now (BIN) feature. In a
standard auction listing, the seller specifies the auction’s duration and the bidder with the
highest bid at the end wins, paying the second highest bid plus an increment. In an ABIN
listing, the auction proceeds similarly but potential buyers can execute the BIN option
to immediately end the auction early and purchase the item at the BIN price. ABIN
listings account for about one quarter of all auction listings on eBay. Figure 1 presents
an example of an ABIN listing—buyers can either bid or to or click on the BIN button,
takes e↵ect gradually as we incorporate possession into our reference point.

     In the platforms literature these are known as direct network e↵ects, in which my payo↵ depends
on the number of other participants (e.g., social media) and indirect network e↵ects, in which my payo↵
depends on the number of participants on the other “side” of the market (e.g., buyers and sellers on
eBay). See Rochet and Tirole (2003).

Notes: This is the listing page for an example ABIN listing. In addition to the “Place Bid” button,
which is standard for auction-style listings and does not change the ending time, the buyer can use the
“Buy-It-Now” option and purchase the good, closing the listing immediately. The current standing high
bidder has no recourse when the BIN option is exercised.


in which case they will purchase the item at the BIN price of $24.95.
       Importantly, the BIN option may disappear in the course of the auction. For the
product categories in our data, it disappears when the standing price exceeds 50% of the
BIN.5 Ignoring bidding increments, this will occur only if there are two bidders who have
each placed a bid that it at or above 50% of the BIN price. If only one bidder entered a
bid that is higher than 50% of the BIN price then the standing price will be lower than
50% of the BIN price, and the BIN button will still appear for future buyers to click on.
When the BIN option is exercised, the bidder with the standing high bid will be notified
that the auction ended, and that their bid was unsuccessful. Therefore some bidders may
anticipate winning and then abruptly lose without the ability to respond.
       Sellers on eBay choose from a variety of mechanisms when they create a listing.6 Bud-
ish and Takeyama (2001) argue that o↵ering a BIN option may allow sellers to extract
more revenue from risk-averse buyers; relatedly, Ackerberg et al. (2014) identify risk pref-
erences as well as discounting preferences from the bid-or-BIN decision faced by bidders
who arrive at a listing. Many other conjectures have been put forward to explain the use of

     In some other categories the BIN option disappears once a single bid is submitted that is above the
secret reserve.

     These are auctions (with or without a BIN option) and fixed price (with or without a bargaining
option). Minor options include duration, starting price, secret reserve price, end time, and shipping.

the ABIN mechanism, from reference dependent preferences to common-values concerns;
see Bauner (2015) for a recent survey of this still-lively literature as well as a structural
model of mechanism choice. For our application we take the set of ABIN listings as given,
though we acknowledge that there may be substantial selection of listings into the ABIN
mechanism. This is an external validity concern. We note, however, that buyers cannot
explicitly condition on the availability of a BIN option among auctions when using the
website’s built-in search feature.


3     A Model of Disappointment and Platform Exit
This section presents a simple behavioral model of the e↵ect of unanticipated loss on the
likelihood of platform exit. Our main hypothesis is that the longer a first-time bidder
has been in the lead, the more severe the disappointment when they abruptly lose to the
execution of a BIN option, and therefore the less likely he is to return and participate
again. We also develop ancillary hypotheses for bidders who lose by other means, as well
as for more experienced bidders who lose to the execution of a BIN option.
    We develop the model in two steps. First, we characterize disappointment aversion
for bidders with rational expectations reference points in an ascending price auction.
Second, we model bidders’ decisions to revisit the auction platform as a function of past
outcomes. Bidders weigh revisiting the platform against a random outside option, and
update negatively on future expected surplus when they have negative experiences.
    Our model is written to the end of generating meaningful empirical predictions. This
guides us at several points. For instance, we focus exclusively on losing bidders because
we can’t meaningfully compare platform exit among winners versus losers, given that
winners have obtained the item they were seeking. Moreover, our theoretical model
explicitly excludes many salient features of bidders and their bids, e.g., when the bid was
placed. We exclude these features from out model not because they are unimportant, but
because in the empirical exercise they are observable, and therefore we can control for
them to construct the empirical analogue of the simple model to which we now turn.


3.1    Disappointment and Reference Points
At any given point before an auction ends, there will be one bidder who is in the lead.
A bidder whose standing high bid goes unchallenged for longer may rationally anticipate

                                             6
that they are more likely to win the auction. As described below in Figure 2, we show that
this anticipation is consistent with our observational data. This motivates our use of time
spent in the lead as an instrument for movement in reference points. Namely, the longer
a bidder is in the lead, the more they expect to win, and the greater the disappointment
when they lose.
       Consider a bidder who is currently in the lead, and normalize the di↵erence between
the consumption value of the item and the amount of their bid to 1 (we only consider
losing bidders in our empirical exercise, so we ignore rebidding). We write the surplus
realized from the auction as


                                         ⇡ = y + µ(y       p),                                     (1)

where y 2 {0, 1} is the bidder’s allocation from the auction, p is the bidder’s expectation
of y at the time the auction ended, and µ represents the bidder’s gain-loss utility as in
Kőszegi and Rabin (2006). For simplicity let µ be piecewise linear, so that
                                         8
                                         < ↵(y        p)    if y   p0
                            µ(y     p) =
                                         :  (y        p)    if y   p>0

       Disappointment aversion implies that ↵ > 0. In the empirical section we focus exclu-
sively on losing bidders, i.e., the region where y = 0  p. This means we compare bidder
with identical outcomes but di↵erent reference points.7
       There are two circumstances that lead to y  p at the end of the auction. First, the
leading bidder can be “sniped” by another bidder who submitted a last-second bid, so
that the leading bidder cannot possibly respond. Second, a buyer can exercises the BIN
option, ending the auction abruptly. To formalize this, let t = 0 denote the beginning of
an auction and t = 1 its end, and assume

   7
    A more subtle distinction between disappointment aversion as formulated in Loomes and Sugden
(1986) and reference-dependence as in Kőszegi and Rabin (2006) concerns whether the referent is the
certainty equivalent or the entire distribution of outcomes. Sprenger (2015) explores this distinction
experimentally and finds evidence for a risk endowment e↵ect, consistent with the latter. Unfortunately
our empirical setting does not o↵er any further leverage on this distinction.

                     :   p(t) < ps if bidder i loses to a BIN event at time t < 1

Moreover, p(t) is strictly increasing in t.

       The first scenario reflects bidders who are outbid early in the auction; at the end, they
anticipate losing. However, bidders may also lose at the end of the auction. They face
competition from “snipers,” and so we allow for the possibility that ps < 1.8 Finally, the
assumption that p(t) is strictly increasing in t is consistent with any model in which the
hazard rate of being outbid is strictly positive.
       Assumption 1 is confirmed in the auctions that comprise our dataset (described in
more detail in Section 4). Figure 2 presents a plot of the empirical likelihood that the
bidder who holds the standing high bid at time t goes on to eventually win the auction.
We see that p(t) is monotone over t. It appears to be converging to approximately 0.7,
before the slope increases sharply to arrive at 1, consistent with the presence of snipers.
       In light of this, our assumption implies that bidders’ expectations about the likelihood
of winning are qualitatively consistent with the data. This is related to the rational
expectations reference points of Kőszegi and Rabin (2006), but somewhat weaker. We
emphasize that for our analysis, bidders’ expectations about the path of p(t) need not be
exactly correct—this would be a particularly untenable assumption for first-time bidders—
we only rely on monotonicity. Therefore we require bidders’ reference points to match
the data qualitatively, rather than exactly. Our assumption formalizes the notion that a
rational bidder who successfully maintains the standing high bid will also update positively
on the likelihood that they will win the auction. This exposes them to greater potential
disappointment if they lose.
       A possible objection to our model concerns predictions for bidders who lose by being
outbid, rather than to the BIN option. Because bidders evaluate surplus only at the end
of the auction, they update their expectations before the auction ends and hence and
   8
    See Roth and Ockenfels (2002) and Bajari and Hortaçsu (2003) for evidence on the causes and
prevalence of sniping, and Backus et al. (2015) for evidence on its e↵ects on platform exit. Much of this
sniping happens in the last seconds of an auction, too late for any feasible response, and so we treat it
as qualitatively di↵erent from being outbid at t < 1.

Notes: This figure presents the empirical likelihood that the bidder who holds the current high bid, at
a time t ultimately wins the auction. Note that, as in the model, t is normalized such that an auction
begins at t = 0 and ends at t = 1. To construct the plot we took, for a grid of points in t, the set
of bidders who were currently in the lead in each of our auctions and computed the average value of a
dummy variable for whether they were the eventual winner at the end of the auction. We use all auctions
in the four ABIN categories during our sample period.


su↵er no disappointment. But why should they su↵er less disappointment when they are
outbid? There is a substantive di↵erence between these bidders and those who lose to a
BIN option, which is that the former have recourse, i.e., the option to re-bid. We exclude
this from our model for the sake of parsimony, embedding it in a timing assumption, but
in this sense our setup implicitly draws on a notion of regret. A more comprehensive
formal treatment would require a unified theory of regret and disappointment, which to
our knowledge does not exist.9 By assuming that surplus is evaluated at the end of the

     From Loomes and Sugden (1986), p. 281: “Because regret theory makes comparisons across actions
but within states of the world, it can predict violations of the transitivity axiom but not violations of
the sure-thing principle; whereas disappointment theory, which makes comparisons across states of the
world but within actions can predict violations of the sure-thing principle, but not violations of transi-
tivity. However, both theories generate many of the same predictions such as the common consequence
and common ratio e↵ects in the case of statistically independent prospects, simultaneous gambling and
insurance, and the isolation e↵ect. Given the similarity of the fundamental structure of both theories,
there may be grounds for thinking that a more general theory of rational choice under uncertainty may
encompass both regret and disappointment.”

auction, then bidders who lose to another bid su↵er no disappointment because—unlike
those to lose to a BIN event—conditional on losing, they anticipate loss. This is related
to the finding of Filiz-Ozbay and Ozbay (2007) that bidders have no regret in standard
second-price auctions.


3.2     Platform Exit
The second component of our model connects negative outcomes to platform exit. Bidders
will update their beliefs about the value of participating in an auction and will chose to
exit the platform after m auctions if the expected utility of participating again is less than
that of the next-best substitute,

                                    E[⇡m+1 |⇡1 , . . . , ⇡m ]  ✓i .                             (2)

In our notation, the expectation E is taken with respect to bidder i’s subjective beliefs
about the benefit of participating in another auction, and ✓i is an exogenous expected
payo↵ to bidder i’s next-best substitute. ✓i is a bidder-specific random variable with
distribution F (·). We assume that bidders have an astructural understanding of the
surplus from platform participation: i.e., their expectations about future values of ⇡ are
monotone in prior realizations. We formalize this as

ASSUMPTION 2 (Beliefs): E[⇡m+1 |⇡1 , . . . , ⇡m ] is strictly increasing in ⇡m .

This implies that a bidder who obtains less surplus in their last transaction is strictly
less likely to revisit the site. It is not entirely innocuous: it could be violated if bidders
are learning about mechanisms – e.g., I lose to a late bidder today, but believe that I
will get more surplus tomorrow now that I understand the practice. This is the sense in
which bidders are astructural; we assume they are not learning about the structure of the
market, so that their updates about future surplus are monotone in today’s surplus. This
is perhaps most reasonable for new bidders who may not fully apprehend the mechanisms
on the platform.10

    For more rigorous foundations on misattribution and reference-dependent preferences, we refer the
reader to recent work on this topic in Bushong and Gagnon-Bartsch (2016).

3.3    Empirical Predictions
Our main hypothesis combines disappointment aversion with platform exit:

HYPOTHESIS 1: The longer a first-time bidder has been in the lead, the more likely they
are to exit the platform after experiencing a loss to a BIN event.

For first-time bidders who lose, the probability of exit is given by F (E[⇡2 |⇡1 ]), with
⇡1 = ↵(y    p). By Assumption 2, this is decreasing in p. For bidders who lose to the BIN
option at time t, p = p(t) by Assumption 1; moreover, p(t) is increasing in t. Therefore
the probability of exit is also increasing in t.
   Note that Hypothesis 1 stands in contrast with prior work that has argued for a pseudo-
endowment e↵ect. The pseudo-endowment hypothesis suggests that bidders become more
attached to the item over time, thereby making them more likely to return and to bid
more aggressively when they do. There is a non-behavioral version of this hypothesis
as well: if I anticipate winning the auction, perhaps I plan my consumption around the
item, e.g., purchase complementary goods. In either case, the empirical prediction is an
increase in the bidder’s willingness to pay for the product. To address this, in addition
to o↵ering evidence for Hypothesis 1, we test whether bidders who do return and bid on
the same product place higher bids the second time.
   Our model yields two additional ancillary hypotheses.

HYPOTHESIS 2: Among first-time bidders who expect to lose at the end of the auction,
i.e. do not lose to a BIN event or a late bid, time spent in the lead is unrelated to exit.

For these bidders, p = 0 and therefore our model predicts that the probability of exit is
invariant to time spent in the lead.
   Hypothesis 2 helps to address alternative stories that depend on time spent in the lead
but not disappointment. For instance, perhaps bidders update negatively in proportion
to, and because of, time wasted on an unsuccessful bid. The comparison to bidders who
had an opportunity to re-bid and chose not to, helps us isolate the role of reference points.

HYPOTHESIS 3: Among experienced bidders who lose to a BIN event, the relationship
between time spent in the lead and exit is weaker than for inexperienced bidders.




                                              11
This follows from selection on survival: repeat bidders are likely to have worse outside
options. Formally, we have a long sequence of bounds on the value of their outside option.
The probability that they return is given by F (mink=1,...,m {E[⇡k+1 |⇡1 , . . . , ⇡k ]}). Bidders
who have recently had a series of good experiences become infra-marginal and are unlikely
to exit even in the face of severe disappointment. Informally one might also expect, in
Bayesian spirit, that with more data, bidders update less (and are therefore less likely to
exit) with each additional data point.
       In a baseball card trading field experiment, List (2003) showed that experienced traders
are less subject to the endowment e↵ect, and in that sense “less behavioral.” Anticipating
selling the cards that they buy implies that their ownership is transient, making them
less subject to the endowment e↵ect. Our explanation, particular to our setting, is sub-
stantively di↵erent: experienced and inexperienced buyers on the platform need not have
di↵erent preferences. Rather, the e↵ect of disappointment aversion on exit behavior is
endogenously determined by our model.


4        Sample Design
We begin constructing our sample with all new users who created an account on the U.S.
eBay site between June 1, 2009 and October 31, 2013 and confirmed their account through
e-mail verification. From this set, we selected users whose first non-browsing consumer
action was casting a bid in an ABIN auction. We focus on first-time bidders because, as
our model posits, these are the set for whom exit is most responsive to disappointment.
We relax this restriction later to test Hypothesis 3.
       We further limited the sample to auctions belonging to four specific product categories:
cell phones and accessories; clothing, shoes and accessories; event tickets and experiences;
and motor parts and accessories. These were chosen because therein the BIN option re-
mains available until the standing price exceeds 50% of the BIN price. In other categories,
the BIN option disappears once the first bid is placed.11 We then restrict attention to suc-
cessful auctions where there were at least two participants. For each auction that closed
prematurely through the BIN option, we retained a single losing bidder: the one who was
leading at the time the BIN option was exercised and was also a first-time bidder.12 This
  11
     If there is a secret reserve price, the BIN option lingers until a bid exceeds it. In all categories other
than vehicles, the BIN price must always be at least 30% higher than the starting price.
  12
     We relax this restriction later to test Hypothesis 2.

reduces the sample to 23,439 first-time bidders who lost due to the BIN event.
           There is substantial variation in the timing of these BIN events, both in relation to
the auction clock and with respect to the length of time that the losing bidder was in the
lead. Figure 3a shows the distribution of when the BIN option was exercised. Because
auctions vary in length, we normalized the timing by the intended duration so that 0
corresponds to the beginning and 1 to the scheduled end. Figure 3b shows the empirical
CDF of time in the lead in hours. The median bidder is in the lead for approximately
6 hours, but there is a substantial right tail who lead for significantly longer periods of
time. The average “time in the lead” for a bidder was just under 15 hours.
           For each losing bidder, we construct our primary outcome variable, “exit,” as a dummy
for whether the losing bidder ever participated in another auction within 365 days of their
loss. 72% of new bidders who lost via BIN returned to bid in another auction within a
year. This rate is substantially higher than in Backus et al. (2015), mainly because the
bulk of these auctions are of phones and clothes.
           We also obtain data on the timing and levels of their bids, demographic characteristics,
as well as the characteristics of the auction and the seller.13 Auctions are scheduled to last

about 95 more hours at the time of the BIN event and are generally evenly distributed
over the week. Items being auctioned are 42 percent new and are mostly split evenly
between clothes and phones, with only 8 percent of the sample in auto parts and tickets.
The joint coverage of the demographic data limits the sample to 12,068 bidders, which
we use for some specifications that control for demographic characteristics. Bidders for
whom we have demographics in this sample are 62 percent female and generally young
with a wide distribution of incomes.14


5        Main Results: Testing Hypothesis 1
Here we test our main hypothesis, that time spent in the lead is correlated with bidder
exit among first-time bidders who lose because of a BIN event. According to our model,
they exit with probabilityF (E[⇡2 |↵(y          p(t))]), which is increasing in t.


5.1       Disappointment and Bidder Exit
Figure 4 plots the probability of bidder exit by hours spent in the lead as the highest
bidder for a sample of first-time bidders who lost to a BIN event. We find a positive
relationship between time in the lead and the likelihood of exit that is consistent with
disappointment aversion and rational reference point formation.
       Absent any confounds, Figure 4 is evidence for Hypothesis 1: the longer a bidder
maintains the standing high bid before the BIN event, the more likely they are to exit.
However, there are many omitted variables driving exit that could be correlated with
variation in time in the lead. Mechanically, that variation comes from two sources: the
time at which the bid is placed and the time of the BIN event. While the former is clearly
endogenous, we posit that the latter source of variation is exogenous – we see no reason
to believe that the buyer exercising the BIN option does so in a way that is correlated
with the likelihood that the current high bidder will return to the site. We isolate this
variation by introducing a large set of controls for the former source: the timing and the
level of the standing high bid as well as attributes of the standing high bidder. This is
our identification assumption – that conditional on this large set of controls, the timing
of the arrival of the BIN event is exogenous. In Appendix A we consider the robustness of

of categories and conditional on a BIN event occurring and consists of new users only.

our results to omitted variables bias following the suggestions of Altonji et al. (2005) and
Oster (2015). There we show that, given the robustness of our results to the large set of
controls, one would need to hold very particular beliefs about the covariance structure of
the observables and unobservable confounds in order to qualitatively overturn our result.
    Table 1 shows the average marginal e↵ects on exit from spending an additional 24
hours in the lead using six probit specifications. The first column presents the slope of
Figure 4, with time rescaled to be in days rather than hours. The estimated marginal
e↵ect of an additional day in the lead is 7.3 percentage points over the baseline of 28%.
That corresponds to a 26% increase in exit.
    Our first robustness check is shown in Column 2, where we control for the number of
spells as the high-bidder that our loser experienced in the course of the auction, as well
as the decile of the ratio of the losing bid to the BIN price. These covariates are proxies
for bidder attentiveness and willingness to pay. A bidder who has high willingness to pay
may be more or less likely to exit because the high willingness to pay reflects that the
bidder has limited options in other auctions, fixed price listings, or non-eBay merchants.

Notes: This table presents the average marginal e↵ect of time spent in the lead on the likelihood of exiting

Their high bid is unlikely to be reached by other bidders, giving them a long spell as the
winner. The mirror image of this is a “bargain hunter” who enters the auction at the
very beginning with a low bid hoping to get lucky. We expect that bidder to enjoy a
long spell as the top bidder since most bidding happens at the very end. This happens in
part because the search ranking algorithm promotes auctions ending soon, a preference
perhaps shared by eBay bidders. Leaving these variables out of the analysis may bias
the e↵ect in a theoretically ambiguous direction. The estimated marginal e↵ect falls only
slightly to 6.9 percentage points with these added controls.
    In Column 3 of Table 1 we add variables that characterize the auction and the seller to
absorb some of the variation in exit rates. We augment the specification with the product
category of the item, the intended duration and ending day of the week for the auction,
the natural log of the number of item page views for each day the listing was up, a set
of dummies that describe the number of transactions that the seller had completed up to
that point, the item condition (new, used, refurbished, unknown) and whether the item
was in the product catalog (a commodity item). The exit rates clearly vary by product
category, with clothes having the lowest and tickets the highest. Experienced sellers are
more likely to provide better service and produce less exit from the platform, as shown
in Nosko and Tadelis (2015). The duration variable is meant to capture bargain hunters,
who are likely to return. Shorter auctions are typically used by sellers who are eager
to sell, even at the cost of a lower price. The page views variable allows us to control


                                                    16
for characteristics unobservable to the econometrician that correlate with the listing’s
desirability. For instance, a misspelling that makes a listing hard to find or high-quality
photos, which influence search rank, would be captured by this metric. Item condition
has a theoretically ambiguous e↵ect on exit. With these, the estimated e↵ect on exit
drops to 6.5 percentage points, which is still economically and statistically significant.
      Column 4 of Table 1 adds a set of dummy variables corresponding to deciles of sched-
uled time remaining when the BIN event occurs and a set of dummies corresponding to
quintiles for auction part for the first bid of our loser. The motivation for this control is
that time in the lead at the beginning of the auction has a qualitatively di↵erent e↵ect
that the same time in the lead near the end. This does not seem to be the case; the
estimated e↵ect is 6.7 percentage points.
      The penultimate column adds the logged number of events and sessions divided by
time between the first time that our buyer appears on the site and the losing auction start
time. Events are essentially any actions on the site, such as a search query or a review
of the bidding history of a listing. Whenever more than 30 minutes pass between events,
a new session is started. Both of these variables proxy for interest in the site and such
users are less likely to cease using auctions and eBay more generally. They also allow us
to separate the e↵ect of being more attentive from time in the lead. Controlling for these
variables reduces the estimated e↵ect to 6.4 percentage points. We are not controlling for
site activity that takes places while the auction is unfolding since that is in part how the
reference points are shifted.
      In the final column of Table 1 we add demographics: annual household incomes of the
users, their genders, and ages. These variables are missing for almost half the sample,
but as they are important controls, we believe that their inclusion was a useful robustness
check.15 The estimate of the marginal e↵ects on exit from an additional 24 hours in the
lead remains steady at 6.4 percentage points.
      Figure 5 plots the expected probability of exit from the probit specification in Column
6 of Table 1 as function of time in the lead with a 95% confidence interval. Figure 6
shows the average marginal e↵ect on exit from an additional 24 hours in the lead from
specification 6 of Table 1 as a function of time in the lead with a 95% confidence interval.
      The concave shape indicates that the marginal impact of time in the lead on exit
increases with time in the lead, and drops o↵ once someone has been winning for most

of the auction, yet it is always positive, and significantly di↵erent from zero. As such,
the analysis provides strong evidence, both large in magnitude and highly statistically
significant, that spending more time in the lead before losing the item abruptly cause the
bidder to be more likely to exit the auction platform to avoid such future experiences.
We view this as convincing evidence of our hypothesis.

comes of interest. Note that each cell of the table presents an average marginal e↵ect for
a separate regression. The first column of Table 2 reproduces the Table 1 to facilitate
comparisons. The second column takes as a dependent variable exit from eBay.com alto-
gether, not merely the auction part of the market.16 Not surprisingly, the e↵ect of time in
the lead is somewhat weaker since some of the people who abandon auctions may substi-
tute towards fixed price listings. In the third column, a successful outcome is an attempt

to purchase the same product catalog item, conditional on coming back to eBay. We find
that time in the lead makes that less likely, and the e↵ect is significant even in our richest
specification despite the limited sample. This means that losing to a BIN event makes
returning to find the same item less likely when the loser was in the lead for longer.17 This
is a di↵erent result from both the experimental and field literature, which has found a
heightening e↵ect on rebidding within the same auction from additional time in the lead.
Of course, it is possible that this attempt takes place on a di↵erent e-commerce site or
o✏ine, so that is unobservable to us. However, we anticipate this would attenuate rather
than reverse the measurement of an attachment e↵ect unless bidders who are suscepti-
ble to attachment are particularly likely to make purchases o↵-site. Finally, the fourth
column shows the marginal e↵ect on the change in willingness to pay (either the highest
bid or fixed price), conditional on returning to eBay for the same product catalog item.

    We limited this regression to items where there were at least 10 listings available on eBay in the year
after the loss to ensure this was not driven by stock-outs.

The scale is such that 100 would correspond to doubling the WTP and 0 to no change.
We limited the regression to products with at least 10 listing within 1 year of the lost
auction and removed any observations where the outcome exceeded 500. The estimates
are generally positive, but noisy. While the estimated e↵ects are typically not significant
in the richer specifications, this is largely attributable to the fact that the data is pretty
sparse as we move down the rows and to the right across the columns.

6     Additional Results: Testing Hypotheses 2 and 3
In the above we have shown that first-time bidders who lose abruptly following a BIN
event are more likely to leave the site the longer they have been in the lead, consistent
with disappointment aversion and expectations-based reference points. However, there
are alternative stories consistent with Hypothesis 1. For instance, one might worry that
time spent in the lead is a proxy for time and attention devoted to the purchase, that
losing bidders may simply be annoyed at the e↵ort wasted. To rule out this and other
alternative hypotheses, we also test Hypotheses 2 and 3.

                                                   20
6.1       Expecting to Lose
Hypothesis 2 is a placebo test. It claims that the exit rate of bidders who have been
outbid, and therefore anticipate loss at t = 1, should show no sensitivity to time spent in
the lead. To test this, we augment our sample with first-time bidders who lost with more
than 12 hours remaining in the auction. We impose the 12-hour restriction to guarantee
that these bidders had ample time to respond18 Intuitively, they had an opportunity to
rebid and chose not to, and therefore anticipated their loss (p = 0).

       Table 3 recreates Table 1 for this augmented sample, where we allow for separate con-
stant and slope parameters for the two samples. For specifications (1) - (5) we see smaller,
non-robust e↵ects for non-sniped losers that are sometimes negative and sometimes posi-
tive. However, the non-sniped losers who were outbid exhibit no disappointment aversion
once we include the full set of controls in specification (6). Therefore we take this as
confirmation of Hypothesis 2.


6.2       Experienced Losers
Hypothesis 3 claims that more experienced bidders will be less sensitive to time spent in
the lead when they lose to a BIN event for two reasons. First, consistent with the model
of Section 3, more experienced bidders are a selected sample with, in expectation, a worse
  18
    The results are not sensitive to using a 6 hour or a 24 hour cuto↵. The added observations come
from a disjoint set of auctions from our main analysis. These are also losers, but the manner in which
they were bested is di↵erent: they were outbid, rather than binned, with some time in which to respond.

Notes: This figure replicates Figure 4 by plotting exit rates against time spent in the lead for four samples

outside option. Second, more informally but consistent with Bayesian updating, bidders
should update their beliefs less with each additional experience.
    Figure 7 recreates Figure 4 accounting for user experience. Consistent with Hypothesis
3, the e↵ect of time in the lead on exit declines markedly as users accumulate additional
experience. For bidders with 51 or more prior transactions, there appears to be no e↵ect
at all. These results are strongly consistent with Hypothesis 3.


6.3     Commodity Items
We noted earlier that an alternative story to disappointment aversion would be one of
a quasi-endowment or attachment e↵ect (Ariely and Simonson, 2003). It posits that as
bidders become attached to a good in the course of bidding and are therefore more likely
to return to the site upon losing, in order to ultimately obtain the item. Our results on
exit are inconsistent with this hypothesis; our supplementary results in Table 2 showed

                                                                       22
that bidders who do return do not bid on the same product, and bidders who do return
and bid on the same product do not bid more. However, one might suspect that these
bidders lack opportunities to bid on the exact same product. We therefore o↵er a sharper
test by restricting attention to items that are in eBay’s product catalog, meaning that
they are sufficiently common to have a UPC code and we expect that there are many
such items o↵ered, so that a bidder could return and buy exactly the same product. To
further ensure this, we also limit the sample to items that had at least 10 listings in the
year after the BIN event.
       Table 4 recreates Table 1 using this restricted sample. If shifting reference points were
creating an endowment e↵ect, i.e., changing valuations for an entire class of products, say
all 64GB gold iPhone 3s rather than the particular one that was lost, we would expect
the losing bidder to return to bid at a higher rate. Instead, we find a positive e↵ect of
time in the lead on exit probability. Moreover, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the
slope is di↵erent for commodity and long-tail items.19

We contribute to a growing literature that studies the role of reference points in decision
making; see DellaVigna (2009) and Barberis (2013) for recent surveys. Barberis (2013)

argues that outside the areas of choice under uncertainty, namely finance and insurance,
a lack of empirical analyses casts doubt on the importance of reference points, and of
prospect theory more generally.
   The main difficulty Barberis (2013) points to is the lack of guidance on what a gain
or loss represent relative to well understood reference points. He states that the rational
expectations solution o↵ered by Kőszegi and Rabin (2006) “remains a hypothesis in need
of more testing and, in any case, is unlikely to be completely correct.” He later argues that
“Reference dependence is the most basic idea in prospect theory, and if any element of the
theory finds a permanent place in economic analysis, it will surely be this one.” To the
best of our knowledge, our analysis o↵ers a first application with rational reference points
that naturally shift with time to explain observed behavior in a large market setting.
   Documenting rationally-formed, evolving reference points, involves two major mea-
surement problems that have mostly confined the study of reference-dependent prefer-
ences to the lab. The first is finding a reference point shifter. In our setting, this is time
spent as the winning bidder, which is consistent with rational expectations reference point
formation in the spirit of Kőszegi and Rabin (2006). The data confirm that the longer one
holds the winning bid, the more likely it is that they will win the auction. This parallels
the reference point shifter in Card and Dahl (2011), who exploit the fact that rational
expectations about NFL game outcomes are easy to measure using betting markets.
   The second problem is finding a measure of ex post disappointment when the BIN
option is exercised. Platform exit serves this purpose in our study, and it is also eco-
nomically important. We believe that this is the clearest example of reference dependent
preferences using observational data from real market behavior to date. Card and Dahl
(2011) use family violence as the outcome variable and find that upset losses strongly
impact family violence, while losses in games that were expected to be close have small
and insignificant e↵ects. Hence, both studies provide confirmation of rational reference
point formation.
   Even though Card and Dahl (2011) is the closest study to ours in many respects, we do
find an interesting di↵erence between the exit behavior of individuals in our marketplace
and the violent behavior in their setting. NFL football games last for several hours,
creating the opportunity for updating the reference point during the game. Card and
Dahl (2011) test for such updating using the score at halftime and conclude that behavior
is driven by the game outcome relative to expectations at the start of the game, with


                                             24
no updating of reference points based on halftime information. We find that individuals
appear to update their reference points in two important ways. First, time in the lead
seems to continuously and rationally shift their beliefs about the likelihood of winning the
object. Second, and more striking, if they lose and have recourse to re-bid, and choose
not to, then they update their reference point in an extreme way. Namely, their behavior
suggests that they seem to shed the expectation of winning the auction, regardless of how
long they were in the lead before hand.
   Our study points at the potential for future empirical work in identifying the mag-
nitude and significance of behavioral biases using data from the exponentially growing
datasets associated with online consumer behavior. As ours and other recent studies
demonstrate, the breadth and increasing availability of online market data promises new
directions for testing behavioral theories and developing an empirical behavioral research
agenda that reaches far beyond lab environments.

A      Robustness Appendix
We conducted a series of robustness checks out of concern both for the exogeneity of
our variation as well as the interpretation of the e↵ects. First, we use a linear probabil-
ity model with a heteroskedasticity-robust variance-covariance matrix. This is partly a
specification check and partly meant to lay the ground for our second check, that applies
Altonji et al. (2005) and Oster (2015) to calculate bounds on the omitted variable bias
under proportional selection on observables and unobservables.
    This robustness exercise relies on adding control variables which have substantial ex-
planatory power on the outcome. To that end, we collected extensive controls on the
timing and levels of bids, demographic characteristics of bidders, as well as the charac-
teristics of the auction and the seller. Tables A-1 and A-2 display summary statistics for
our sample.


A-1     Linear Probability Model
As a specification check and prelude to Section A-2, we replicate our results using a linear
probability model (LPM) rather than the probit approach of Section 5 LPM estimates
are reported in Table A-3. They are somewhat larger than the probit AMEs, but they
have a very similar pattern of adjustment to covariates.


A-2     LPM Coefficient Stability
While our coefficients are stable as we add covariates, that is not a sufficient condition
for omitted variable bias to be negligible. Figures A-1 and A-2 are based on the omitted
variable bias bounding approach of Oster (2015). We assume that the unobservables
share at least some of the covariance properties of the observables we selected. Without
this reasonable assumption, very little can be said about the merits of our identification
strategy.
    The horizontal line in Figure A-1 shows the marginal e↵ect on exit from an additional
24 hours in the lead from specification (6) in Table A-3. The bias of this estimate depends
on two unknown in-sample parameters: the R2 from a hypothetical regression of the
                                                              2

of selection proportionality . A      of one indicates that the observed and unobserved

variables have an equally important e↵ect on the coefficient of interest. A                                                 greater than
one indicates that the unobserved variables are relatively more important.20 Similarly, an

RM AX of 1 would indicate that the potential explanatory variables are highly predictive
and there is very little measurement error or idiosyncratic variation driving a bidder’s
exit decision.

                  To fix the idea, consider our model

                                        y =↵+   · t + ⌃C
                                                       j=1   j   · xj + ⌃U
                                                                         k=1 ⌘k · zk + " = ↵ +          · t + C + U + ",

where y is the binary exit outcome, t is time in the lead, xj are the controls and zk are the unobserved
variables. We assume that U and C are orthogonal. The proportionality of selection relationship is
defined as
                                                                            Cov(U,t)
                                                                            V ar(U )
                                                                        =   Cov(C,t)
                                                                                       .
                                                                            V ar(C)

Essentially, is the ratio of univariate regression coefficients of the linear index t on U and the linear
                2
index t on C. RM  AX comes from the infeasible regression of y on t and the variables that comprise C
and U .

 Notes: This figure plots the proportionality of selection coefficient ( ) required to generate adjusted
                                               2
estimates such that = 0, as a function of RM     AX . We view this as a bound on the assumptions on
unobserved heterogeneity required to qualitatively overturn our result. The dashed vertical line refers to
the recommended value for comparison of 1.3 · R̃2 from (Oster, 2015).


                        The green line shows the bias-adjusted marginal e↵ect for the equal selection case
                                 2
( = 1) for a range of plausible RM AX values. Other downward-sloping lines make di↵erent
assumptions about the selection proportionality. In a setting where the observed and
unobserved variables explain a lot of the variation, the bias-adjusted e↵ect turns negative.
However, near the 1.3 · R̃2 cuto↵ for RM
                                       2
                                         AX suggested by Oster (2015), the bias-adjusted
estimates are generally near the unadjusted one and considerably above zero.21 This
suggests that our estimated e↵ect is robust and economically significant.
                                           2
                        For each value of RM AX , we also calculate the value of                       that would explain away the
marginal e↵ect and reduce it all the way to zero. That value is plotted in Figure A-2.
  21
    The cuto↵ is based on a sample of high-quality randomized studies that considered the sensitivity of
treatment e↵ects to the inclusion of controls. The assumption is that since treatment is experimental,
these estimates should generally “survive” the adjustments process. The cuto↵ of 1.3 · R̃2 , where R̃2 is
the R2 from the regression with the controls, allows 90% of estimates to survive. This value corresponds
to a bound on where the unobservables explain somewhat less than the observables.


                                                                                Appendix-5
Near our cuto↵, the unobserved variables needs to be more than 15 times as important
as observed ones to completely suppress the estimated e↵ect. When the exit decision is
more predictable, at least hypothetically, a smaller role for unobservables is sufficient to
reduce the estimates below zero.
   Another motivation for this robustness check is that it is possible for the perceived
time in the lead to exceed the measured time since users are typically not monitoring the
site closely and are inattentive to outbid notifications. We use the timestamp of when the
BIN event occurs to define time in the lead, but some amount of time may pass before
the losing bidder reads the e-mail or becomes cognizant of in-app notification, which are
instantaneous. This gap between measured time in the lead and perceived time in the
lead for the user means the e↵ect we seek to estimate will be attenuated. Since this issue
can be re-expressed as a kind of omitted variable problem, this bounding approach allows
us to characterize the magnitude of this measurement error-induced bias in the behavioral
response.
