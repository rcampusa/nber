This paper develops and estimates a model with multiple schooling choices that identifies the causal
effect of different levels of schooling on health, health-related behaviors, and labor market outcomes.
We develop an approach that is a halfway house between a reduced form treatment effect model and
a fully formulated dynamic discrete choice model. It is computationally tractable and identifies the
causal effects of educational choices at different margins. We estimate distributions of responses to
education and find evidence for substantial heterogeneity in unobserved variables on which agents
make choices. The estimated treatment effects of education are decomposed into the direct benefits
of attaining a given level of schooling and indirect benefits from the option to continue on to further
schooling. Continuation values are an important component of our estimated treatment effects. While
the estimated causal effects of education are substantial for most outcomes, we also estimate a quantitatively
important effect of unobservables on outcomes. Both cognitive and socioemotional factors contribute
to shaping educational choices and labor market and health outcomes. We improve on LATE by identifying
the groups affected by variations in the instruments. We find benefits of cognition on most outcomes
apart from its effect on schooling attainment. The benefits of socioemotional skills on outcomes beyond
their effects on schooling attainment are less precisely estimated.

        1     Introduction
        Persons with more schooling have better health, healthier behaviors, and higher wages.

        The causal basis for these relationships is the topic of a large literature.1

            Figure 1 illustrates these familiar empirical regularities for the four outcomes

        analyzed in this paper: wages, health, self-esteem, and smoking.2 The black bar in each

        panel shows the unadjusted mean difference in outcomes for persons at the indicated

        levels of educational attainment compared to those for high school dropouts. An obvious

        explanation for such relationships is ability bias. However, as shown by the grey bars in

        Figure 1, adjusting for family background and adolescent measures of ability attenuates,

        but does not eliminate, the estimated effects of education.3

            It is easy to fault the simple adjustments used in Figure 1. The measures used to

        make the adjustments may be incomplete or imperfect. Such concerns have given rise to

        a search for instrumental variables (exclusion restrictions including randomization and

        regression discontinuity methods) to secure causal estimates of the effect of education.

            The IV literature has itself been faulted. The available instruments for schooling are

        often weak (see Bound, Jaeger, and Baker, 1995). When agents select into schooling on

        the basis of their idiosyncratic benefits from it, instruments identify “causal effects” for

        unidentified groups of persons (see, e.g., Heckman, 1997; Heckman and Vytlacil, 1999,

        2005) that often differ from average treatment effects, treatment on the treated, or policy-

        relevant treatment effects (see Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil, 2011). Regression

        discontinuity methods identify responses for individuals at the points of discontinuity

        of the instruments which may or may not be the individuals toward which policies are

        best targeted.

       A positive association between education and labor market outcomes has long been noted in the
literature (Mincer, 1958; Becker, 1964; Mincer, 1974). For surveys, see Card (1999) and Heckman, Lochner,
and Todd (2006) and the references they cite. The positive correlation between schooling and health is also a
well-established finding (Grossman, 1972, 2000, 2006). See also Adams (2002); Arendt (2005); Lleras-Muney
(2005); Silles (2009); Spasojevic (2003); Arkes (2003); Auld and Sidhu (2005); Grossman (2008); Grossman
and Kaestner (1997); Cutler and Lleras-Muney (2010); Conti, Heckman, and Urzúa (2010), and the literature

          Most of the treatment effect literature focuses on identifying the effects of choosing

       between two levels of final schooling attainment or else assumes that schooling is

       captured by “years of schooling”4 and estimates versions of the Mincer (1974) model.5

       With a few notable exceptions,6 little work in the treatment effect literature considers

       models with multiple discrete schooling levels or dynamic models of schooling attainment.

       Moreover, identifying treatment effects at multiple margins of choice requires choice-

       specific instruments that are often not available.

          A growing literature formulates and estimates dynamic discrete choice models of

       schooling that account for both the nonlinearity of the effects of schooling and the

       information available to agents when they make their schooling choices.7 With these

       models, it is possible to identify the margins of choice which different instruments

       identify and the populations affected by the various instruments.8

          However, many question the robustness of estimates from such models because of

       the often strong assumptions made about schooling choice models, the information

       sets that agents are assumed to act on, the apparent arbitrariness in the choices

       of functional forms in the estimation equations, and the invocation of assumptions

       about the support of the instruments (see, e.g., Imbens, 2010). Many scholars report

       difficulties in identifying crucial cost parameters.9 Nonpecuniary or “psychic” costs play

       a dominant role in many structural models of schooling in which agents are assumed to

       make choices to maximize expected future net income. See, e.g., Cunha, Heckman, and

       Navarro (2005); Eisenhauer, Heckman, and Mosso (2013); Abbott, Gallipoli, Meghir,

       and Violante (2013). Unexplained “psychic costs” or tastes for schooling substantially

       outweigh financial costs in accounting for schooling choices. This casts some doubt on

       See Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2006) for a discussion of the empirical evidence against the Mincer
model. There is abundant evidence of “sheepskin” effects, i.e. nonlinearities associated with completion of
college. Those authors also show that the original Mincer model ignores continuation values to education
which we show to be an important component of the “true” effect of schooling.

       the specifications of decision rules used in the current structural literature.

          As a result of the criticism directed against the various approaches, the literature

       on the “causal effects” of schooling is divided into camps organized around favored

       methodologies, as well as beliefs about the questions they think can be “credibly”

       answered by the data. This paper implements an approach that is a halfway house

       between the IV literature that reports “effects” at unspecified margins and the fully

       structural dynamic discrete choice literature. Our approach draws on identifying

       strategies from the matching, IV, and control function literatures.10 We identify the

       causal effects of schooling at different stages of the life cycle based in part on a rich

       set of covariates to control for selection bias. We also use exclusion restrictions to

       identify our model as in the IV and control function literatures. Like the structural

       econometrics literature, we estimate causal effects at clearly identified margins of choice

       for populations affected by policies. Unlike the structural literature, we are agnostic

       about the specific model of choice used by agents. We approximate the dynamic choice

       model following suggestions of Heckman (1981), Eckstein and Wolpin (1989), Cameron

       and Heckman (2001), and Geweke and Keane (2001).

          We build on the sequential discrete choice model of Cameron and Heckman (2001) by

       adding schooling-specific outcome equations and by adding interpretable measurements

       to proxy the cognitive and socioemotional variables found to be important predictors of

       schooling, the returns to schooling, and the psychic costs of schooling.11 We explore the

       dimension of the space of unobservables required to control for selection and to fit the

       data. Instead of trying to purge the effects of multiple abilities on outcomes to isolate

       causal effects of schooling, we estimate the effects of these abilities in shaping schooling

       and in mediating the effects of schooling on outcomes. We use numerous proxies of

       both cognitive and socioemotional abilities in an attempt to account for ability bias

       at multiple margins of choice. We find that at least two dimensions of heterogeneity

       are required to produce an adequate empirical model of schooling and its effects on

      outcomes. We also find that after accounting for these abilities, there is little additional

      role for unmeasured abilities in shaping the dependence between schooling decisions

      and outcomes. We account for measurement error in measuring abilities and show that

      doing so has important consequences.12 We capture heterogeneity in the response to

      treatment on which individuals sort into schooling that is a hallmark of the recent IV

      literature. We estimate the empirical consequences of sorting on multiple components

      of ability.

          In our model, as in standard dynamic discrete choice models, educational choices at

      one stage open up educational options at later stages. The expected consequences of

      future choices and their costs are implicitly valued by individuals when deciding whether

      or not to continue their schooling. Our empirical strategy allows for these ex ante

      valuations but does not explicitly estimate them.13 We decompose the ex post treatment

      effects of educational choices into the direct benefits of the choice and the continuation

      values arising from access to additional education beyond the current choice. Thus

      we estimate ex post returns to schooling both as the direct causal benefit comparing

      two final schooling levels—the traditional focus in the human capital literature (see,

      e.g., Becker, 1964)—and as returns through continuation values created by the options

      opened up by schooling (Weisbrod, 1962; Comay, Melnik, and Pollatschek, 1973; Altonji,

      1993; Cameron and Heckman, 1993; and Heckman, Lochner, and Todd, 2006).

          Our paper also contributes to an emerging literature on the importance of both

      cognitive and socioemotional skills in shaping life outcomes (see Borghans, Duckworth,

      Heckman, and ter Weel, 2008; Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzúa, 2006; Almlund, Duckworth,

      Heckman, and Kautz, 2011). The traditional literature on the benefits of education

      focuses on the effects of cognitive ability. We confirm the findings in the recent literature

      that both cognitive and socioemotional skills are important predictors of educational

      attainment. Fixing schooling levels, the effects of cognition on outcomes are still

      substantial. The estimates of the within-schooling effects of socioemotional skills on

      outcomes are less precisely estimated.

          We find that (a) there is substantial sorting into schooling both on cognitive and

       socioemotional measures; (b) there are causal effects of education on smoking, physical

       health, and wages at all levels of schooling; (c) for most outcomes, only high-ability

       people benefit from graduating from college. An exception to this rule is that low-ability

       people are the only ability group to benefit in terms of self-esteem; (d) continuation values

       are an important component of the causal effects of schooling; and (e) measurement

       error is empirically important, and ignoring it affects our estimates. We also contribute

       to the literature on the non-market benefits of education by studying the causal effects

       of education on health, healthy behaviors, and mental health (see, e.g., Lochner, 2011,

       Oreopoulos and Salvanes, 2011, and Cawley and Ruhm, 2012).



       1.1     The Benefits and Limitations of Our Approach

       Like the treatment effect literature, our approach enables us to identify the gross

       benefits of education. Unlike what is obtained from that approach, we can identify

       average benefits for persons at multiple levels of schooling in terms of observable and

       unobservable characteristics. The approach adopted in this paper complements the

       analyses of Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2005, 2007a,b); Heckman, Urzúa, and Vytlacil

       (2006), and Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil (2011) by providing a flexible parametric

       alternative to their data-demanding semi-parametric analyses. Our approach is useful in

       estimating parameters for samples of moderate size, such as the NLSY79 data analyzed

       in this paper.

          Because we are agnostic about the decision model used by our agents, like the rest of

       the treatment effect literature, we do not identify costs.14 We do not impose particular

       models of expectations such as rational expectations. Fully structural models do so, but

       typically impose greater parametric structure. Accordingly, we cannot estimate ex ante

  14
     We can use auxiliary data to identify components of costs such as tuition. However, we cannot identify
the full components of cost, including psychic costs, which have been estimated to be very important. See
Eisenhauer, Heckman, and Mosso (2013), Eisenhauer, Heckman, and Vytlacil (2014), and Abbott, Gallipoli,
Meghir, and Violante (2013) where explicit structural approaches are developed and applied to generate
treatment effects and the costs and benefits of treatments. Structural models like those of Eisenhauer,
Heckman, and Mosso (2013) identify both ex ante and ex post rates of return.

                                                    8
benefits and costs, nor can we estimate net rates of return. This limitation precludes

a full cost-benefit analysis. With our approach we can only identify a portion of the

ingredients required to evaluate social programs—the ex post gross benefit portion

emphasized in the literature on treatment effects although monetary components of cost

may be available from auxiliary sources. Our approach represents a computationally

tractable compromise between the conventional literature on treatment effects and a

fully structural approach that allows us to explore economically relevant margins of

choice without imposing strong assumptions about agent decision making.



2      The Model
We estimate a sequential model of schooling with the transitions at the nodes shown in

Figure 2, where J is a set of possible schooling states, Cj,j 0 is the available choice set

for a person at j choosing between remaining at j or transiting to j 0 , where j, j 0 ∈ J .

J is not necessarily ordered. Dj,j 0 = 1 if a person at j chooses j 0 ∈ Cj,j 0 at decision

node {j, j 0 }. Dj,j 0 ∈ D, the set of possible educational transition decisions taken by an

individual over the life cycle. We assume that the environment is time-stationary and

that educational decisions are irreversible. Each choice set contains two options: (a)

remain at j ∈ Cj,j 0 or (b) continue on to j 0 ∈ Cj,j 0 , where j 0 6= j.

    Qj,j 0 = 1 denotes that a person gets to decision node {j, j 0 }. Qj,j 0 = 0 if the person

never visits decision node {j, j 0 }. The history of nodes visited by an agent can be

described by the collection of Qj,j 0 such that Qj,j 0 = 1. Clearly, Dj,j 0 is not defined

if Qj,j 0 = 0. Formally we assign the value “0” to such undefined states, but we could

assign any finite value.

    We adopt the convention that j = 0 is the state of being without a high school

credential; j = 1 denotes being a high school graduate; j = 2 denotes getting a GED

(an option for dropouts); j = 3 denotes attending college; j = 4 denotes graduating

college. The “j” denotes possible states a person can visit. We let s denote the realized

final schooling level, and S denote the discrete random variable. A person who drops



                                                9
      out of high school (D0,1 = 1) and does not earn a GED (D0,2 = 1) is a permanent

      dropout with s = 0. We observe post-schooling outcomes associated with each level of

      final educational attainment. In our sample, we have so few GEDs who attempt college

      that we ignore this possibility in our empirical analysis.15

where Ij,j 0 is the perceived value (by the agent) of attaining schooling level j 0 for a

can make irrational choices or their educational choices could be governed by behavioral

anomalies.

   Associated with each final schooling state are a set of k potential outcomes for

       2.2     Parameterizations of the Decision Roles and Potential

       Outcomes

       Following a well-established tradition in the literature,16 we approximate Ij,j 0 using a

       linear-in-the-parameters model:


                                   Ij,j 0 = Xj,j 0 βj,j 0 + θαj,j 0 − νj,j 0 ,                 (4)


       where Xj,j 0 is a vector of variables (and functions of these variables) observed by the

       economist that determine the schooling transition decision of the agent with schooling

       level j, θ is a vector of unobserved (by the economist) endowments. This approximation

       is a starting point for a more general analysis of dynamic discrete choice models.

       Endowments θ are not directly observed by the econometrician but are proxied by

       measures. θ plays an important role in our model. Along with the observed variables,

       it generates dependence among schooling choices and outcomes. νj,j 0 represents an

       idiosyncratic error term assumed to be independent across agents and states. It plays the

       role of a random shock: νj,j 0 ⊥⊥ (Xj,j 0 , θ), where “⊥⊥” denotes statistical independence.

          Latent variables generating outcomes are also approximated by a linear-in-the-

       parameters model.
                                      ∗
                                    Yk,s = Xk,s βk,s + θαk,s + νk,s ,                          (5)


       where Xk,s is a vector of observed controls relevant for outcome k and θ is the vector

       of unobserved endowments. νk,s represents an idiosyncratic error term that satisfies

       νk,s ⊥⊥ (Xk,s , θ).



       2.3     Measurement System for Unobserved Endowments θ

       Most of the literature estimating the causal effect of schooling develops strategies for

       eliminating the effect of θ in producing spurious relationships between schooling and


  16
    See Heckman (1981), Cameron and Heckman (1987, 2001), Eckstein and Wolpin (1989), Geweke and
Keane (2001), and Arcidiacono and Ellickson (2011).

                                                      12
       outcomes.17 Our approach is different. We proxy θ to identify the interpretable sources

       of omitted variable bias and to determine how the unobservables mediate the causal

       effects of education. We follow a recent literature documenting the importance of both

       cognitive and noncognitive skills in shaping schooling choices and mediating the effects

       of schooling on outcomes.

          Given θ, and conditional on X, all educational choices and outcomes are assumed

       to be statistically independent. If θ were observed, we could condition on (θ, X) and

       achieve selection-bias-free estimates of causal effects and model parameters. This would

       be equivalent to a parametric version of matching on θ and X.18 Both matching and

       the procedure in the paper assume that conditional on θ and X, outcomes and choices

       are statistically independent. In this paper, we do not directly measure θ. Instead, we

       proxy it and correct for the effects of measurement error on the proxy. Our analysis

       can be thought of as a parametric version of matching on mismeasured variables where

       we estimate and correct for the measurement error in the matching variables.19 We test

       the robustness of our approach by allowing for an additional unproxied unobservable

       that accounts for dependence between schooling and economic outcomes not captured

       by our proxies. These additional sources of dependence can be identified without proxy

       measurements for them under the conditions stated in Heckman and Navarro (2007).

          Following Carneiro, Hansen, and Heckman (2003) and Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzúa

       (2006), we adjoin a system of measurement equations to proxy θ. We have access to

       information on cognitive and socioemotional measures. We thus link our paper to an

       emerging literature on the importance of cognitive and noncognitive skills in shaping

       schooling choices and outcomes.20 The recent literature establishes that both cognitive

       and noncognitive skills can be shaped by interventions and that they are effective

       margins for social policy (see Heckman and Mosso, 2014, Heckman, Pinto, and Savelyev,

          Let θC and θSE denote the levels of cognitive and socioemotional endowments and

       suppose θ = (θC , θSE ). We allow θC and θSE to be correlated. Let Ts,l
                                                                           C be the lth

       level s. Parallel to the treatment of the index and outcome equations, we assume linear

          The structure assumed in Equations (6), (7), and (8) is identified even when

       allowing for correlated factors, if we have one measure that is a determinant of cognitive
                    C ), one measure that is a determinant of socioemotional endowments
       endowments (Ts,l
         SE ), at least three measures that load on both cognitive ability and socioemotional
       (Ts,l

       ability, and conventional normalizations are assumed.21 We collect our assumptions

       about the dependence structure among the model unobservables in Table 1. In Section

       I of the Web Appendix, we test if additional unobservables beyond θC and θSE are

       required to capture the dependence between schooling and outcomes beyond that arising

       from observables. Our empirical estimates are essentially unchanged when we introduce

       a third factor to capture dependencies between schooling and outcomes not captured

       by the proxy factors. To simplify the exposition, in the main text we report results

       from models that use measurements to proxy θ.




  21
     See, e.g., the discussion in Anderson and Rubin (1956) and Williams (2011). One of the factor loadings
for θC and θSE has to be normalized to set the scale of the factors. Nonparametric identification of the
distribution of θ is justified by an appeal to the results in Cunha, Heckman, and Schennach (2010).

Note: For linear models the independence assumption can be relaxed to allow the error terms to share a
common component (e.g. εk ) across schooling levels (i.e. instead assume ν̂k,s ⊥⊥ ν̂k,s0 , where νk,s = εk + ν̂k,s ).


       2.4      Sources of Identification

       Our model has multiple sources of identification. First, if θ were measured without

       error, the model would be identified by conditioning of θ (a version of matching on

       X and θ in a parametric model). If it is measured with error but all components are

       proxied, and the identifying restrictions for the factor models given in the previous

       section are satisfied, we can use the extension for matching on mismeasured variables

       developed in Carneiro, Hansen, and Heckman (2003) and Heckman, Pinto, and Savelyev

       (2013). Under either set of conditions, the model is identified without making any

       distributional assumptions on the unobservables (see, e.g., Cunha, Heckman, and

       Schennach, 2010). We also have access to transition-specific instruments, variables in

       Xj,j 0 , not in Xk,s , assumed to be independent of the model unobservables. The benefit

       of access to instrumental variables is that they allow us to test the validity of either

       version of the matching assumption. Under support conditions on the instruments


                                                              15
specified in Heckman and Navarro (2007), the model is identified without invoking any

distributional assumptions on the unobservables. We approximate the distribution of

unobservables using mixtures of normal sieve estimators (see Chen, 2007).



3     Defining Treatment Effects
Under our assumptions, the model estimates distributions of counterfactual outcomes.

Hence a variety of treatment effects for the effect of education on labor market and

health outcomes can be generated from it. They can be used to predict the effects of

manipulating education levels through different channels for people of different ability

levels. They allow us to understand the effectiveness of policy for different segments of

the population.

    We consider two different formulations of treatment effects. The first compares

returns between two terminal schooling levels. The second estimates the treatment

effect of specific educational decisions, inclusive of the continuation values associated

with future decisions.

    The traditional literature on estimating the returns to schooling defines its param-

eters in terms of the returns generated from going from one final schooling level to

another (Becker, 1964). It ignores the sequential nature of schooling and the options

created by going to an additional level of school. For example, after graduating from

high school, an agent may enroll in college. After enrolling, the agent may choose to

earn a four-year degree. The benefits of graduating from high school include the options

which subsequent education makes possible. (See Weisbrod, 1962; Comay, Melnik, and

Pollatschek, 1973; Altonji, 1993 and Cameron and Heckman, 1993.)

    Treatment effects can be identified at each node in the educational choice tree of

Figure 2. For example, we estimate the treatment effect for deciding to graduate from

high school or drop out (node {0, 1}). Once agents graduate from high school, they

have the option of going to college and even graduating from college. Similarly, once

agents drop out, they have the option of getting a GED. The full returns to early



                                           16
      choices include the benefits from access to additional educational options.



      3.1      Traditional Treatment Effects: Differences Across Fi-

      nal Schooling Levels

      We estimate the traditional returns to education defined as the gains from choosing

      between terminal schooling levels. Let Ys0 be an outcome at schooling level s0 and Ys

      be an outcome at schooling level s. Conditioning on X = x and θ = θ, the average

      treatment effect of s compared to s0 is E(Ys − Ys0 |X = x, θ = θ). Measured over the

      entire population it is

                                        ZZ
                            ∗
                        AT Es,s 0   ≡        E(Ys − Ys0 |X = x, θ = θ) dFX,θ (x, θ).             (9)


          The average treatment effect calculated by averaging over the subset of the population

      that completes one of the two final schooling levels is

                             ZZ
                AT Es,s0 ≡          E(Ys − Ys0 |X = x, θ = θ) dFX,θ (x, θ | Hs + Hs0 = 1).      (10)



      3.2      Dynamic Treatment Effects

      We also estimate treatment effects associated with each decision node. These take into

      account the benefits associated with the options opened up by educational choices.

      This treatment effect is the difference in expected outcomes arising from changing a

      single educational decision in a sequential schooling model and tracing through its

      consequences. We estimate the continuation value as the probability-weighted benefit

      of further educational choices using probabilities perceived by the agent. In computing

      a version of these probabilities to identify treatment effects (but only for this purpose),

      we assume rational expectations: the empirical probabilities are assumed to be what

      the agent acts on.22 The expected value associated with fixing a particular education


22
     We do not impose rational expectations in estimating the choice model, just in interpreting it.

        The expectation (E) on the left-hand side is over future educational choices and
                                                                 
        idiosyncratic shocks. P r s|X = x, θ = θ, F ix Dj,j 0 = 1 is the probability that the

        individual stops at education level s when fixing Dj,j 0 = 1. Ys is the value of the outcome

        if the individual stops at education level s. For example, the choice of graduating from

        high school opens up the possibility of enrolling in college and possibly graduating from

        college.24

           The person-specific treatment effect for an individual making a decision at node

        (j, j 0 ) deciding between going on to j 0 or stopping at j is the difference between the

        expected value of the two decisions:


             Tj,j 0 [Y |X = x, θ = θ] ≡ E(Y |X = x, θ = θ, F ix Qj,j 0 = 1, F ix Dj,j 0 = 1)

                                            − E(Y |X = x, θ = θ, F ix Qj,j 0 = 1, F ix Dj,j 0 = 0).


        The person-specific treatment effect not only takes into account the direct effect of the

        decision, but also includes the value of any additional schooling. Averaged over the full

        population
                                           ZZ

        The corresponding parameter for those who ever visit the decision node {j, j 0 } is

                                      ZZ

   23
      The distinction between fixing and conditioning traces back to Haavelmo (1943). For a recent analysis
see Heckman and Pinto (2013). Under the assumptions in Table 1, fixing and conditioning produce the same
causal parameter conditioning on X and θ.
   24
      The expected outcome for an individual with characteristics X and θ who chooses to graduate from
high school (D0,1 = 1) is thus E(Y |X = x, θ = θ, F ix D0,1 = 1) = P r(s = 1|X = x, θ = θ, F ix D0,1 =
1) × E(Y1 , |X = x, θ = θ) + P r(s = 3|X = x, θ = θ, F ix D0,1 = 1) × E(Y3 |X = x, θ = θ) + P r(s = 4|X =
x, θ = θ, F ix D0,1 = 1) × E(Y4 |X = x, θ = θ).

                                                          18
       The average marginal treatment effect is the average effect of choosing an additional

       level of schooling for individuals who are at the margin of indifference between the two

       choices:

                                    ZZ
                    AM T Ej,j 0 ≡        Tj,j 0 [Y |X = x, θ = θ] dFX,θ (x, θ̄ | |Ij,j 0 | ≤ ε),   (13)


       where ε is an arbitrarily small neighborhood around the margin of indifference. AMTE

       defines causal effects at well-defined and empirically identified margins of choice. This

       is the proper measure of marginal gross benefits for evaluating social policies.25

          Each treatment effect can be decomposed into direct effects and a continuation value.

       For example, the continuation value of graduating from high school is the probability

       that the individual enrolls in college times the expected wage benefit of having some

       college plus the probability of completing college times the wage benefit of completing

       college and stops there:26


          CV0,1 (Y |X = X, θ = θ)

                    = E(Y4 − Y1 |X = X, θ = θ) × Pr(s = 4|X = X, θ = θ, F ix D1,0 = 1)

                    + E(Y3 − Y1 |X = X, θ = θ) × Pr(s = 3|X = X, θ = θ, F ix D1,0 = 1).


       We report estimates of the continuation value ratio (CVR) to summarize the relative

       importance of the CV. It is the average continuation value (ACV) divided by the
                                                                                    ACV

       3.3        Policy Relevant Treatment Effects

       The policy relevant treatment effect (PRTE) is the average treatment effect for those

       induced to change their educational choices in response to a particular policy intervention.

       Let Y p be the aggregate outcome under policy p. Let S(p) be the schooling selected
  25
     See, e.g., Heckman and Vytlacil (2007a) and Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil (2010).
  26
     The direct effect of graduating from high school is DT E0,1 (Y |X = x, θ = θ) = E(Y1 − Y0 |X = x1 , θ =
θ) − E(Y2 − Y0 |X = x, θ = θ) × Pr(s = 2|X = x, θ = θ, F ix D0,1 = 0). The second term on the right-hand
side arises from the forgone option of taking the GED.

       4      Data
       We use the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) to estimate our

       model. It is a nationally representative sample of men and women born in the years

       1957–1964. Respondents were first interviewed in 1979 when they were 14–22 years of

       age. The NLSY surveyed its participants annually from 1979 to 1992 and biennially

       since 1992. The NLSY measures a variety of adult outcomes including income and

       health. The survey also measures many other aspects of the respondents’ lives, such as

       educational attainment, fertility, scores on achievement tests, high school grades, and

       family background variables. This paper uses the core sample of males, which, after

       removing observations with missing covariates, contains 2242 individuals.27 We report

       results for samples that pool race groups.



       4.1     Outcomes, Transitions, and Final Attainment Levels

       This paper considers the effect of education on three different health and health-related

       outcomes: overall physical health, smoking, and self-esteem.28 As a measure of physical

  27
      Respondents were dropped from the analysis if they did not have valid ASVAB scores, missed multiple
rounds of interview, had implausible educational histories, were missing control variables which could not
be imputed, or had implausible labor market histories. A number of imputations where made as necessary.
Previous years’ covariates were used when covariates where not available for a needed year (such as region
of residence). Responses from adjacent years were used for some outcomes when outcome variables were
missing at the age of interest. Mother’s education and father’s education were imputed when missing. See
Web Appendix Section A for the analysis of the deleted observations.
   28
      The literature focuses primary attention on the effect of mortality and on smoking. See Cutler and
Lleras-Muney (2010).

                                                     20
        health, we use the PCS-12 scale, the Physical Component Summary obtained from

        the SF-12.29 The SF-12 in turn is designed to provide a measure of the respondent’s

        mental and physical health irrespective of their proclivity to use formal health services.

        We also study smoking at age 30 as an additional measure of healthy behaviors. It is

        a self-reported, binary variable recording whether the individual smoked daily at age

        30. As a measure of mental health, the effect of education on self-esteem is considered.

        Self esteem is measured using Rosenberg’s self-esteem scale collected in 2006, when

        individuals were in their 40s.

            We also analyze the effect of education on log wages at age 30 as a traditional

        benchmark. Details on the construction of these outcome variables are presented in the

        Web Appendix Section A.

            We estimate models with the four different transitions and five final schooling levels

        depicted in Figure 2. Education at age 30 is treated as the respondent’s final schooling

        level.30



        4.2        Measurement System (T )

        Our approach to estimating the impact of cognitive and socioemotional measures on

        schooling choices and outcomes improves on the traditional approach, which uses indices

        of direct measures of behavior, designated as cognitive and socioemotional indices, to

        proxy latent traits. We allow for measurement error and use factor analysis to let the

        data determine the weights on specific measures used in forming indices.31

            As noted by Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz (2011) and Heckman and

        Kautz (2012, 2014), a fundamental identification problem plagues the extraction of

        psychological characteristics. Traits are measured from behaviors that can also be

        affected by incentives and other traits. Even after controlling for these incentives and

        other traits, some normalizations are necessary to operationalize the measures of traits,
   29
      SF-12 is a 12-question health survey designed by John Ware of the New England Medical Center Hospital
(see Ware, Kosinski, and Keller (1996) and Gandek, Ware, Aaronson, Apolone, Bjorner, Brazier, Bullinger,
Kaasa, Leplege, Prieto, and Sullivan (1998).
   30
      A negligible fraction of individuals change schooling levels after age 30.

        and distinguish one trait from another. Even if this distinction cannot be made, we

        can condition on the (entire) set of traits without distinguishing which particular traits

        produce outcomes. Hence, our estimates of the causal effects of schooling on outcomes

        do not require that we solve these identification problems. Our estimates of effects of

        specific factors do.

           We identify the cognitive and socioemotional factors used in this paper from an

        auxiliary measurement system fit jointly with a model of educational choice. Following

        Hansen, Heckman, and Mullen (2004), we control for the effect of schooling at the

        time the measurements are taken on the measurements to control for feedback from

        schooling to measured traits. We do not use the outcome measures (Y ) in extracting

        the distributions of latent factors to avoid getting tautologically good fits between

        outcomes and factors and to render the factors interpretable.

           Sub-tests from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) are used

        as dedicated measures of cognitive ability and are assumed not to be determined by

        the socioemotional factor. Specifically, we consider scores from Arithmetic Reasoning,

        Coding Speed, Paragraph Comprehension, Word Knowledge, Math Knowledge, and

        Numerical Operations.32

           Academic success (measured by GPA) depends on cognitive ability, but also de-

        pends strongly on socioemotional traits such as conscientiousness, self-control, and

        self-discipline. This motivates our identification strategy of including both a cognitive

        and socioemotional factor as determinants of 9th grade GPA, as much of the variance in

        this measure not explained through cognitive test scores has been shown to be related

        to socioemotional traits.33

           To identify the socioemotional factor, we use measures of participation in minor


   32
      A subset of these tests is used to construct the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score, which is
commonly used as a measure of cognitive ability. AFQT scores are often interpreted as proxies for cognitive
ability (Herrnstein and Murray, 1994). See the discussion in Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz
(2011).
   33
      As noted by Borghans, Golsteyn, Heckman, and Humphries (2011) and Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman,
and Kautz (2011), the principal determinants of the grade point average are personality traits and not
cognition. Similarly, Duckworth and Seligman (2005) find that self-discipline predicts GPA in 8th graders
better than IQ. See also Duckworth, Quinn, and Tsukayama (2010).

       risky or reckless activity in 1979 in the measurement system for the socioemotional

       endowment.34 In order to identify the distribution of correlated factors, risky behavior

       is restricted to not load on the cognitive factor.35

          As a robustness check, we include five additional measures of risky adolescent

       behavior to check our estimates based on the non-cognitive factor.36 We consider

       violent behavior in 1979 (fighting at school or work and hitting or threatening to hit

       someone), tried marijuana before age 15, daily smoking before age 15, regular drinking

       before age 15, and any intercourse before age 15. For violent behavior, we control for

       the potential effect of schooling on the outcome. The estimates based on including

       these measures are essentially the same as the ones reported in the text.



       4.3     Control Variables (X)

       For every outcome, measure, and educational choice, we control for race, broken home

       status, number of siblings, mother’s education, father’s education, and family income

       in 1979. We additionally control for region of residence and urban status at the time

       the relevant measure, decision, or outcome was assessed.37 For log wages at age 30, we

       additionally control for local economic conditions at age 30.

          The models for educational choice include additional choice-specific covariates.

       Following Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil (2011), we control for both long-run economic

       conditions measured by unemployment and current deviations from those conditions. By

       controlling for the long-run local economic environment, local unemployment variations

       capture current economic shocks that might affect schooling decisions.

  34
      Preliminary data analysis suggested that one measure of risky behavior is the least correlated cognitive
endowments among our measures of socioemotional traits. This variable is a binary variable which is unity if
an agent answers yes to any of the following questions in 1980: “Taken something from the store without
paying for it,” “Purposely destroyed or damaged property that did not belong to you?,” “Other than from a
store, taken something that did not belong to you worth under $50?,” and “Tried to get something by lying
to a person about what you would do for him, that is, tried to con someone?”
   35
      These measures are used for estimating one of the three-factor models discussed in Web Appendix
Section I.
   36
      Gullone and Moore (2000) present a line of research which studies the relationship between personality
traits and adolescent risk-behavior.
   37
      Based on the data, we assume that high school, GED certification, and college enrollment decisions
occur at age 17 while the choice to graduate from college is made at age 22.

                                                     23
       4.4     Exclusion Restrictions

       Identification of our model does not rest solely on the conditional independence as-

       sumptions listed in Table 1 which, by themselves, could justify identification of our

       model as a version of matching on mismeasured variables. Under sufficient support

       conditions on the regressors, the model is nonparametrically identified and does not

       require either conditional independence assumptions or normality assumptions.38 To

       nonparametrically identify treatment effects without invoking the full set of conditional

       independence assumptions, node-specific instruments are critical. We have a variety

       of exclusion restrictions that affect choices but not outcomes. These are listed in the

       bottom five rows of Table 2. The node-specific exclusion restrictions are noted at the

       base of the table.

          In a dynamic forward-looking model, instruments at later stages that are known

       at earlier stages cannot be excluded from choices at earlier stages. Following the

       literature on rational expectations econometrics (see Hansen and Sargent, 1980), stage-

       specific expectations of the future-stage realized value of instruments qualify as valid

       instruments. We find that candidate instruments based on future variables (e.g., college

       tuition for high school graduation) were not statistically significant predictors of early-

       stage (high school graduation) decisions. In our samples, future realizations of the

       potential instruments do not predict previous stage-specific schooling choices. Invoking

       linearity of the effect of schooling on outcomes widely used in the literature (Card,

       1999, 2001) avoids the need for stage-specific instruments. However, linearity in years

       of schooling for wage equations is decisively rejected in many data sets.39 In addition,

       different schooling levels are qualitatively different.40

        5     Estimation Strategy
        We estimate the model in two stages. The distribution of latent endowments and the

        model of schooling decisions are estimated in the first stage. The outcome equations

        are estimated in the second stage using estimates from the first stage.

            We follow Hansen, Heckman, and Mullen (2004), and correct estimated factor

        distributions for the causal effect of schooling on the measurements by jointly estimating

        the schooling choice and measurement equations. The distribution of the latent factors

        is estimated using data on only educational choices and measurements. This allows

        us to interpret the factors as cognitive and socioemotional endowments. It links our

        estimates to an emerging literature on the economics of personality and psychological

        traits but is not strictly required if we only seek to control for selection in schooling

        choices. We do not use the final outcome system to estimate the factors, thus avoiding

        producing tautologically strong predictions from the estimated factors.

            Assuming independence across individuals, the likelihood is:

                                   Y
                            L=             f (Yi , Di , Ti |Xi )
                                       i
                                   YZ
                               =                 f (Yi |Di Xi , θ)f (Di , Ti |Xi , θ)f (θ)dθ,
                                       i


        where f (·) denotes a probability density function. The last step is justified from the

        assumptions listed in Table 1. For the first stage, the sample likelihood is

                                           YZ
                                   1
                               L =                       f (Di , Ti |Xi , θ = θ) dFθ (θ),       (15)
                                             i     θ∈Θ


        where we integrate over the distributions of the latent factors. We approximate the

        factor distribution using a mixture of normals.41 We assume that the idiosyncratic

        shocks are mean zero normal variates. The goal of the first stage is to secure estimators

        of f (Di , Ti | Xi , θ) and f (θ). In the second stage, we use first stage estimates (denoted

   41
     Mixtures of normals can be used to identify the true density nonparametrically, where the number of
mixtures can be increased based on the size of the sample. For a discussion of sieve estimators, see Chen
(2007).

                                                               26

                   L =              f (Yi |Di , Xi , θ = θ)fˆ(Di , Ti |Xi , θ = θ)dF̂θ (θ).   (16)
                          i   θ∈Θ


      Since outcomes (Yi ) are independent from the first stage outcomes conditional on

      Xi , θ, Di and we impose no cross-equation restrictions, we obtain consistent estimates

      of the parameters for the adult outcomes. Each stage is estimated using maximum-

      likelihood. Standard errors and confidence intervals are calculated by estimating two

      hundred bootstrap samples for the combined stages.



      6      Empirical Estimates
      Since the model is nonlinear and multidimensional, in the main text we only report

      interpretable simulations of it.42 We randomly draw regressors from the observations

      and the estimated factor distributions to simulate the various outcomes.

          We present our empirical analysis in the following order. Section 6.1 discusses the

      estimates of the measurement system and the estimated effects of the endowments

      on schooling, labor market, and health outcomes. Section 6.2 presents estimates of

      the treatment effects of education. Section 6.3 gives estimates of the policy relevant

      treatment effect of a subsidy to college tuition. Section 6.4 discusses the importance of

      the latent cognitive and socioemotional endowments.



      6.1     The measurement of endowments and their effects on

      outcomes

      Figure 3 shows the variance decomposition of the measures. The latent factors explain

      between 20% and 70% of the variance of the ASVAB tests and school grades. While the

      socioemotional factor explains only 2%–3% of the variation in reckless behavior, it has a

      statistically significant effect on outcomes for those with at least a high school degree.43
42
     Parameter estimates for individual equations are reported in the Web Appendix.
43
     See Web Appendix Section C.

                                                     27
        Although observed and latent variables combined explain a large part of the variance

        of the test scores and grades, there is a still significant amount of measurement error

        (labeled as “Residual” in the figure).44 We test and reject the hypothesis that a bivariate

        normal model produces good model fit in favor of a model with a mixture of two normals

        for the factor distribution.45 Simulations of the model show that the estimated model

        fits the data well.46 We find a positive and statistically significant correlation between

        the cognitive and socioemotional/personality endowments (ρ = 0.23).




   44
       This implies that any predictions of the factors would also have a significant amount of measurement
error.
    45
       The likelihood ratio test was used to test for the appropriate number of mixtures.
    46
       The goodness of fit measurements are made for the various outcomes and measurement systems. Goodness
of fit for discrete outcomes is tested using a χ2 test of fit of the model to data. For continuous outcomes, the
equality of the model and data are tested using t-tests. We test for mean equivalence of the means for many
sub-populations and jointly test if the means are equivalent for all sub-populations using a χ2 test. Tests of
goodness of fit are found in Section E in the Web Appendix.

       Notes: Bars indicate the fraction of the variance in each outcome explained by observable covariates (X), unobservable cognitive and
       socioemotional factors (θC , θSE ), and remaining unobservables (). For continuous outcomes we decompose the observed variance, while
       for discrete outcomes we decompose the variance of the latent index. Given the assumption that the factors, observable characteristic,
       and unobservables are all independent, the total variance of an outcome can be decomposed as var(Y ) = var(X 0 β) + var(θ 0 α) + var()
       for continuous outcomes and var(I) = var(X 0 β) + var(θ 0 α) + var() for discrete outcomes. Furthermore, var(α0 θ) = var(θC αC ) +
       2cov(θC αC , θN C αN C ) + var(θN C αN C ). In the legend above, for continuous outcomes, “Observables” is var(X 0 β)/var(Y ), “Cognitive” is
       var(θC αC )/var(Y ), “Covariance” is 2cov(θC αC , θN C αN C )/var(Y ), and “Socioemotional” is var(θN C αN C )/var(Y ). Calculations for the
       discrete outcomes are the same, but are normalizes by var(I) rather than var(Y ). The ASVAB tests are assumed to not depend on the
       socioemotional endowment, while reckless behavior is assumed to not depend on the cognitive endowment. The ASVAB and behavior
       models are estimated separately for those with less than twelve years (< 12), those who are high school graduates (= 12), and those
       who have attended college (> 12) at the time they took the ASVAB tests. Minor reckless behavior, which is also measured in 1979, also
       estimates models separately for those with less than 12 years and those with 12 or more years of schooling.

Notes: For each of the four educational choices, we present three figures that study the probability of that specific educational
choice. Final schooling levels do not allow for further options. For each pair of schooling levels 0 and 1, the first subfigure (top)
presents P rob(D|dC , dSE ) where dC and dSE denote the cognitive and socioemotional deciles computed from the marginal
distributions of cognitive and socioemotional endowments. P rob(D|dC , dSE ) is computed for those who reach the decision node
involving a decision between levels 0 and 1. The bottom left subfigures present P rob(D|dC ) where the socioemotional factor is
integrated out. The bars in these figures display, for a given decile of cognitive endowment, the fraction of individuals visiting
the node leading to the educational decision involving levels 0 and 1. The bottom right subfigures present P rob(D|dSE ) for
a given decile of socioemotional endowment, as well as the fraction of individuals visiting the node leading to the educational
decision involving levels 0 and 1.

Notes: For each of the four outcomes, we present three figures that study the impact of cognitive and socioemotional endowments.
The top figure in each panel displays the levels of the outcome as a function of cognitive and socioemotional endowments. In
particular, we present the average level of outcomes for different deciles of cognitive and socioemotional endowments. Notice
that we define as “decile 1” the decile with the lowest values of endowments and “decile 10” as the decile with the highest levels
of endowments. The bottom left figure displays the average levels of endowment across deciles of cognitive endowments. The
bottom right figure mimics the structure of the left-hand side figure but now for the socioemotional endowment.




                                                                                                                                                         32
           There may be concern that the socioemotional factor is describing something like

        academic ability, since it is partly based on grades.47 In order to address this issue,

        the role of the cognitive and socioemotional factors in adverse adolescent behaviors is

        investigated. Table 3 reports estimates for smoking, drinking, intercourse and violent

        behaviors. The factor loadings (the coefficients for “cognitive” and “socioemotional”

        factors at the base of each table) show that the socioemotional factor plays a significant

        role in these adverse behaviors, whereas the cognitive loadings are either statistically

        insignificant or much smaller than the socioemotional loadings.




   47
      Our exclusion restriction for the socioemotional factor is “risky and reckless behavior in 1979”, which is
a binary measure of whether the person had ever done any of the following things: (1) purposefully damaged
another person’s property, (2) stolen an item of value from another person that was worth less than $50,
(3) stolen a small item from a store, or (4) tried to get something from someone by lying about what they
would do in return. Not included as part of the measurement system, we have additional binary measures for
violent behavior in 1979, daily smoking before age 15, tried marijuana before 15, regular drinking before 15,
and sexual intercourse before age 15. These five measures were excluded from the measurement system as
they are extreme enough that they may affect schooling decisions and later life health. For example, we did
not want to predict later life health decisions with early life health decisions, or educational choice by actions
that could lead to incarceration (such as violent behavior). We include these as outcomes that do not inform
our measurement system to help us interpret our factor. We chose risky and reckless behavior in 1979 as our
exclusion restriction because it was less likely to directly determine educational outcomes. All of the risky
measures had low and statistically insignificant correlations with AFQT (| ρ |< 0.05). See section N.1.

     The numbers in this table represent the estimated coefficients and standard errors associated with binary choice models of early risky
      behaviors on the set of controls presented in rows. Information about living in the West and Northeast is only available in 1979. a The
      dependent variable takes a value of one if the individual has reported the behavior before age 15, and zero otherwise. b The variable
     “Violent” takes a value of one if the individual participated in fighting or assault in 1979, and is estimated separately by education level to
      account for age differences in 1979. For violent behavior, which is measured in 1979 rather than at a specific age, we include age and age
      squared.

     Notes: The numbers in this table represent the estimated coefficients and standard errors associated with individual binary choice models
     of the sequential education model. Terminal schooling levels are highlighted in bold. Age in 1979 is included as a cohort control. We also
     included individual cohort dummies and it did not change the results. a Local long-run unemployment is the average local unemployment
     level over the previous 5 years. Local unemployment is the current unemployment rate. GED passrate is the estimated number of high
     school graduates able to pass the test on a single try given the state’s passing standard. Unemployment variables, tuition, region dummies,
     and urban status are at age 17 for high school graduation, GED certification, and college enrollment choices. Tuition, unemployment
     variables, region dummies, and urban status are at age 22 for the choice to graduate from college.
          To test the robustness of the measurement system and our identification strategy,

       several alternative specifications were estimated. For example, the measurement system

       was also estimated including models for early adverse behavior. Including these measures

       does not substantially change either the distribution of the factors or the loadings in

       the education and grade models. In Appendix Section I.2.4, we report that inclusion of

       a third factor, unrelated to cognitive and noncognitive measurements, but included in

       the schooling and outcome equations, does not substantially affect any of our empirical

       results.48 This lends support to an empirical strategy of matching on mismeasured

       proxies for interpretable factors and correcting for measurement error.49

          Table 4 presents the estimates of the schooling choice model. The cognitive factor

       loadings are statistically significant for all educational decisions. The socioemotional

       loadings are statistically significant in all decisions but the decision for GED certification.

       Figure 3 shows that the latent factors explain about 20%–40% of the variance in the

       educational models. Figure 4 shows the distribution of the factors by final schooling

       level. Figure 5 presents the probabilities of making the indicated educational choice

       at various levels of agent latent endowments. Individuals sort on both cognitive and

       socioemotional endowments into increasing schooling levels. The only exception are

       the GEDs, who have cognitive ability distributions similar to terminal high school

       graduates but socioemotional distributions similar to dropouts.

          The latent endowments have statistically significant effects on labor market and

       health outcomes. Figure 6 plots the effects of the latent endowments on (log) wages,

       daily smoking, self-esteem, and physical health. The cognitive endowment affects all four

       outcomes, while the effect of the socioemotional endowment is statistically significant

       only in the equations for wages and smoking. Moving someone from the lowest decile

       to the highest decile in both cognitive and socioemotional ability, increases their wages

       by 0.6 log points, lowers the probability of being a smoker by 60%, increases their

       self-esteem by one standard deviation and increases their health by half a standard

  48
     The third factor is assumed to be uncorrelated with the other two factors. Proof of identification of the
model is straightforward using the analysis in Anderson and Rubin (1956).
  49
     Appendix F shows the importance of accounting for measurement error in forming proxies for the factors.

       deviation.

          The estimates reveal clear evidence of sorting into education by both cognitive and

       socioemotional endowments. At the same time, these endowments have significant

       impacts on adult outcomes. Together these results imply strong selection biases in

       observed differences in outcomes by education level. This highlights the importance

       of accounting for observed and latent traits when estimating the causal impact of

       education.



       6.2     The Effects of Educational Choices

       As discussed in Section 3, the causal effects of educational can be calculated by comparing

       outcomes between two final schooling levels or comparing final outcomes based on fixing

       decisions at a specified choice. We first compare the outcomes from a particular final

       schooling level s with those associated with being a high school dropout. The estimated

       treatment effects of education on log wages, smoking, physical health, and self-esteem

       are shown in Figure 7.50 For each of the outcomes, the bars labeled “Observed” display

       the observed differences in the data. The bars labeled “Causal Mechanism” display the

       average treatment effect obtained from the comparison of the outcomes associated with

       a particular schooling level j relative to the high school dropout status.51 This figure

       shows the observed earnings difference between dropouts and other educational groups.

       Since the “observed” bar only uses the individuals in two groups, the ATE is calculated

       over the same sub-population to increase comparability.

          Our sequential model allows us to construct and analyze treatment effects by decision

       node. We also compute the gain to achieving (and possibly exceeding) the designated

       state inclusive of the continuation value and compare it to the outcome associated with

       not achieving the state. AMTE is the average treatment effect for the subpopulations

  50
      These are calculated by simulating the mean outcomes for the designated state and comparing it with
the mean-simulated outcome for the benchmark dropout state for the subpopulation of persons who are in
either the designated state or the dropout state.
   51
      Tables showing ATE for the full population; TT and TUT can be found in Section J of the Web
Appendix.

Notes: Each bar compares the outcomes from a particular schooling level j and the HS dropout status. The “Observed” bar
displays the observed differences in the data. The “Causal Mechanism” bar displays the estimated average treatment effect
(ATE) obtained from the comparison of the outcomes associated with a particular schooling level j relative to the HS dropout
status. The ATE is calculated for those who have one of the final schooling levels being considered, so that the population
is the same as the “Observed.” The RR   ATE for the full population and other margins is reported in the Web Appendix. The
average treatment effect is AT Es,0 ≡     E(Ys − Y0 |X = X, θ = θ) dFX,θ (X, θ | H0 + Hs = 1) where E is the expectation over
idiosyncratic shocks to the outcomes Ys and Y0 . The difference between the observed and causal treatment effect is attributed
to the effect of selection and ability. The error bars and significance levels for the estimated ATE are calculated using 200
bootstrap samples. Error bars show one standard deviation and correspond to the 15.87th and 84.13th percentiles of the
bootstrapped estimates, allowing for asymmetry. Significance at the 5% and 1% levels is shown by open and filled circles on
the plots, respectively.




                                                                              38
       approximately indifferent to the two options of a particular choice.52 The PRTE is

       defined as the average treatment effect for those induced to change final educational

       levels by a change in policy from p to p0 . Again, the gains include continuation values.

           The estimated treatment effects of educational decisions on log-wages, smoking,

       physical health and self-esteem are shown in Figure 8. Each figure presents the average

       effects of educational choices on the outcome of interest. The effects are presented as

       different bars in each figure, and they are defined as the differences in the outcome

       associated with the designated level and the one preceding it (not necessarily final or

       terminal schooling levels). Let Yj 0 denote the outcome (including continuation value)

       of choosing more schooling at a particular node. Let Yj be the outcomes when no

       additional schooling is chosen at the particular node. Terminal schooling levels (GED

       certification and college graduation) do not provide any continuation value. At each

       node, ATE presents E(Yj 0 − Yj |Qj,j 0 = 1). ATE (high) and ATE (low) are the ATEs

       for different ability groups. The high- (low-) ability group is defined for individuals

      with both cognitive and socioemotional endowment above (below) the overall median

       of the full population. The table below the figure displays the fraction of individuals at

       each educational choice who are in the high- or low-ability group. The ATE is for the

       population who reaches the decision node. The ATE estimates for the entire population

       are reported in the Web Appendices J and K.

           The panels in Figure 9 show that the estimated average treatment effect of getting

       a four-year degree depends on the latent ability of individuals for log wages, smoking,

       self-esteem and physical health. The figures display how treatment effects of graduating

       from college vary by decile of both cognitive and socioemotional endowments for each

       outcome. Unlike the previous graphs, these show average benefits by decile over the full

       population, rather than for the population that reaches each node. This makes deciles

       comparable across figures.

Notes: Let Yj and Yj 0 denote the outcomes associated with schooling levels j and j 0 , respectively. Importantly, each
schooling level might provide the option to pursuing higher schooling levels. Only final schooling levels do not provide
an option value. The error bars and significance levels for the estimated ATE are calculated using 200 bootstrap sam-
ples. Error bars show one standard deviation and correspond to the 15.87th and 84.13th percentiles of the bootstrapped
estimates, allowing for asymmetry. Significance at the 5% and 1% level are shown by hollow and black circles on the
plots respectively. For two schooling levels j and j 0 associated with a particular educational choice, the ATE bar presents
E(Yj − Yj 0 |Qj,j 0 = 1). The estimates for the full population are reported in the Web Appendix. AMTE presents the
average (Yj − Yj 0 ) for those who reach that decision node and are indifferent between j and j 0 . To be exact, the node-

Notes: Each panel in this figure studies the average effects of graduating with a four-year college degree on the outcome of in-
terest. The effect is defined as the differences in the outcome between those with a four-year college degree and those with some
college. For each panel, let Ysomecoll and Y4−yr degree denotes the outcomes associated with attaining some college and gradu-
ating with a four-year degree, respectively. For each outcome, the first figure (top) presents E(Y4−yr degree −Ysomecoll |dC , dSE )
where dC and dSE denote the cognitive and socioemotional deciles computed from the marginal distributions of cognitive
and socioemotional endowments. The second figure (bottom left) presents E(Y4−yr degree − Ysomecoll |dC ) so that the
socioemotional factor is integrated out. The bars in this figure display, for a given decile of cognitive endowment, the
fraction of individuals visiting the node leading to the educational decision involving graduating from a four-year college.
The last figure (bottom right) presents E(Y4−yr degree − Ysomecoll |dSE ) and the fraction of individuals visiting the node
leading to the educational decision involving graduating from a four-year college for a given decile of socioemotional endowment.

          One benefit of schooling is access to further schooling.53 Specifically, the choice to

       graduate from high school and the choice to enroll in college open up the doors for

       continued education. The continuation value of an educational choice is the probability

       of additional education times the benefits of that additional education. For high-ability

       individuals, the benefits of college may be large, and the probability of attending may

       be close to 1. For such individuals, the continuation value may constitute the bulk

       of the return to graduating from high school. For others, the probability or benefit

       of college may be much lower. Figure 10 reports the continuation value ratio—the

       proportion of the ATE accounted for by the continuation value. The continuation value

       ratio is reported both for high school graduation and enrollment in college. In Figure 10,

       the ratios are shown for high ability and low ability individuals, as well as the AMTE.

       The ratio is only shown if the ATE is statistically significant.54

    The continuation value ratio is only relevant for treatment effects that are significant. The ratio for
imprecisely estimated numbers often have large, but insignificant values.

Notes: Estimates which have insignificant ATEs are not shown. (Taking ratios can lead to very large standard errors which
compress the figures.) The ratio of average continuation value to average treatment effect is calculated by dividing the average
continuation value by the average total treatment effect for those that reach the decision.. Continuation Value is the additional
benefit gained through the option of pursuing additional education and is defined in Section 2. High-ability individuals are
those in the top 50% of the distributions of both cognitive and socioemotional endowments. Low-ability individuals are those
in the bottom 50% of the distributions of both cognitive and socioemotional endowments. The error bars and significance levels
for the estimated ATE are calculated using 200 bootstrap samples. Error bars show one standard deviation and correspond
to the 15.87th and 84.13th percentiles of the bootstrapped estimates, allowing for asymmetry. Significance at the 5% and 1%
level are shown by hollow and black circles on the plots respectively.


                       In general, the differences in outcomes between schooling levels are much larger

                    when we do not control for observed variables and latent endowments. In most cases,

                    the gains from education is increasing (in absolute value) with the schooling level, even

                    after controlling for endowments. However, GED certification does not have significant

                    causal effects on any of the outcomes.




                                                                                  43
Treatment Effects on Wages When comparing final education levels, the treat-
ment effect for log wages is statistically significant for graduating from high school,

some college achievement, and attaining a four-year college degree. The GED confers

no benefits. About half of the observed difference in wages at age 30 are explained by

observed variables and latent endowments.

   When looking at the node-specific treatment effects on wages, higher educational

attainment results in gains in wages, though low-endowment individuals gain very little

from getting a four-year college degree. Figure 9 shows that it is individuals with

high cognitive ability that capture most of the gains from a four-year degree. The

GED confers no benefit except for individuals with large cognitive and socioemotional

endowments – a group of individuals who rarely drop out of high school.

   For log wages, the continuation value accounts for over half of the ATE from

graduating from high school. While the total effect is relatively constant across

treatment effects and endowment levels, low-endowment individuals benefit through the

direct effect of being a high school graduate (see Figure 10). For the decision to enroll

in college, less than half of the AMTE and ATE are continuation value, though more

than half of the benefit for high-endowment individuals comes from continuation value.


Treatment Effects on Smoking Aside from the GED, education causally reduces
smoking, even after accounting for unobserved heterogeneity. The latent endowments

and observables account for one-third of the observed effect of education. Looking

at the node-specific treatment effects, each educational decision also causally reduces

smoking and it has an only weak dependence on latent endowments (see Figure 8 and

Figure 9).

   More than half of the average treatment effect of graduating high school and enrolling

in college is derived from the continuation value for high-endowment individuals, while

almost all of the treatment effect is coming from the direct effect for low-endowment

individuals.




                                           44
Treatment Effects on Self-Esteem When considering treatment effects by final
schooling level, there is no statistically significant causal effect of schooling on self

esteem. The estimates are more precise when looking at the dynamic treatment effects

from specific educational decisions. Graduating from High School or obtaining the GED

does not increase self-esteem, while enrolling in college and graduating with a four-year

degree does. Interestingly, the gain is heterogeneous by ability, with the low-ability

individuals getting larger gains. Figure 9 shows it is individuals with low socioemotional

ability that capture most of the gains from a four-year degree. The improvements in

self-esteem and self-mastery from enrolling in college are explained almost completely by

the direct effect of having attended college, though a small and statistically significant

portion of the gains are from continuation value for the low-endowment ATE and the

AMTE (see Figure 10).


Treatment Effects on Physical Health The estimated effects by final schooling
level are imprecise. There is no statistically significant effect from final education level

on physical health. On the other hand, the estimated causal effects of most educational

decisions are statistically significant. Graduating from High School and graduating

with a four-year degree both show statistically significant improvements in physical

health. There is no evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects by ability. Finally, the

continuation value accounts for a portion of the average physical health benefits from

graduating from high school and enrolling in college.

While estimating the returns to particular educational choices is informative, it does

not correspond to any particular policy. The PRTE allows us to identify who would

be induced to change educational choices under a particular policy change, and how

these individuals would benefit on average. As an example, we simulate the response

to a policy intervention that provides a one standard deviation subsidy towards early

college tuition (approximately $7, 500 dollars per year). Column 1 of Table 5 provides


                                            45
        the average treatment effect for those that are induced to change education levels by

        the tuition subsidy. Since tuition at age 17 only enters the choice to enroll in college,

        the subsidy will only induce high school graduates to change their college enrollment

        decisions. Those induced to enroll may then go on to choose to graduate with a four

        year degree.55 Columns 2 and 3 of Table 5 decompose the PRTE into the average gains

        for those induced to enroll that then go on to earn 4 year degrees and the average gains

        for those that do not. Except for self-esteem, the PRTE is larger for those that then go

        on to earn 4 year degrees.

            Figure 11 shows which individuals are induced to enroll in college within the deciles

        of the distribution of 1,3 = θα1,3 − ν1,3 , conditional on Q1,3 = 1, the unobserved compo-

        nents of heterogeneity acted upon by the agent but unobserved by the econometrician.

        The policy induces some individuals in every decile to switch, but places more weight

        on those in the middle deciles of the distribution. The figure further decomposes the

        effect of those induced to switch into the effect for those who go on to graduate with

        four year degrees and the effect for those who do not. We see that those induced to

        switch in the top deciles are more likely to go on to graduate.56

Notes: Table shows the policy relevant treatment effect (PRTE) of reducing early tuition by a standard deviation (approx.
$7,500). The PRTE is the average treatment effect of those induced to change educational choices as a result of the policy:

                E(Y p − Y p |X = X, θ = θ), dFX,θ (X, θ|S(p) 6= S(p0 )}. Column 1 shows the overall PRTE. Column 2 shows

the PRTE for those induced to enroll by the policy who then go on to complete 4-year college degrees. Column 3 shows the
PRTE for individuals induced to enroll but who do not complete 4-year degrees.




   55
     Models were estimated that include tuition as a determinant of the high school graduation decision.
However, estimated effects of tuition on high school graduation are small and statistically insignificant.
  56
     Note that there is little evidence of forward-looking behavior in terms of tuition.

Notes: The figure plots the proportion of individuals induced to switch from the policy that lay in each decile of 1,3 , where
1,3 = θα1,3 − ν1,3 . 1,3 is the unobserved component of the educational choice model. The deciles are conditional on Q1,3 = 1,
so 1,3 for individuals who reach the college enrollment decision. The bars are further decomposed into those that are induced
to switch that then go on to earn 4-year degrees and those that are induced to switch but do not go on to graduate.




             The $7,500 subsidy induces 13% of high school graduates who previously did not

         enroll to enroll in college. Of those induced to enroll, more than a third go on to

         graduate with a 4 year degree. For outcomes such as smoking, the benefits are larger

         for those who graduate with a 4-year degree, while for outcomes such as self-esteem,

         those that enroll, but choose not to earn 4 year degrees have larger benefits.

             Using the estimated benefits, we can calculate if the policy is cost effective. As a

         limitation of our model, we can only estimate the monetary costs and cannot estimate

         psychic costs. We can determine if the monetary gains in the present value of wages at

         age 18 is greater than the $7,500 subsidy. Given a PRTE of 0.13 for log present value

         of wage income, the average gains for those induced to enroll was $11,275.57 If the

         subsidy was given for the first two years of college, then the policy is not cost-efficient

         on average. If the subsidy must also be offered to those already enrolled, then monetary

         costs greatly outweigh the estimated earnings benefits, never mind any psychic costs.
   57
        Wages are divided by $10,000 prior to taking logs

                                                                 47
   While the intervention does not pay for itself through increased income, there are

benefits for several other life-outcomes such as reduced smoking, improved self-esteem,

and improved physical health.



6.4     The Channels of Influence of Cognitive and Socioe-

motional Skills

The traditional literature focuses on cognitive ability as a major determinant of schooling

and the outcomes of schooling. Much less is known about the importance of socioe-

motional factors, although a growing literature establishes their predictive power. We

present new evidence on the channels through which cognitive and socioemotional skills

operate. As shown in Figure 5 and Table 4, both factors are important in explaining

schooling choices at all decision nodes with the exception of socioemotional skills in

explaining the decision of dropouts to obtain GEDs.

   Controlling for selection into schooling levels, we can determine if, after fixing

schooling, there are additional effects of cognitive and socioemotional skills on outcomes.

Is the main effect of these skills through educational attainment or are there additional

effects of the traits on outcomes beyond their effects on schooling?

   The models for outcomes are estimated twice: (a) excluding any effect of the latent

factors on outcomes except through their effects on schooling and (b) allowing the

latent factors to have additional effects beyond their effects on schooling. A comparison

of the estimates is informative.

   Table 6 reports, for each set of outcomes, tests of whether the loadings on the latent

factors at all schooling levels (HS Dropout—Coll. Graduate) are all zero (column a)

or whether they are equal to their levels in the unconditional model (column b). For

most outcomes, cognition has a statistically significant effect beyond its educational

attainment. For physical health and self-esteem, the effects of socioemotional skills

are not precisely estimated. We cannot reject the hypothesis that across all s, the

socioemotional loadings are jointly equal to 0. We also cannot reject that they are the

      same as the loadings for the factors on outcomes that do not control for s. However, in

      the case of smoking, it appears that the socioemotional trait has a statistically significant

      effect beyond its effect on schooling. Finally, in terms of wages, socioemotional trait

      operates primarily through its affect on schooling.

7     Summary and Conclusions
This paper formulates and estimates a sequential model of educational choices and

their consequences for wages, health and healthy behaviors, allowing for heterogeneity

among agents in both observed and unobserved characteristics. We estimate the

causal impact of education on health and labor market outcomes when responses to

treatment vary among observationally identical persons who select into schooling levels

on the basis of their idiosyncratic responses. We proxy the unobservables producing

dependence between choices and outcomes using a variety of measurements. We adjust

for the measurement error arising from using proxies. We use multiple sources of

identification to secure our estimates. Each educational choice has exclusion restrictions

that affect choices but not the outcomes produced from the choice. These can be

used as instruments to identify the model. They allow us to control for unobservables

that generate dependence between choices and outcomes that are not proxied by our

measurements.

    Unlike most of the literature on the treatment effects of education, we analyze a

model with multiple schooling choices that recognizes the fundamentally nonlinear effect

of schooling on a variety of outcomes. Our paper defines and estimates a variety of novel

treatment effects, including treatment effects that account for the continuation values

associated with future educational choices which we find to be empirically important

for most transitions.

    Our empirical results show that there is strong sorting into schooling levels on

both cognitive and socioemotional endowments. Overall, we find that wages and the

health and healthy behaviors of persons is enhanced by high school graduation, college

enrollment, and graduation from a 4-year college. We find that the causal effects

of schooling differ by ability level. For example, when considering the benefits of a

four-year degree, only high-ability individuals gain higher wages, while only low-ability

individuals gain higher self-esteem. In general, observed differences by educational

attainment diminish when we control for observables and latent abilities.

    The model estimated in this paper is a halfway house between the treatment effect

                                           50
       literature and the structural literature on dynamic discrete choice. By modeling the

       latent variable structure, we improve on LATE by identifying the groups affected by

       variations in instruments and policies. We find strong evidence that agents select into

       schooling based on their idiosyncratic responses to schooling. Our model requires no

       assumptions about how agents form expectations or what they seek to maximize that

       are routinely invoked in the structural economics literature.58

          By estimating a sequential model of schooling in a single framework, we are able

       analyze the ex post returns to education for people at different margins of choice and

       to analyze a variety of interesting policy counterfactuals. We are able to characterize

       who benefits from education across a variety of market and nonmarket outcomes. We

       decompose these benefits into direct components and indirect components arising from

       continuation values that we estimate to be substantial. Standard estimates of the

       benefits of education based on direct components underestimate the full benefit of

       education.




  58
    This generality comes at a cost. Agent information sets are not precisely specified or identified and we
cannot estimate psychic costs or net returns.
