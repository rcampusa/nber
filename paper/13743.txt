The Effect of Hours of Work on Social Interaction

                                              ABSTRACT

Over time, increases in hours of work per capita have created the intuitively plausible notion that there
is less time available to pursue social interactions. The specific question addressed in this paper is
the effect of hours of work on social interaction. This is a difficult empirical question since omitted
factors could increase both hours of work and social interaction. The approach taken in this paper
utilizes an exogenous decline in hours of work in France due to a new employment law. The results
clearly show that the employment law reduced hours of work but there is no evidence that the extra
hours went to increased social interactions. Although hours of work are not an important determinant
of social interaction, human capital is found to be important. The effect of human capital, as measured
by education and age, is positive for membership groups but negative for visiting relatives and friends.
Also, contrary to expectations, there are no important differences in the determinants of social interaction
by gender, marital status or parent status. Finally, a comparison between France and the US show
that the response to human capital and other variables are much the same in both nations.

1. Introduction

        Certain types of social interaction have been declining over the past 30 years. This decline has

attracted interest in both the academic literature and in the popular press. Robert Putnam (1993, 1995) was

one of the first to write about the decline of social interaction in the US. Putnam (2000) provides

considerable documentation for the decline of certain groups such as Masons and League of Women

Voters. In addition, a recent study by McPherson, Smith-Lovin and Brashears (2006) documents the decline

in the number of close friends over the past 20 years. Highlights from this study were reported in articles in

the Washington Post (Mallaby, 2006), the Los Angeles Times (Rodriquez, 2006) and the New York Times

(Hulbert, 2006).

        Social interaction has appeared in the economics literature primarily as a proxy for social capital in

empirical studies. Social capital is generally defined as something similar to friendship or trust and is a stock

concept. Social interaction is part of the process which creates social capital. This paper is focused on

social interaction rather than social capital. In this paper, social interaction is defined to include engagement

in either organized membership groups such as a sports club or in visiting with friends or family. Social

interaction will exclude engagement between individuals living in the same household and will be limited to

non-commercial activities. It does include interaction with work associates outside of the workplace.

        In prior studies economists have modeled social interaction as either investment or as consumption.

This choice has only a minimal effect on the empirical specification since many of the included variables are

the same. However, the choice does affect the interpretation of these variables. In an investment model,

the independent variables are interpreted as measures of returns on investment and the ability to capture

these returns. In a consumption model, these variables are interpreted as measures of price and income.

Investment may have been a more important motive for social interaction in the past. The need to maintain

social networks as an investment has declined as markets have become more efficient and as incomes

have increased. Specifically, markets for various types of personal services, other employment and

insurance have become larger and more efficient than they were in the past. Increased income also allows

for increased purchases of services and insurance. The increased efficiency in the labor market has
improved an individual’s chance of finding employment without relying on friends or relatives. These

changes have reduced the investment motives for social interaction.

        Understanding the determinants of social interaction is important regardless of whether it is

consumption or investment. This paper assumes that social interaction is consumption and is the

consequence of utility maximizing behavior by individuals who face economic constraints. Individuals derive

utility directly from social interaction and may also derive utility through altruistic channels which involve

social interaction. Although it is assumed that social interaction is a utility maximizing behavior, it can result

in externalities in the form of increased social capital for individuals and for the community. Grier and

Tullock (1989) and La Porta et al. (1997) have argued that social capital has positive effects on the

efficiency of economic institutions and is a benefit to society. Also, Kawachi et al. (1996) and Cohen (2004)

argue that social interaction has positive effects on both the mental and physical health of individuals.

        As noted above, some forms of social interactions have been declining. This may be the result of

gradual but significant changes in the constraints faced by individuals in choosing their optimal social

interactions. This paper empirically investigates which of these constraints are important determinants of

social interaction. The specific question investigated in this paper is whether changes in hours of work have

affected the level of social interaction. The increase in female labor force participation has increased hours

of work per capita which may have had an affect on social interaction. The intuitive argument is that longer

hours of work will reduce time available for other activities and thus reduce social interaction. However,

Putnam (1996) argues that individuals who work long hours are more inclined to civic engagement. This

could occur if there were an important unobserved third factor such as ambition. An individual who is

ambitious may choose to work long hours, to participate in civic organizations and meet with friends and

neighbors more than a less ambitious individual. Hours of work and social interaction would then both be a

function of an unobserved third factor which would bias the regression estimates. Costa and Kahn (2003)

find that increased female labor force participation has a negative effect on membership in community

groups. However, Rupasingha, Goetz and Freshwater (2006) find that female labor force participation has a

positive effect on membership in community groups. Putnam uses data from the General Social Surveys to




                                                         2
show that employed individuals belong to more civic groups than those outside of the labor force. These

inconsistent results suggest that unobserved factors might be causal on both hours of work and social

interaction, i.e., third factor endogeneity.

        To estimate the effect of hours of work on social interaction requires that this third factor endogeneity

be controlled. One method for controlling third factor endogeneity is to examine social interaction before

and after an exogenous shock in hours of work. Unfortunately, changes in hours of work are typically

endogenous, such as in the case of job changers. However, a recent change in the law governing hours of

work in France represents such an exogenous shock. A French law enacted in 1998 reduced the legal

number of hours worked per week from 39 to 35. The main objective of this law was to create employment

by sharing the available work. If it can be convincingly shown that this law reduced hours of work and

increased social interaction, it would be evidence that hours of work affect social interaction.



2. Prior Studies

         The prior studies of interest include studies of legal changes in the maximum hours of work per

week on the actual hours of work per week and on non-work time activities in France. Also of interest are

studies which include the effect of labor force participation on social interaction outcomes. No prior study

has considered third factor endogeneity of hours of work and social interaction.

        The French studies include Crepon and Kramarz (2002) who investigate the effects of the 1982

reduction of weekly working hours in France. In 1981 the minimum wage was increased by 5 percent and

the workweek was then reduced from 40 to 39 hours. At the same time, stable monthly earnings for

minimum-wage earners were mandated. They find that workers employed 40 hours and above in March

1981 were more likely to lose their jobs between 1981 and 1982 than workers employed 36 to 39 hours in

same month. They estimate the impact of this one-hour reduction was a reduction in employment.

Minimum-wage workers were most affected by the changes.

        Fagnani and Letablier (2004) study the effect of the 1998, 35 hour work law on family balance. They

examine the effect of the law on daily life for parents with a young child under six years old. Six out of ten




                                                        3
respondents reported a positive impact of the work law on their family time. However, the results depended

on whether the respondent worked standard hours or an irregular schedule. It is also correlated to the

negotiation process in the workplace. The work law was perceived as negative by those who work an

irregular schedule.

        Estrade, Méda and Orain (2001) analyzed a survey which was conducted by the French Ministry of

Work and Social Affairs at the end of 2000, and included 1,618 full-time employees working in large

companies that had implemented the law for at least one year. The results from the survey indicate that 25

percent of the respondents took part more often in membership activities after the law was put into effect.

Also, 16.6 percent of the respondents reported an increase in visiting with friends or neighbors.

        Prouteau and Wolff (2002) investigate the factors associated with memberships in social groups in

France using the Time Use Surveys. They show that association activities are higher for those who work

part time or who benefit from flexible working hours. Employees working in the public sector are more likely

to take part in membership groups than employees working in the private sector. Furthermore, they

highlight that people having more membership activities are also likely to have more social contacts.

        Estevao and Sa (2006) used data from the French Survey of Employment and used the timing

difference by firm size to set up a difference in difference specification. They find that the law increased

dual-job holdings and that some workers were replaced by cheaper, unemployed individuals as relative

hourly wages increased in large firms. Employment of persons directly affected by the law declined,

although the net effect on aggregate employment was not significant. They showed that average hours per

worker in firms of more that 20 fell from 39.5 in 1998 to 37.5 in 2002. In small firms, average hours per

worker fell from 40.8 in 1998 to 38.5 in 2002. They find no significant shift from large firms to small firms

due to the law.

        The US studies include Costa and Kahn (2003) who examined the effects of demographics and

heterogeneity on memberships and visiting. The data they use are from the Current Population Survey, the

General Social Survey (GSS) and the Americans’ Use of Time Survey. They conclude that the increase in




                                                       4
wage inequality has contributed to the decline in social interaction. They also examine the effect of female

labor force participation on social interaction and conclude that it has a negative effect.

        Rupasingha, Goetz and Freshwater (2006) study social capital in the US. They assume that social

capital provides utility and uses a model of household production. The model is implemented with county

level data for two time periods. Ethnic homogeneity, income inequality, attachment to place, education, age,

and female labor force participation are included as regressors. Increases in education increased

memberships. They find that female labor force participation is positively related to membership in

community groups. This suggests that as hours per capita increase for women, their membership in

community groups increases.

        Saffer (forthcoming) uses a model of household production to derive the demand for social

interaction. The model shows that the demand for social interaction is a function of wages, employment,

education and income and demographic variables. The theory is tested with data from the General Social

Survey from 1974 to 2004. The results show that social interaction can be explained as the consequence of

utility maximizing behavior by individuals. Increases in education generally increase memberships but

reduce visiting with relatives and friends. Increases in employment decreased visiting with friends and

relatives but had a positive effect on memberships.



3. The Empirical Model

        The theory of household production developed by Becker (1965) provides the basis of the empirical

model of social interaction. This theory emphasizes the role of time in consumption and that time is a limited

resource. Becker redefined the goods that consumers derive utility from, called Z goods, as goods that are

produced by consumers with inputs of their own time and with inputs of market goods. These Z goods enter

the utility function, which is otherwise a conventional utility function.

        Is social interaction a Z good? Arrow (2000) argues that the psychological reward from friendship is

an important motivation for social interaction. That is, social interaction provides utility, which makes it a

good. Social interaction is produced with time and market goods by households or individuals. Social




                                                          5
activities take time and depending on the activity, market goods, such as membership fees or providing

refreshments, are also needed. Social interaction thus fulfills the definition of a Z good since it yields utility

and is produced by individuals with time and market goods. A straightforward application of Becker’s Z good

production theory can be used to derive a demand for social interaction (SI).

        The theory assumes an SI production function which is optimized with respect to a cost constraint.

The price of SI, is Πsi and Zo is a vector of other Z goods which includes both time intensive and market

goods intensive Z goods. Πo is a vector of prices for these other Z goods. Which goods get produced, and

in what quantities, is determined by utility maximization. Given the consumer’s utility map, the prices of the

Z goods and full income, (F) the utility maximizing levels of all Z goods are determined. The theoretical

demand for SI can be derived from this optimization problem:

(1) SI = SI( Πsi, Πo, F, Taste).

The demand for SI, like any other good, depends on its own price, the price of other Z goods (Zo), full

income and taste. As the own price of SI rises the quantity demanded of SI will fall. As the price of the

other good, Πo, rises the demand for SI will rise or fall depending on whether SI is a complement or

substitute for Zo. As full income rises, the demand for SI will rise or fall depending on whether SI is a normal

or inferior good.

        The empirical demand function can be specified by replacing the prices in equation (1) with their

empirical proxies and with a set of additional control variables. The prices of the Z goods are equal to the

price of time over the marginal product of time which also equals the price of market goods over the

marginal product of market goods. The wage is usually assumed to be the proxy for the price of time in Z

production. However, since the focus of this paper is on hours of work, hours of work are used in place of

the wage as a proxy for the price of time. This replacement is justified by assuming that the price of non-

working time is a function of the supply and demand for this type of time. As hours of work increase, the

supply of non-working hours decreases which will increase the price of time. Holding demand for non-work

time fixed, as hours of work increase, the price of time increases. Zero hours of work is interpreted as a low

opportunity cost of time. The marginal product of time and the marginal product of market goods are usually




                                                         6
assumed to be positive functions of education. The prices of market goods are assumed to be a function of

regional fixed effects variables.

          The empirical SI function also includes other control variables. Variables for children and marriage

can are also included. In the spirit of Becker’s theory of time allocation, children and marriage can be

viewed as Z goods. Children or child development requires time and market goods and children can be

assumed to directly yield utility. Similarly, marriage requires time specifically spent on the marriage

relationship and market goods that might not be otherwise purchased and can be assumed to yield utility.

The level of a substitute or complementary Z good can act as a proxy for its price. Children and marriage

may be substitutes with social interaction or complementary with social interaction. For example,

substitution will occur if parents do not see friends as much due to their child responsibilities. However,

children may be complementary with some social activities so that an increase in children at home could

have a positive effect on social interaction. An increase in the level of a substitute will have a negative effect

on the dependent variable, and an increase in the level of a complement will have a positive effect on the

dependent variable. The empirical demand function is:

(2) SI = SI(hours of work, education, family income, children, married, gender, age, community size,

occupation fixed effects, industry fixed effects and region fixed effects variables).

        A problem with this empirical specification is that the proxies for the price of Z goods are not specific

to any particular Z good. Thus, an increase in hours of work raises the price of time for all Z production

which is equal to an increase in the price of all Z goods. However, the increase in the price of each Z good

is proportional to its time intensiveness. An increase in the price of time will increase the price of SI relative

to the price of less time intensive goods.1 If SI is assumed to be relatively time intensive then a decrease in

hours of work should have a positive effect on social interaction.

        A similar problem exists for education as an empirical proxy for the price of SI. The effect of

education is more complex since an increase in education increases both the marginal product of time and

the marginal product of market goods in all Z production. Social interactions are assumed to be relatively

 A change in the price of time creates a substitution effect and a potential scale effect. The input mix in Z production
changes but the scale of production is dependent on the utility maximizing level of Z.


                                                            7
time intensive goods but education can increase the marginal product of time by either more or less than it

increases the marginal product of market goods.2 If education increases the marginal product of time more

than the marginal product of market goods then an increase in education would lower the price of SI relative

to the price of less time intensive Z goods. In this case education has a positive effect on the quantity

demanded of SI. However, if education increases the marginal product of market goods more than the

marginal product of time, then an increase in education would increase the price of SI relative to the price of

less time intensive Z goods. In this case education has a negative effect on quantity demanded of SI.



4. The Data

        The data are from the Continuous Survey of Household Living Conditions (EPCV).3 The EPCV data

were collected every year since 1996 by INSEE and is a national random sample of 8,000 addresses.4 Only

one individual in each household is interviewed resulting in approximately 6,000 interviews per year. Data

on hours of work were not collected until 1998. Over 48,000 observations are currently available in the

EPCV. The sample used in this paper is restricted to individuals who are 18 to 65 years old.

        The EPCV contains both social interaction variables and economic variables and is a national

random sample. There are 16 empirical dependent variables measuring social interaction. There are eight

dependent variables measuring membership in organizations. The memberships are: 1) Humanitarian (i.e.

service to community), 2) Sport Groups, 3) Union Groups, 4) Parents Groups, 5) Literary, Art, Discussion or

Study Groups, 6) Church Groups, 7) Elderly Associations, 8)Total Number of Memberships. There are also

eight visiting variables measuring the number of times per year the individual visits with: 9) Mother, 10)

Father, 11) Children, 12) Grandchildren, 13) Other relatives, 14) Neighborhood friend, 15) Other friends

(excluding work colleagues) 16) Work Colleagues. The visiting variables are all continuous except for

  Education could also increase the marginal products of time and market goods by the same amount. In this case, the
effect of the change in education depends on the magnitude of the effect on marginal product relative to other Z goods.

visiting colleagues which is continuous. Participation in Sports Groups is likely to be a good proxy for an

active lifestyle and thus also a measure of health.

        The price of SI is a function of the opportunity cost of time, the price of the market goods used in

production of SI, the marginal product of time and the marginal product of the market goods. Hours of work

are an empirical measure of the opportunity cost of time. If an individual does not work, hours of work are

zero which is a valid value and a measure of the opportunity cost of time. The marginal products of time and

market goods are assumed to be a positive function of education. In France, the education system provides

both a professional track and a technical track which are not the same. Therefore, the education is coded as

four dichotomous variables. The real price of market goods is assumed to be controlled by cross sectional

and time fixed effects variables.

        Full income is labor income plus other income. Other income can be spouse’s income or income

from such sources as government transfers and earnings from assets. With the wage held constant in the

regression, full income can increase as spouse’s income or as non-labor income increases. Empirically,

total real family income is used to measure full income. The monetary variables in the French data are

reported in Euros. There is no a priori expectation for the effect of income on SI. Some forms of SI could be

normal while others could inferior.

        Additional independent variables include a child and a marriage variable. The child variable is

defined as equal to one for households that have children under 18 living at home. Marriage is a

dichotomous variable equal to one for individuals who are married or living as a married couple.

        There are several additional variables which are included in the regressions. There are data to

define a dichotomous variable for male and a continuous variable for age. The data sets contain information

to construct a dichotomous variable equal to one if an individual lives in a rural area. Dichotomous variables

can also be defined if an individual is a civil servant or self-employed. These variables are needed since

these categories of labor were exempted from the employment laws. Race is not included in the French

data. The data contain information on place of birth which is used to construct a dichotomous born in

France variable. There are also three community sizes dichotomous variables. These are defined for




                                                       9
communities of less than 20,000 people, 20,000 to 100,000 people and over 100,000 people. There is also

a dichotomous variable for those who live in the Paris region. Finally, there are 12 industry, eight

occupational and 22 geographic region fixed effects variables defined. The sample means are shown in

table 1.



5. The Empirical Strategy

           The empirical strategy relies on the French employment law of 1998 which required a reduction in

hours of work for full time workers from 39 to 35 hours with no decline in income. The employment law

consisted of three parts: 1) the first part covered firms with more than 20 employees, 2) the second part

covered firms with 20 or less employees and 3) the third part covered civil servants. Firms of more than 20

employees were required to conform to the law by January 2000 and firms with 20 or less employees were

required to conform by January 2002.5 The law which covered civil servants also took effect in January

2002. Civil servants are therefore included with workers in firms of 20 or less employees since both laws

took effect on the same date. These new laws allowed individuals to work more than 35 hours if they

received overtime pay and allowed averaging hours per week over a year. The self-employed were

exempted.

           The data in table 2 part A show the percent of individuals in five categories of hours worked per

week. These data include only individuals who have positive hours of work. The data show that after the

deadline dates there was a significant decline in the number of workers working 39 hours and a significant

increase in the number of workers working 35 hours. The change occurs in large firms in 2000 and in small

firms and civil service in 2002 which corresponds to the legal deadlines for compliance. The number of

workers in the other categories is relatively constant.

           The employment laws are modeled as a difference-in-difference specification. Two treatment

groups can be defined based on the deadline for compliance by large firms and for compliance by small

firms and civil service. Workers who are affected by the law (36 or more hours per week) are considered in



5
    The law included incentives for companies that reduced hours of work before the mandatory enforcement date.


                                                           10
one of two treatment groups. Those who are unaffected by the law are considered the control group. The

first treatment group are workers in large firms. From 2000 to 2001, workers in small firms are part of the

control group for workers in large firms. Also, workers who work 35 or less hours, who are civil servants or

self-employed are part of this control group. The second treatment group are workers in small firms and civil

servants. From 2002 to 2003, workers in large firms are part of the control group for workers in small firms.

Again, workers who work 35 or less hours or who are self-employed are part of the control group. For both

groups, the first difference is the change due to the employment law and the second difference is between

individuals who were affected by the law and those who were not affected by the law.

        The first empirical question is whether these laws actually reduced hours of work. To address this

question a difference-in-difference model with hours of work as the dependent variable is estimated. This

equation is simply a reduced form of the labor supply and demand functions. The second empirical question

is whether the laws increased social interaction.

Let,
L= individual works in a firm of more than 20 employees
S = individual works in a firm of 20 or less employees or is a civil servant
X = independent variables from equation (2).

(3) HW = α1L + α2post1999 + α3L*post1999 + α4S + α5post2001 + α6S*post2001 + α7X
(4) SI = β1L + β2post1999 + β3L*post1999 + β4S + β5post2001 + β6S*post2001 + β7X

Equation (3) measures the effect of the employment laws on hours of work. Equation (4) measures the

effect of these laws on social interaction. If the laws reduced hours of work, those individual who are directly

affected may increase their social interaction. The partial effect of the law in the post period on hours of

work is α3 for large firms and α6 for small firms. The partial effect of the law in the post period on social

interaction is β3 for large firms and β6 for small firms.

        There are several concerns with this DD model. It should be noted that equation (4) simply

measures the effect of being in a particular type of employment after the implementation of the work law.

Other events might have occurred at the same time that the law was implemented. However, the important

issue in this paper is whether there is any change in hours of work following the implementation of the laws

rather than assignment of causality. Another concern is that workers are free to switch between full time




                                                            11
and part time work and choose to take a second job or quit a second job. These phenomena might impact

the effect of the employment laws on hours of work. The data in table 2A suggest that the laws did reduce

hours of work. Another concern is with individuals in large firms who might switch to small firms in order to

avoid the effect of the employment law. Since the law requires small firms to comply within two years, it

seems doubtful that anyone would switch for a two year only advantage. Estevao and Sa (2006) found no

significant shift from large firms to small firms due to the law. Also, workers in large firms are not likely to

switch into the civil service since civil service employment requires passing a competitive exam and again

the advantage would only last for two years.

        Finally, there is a concern with a potential spill-over effect of the law into the control group. Assume

that individuals in the treatment group interact with individuals in the control group. Individuals in the control

group do not have a reduction in hours of work and do not have additional time to interact with the

individuals in the treatment group. In this scenario, the measured effect of the treatment would then be

biased towards zero. This potential problem is more likely to occur in visiting types of social interaction

rather than membership types of social interaction. One way to check for this problem is to examine the

time data for social interaction by treatment groups and the control groups. This data is presented in table

2B and 2C. These data show that the compliance dates for the employment laws had no effect on the

treatment group and no effect on the control group. Only four social interaction variables are presented

since none of the other categories of social interaction showed any discernable effect of the employment

laws. A spill-over effect of the laws to the control groups thus appears unlikely.



6. Results

        Table 3 presents the regression results for the 17 dependent variables. All equations include the

same set of independent variables and both probit and OLS are used for estimation depending on whether

the dependent variable is dichotomous or continuous. Marginal effects are reported for the probit

specifications. All specifications include seven occupation, 11 industry and 21 region dichotomous variables

which are not reported in the table. The first dependent variable is a continuous measure of hours of work




                                                        12
per week. The next seven dependent variables are dichotomous measures of membership in organizations.

The next dependent variable is a continuous measure of the total number of memberships for an individual.

Finally, the last eight dependent variables are continuous measures of visits per year to relatives and

friends.

           The first regression shows the effect of the employment laws on hours of work. For those in large

firms, after 1999, there was a reduction of approximately two hours per week. For those in small firms, after

2001, there was a reduction of approximately 1.6 hours per week. The regression also shows that higher

income, being male, being older and being French born all increase hours of work. The regression also

shows that being married and having children reduces hours of work.

           Although the law is found to decrease hours of work there is little evidence that these hours go to

increased social interaction. The results in table 3 show that for individuals in large firms there is no

increase in social interaction. For individuals in small firms there is an increase only in church membership

and in visiting neighbors. The extra hours resulting from the law are going to activities other than social

interaction which suggests that hours of work are not an important causal factor on social interaction. 6

           The results in table 3 also show the effect of education on social interaction. Education is a proxy for

the price of Z goods. When education increase it lowers the price of Z goods in proportion to the time

intensiveness of the good. Education is positive and significant for all membership activities excluding

elderly groups. Education is negative and significant for most visiting activities. The positive effect of

education on memberships and negative effect on visiting can be explained with the marginal products.

Assume that all social interaction is time intensive. The relative magnitudes of the effect of education on the

marginal products of time and market goods determine whether the coefficient is positive or negative. For

time intensive goods, if education has a greater effect on the marginal product of time, the coefficient will be

positive. If education has a greater effect on the marginal product of market goods then the coefficient will

be negative. The results thus suggest that education has a greater effect on the marginal product of time in

membership activities and a smaller effect on marginal product of time in visiting activities. This may be due


6
 Since the partial effect of the law on social interaction is insignificant, the effect of hours of work on social interaction is
zero.


                                                               13
to the fact that membership activities are more goal oriented than visiting activities. More educated

individuals can apply their greater human capital to assist a membership organization in meeting their goals.

Education lowers the relative price of membership activities but raises the relative price of visiting activities.

           Family income is included as a proxy for income and is positive for memberships and negative for

visiting. This indicates that memberships are normal Z goods while visiting tends to be inferior. The

exceptions are grandchildren and other relatives which is insignificant and colleagues which is positive.

           The regressions in table 3 also show the effects of demographics. Being married tends to reduce all

social interactions which suggests that a spouse is a substitute for other social interactions. Children have a

positive effect of membership in school and church groups. These activities are complementary with

children. The other social interactions had mixed results. Age like education increases memberships and

reduces visiting. Age may be acting as an indicator of human capital as is education. Males tend to have

less of all social interactions. The urban variables show that individuals in larger communities and in Paris

tend to be somewhat less social. The French born variable shows mixed effects.7

           Additional regressions were estimated to further explore the effects of gender, marriage and

children. These regressions allow all of the included independent variables to have different coefficients.

The sociological literature argues that gender and marriage are important determinants of social interaction.

McPherson and Smith-Lovin (1986) have noted that voluntary groups tend to be segregated by gender.

Women are more likely to belong to small groups organized around social or religious activities. Men are

more likely to belong to larger work-oriented groups. They have also argued that women keep kinship

contacts alive through regular contact. Men are more likely to interact with more heterogeneous groups with

the nuclear family as the primary basis of intimacy and support. Gerstel (1988) argues that married women

maintain the relationships with their own and their husband’s kin far more than married men do. Wives also

maintain contact with friends and neighbors more than husbands. This literature suggests that separate

estimation for males and females will reveal some significant differences.




7
    Another set of regressions estimated with a subsample limited to employed individuals produced very similar results.


                                                             14
        The additional regressions were based on subsamples of data for males, for females, for married, for

non-married, for individuals with children and for individuals with no children. None of these regressions

resulted in anything significantly different from the overall regressions in table 3. The results from these

regressions are presented in table 4. In table 4, the dependent variable is listed in the first column and the

subsample is listed in the first row. All equations include the same set of independent variables in table 3.

However, to save space, only the results for the post-law variables are presented. The variables that are not

presented are similar to those in table 3. These results suggest all groups are similar with respect to the

marginal effects of the determinants of social interactions. Since these determinants may have different

levels for each demographic group, the levels of social interactions can be different.

        Table 4 also presents the results from a sample limited to employed individuals. Since the empirical

models estimate the effect of the laws rather than hours of work directly there may a channel by which the

laws affect social interaction other than by affecting hours of work. Individuals who were not directly affected

might increase social interaction if their friends and relatives were more available for social activities. By

limiting the sample to employed individuals any spillover to non-working individuals is eliminated. If there is

a spillover effect then the regressions for the employed only should show smaller effects than found in the

full sample. The hours regressions show that the laws reduced hours of work for all groups except for those

individuals with no children who worked in small firms or who were civil servants. With a few exceptions, the

social interaction variables are again unaffected by the employment laws. The variables which are not

presented are also similar across all groups. This suggests that this channel by which the laws might affect

social interaction is not relevant.

        Are other channels by which the employment laws might affect social interaction? Suppose that the

true effect of the laws on social interaction were positive. In order to estimate consistently insignificant law

coefficients, there would have to be a channel by which the laws could have a significant negative effect on

social interaction. But there is no plausible channel by which the laws could reduce social interactions.

Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the lack of a significant effect of the laws on social interaction

indicates that there is no effect of hours of work on social interaction.

7. Comparison France and the US

        There are very similar data from the US which makes it possible to compare results from this study

with a prior study of social interaction in the US. Saffer (forthcoming) estimates a similar model with US data

from the General Social Survey (GSS). The GSS is funded by the National Science Foundation and is part

of a program of social indicator research, replicating questionnaire items and wording in order to facilitate

time-trend studies. The GSS data include over 40,000 observations. The EPCV data and the GSS data

are limited to persons 18 to 65 years of age. The EPCV data are from 1996 to 2003 and GSS data are from

1974 to 2004.

        Table 5 compares the regression results from this study with those of Saffer (forthcoming). Table 5

presents 10 pairs of regressions which used similar dependent variables in both studies and includes the

results for education, income and demographics. The comparisons between the two studies are limited to

sign and significance of the coefficients. This is due to the inclusion of different variables in regressions for

each nation and the different metric for education and income.8 In table 5, when the results differ between

the US and France they are highlighted in bold for easy recognition. For both countries, education is an

important determinant of social interaction with a positive effect on memberships and a negative effect on

visiting. Also, age follows the same pattern of increasing memberships but reducing visiting in both nations.

Income increase memberships but generally reduces neighborhood visiting. Being married reduces social

interaction in both nations and males tend to have less social interaction except for visiting friends and

neighbors. As can be seen in the table, 44 out of 50 pairs of coefficients are the same in sign and

significance. These data suggest that there many similarities in the determination of social interaction in the

two nations.



8. Conclusions

        Increases in hours of work per capita over the years has created an intuitively plausible notion that

there is not enough time left for social interaction. The specific question addressed in this paper is the effect


8
 The Education variable is continuous and the Professional and University variables are dichotomous. Income is
measured in euros in France and in dollars in the US.


                                                        16
of hours of work on social interaction. Intuitively, an increase in hours of work might be assumed to reduce

social interaction. However, there is evidence that individuals who work longer hours also have higher

levels of social interaction. This effect is attributed to third factor endogeneity. Measuring the effect of hours

of work on social interaction is thus a difficult empirical problem. The approach taken in this paper utilizes

an exogenous decline in hours of work in France due to a new employment law. The results show that the

law reduced hours of work in France. However, there is no evidence that the extra hours went to increased

social interactions. There are no significant differences in the marginal effects of the included variables by

gender, marital status or parent status. These results suggest that hours of work are not an important

determinant of social interaction. Since the French and US results are quite similar, where they can be

compared, it suggests that this effect may also be true in the US.

        The results also indicate that Human Capital, as measured by education and age, is an important

determinant of social interaction. The effect of education and age is positive for membership groups but

negative for visiting. Time series data show that memberships have remained fairly stable while visiting has

declined. The increases in education over time could explain the decline in visiting.
