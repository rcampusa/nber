                                          ABSTRACT

The fragmentation of production across borders allows firms to make and export final goods, or
to perform only intermediate stages of production by processing imported inputs for re-exporting.
We examine how financial frictions affect companies’ choice between processing and ordinary
trade –implicitly a choice of production technology and position in global supply chains – and
how this decision affects performance. We exploit matched customs and balance-sheet data from
China, where exports are classified as ordinary trade, import-and-assembly processing trade
(processing firm sources and pays for imported inputs), and pure-assembly processing trade
(processing firm receives foreign inputs for free). Value added, profits and profitability rise from
pure assembly to processing with imports to ordinary trade. However, more profitable trade
regimes require more working capital because they entail higher up-front costs. As a result, credit
constraints induce firms to conduct more processing trade and pure assembly in particular, and
preclude them from pursuing higher value-added, more profitable activities. Financial market
imperfections thus impact the organization of production across firms and countries, and inform
optimal trade and development policy in the presence of global production networks.

1 Introduction
The decline in transportation costs and policy barriers over the last few decades has revolutionized global
trade by enabling the splicing of production across borders. Firms today can choose to perform only
intermediate segments of the supply chain by processing and assembling imported inputs, before re-
exporting to final producers and retailers abroad. According to the International Labor Organization, 60
million workers worldwide are employed in 3,500 export processing zones spanning 130 mostly
developing countries (Boyenge 2007). This phenomenon raises important policy-relevant questions.
How should trade policy be designed when different manufacturing stages occur in different nations?
What are the welfare and distributional effects of processing trade and the policies that govern it? Does
it shape technology transfer to emerging economies and the transmission of shocks between countries?
      To shed light on these questions, we study how firms choose between processing and ordinary
trade – implicitly a choice of production technology and position in global supply chains – and how this
decision affects company performance. We show that spanning more production stages via ordinary
trade increases value added and profitability. However, it also requires more working capital because it
entails higher up-front costs. As a result, financial frictions induce firms to conduct more processing
trade, and preclude them from pursuing higher value-added, more profitable activities. At the same time,
processing trade enables constrained firms that could not undertake ordinary exports to share in the gains
from trade. Financial market imperfections thus affect the organization of production across firms and
countries, and inform the design of trade and development policy in the presence of global value chains.
      We use matched customs and balance-sheet data at the firm level for China, an economy ideally
suited to this analysis because of its major role in international production networks. To boost exports,
in the mid 1980s China formally introduced a processing trade regime (PT) that exempts materials
imported for further processing and re-exporting from import duties. By 2005, 32.7% of Chinese
exporters pursued processing trade and contributed 54.6% of total exports. In addition, Chinese firms
choose between two operating modes within the processing regime. Under pure assembly (PA), they
receive foreign inputs at no cost from the trade partner abroad to whom they also send the final product.
Under processing with imports (PI), also known as import-and-assembly, the Chinese firm instead
independently sources and pays for imported parts. These institutional features introduce wedges
between the costs and returns associated with ordinary trade (OT), PI and PA. Finally, China’s financial
system is underdeveloped and segmented across provinces. It thus provides a perfect setting for
exploring the link between credit constraints and firms’ choice of export mode.
      We establish two main results. First, profitability varies systematically across trade strategies.
Profits, profit-to-sales ratios and value added are higher for companies that undertake more ordinary

                                                                                                         1
relative to processing trade and more import-and-assembly relative to pure assembly. Producers settling
for PA or PI must therefore face some constraint that prevents them from doing OT.
      Second, limited access to capital poses such a constraint and determines exporters’ choice of trade
regime. We first demonstrate that (i) in the cross-section of firms within finely disaggregated industries,
financially healthier enterprises with more liquid assets and less leverage pursue more ordinary trade
relative to processing trade and more import-and-assembly relative to pure assembly. Moreover, (ii)
within continuing exporters over time, improvements in financial health are followed by reallocations
of trade activity towards regimes with higher working capital needs. Similarly, new exporters' financial
health prior to export entry strongly predicts their trade regime upon entry.
      Since (i) and to a lesser degree (ii) may arise endogenously, we exploit a series of exogenous
sources of variation to establish a causal effect of credit constraints. We show that (iii) following the
removal of MFA quotas on textiles and apparel in 2005, new exporters of such products choose different
trade modes depending on their financial status before 2005. (iv) Across sectors within firms, exporters
conduct more OT than PT and more PI than PA in financially less vulnerable sectors, i.e. sectors that
rely less on external capital markets for exogenous reasons. (v) The impact of firms' financial health and
sectors' financial vulnerability is bigger in Chinese provinces with weaker financial systems, where
liquidity constraints are more likely to bind for the Chinese exporter. By contrast, this impact is stronger
for financially more developed export destinations, where the foreign partner is less constrained and can
more easily bear the costs that the Chinese seller cannot.
      These empirical findings are consistent with liquidity needs and profitability varying across trade
regimes such that financial frictions shape firms’ choice of export mode. Conceptually, different trade
regimes correspond to a different distribution of production stages, costs and profits between Chinese
suppliers and foreign buyers. From the perspective of the Chinese manufacturer, ordinary trade requires
the most working capital because he pays for product design, domestic and foreign inputs, import duties
on foreign inputs, final assembly, and distribution abroad. Processing with imports necessitates less
financial liquidity, since it avoids the costs of product design, import tariffs and distribution. Financing
needs are lowest under pure assembly, when upfront expenses comprise only domestic inputs and
product assembly. When the costs borne by each party represent relationship-specific investments and
contracts are incomplete, hold-up problems arise and trade partners split revenues according to Nash
bargaining with their contribution to the relationship as bargaining weight. Chinese firms thus sort into
trade modes based on their access to capital, and this in turn pins down their profitability.
      Our analysis uncovers an important and previously unexplored determinant of firms’ export mode:
credit constraints. The recent literature has proposed other factors that govern the choice between


                                                                                                          2
processing and ordinary trade in China. These include firm productivity (Brandt and Morrow 2015, Dai
et al. 2011, Defever and Riaño 2012), space-based industrial policies (Defever and Riaño 2012), import
tariffs (Brandt and Morrow 2015), and incentives for foreign firms to vertically integrate their Chinese
supplier (Feenstra and Hanson 2005, Fernandes and Tang 2012). We use a variety of estimation
strategies in order to account for these alternative factors, as well as for other observable and
unobservable firm and sector characteristics. We control for the variation in aggregate supply and
demand conditions with a stringent combination of firms’ province, industry and destination fixed
effects, and for unobserved company characteristics with firm fixed effects. We establish that the role
of firms’ financial health is independent from that of firm size, age, productivity, ownership structure
(private vs. state, domestic vs. foreign), production technology (capital-, skill-, material intensity), and
tariffs on imported inputs. Of note, its effect is economically large relative to that of firm productivity,
which is weakly correlated with access to capital due to frictions in Chinese financial markets. We ensure
that our results for sectors’ financial vulnerability are not driven by the variation in physical capital
intensity, human capital intensity, relationship specificity, and upstream import tariffs across sectors.
      Our findings suggest that financial frictions influence the organization of global production
networks across firm and country boundaries. The three trade regimes correspond to the integration of
different segments of the value chain (product design, input sourcing, input processing, final assembly,
distribution) under the control of the Chinese exporter. Hence credit constrained firms, and presumably
financially underdeveloped countries as a whole, might be stuck in low value-added stages of the supply
chain and unable to pursue more profitable opportunities. Strengthening capital markets might thus be
an important prerequisite for moving into higher value-added, more profitable activities.
      Our study provides a bridge between two active literatures on trade and finance and on global
value chains. There is growing evidence that credit constraints impede firms' export activity and distort
aggregate trade flows, both in normal times and during crisis episodes (Foley and Manova 2015, Manova
2013, Berman and Héricourt 2010, Bricongne et al. 2012, Amiti and Weinstein 2011, Minetti and Zhu
2011, Chor and Manova 2012, Feenstra et al. 2011). We propose a novel mechanism – choice of trade
regime and implicitly global value chain position – through which credit constraints operate. There has
also been increased interest in international production networks and their implications for the
transmission of shocks across borders during the 2008-2009 crisis (Bems et al. 2011, Levchenko et al.
2010, Baldwin 2012). 1 An important advance in this area has been the inference of domestic value added
and production line position from trade flows and input-output tables at the country level (Johnson and

and productivity are procyclical and track financial conditions.

                                                                                                                   3
Noguera 2012, Antràs and Chor 2013, Fally 2011) and in China in particular (Brandt and Morrow 2015,
Kee and Tang 2012, Koopman et al. 2011). To this line of research we add one of the first micro-level
studies of how and why individual firms operate at different stages along the global value chain. We
also shift attention to the decisions of Southern firms, rather than those of Northern manufacturers
looking to relocate production to the low-cost South. 2
         Our analysis illustrates how liquidity constraints shape the design of international trade contracts.
Compared to OT and PI, PA is a codified form of trade credit extended by the foreign buyer to the
Chinese supplier for the purpose of financing imported inputs. Our paper thus extends previous work on
the use of trade credit in cross-border transactions (Antràs and Foley 2011, Demir and Javorcik 2014)
and on the effect of financial frictions on multinationals' decision to off-shore intra-firm or at arm's
length (Antràs et al. 2009, Manova et al. 2015, Javorcik and Spatareanu 2009).
         Finally, our conclusions shed light on the gains from trade and the role of trade policy in the
presence of processing trade and global supply chains. Our results reinforce recent evidence that
facilitating access to imported materials can boost the export performance of developing countries by
enabling manufacturers to improve product quality and to broaden product scope (Kugler and Verhoogen
2009, 2012, Goldberg et al. 2010, Manova and Zhang 2012). This is particularly relevant for economies
that rely on trade for growth and knowledge spillovers. Our findings further suggest that the international
fragmentation of production and its institutionalization with the processing regime in China allow
liquidity constrained firms to share in the gains from trade, when they could not have done so otherwise.
This highlights the differential effects of trade policy and global value chains across heterogeneous firms
in a world with financial market imperfections.
         The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides institutional
background on China’s trade regimes. Section 3 outlines a conceptual framework that guides our
empirical analysis. We introduce the data in Section 4, and present the empirical results in Section 5.
The last section concludes.


2 Institutional Background
For the past 30 years, China has used a variety of policy instruments to stimulate export activity. A
particularly consequential intervention has been the establishment of a designated trade regime that
exempts imported inputs from import duty as long as they are used for further processing, assembly and
ultimately re-exporting on behalf of foreign buyers. In place since the mid-1980s, this provision

                                                                                                            4
encourages the formation of processing-trade relationships between local firms and overseas companies
looking to offshore production to China.
      Chinese customs authorities distinguish between two carefully enforced trade regimes: processing
trade (PT) and ordinary trade (OT). 3 Processing trade is formally defined as "business activities in which
the operating enterprise imports all or part of the raw or ancillary materials, spare parts, components,
and packaging materials, and re-exports finished products after processing or assembling these
materials/parts". A firm conducting processing trade can claim import-duty exemption only if, at the
time of importing, it shows proof of a contractual agreement with a foreign buyer to whom it will export
the processed goods.
      Processing trade comprises two sub-categories: processing with imports (PI) and pure assembly
(PA). Pure assembly is also known as processing with foreign-client supplied materials. It refers to
"business activities in which the operating enterprise receives materials/parts from a foreign enterprise
without needing to pay foreign exchange for the import, and carries out processing or assembling with
the materials/parts as per the requirements of the foreign enterprise, only charging for the processing or
assembling, while any finished products are to be sold and marketed by the foreign enterprise." By
contrast, processing with imports, also known as processing with imported materials or import-and-
assembly, refers to "business activities in which the operating enterprise imports materials/parts by
paying foreign exchange for their processing, and exports finished processed products for sale abroad".
      Under both types of processing trade, the import duty is waived, the Chinese party pays for
domestic inputs and labor and customizes the product to the specifications of the foreign buyer, and the
foreign buyer handles product design, marketing and distribution. However, under PA, the Chinese firm
is not responsible for sourcing foreign materials and incurs no cost for using them. Under PI on the other
hand, it decides what parts to source, from which countries, and at what prices. It also has to pay for any
imported inputs. The foreign input suppliers are typically not the same party to whom the Chinese firm
ultimately exports. From a contractual perspective, whoever purchases a given input preserves
ownership rights over it until the processing transaction has been completed.
      Firms exporting under ordinary trade often manufacture exclusively with local inputs, but they are
allowed to combine foreign and domestic materials and to sell both at home and abroad. This makes it
prohibitively difficult for Chinese customs to ascertain what fraction of any imported inputs go towards

 There are a number of other regimes that capture less than 4% of exports (e.g. warehousing trade, entrepôt trade by
bonded area, international aid, barter trade). All regime definitions are from "Measures of the Customs of the People's
Republic of China on the Control of Processing-Trade Goods" released in 2004 and amended in 2008 and 2010.

                                                                                                                     5
production for exporting, especially when the Chinese company exports under its own brand name.
Ordinary exporters thus incur import tariffs on any foreign intermediates they use.
      A Chinese manufacturer may legally undertake both ordinary and processing trade, in which case
each of its import and export transactions is recorded and treated separately according to its specified
trade regime. 4 For example, a garment maker may use imported materials in order to sell domestically
and abroad under its own brand (e.g. Youngor) as well as to export under a foreign brand (e.g. Nike,
Gap). It would then enjoy the import tariff waiver on its processing imports but not on the foreign inputs
it acquired for its domestic production and ordinary exports.
      The introduction of the processing trade regime has significantly contributed to the expansion in
China's trade activity. In 2005 – the year our empirical analysis focuses on – 54.6% of all exports by
value represented processing trade. While China's import duties have declined over time, the exemption
for processing imports remains important: Average tariff rates dropped from 41% in 1992 to 16.8%
before entry into the WTO in 2001 and reached 9% in 2005 (Lemoine and Ünal-Kesenci 2004, Yu 2015).


3 Conceptual Framework
Chinese firms can participate in international trade via ordinary trade, processing with imports and pure
assembly. We posit that the institutionalized differences among these three trade regimes generate trade-
offs between ex-ante costs and ex-post profits: From the perspective of the Chinese company, more
profitable export modes are associated with higher up-front expenditures. As a result, financially
unconstrained firms are able to conduct the most profitable activity, while firms with limited access to
capital are forced into less profitable trade regimes with lower liquidity needs. Credit constraints thus
not only directly affect firms’ export strategy, but implicitly their production technology as well. This
section provides intuition for these economic forces and develops empirically testable hypotheses.

3.1 Key intuitions
We first build intuition by focusing on single-product firms exporting to a single destination. Consider
a Chinese firm facing foreign demand for a product such as a toy doll. Manufacturing and selling this
product requires multiple activities: product design, input sourcing, input assembly, marketing and
distribution. Each activity entails up-front costs that must be incurred before any sales and payoffs are
realized. Moreover, not all required inputs are available domestically. For example, plastic molds, paints
and hair might have to be imported because local suppliers lack the technological know-how to make


4
 On the import side, ordinary imports include final consumption goods, intermediates used in production for the
domestic market, and intermediates used in production for foreign markets by firms exporting under the OT regime.

                                                                                                               6
them or cannot meet the quality standards of foreign consumers. Conversely, malleable plastic, dress
cloth and assembly workers can be reliably and cost-effectively secured at home.
      The Chinese firm can choose to conduct ordinary trade and sell directly to foreign consumers, or
alternatively to engage in processing trade with a foreign party via pure assembly or processing with
imports.5 The up-front expenses and hence liquidity needs of the Chinese firm are lowest under pure
assembly, higher under processing with imports, and highest under ordinary trade. With PA, the Chinese
firm pays only for domestic inputs and assembly. With PI, it is responsible for domestic inputs, foreign
inputs and assembly. With OT, it covers product design, domestic and foreign inputs, import duties on
foreign inputs, assembly and distribution abroad. The foreign trade partner bears the cost of any activities
not performed by the Chinese firm.
      We hypothesize that the profits of the Chinese firm are lowest under pure assembly, higher under
processing with imports, and highest under ordinary trade. With OT, it operates completely
independently and captures all profits from foreign sales. With PT, on the other hand, trade partners
presumably make relationship-specific investments in product design, input sourcing, assembly and
distribution. In the presence of incomplete contracting, this would generate a two-sided hold-up problem,
such that profit sharing would be determined by ex-post Nash bargaining. The return to the Chinese firm
would then be its outside option (i.e. revenues from selling the assembled product to another buyer) plus
its share of the surplus rents from the partnership. Since bargaining power stems from parties’ relative
importance to the relationship, each side’s bargaining weight would likely increase with its contribution
to total costs. The Chinese firm’s profits would thus rise from PA to PI to OT.
      The ranking of trade regimes by up-front costs and ex-post profits might be reinforced by three
additional factors. To the extent that other forces might make it ambiguous, we would be less likely to
find support for our hypotheses. Thus which mechanisms dominate is ultimately an empirical question.
      First, given demand, there is a profit-maximizing level of output for each export mode. Producing
less would reduce costs and financing needs, but also profits. If a firm has sufficient liquidity for first-
best production in one trade regime (e.g. PI) but not in a higher-ranked regime (e.g. OT), it could choose
to operate at a second-best scale under the higher-ranked regime. By revealed preference, however, this
would still imply greater profits with the higher-ranked regime.
      Second, ordinary firms can opt to use fewer imported inputs than processing firms if foreign parts
are more expensive than domestic parts, especially if the import tariff is high; processing firms have


5
  This assumes that there is sufficient demand abroad both for final goods supplied by ordinary Chinese exporters and
for outsourcing production to China via processing trade. We believe this approximates well the economic environment
in China, and it allows us to concentrate on the trade-offs faced by the Chinese entrepreneur. See also Section 6.6.

                                                                                                                   7
little flexibility or interest in doing so because they must observe the specifications of the foreign buyer
and because they don’t incur import duties. This is unlikely to reduce OT costs below PI costs given the
high costs of product design and distribution and the loss in profits associated with deviations from the
first-best input mix. By revealed preference, an OT firm would therefore substitute towards local inputs
only if this still guarantees higher profits than alternative trade regimes.
      Finally, imperfect contractibility might generate moral hazard in production: Trade partners would
underinvest if they incur the full cost of an input but receive only a share of its marginal revenue. For
example, the Chinese producer might have to exert effort in sourcing inputs and managing operations.
The higher his bargaining weight, the more effort he would be incentivized to expend and the higher
sales and profits would be. 6 This would magnify the difference in profitability across trade modes.
      Given the ranking of profits across export regimes, ceteris paribus ordinary trade will be the
dominant strategy for Chinese firms with the requisite financial liquidity. However, some companies
might have restricted access to internal and external capital. The former would arise if they cannot retain
sufficient earnings from operations and must transfer profits to stockholders because of principal-agent
issues inside the firm. The latter would occur in the presence of credit market frictions due to limited
contract enforcement (e.g. endogenous default; weak protection of collateral claims) or asymmetric
information between lenders and borrowers (e.g. adverse selection; unobserved cost or demand shocks).
      Chinese firms will therefore pursue the most profitable trade mode they can, sorting into different
regimes based on their financial health: Ceteris paribus, most financially constrained exporters will
conduct pure assembly and earn low profits. Less financially constrained exporters will conduct import-
and-assembly and earn higher profits. Least financially constrained exporters will conduct ordinary trade
and earn the highest profits.

3.2 Empirical hypotheses
We next consider multi-product firms selling to multiple destinations. This accounts for the rich choice
set available to manufacturers in reality and sheds more light on underlying mechanisms of interest. It
also allows us to develop empirical hypotheses and identification strategies.
      Firms actively choose how many products to export, which products to export, and under what
trade regime so as to maximize total profits. They must allocate their financial resources across product
lines and export modes, recognizing that different products feature different up-front liquidity needs and
ex-post payoffs because of different cost and revenue structures. This allocation entails two liquidity-


6
 This assumes that the foreign party doesn’t underinvest or its underinvestment is less harmful to production. This
would be more likely when it resides in a country with stronger contract enforcement.

                                                                                                                 8
profit trade-offs: First, manufacturing more products can increase total revenues but impose higher ex-
ante costs. Second, processing trade (especially pure assembly) uses up less liquidity per product than
ordinary trade, and can thereby enable a firm to spread its funds across more products. This tends to
increase total profits along the extensive margin. However, PT (especially PA) offers lower returns per
product than OT. This tends to decrease total profits along the intensive margin.
      This complex optimization problem has an intuitive solution. Ordering products by their revenue-
to-liquidity-needs ratio, firms will add products in decreasing order of attractiveness until they exhaust
their available liquidity, and adjust export modes along the way. Both the level of up-front costs and the
ratio of payoffs to up-front costs matter. Pursuing trade regimes that guarantee a bigger share of revenues
is only worthwhile if these revenues are sufficiently high relative to the higher liquidity needs that such
regimes impose. Firms will thus choose ordinary trade for products with relatively low up-front costs
and high revenue potential; processing with imports for goods with intermediate cost and revenue levels;
and pure assembly for articles with high liquidity requirements but limited returns.
      We expect exporters with more access to finance to differ from capital-scarce firms in a number
of respects. First, financially healthier manufacturers can allocate more liquidity to each of their product
lines. Hence for any given product, less constrained firms will be more likely to conduct ordinary trade
relative to processing trade and import-and-assembly relative to pure assembly. Second, financially
healthier producers can export more products. They will go further down the product hierarchy, adding
goods with progressively higher liquidity needs that create stronger incentives for processing trade and
pure assembly. Aggregating across products to the firm level, the relationship between firms’ financial
health and overall export composition by trade regime is therefore theoretically ambiguous. Finally,
firms with more access to capital will earn higher profits because they can always undertake (weakly)
more profitable trading strategies than producers with less access to capital.
      This framework implies that firms will adopt a single trade mode per product. In practice, we
observe firm exports by destination country and 8-digit product category or 3-digit sector. While each
product category and sector arguably groups products with varying cost and revenue structures, we can
measure the reliance on external capital for up-front costs only at the sector level. Separately, cross-
country differences in consumer demand, product customization and distribution costs can incentivize
an exporter to sell the same product to different markets via different trade modes. For these reasons, we
anticipate that firms might use multiple trade regimes within a product category or sector.
      These arguments imply systematic and smooth variation in profitability and export strategies
across firms and sectors. We summarize these predictions with the following three hypotheses:



                                                                                                          9

4 Data
4.1 Trade and balance-sheet data
Our analysis makes use of two proprietary datasets on the activities of Chinese firms in 2005. Firms are
legally required to complete both, and compliance is strictly enforced by different government agencies.
The first one is the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASIF) conducted by China’s National Bureau of
Statistics.7 It provides standard balance-sheet data for all state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and all private
companies with sales above 5 million Chinese Yuan 8. We observe each firms’ location in one of 31
provinces and its main industry of activity out of 475 finely disaggregated categories in the Chinese
GBT 4-digit classification. The main variables of interest to us are measures of firm profitability and
financial status, which we discuss in greater detail below. We also use information on total sales,
employment, capital and material inputs to construct proxies for firm size and productivity.
      We also utilize the Chinese Customs Trade Statistics (CCTS) collected by the Chinese Customs
Office, which contains detailed information about the universe of trade transactions. 9 It reports the value
of firm exports (free on board) and imports (cost, insurance and freight included) in U.S. dollars by
country and product for 243 destination/source countries and 7,526 products in the 8-digit Harmonized
System. 10 The records indicate whether each cross-border sale occurs under ordinary trade, processing
with imports or pure assembly. The trade-regime classification thus characterizes individual transactions


7
  As in Wang and Yu (2012), the ASIF data are cleaned by excluding observations according to the following criteria:
(a) firms in non-manufacturing industries (2-digit GBT industry code >43 or <13) and tobacco (GBT code 16); (b)
observations with negative values for output, sales, exports, capital or intermediate inputs; (c) observations with total
assets less than total fixed assets or total liquid assets, or with total sales less than exports.
8
  This is equivalent to 0.6 million USD based on the USD-CNY exchange rate in 2005.
9
  Manova and Zhang (2009) describe the data and stylized facts about firm heterogeneity in Chinese trade.
10
   Product classification is consistent across countries at the 6-digit HS level. The number of distinct product codes in
the Chinese 8-digit HS classification is comparable to that in the 10-digit HS trade data for the U.S.

                                                                                                                      10
rather than firms. This allows us to construct continuous measures of the proclivity for using different
trade regimes at the firm level. Since we are interested in manufacturers’ export decisions, we drop
export-import companies that serve exclusively as intermediaries between domestic producers (buyers)
and foreign buyers (suppliers). 11
      Our empirical analysis critically relies on combining data from both sources. While each is
organized around company registration numbers, the authorities have not released a unique firm
identifier. We therefore merge the census files to the customs records based on an algorithm that matches
firm names and contact information.12 While imperfect, this procedure generates a large and
representative sample. We are able to obtain balance-sheet data for 44% of all exporters in CCTS and
trade transactions for 67% of all firms reporting positive exports in ASIF. We have verified that matched
exporters exhibit similar trade patterns as the full sample of exporters in the customs registry. Likewise,
the balance sheets of the matched exporters are comparable to those of all exporters in the census.

4.2 Summary statistics
Table 1 illustrates the substantial variation in size and performance across the 50,606 Chinese firms in
our matched sample. Mean log sales and log exports amount to 10.64 and 13.83, with standard deviations
of 1.35 and 2.08 respectively. Log profits and log value added average 7.33 and 9.23, with corresponding
standard deviations of 1.95 and 1.48. The dispersion in profitability, measured by the ratio of profits to
sales, is greater with a mean of 0.03 and standard deviation of 0.20.
      The Venn diagram in Figure 1 shows the distribution of firms operating in a single vs. multiple
trade regime. It shows the percentage share of exporters engaged in each of 7 possible combinations of
trade modes (PA; PI; OT; PA and PI; PA and OT; PI and OT; PA, PI and OT). The reported percentages
sum to 100%. 63.0% of all sellers ship only ordinary exports, while 2.7% and 11.0% conduct exclusively
pure assembly and processing with imports, respectively. The remaining 23.3% pursue mixed trade
strategies, with 3.5% undertaking some activity under all three regimes. Similar patterns obtain when
we look at a finer level of disaggregation and consider firm-sector pairs instead of firms (not shown).
Figure 2 replicates Figure 1, but instead of the percentage share of firms in a segment, it reports the
percentage share of aggregate exports captured by firms in that segment. Processing trade, especially PI,
contributes substantially more to the value of Chinese exports than its number of firms would suggest.
This is despite the low value added associated with processing trade and reflects its high import content.



11
   Since the data do not directly flag trade intermediaries, we follow standard practice and use keywords in firm names
to identify them (Ahn et al. 2011). We drop 29,982 wholesalers that mediate 22.3% of China’s trade.
12
   See Wang and Yu (2012) for a detailed description of the matching procedure.

                                                                                                                    11
      Table 2 documents the variation in the composition of firm exports in terms of trade regimes. We
analyze two indicators: the share of processing exports (both pure assembly and import-and-assembly)
in total exports, (PA+PI)/(PA+PI+OT), and the share of pure assembly in total processing exports,
PA/(PA+PI). We construct each measure at different levels of aggregation in order to study the variation
along different dimensions of trade activity. Table 2 reports summary statistics for all firms in the CCTS
data, but similar patterns obtain in the matched ASIF-CCTS sample.
      The average firm conducts 27% of its exports via processing trade and 24% of its processing
exports via pure assembly. However, there is considerable variation in activity across firms – standard
deviations are 41% and 41%. We observe comparable means and standard deviations when we compute
the two trade shares separately for each firm-ISIC sector pair, each firm-ISIC-destination triplet, each
firm-HS product pair, or each firm-HS-destination triplet. On the other hand, we see less variation in
trade regime choices across sectors or products within firms; even less across sectors or products within
firm-destination pairs; and the least across destination markets within firm-product or firm-sector pairs.
This can be inferred by comparing respective standard deviations and means. For example, the standard
deviation of (PA+PI)/(PA+PI+OT) across destinations within firm-ISIC pairs is 5% relative to a mean
of 18%, while its overall standard deviation across firms is 41% relative to a mean of 27%.
      Manufacturers’ use of foreign inputs is consistent with their choice of export mode. For instance,
ordinary exporters are less prone to import parts from abroad, while companies exporting under more
than one trade regime import intermediates under multiple regimes as well. Accounting for province,
industry and firm ownership fixed effects, the conditional correlation between the share of processing
exports in total exports and the share of processing imports in total imports is 0.603 across firms and
significant at 0.1%. Likewise, the conditional correlation between the share of pure-assembly exports in
total processing exports and the share of pure-assembly imports in total processing imports is 0.946
across firms and significant at 0.1%.

4.3 Measuring financial constraints
We employ four different proxies for sectors’ financial vulnerability, which have been commonly used
in the literature on the role of credit constraints for trade and growth. These variables are meant to
identify technologically-determined characteristics of each sector that are inherent to the nature of the
manufacturing process and beyond the control of individual firms. They are available from Kroszner et
al. (2007) for 29 ISIC 3-digit sectors, which we match to the Chinese HS 8-digit products. 13


13
  The measures are constructed following the methodology of Rajan and Zingales (1998) and Claessens and Laeven
(2003). They are averaged over the 1980-1999 period for the median U.S. firm in each sector.

                                                                                                           12
      There are systematic differences across sectors in firms’ reliance on external capital for funding
operations. These arise because of variation in the relative importance of up-front costs and the lag
between the time when production expenses are incurred and the time when revenues are realized. We
use the ratio of inventories to sales (Inventi) to proxy the duration of the manufacturing process and the
working capital firms require in order to maintain inventories and meet demand. This measure indexes
producers’ liquidity needs in the short run, which are associated mainly with variable costs such as the
cost of labor and intermediate inputs. We exploit two indicators of firms’ funding needs for long-term
investments that comprise mostly fixed costs. The classic measure is sectors’ external finance
dependence (ExtFini), obtained as the share of capital expenditures not financed with internal cash flows.
We also study the share of R&D spending in total sales (RDi), since research and development typically
occur at the beginning of a production cycle before manufacturing and marketing can commence.
      Sectors vary not only in firms’ reliance on external finance, but also in firms' ability to raise
external finance. We proxy the latter with the endowment of hard assets that companies can pledge as
collateral when accessing capital markets. This is gauged by asset tangibility (Tangi), defined as the
share of net plant, property and equipment in total book-value assets.
      As standard in the literature, these sector measures are constructed from data on all publicly traded
U.S.-based companies from Compustat’s annual industrial files. This approach is motivated by a number
of considerations. First, the United States have one of the most advanced and sophisticated financial
systems, which makes it reasonable that the behavior of U.S. companies reflects firms’ optimal asset
structure and use of external capital. Second, having the U.S. as the reference country eliminates the
concern that sectors’ financial vulnerability might endogenously respond to China's level of financial
development. In fact, if the most financially vulnerable industries in the U.S. employ more internal
financing and tangible assets in China because of the worse financial system there, our results would be
biased downwards. Finally, what is required for identification is not that industries have the same
tangibility and liquidity needs in the U.S. and China, but rather that the ranking of sectors remain
relatively stable across countries. To the extent that it doesn’t, measurement error would once again bias
our estimates down. Kroszner et al. (2007), Rajan and Zingales (1998) and Claessens and Laeven (2003),
among others, argue that the measures of financial vulnerability capture a large technological component
that is innate to a sector and therefore a good proxy for ranking industries in all countries. Consistent
with this argument, the measures vary substantially more across industries than across firms within an
industry, and the hierarchy of sectors is quite stable over time.




                                                                                                        13
      In addition to these sector indicators, we also construct two standard balance-sheet measures of
firms' financial health. 14 Liquidity gives the difference between current assets and current liabilities,
scaled by total assets. It signals firms' availability of liquid capital. Leverage is the ratio of current
liabilities to current assets. 15 Firms with higher leverage have more financial obligations outstanding in
the short run and less freedom in managing cash flows or raising additional external capital. We thus
expect exporters with high liquidity and low leverage to be financially healthier and less constrained.
      A first glimpse at the variation in trade activity with firms' financial health and sectors' financial
vulnerability reveals patterns consistent with our hypotheses (Figure 3). We divide firms into two
subsamples with liquidity above and below the median. 16 While the average share of processing trade
in total exports is 29.4% for high-liquidity firms, it is 31.2% for low-liquidity firms. The corresponding
numbers are 17.7% and 19.4% for the share of pure assembly in processing exports. When we distinguish
between sectors with working capital needs above and below the median, we observe substantially
bigger differences. In industries with high inventory-to-sales ratios, the typical firm conducts 19.9% of
its exports via processing trade and 22.7% of its processing exports via pure assembly. By contrast, these
shares drop to 14.3% and 14.6% for industries with low inventory-to-sales ratio.


5 Firm Profitability and Attributes across Trade Regimes
The empirical analysis proceeds in two steps. In this section, we first examine the variation in
profitability and other firm attributes across Chinese exporters engaged in different trade regimes. In
Section 6, we then analyze the effect of financial frictions on companies’ choice of trade regimes.
      According to Hypothesis 1, firm profitability should increase as the composition of foreign sales
shifts from pure assembly to processing with imports to ordinary trade. To assess the empirical validity
                                                                                                                         𝑋𝑋𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 +𝑋𝑋𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
of this prediction, we construct the share of processing exports in total exports �𝑋𝑋                                                         � and the

                                                                    𝑋𝑋𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
share of pure assembly in processing exports �𝑋𝑋                                 � for firm f, after summing f’s exports across all

of its destinations and products. We estimate the following specification separately for each
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓 in the matched ASIF-CCTS sample of exporters with balance-sheet data:

   See for example Whited (1992), Fazzari and Petersen (1993), Greenaway et al. (2007), and Ding et al. (2013).
15
   Leverage is often defined as short-term debt / current assets. In standard Chinese accounting practices, short-term
debt and current liability correspond to the same variable on firms’ balance sheets, “Liu Dong Fu Zhai”.
16
   We control for systematic differences in liquidity across firms with different ownership structures by defining these
medians separately for private domestic firms, state-owned enterprises, joint ventures and foreign affiliates.

                                                                                                                                                    14
Here 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑓𝑓 represents f’s log total profits or profit-to-sales ratio. We include 31 province 𝜑𝜑𝑝𝑝
and 475 industry 𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖 fixed effects using ASIF information on firms’ location and main industry of activity
in the Chinese GBT 4-digit classification. These fixed effects capture exogenous supply and demand
conditions that might both favor certain export modes and impact profits, such as factor costs, factor
intensities, transportation costs, tax treatment, institutional and financial market frictions. We account
for the role of firm size and ownership status with log employment and dummies for state-owned
enterprises, joint ventures, and wholly-owned multinational affiliates, the excluded category being
private domestic firms. We employ Huber-White heteroskedasticity robust standard errors 𝜀𝜀𝑓𝑓 .
           The coefficient of interest 𝛽𝛽 reflects the sign of the conditional correlation between firms’
profitability and trade regime. It is identified from the variation across exporters within narrowly defined
segments of the economy. We cannot and do not want to give 𝛽𝛽 a causal interpretation since profits and
export activity are joint outcomes of firms' maximization problem that are affected by producers’
financial health. Other firm attributes unrelated to credit constraints might also influence both variables.
           The results in Columns 1 and 3 of Table 3 indicate that manufacturers’ profits and profitability
indeed vary systematically with their trade strategy: they both decrease with the share of processing
exports in total exports and with the share of pure assembly in processing exports. These patterns are
independent of the fact that bigger firms tend to be more profitable (the unreported coefficient on
employment is positive). They are also economically significant. A one-standard-deviation fall in

𝑋𝑋𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 +𝑋𝑋𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 +𝑋𝑋𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂
                         is associated with 0.66% higher profit-to-sales returns, while processing exporters with a
                                                   𝑋𝑋𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
one-standard-deviation lower share                               enjoy 0.54% higher profitability. The profit levels of two
                                                𝑋𝑋𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 +𝑋𝑋𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃

companies whose trade shares are one standard deviation apart differ by 6.2% and 11.4%, respectively.
           As customary with balance-sheet data, Chinese firms report consolidated profits from worldwide
sales. To the extent that trade-regime choices affect foreign revenues but not home operations, the
findings above may underestimate the importance of trade modes for export profitability. In Columns 2
and 4, we repeat the analysis for the subset of firms that sell exclusively abroad but not domestically.
While "pure exporters" represent only 20% of the sample, we can be sure that their profits capture solely
cross-border activities. As anticipated, we obtain 50% bigger point estimates in this group of producers.
           The rest of Table 3 illustrates other differences among companies with varying export strategies.
Each cell reports the coefficient 𝛽𝛽 from estimating specification (1) for a different firm characteristic as
the outcome variable.17 First, firms that conduct more processing trade have lower total sales, value

added and domestic sales, but higher export revenues. Among processing exporters, those that pursue
more pure assembly record lower sales, exports and value added. Second, more productive firms are less
likely to undertake processing trade and especially pure assembly, where we measure productivity with
TFP or value added per worker. Third, capital, skill and material intensity generally rise with (XPA +
XPI) / (XPA + XPI + XOT) and fall with XPA / (XPA + XPI). Finally, exporters that perform more processing
trade and especially pure assembly have higher imports and a bigger share of processing imports.
      These findings suggest that multiple firm characteristics might determine or be correlated with the
choice of trade regimes. Our analysis below ensures that the estimated effects of financial frictions do
not capture the role of other factors such as company size, productivity, capital and skill intensity.


6 Financial Frictions and Firms’ Choice of Trade Regimes
Having established that profitability differs across trade regimes, we next show that credit constraints
prevent entrepreneurs from pursuing more profitable regimes. We perform a series of complementary
tests of Hypotheses 2 and 3 in order to establish causality and examine the channels through which
financial frictions operate. In particular, we explore the variation in financial health across firms and
within firms over time; the variation in financial vulnerability across sectors within firms; and the
variation in financial market development across space.

6.1 Firms’ financial health: cross-section
We first study the relationship between firms’ financial health and export activity in the cross section
with the following specification:

         𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 ∙ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑓𝑓 + 𝛤𝛤 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑓𝑓 + 𝜑𝜑𝑝𝑝 + 𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖 + 𝜑𝜑𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 + 𝜀𝜀𝑓𝑓         (2)

𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓 refers to one of the two trade regime shares. We proxy 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑓𝑓 interchangeably
with f's liquidity or leverage ratio lagged by one year, where firms with more liquid assets and fewer
debt obligations are deemed less constrained. We lag the financial health measures to alleviate concerns
with reverse causality since concurrent indicators are more likely to respond to trade activity; using
concurrent liquidity and leverage delivers qualitatively similar results of slightly greater magnitudes.
      We allow for any dispersion in supply and demand conditions across Chinese regions and
economic sectors with province 𝜑𝜑𝑝𝑝 and industry 𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖 fixed effects based on the location and primary GBT-
4 industry affiliation of each firm. We further control for systematic differences among producers of


panel for 2001-2006. Skill, capital and material intensity are measured respectively with the log average wage, the ratio
of net fixed assets to the wage bill, and the ratio of material purchases to the wage bill.

                                                                                                                     16
different organizational structures with ownership dummies. This extensive set of fixed effects accounts
for many independent factors determining the choice of trade regime, such as space-based industrial
policies (e.g. special economic zones, Defever and Riaño 2012) and the optimal organization of
production across firm boundaries (e.g. domestic vs. foreign ownership, Feenstra and Hanson 2005 and
Fernandes and Tang 2012). In robustness checks, we consider the role of other firm characteristics 𝑍𝑍𝑓𝑓 as
discussed below. We report robust standard errors 𝜀𝜀𝑓𝑓 .
      Table 4 indicates a strong link between companies’ financial status and choice of export regime.
Manufacturers with lower liquidity and higher leverage conduct more processing trade (Column 1).
Conditional on performing processing trade, they also engage in more pure assembly relative to import-
and-assembly (Column 2). These results are highly statistically significant and economically
meaningful. Improving liquidity or leverage by one standard deviation would reduce the share of
processing exports by 1-1.5% and the share of pure assembly in processing exports by up to 1%.
      In unreported regressions, we have confirmed that companies’ financial health is related to their
use of foreign inputs in a manner consistent with their choice of export regime: Credit-constrained firms
are more likely not only to export, but also to import under processing trade, especially pure assembly.
      A number of factors other than credit constraints could affect firms’ choice of trade regime and
bias our estimates. We next show that our baseline results survive a series of robustness checks that
alleviate such concerns and help us rule out alternative explanations.

Firm size and productivity
One potential concern is omitted variable bias arising from the relationship between financial health and
other firm characteristics. The key issue is whether these other characteristics impact companies’ trade
regime directly through non-finance channels, indirectly by determining access to finance which in turn
affects trade outcomes, or both. This will depend on the nature of financial market imperfections.
      Consider first firm productivity. Evidence suggests that Chinese firms conducting processing trade
are less productive than ordinary exporters (Brandt and Morrow 2015, Dai et al. 2011, Defever and
Riaño 2012). This could have three distinct implications for our results. First, productivity might be the
primitive attribute that pins down all firm outcomes, including access to capital, choice of inputs and
production technology, size, and export mode. For example, if financiers observe firm productivity but
are vulnerable to endogenous default, they will extend more credit to more productive firms with higher
expected profits, and some less productive firms will be credit constrained (credit underprovision).
Regressing firms’ trade regime on firms’ financial health alone would then correctly capture the effect




                                                                                                       17
of access to capital in equation (2). Controlling for productivity or outcomes of the firm’s maximization
problem such as size would bring 𝛽𝛽 down to zero but not invalidate the finance channel.
      Second, productivity might not perfectly predict firms’ financial health (credit misallocation). For
instance, there might be asymmetric information between lenders and borrowers due to unobserved firm-
specific shocks, or access to capital might depend on political or family connections. In this case,
conditioning on productivity in specification (2) would reduce 𝛽𝛽 without forcing it to zero such that 𝛽𝛽
would underestimate the effect of financial frictions on trade regime choices.
      Third, productivity might directly affect export activity through non-finance channels because of
economies of scale. Product design, marketing and distribution impose fixed costs on ordinary exporters
which processing exporters avoid. When trade regimes differ in profitability, more productive firms with
higher revenues will self-select into more profitable regimes with higher fixed costs. If financial health
is correlated with productivity, omitting the latter from regression (2) would bias the 𝛽𝛽 estimate.
      Firm size could similarly impact both access to financing and trade participation. Evidence in the
finance literature suggests that bigger firms are less credit constrained ceteris paribus (e.g. Beck et al.
2008, Guiso et al. 2004). If fixed costs vary across trade regimes, bigger companies might pursue more
ordinary trade both because they dispose of more liquidity and because they can more easily amortize
higher fixed costs. While the former is consistent with the credit mechanism that we emphasize, the
latter implies that our results might be spurious.
      In sum, firm size and productivity are not classic omitted variables in our context. Including them
as controls 𝑍𝑍𝑓𝑓 in equation (2) could inform the microfoundations of firms’ credit constraints but bias 𝛽𝛽
downwards, while excluding them could bias 𝛽𝛽 upwards. 18 In Columns 3-4 of Table 4, we explicitly
control for companies' lagged total factor productivity and lagged log employment. 19 The coefficient on
financial health retains its statistical significance. Its magnitude is approximately halved in the case of
(XPA + XPI) / (XPA + XPI + XOT) and less affected in the case of XPA / (XPA + XPI). This suggests that firm
size and productivity are imperfectly correlated with access to capital, in line with priors about inefficient
financial markets in China. Moreover, comparative statics indicate that the role of financial health is an
order of magnitude greater than that of the other two firm characteristics: A one-standard-deviation rise
in leverage, TFP and size is associated respectively with a change of 0.3%, 0.02% and 0.08% in (XPA +
XPI) / (XPA + XPI + XOT) and a change of 0.9%, 0.02% and 0.01% in XPA / (XPA + XPI). To guard against
omitted variable bias, we always condition on firm size and productivity in the rest of the analysis.

18
   Pairwise correlations between our financial health measures and the various firm controls we consider are typically
statistically significant but small in magnitude. For example, the raw correlations of liquidity with productivity, log
employment, capital-, skill-, material intensity, and age are 0.14, -0.09, -0.13, 0.10, 0.01, and 0.02, respectively.
19
   Similar results obtain if we use value added per worker instead of TFP or log sales instead of log employment.

                                                                                                                   18
Production technology
We address concerns with other omitted variables related to firms’ production technology in Columns
5-6 of Table 4. In particular, we control for exporters’ log age, lagged capital intensity (ratio of net fixed
assets to total wage bill), lagged skill intensity (log average wage), and lagged material intensity (ratio
of material inputs to total wage bill). 20 To the extent that these characteristics constitute endogenous
firm choices over inputs and production technology, they might be determined jointly with trade
outcomes by financial health and/or productivity. If so, including them in 𝑍𝑍𝑓𝑓 would produce lower-bound
estimates for 𝛽𝛽. On the other hand, if financial health is correlated with these firm characteristics but
they affect trade outcomes through non-finance channels, omitting them could bias 𝛽𝛽. Reassuringly, this
robustness check leaves our results qualitatively unchanged. To remain conservative, henceforth we
always include the full set of firm-level controls as in Column 5-6 (see footnote 18).

Bilateral trade shares
The set of export destinations varies significantly across firms in our sample. Since countries differ in
trade costs, demand conditions and the broader economic environment, different trade regimes might be
best suited to serving different markets for reasons unrelated to financial frictions. To rule out the
possibility that our results are driven by compositional effects, we construct exporters’ trade shares by
destination d and estimate a modified version of equation (2) that adds country fixed effects 𝜑𝜑𝑑𝑑 :

         𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 ∙ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑓𝑓 + 𝛤𝛤 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑓𝑓 + 𝜑𝜑𝑝𝑝 + 𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖 + 𝜑𝜑𝑑𝑑 + 𝜑𝜑𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 + 𝜀𝜀𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓   (2`)

We employ the full set of firm controls 𝑍𝑍𝑓𝑓 discussed above and cluster errors by firm to account for the
potential correlation in 𝜀𝜀𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 across markets within producers. This stringent specification delivers
qualitatively similar estimates of greater magnitudes than our firm-level analysis (Columns 7-8 in Table
4). We ensure that the market composition of firms’ exports does not affect our subsequent results by
presenting evidence at both the firm and the firm-country levels.

Binary trade shares
Given that many Chinese exporters operate under a single trade regime (c.f. Figure 1), the linearity
assumptions implicit in ordinary least squares might generate misspecification bias. In our sample,
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓 and 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 fall strictly between 0 and 1 for a quarter to a third of the
observations. This is consistent with our hypotheses, and appears inconsequential econometrically: Our


20
 Krishna et al. (2015) study how Chinese firms learn from exporting directly vs. indirectly through trade intermediaries.
While learning from exporting might also vary across trade regimes, the productivity and age controls account for that.

                                                                                                                           19
findings remain unchanged or become statistically and economically more significant when we replace
the continuous trade shares with binary indicators set to 1 for all values above 0. Columns 9-10 in Table
4 present point estimates based on a linear probability model applied to disaggregated data at the firm-
destination level, for which 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 = {0,1} holds more frequently than at the firm level. Similar
patterns however emerge for binary trade shares at the firm level.

Multiple products and sectors per firm
Specifications (2) and (2`) explore the variation in trade outcomes across firms within 475 finely
disaggregated GBT 4-digit industries, where each firm is assigned its main industry as reported in ASIF.
This ignores the fact that many exporters are in fact active in multiple industries and products. We
address this by exploiting the CCTS statistics on firm exports by ISIC 3-digit sector (29 categories) and
by HS 8-digit product (5,784 categories). Although the ISIC classification is less granular than GBT-4,
we consider it for consistency with our subsequent analysis of ISIC sectors’ financial vulnerability.
      In Table 5, we estimate the following equations to more rigorously test Hypothesis 2:

        𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 ∙ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑓𝑓 + 𝛤𝛤 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑓𝑓 + 𝜑𝜑𝑝𝑝 + 𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖 + 𝜑𝜑𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 + 𝜀𝜀𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓               (3)
        𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 ∙ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑓𝑓 + 𝛤𝛤 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑓𝑓 + 𝜑𝜑𝑝𝑝 + 𝜑𝜑𝑑𝑑 + 𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖 + 𝜑𝜑𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 + 𝜀𝜀𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓   (3`)

We compute the outcome variables separately for each firm-ISIC sector pair in Columns 1-2, each firm-
destination-ISIC sector triplet in Columns 3-4, and each firm-destination-HS product triplet (the most
disaggregated level available) in Columns 5-6. We include the full set of firm characteristics 𝑍𝑍𝑓𝑓 . We
control for exogenous supply and demand conditions with corresponding ISIC-3 or HS-8 fixed effects
𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖 and province fixed effects 𝜑𝜑𝑝𝑝 in specification (3), and additionally with destination fixed effects 𝜑𝜑𝑑𝑑
in specification (3`). While many firms pursue a mix of export regimes overall, they often choose a
single one for a given industry, and even more frequently for a given industry-destination or product-
destination market. We therefore use binary indicators for 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 and 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 ;
continuous trade shares produce comparable estimates. We cluster standard errors by firm.
      Accounting for the fact that firms may be active in multiple product lines or even broader sectors,
we find that companies’ lagged financial health strongly predicts their choice of trade regime. On
average, firms with more access to capital are more likely to select regimes with higher liquidity needs
for any given sector or product that they pursue. We have separately checked that the baseline results in
Table 4 where we assign firms’ total trade flows to their primary industry of activity are robust to
controlling for the log number of HS-8 products they export (available on request). Together, these
patterns lend further support to Hypothesis 2 and inform the operations of multi-product firms. They


                                                                                                                              20
speak to the effects of financial frictions on the intensive margin, i.e. the choice of trade regime for
sectors actually exported; we later consider the extensive margin of number of sectors exported.

Robustness
A series of additional robustness checks leave our conclusions unchanged (see Online Appendix Tables
1 and 2). First, we have confirmed our results when proxying size with log sales instead of log
employment and material intensity with the ratio of material purchases to total sales instead of to the
total wage bill. Second, import tariffs in upstream industries can affect firms’ choice between processing
and ordinary trade since the former permits duty-free imports of inputs (Brandt and Morrow 2015).
Specifications (2)-(3`) implicitly take this into account because the industry fixed effects 𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖 subsume
the average tariff across imported inputs at the output-industry level. In addition, China’s import tariffs
were relatively low by 2005: The mean and standard deviation across HS-8 products amounted to 9.7%
and 6.6% respectively. Nevertheless, there might be variation in effective import tariffs across exporters
in the same output industry if they use inputs in different proportions. We have therefore verified our
findings for (XPA + XPI) / (XPA + XPI + XOT) controlling for firm-specific import tariffs constructed as
the weighted average tariff across all products that a firm imports, using tariff data from WITS and
lagged firm imports by product as weights as in Yu (2015).
      Finally, we have explored the role of firms’ ownership type. Evidence indicates that the affiliates
of multinational companies are less credit constrained than domestic firms because the former can tap
additional financial resources by accessing foreign capital markets directly or indirectly via internal
capital markets. At the same time, multinational affiliates are not completely unconstrained and
insensitive to host-country financial conditions. 21 Ceteris paribus, financial frictions can thus affect the
trade regime choice of both domestic and foreign-owned firms in China. Since we condition on
ownership type, our estimates are identified from the variation among producers with the same
organizational structure. Split-sample and interaction analyses reveal that qualitatively similar patterns
hold for domestic and foreign-owned firms.

6.2 Endogeneity
It is important to assess whether the strong relationship between firms’ financial health and choice of
trade regime is causal. A priori, even if export levels might influence firms’ access to finance, it is less
obvious how the composition of exports would. We nevertheless consider two potential endogeneity

21
  Foley and Manova (2015) review the literature on the effects of financial frictions on multinational activity. For the
case of China, Manova et al. (2015) show that fully and partially foreign-owned firms export significantly more than
private domestic firms in financially more vulnerable sectors, while Huang et al. (2007) conclude that more credit
constrained Chinese firms are more likely to be acquired by foreign firms.

                                                                                                                    21
problems that could arise only if financial markets are efficient. Their relevance may thus be limited
given the widely recognized inefficiency of Chinese capital markets.
       First, with frictionless capital markets, manufacturers can fund and implement their first-best
export strategy. Since liquidity needs decline from OT to PI to PA, so would the observed use of external
finance across firms with different trade modes. This could spuriously generate our results even though
we lag firms’ financial health if financial health and trade activity are sufficiently slow-moving. What
makes this an unlikely possibility is the substantial variation in profitability across trade regimes: Were
Chinese exporters financially unconstrained, they would have pursued ordinary trade ceteris paribus.
      Second, if firms face no credit constraints and profitability falls from OT to PI to PA due to non-
finance factors (unlike in Section 3.1), firms might sort into trade regimes for exogenous reasons. If
investors are more willing to fund more profitable ventures, exporters more active in trade regimes that
happen to have higher returns would exhibit stronger financial health. While not impossible, this
rationalization is hardly credible as it requires a very special alignment of exogenous forces.
      Of note, reverse causality could lead us not only to overestimate, but also to underestimate the true
impact of financial frictions on exporters’ activity. If partnerships with foreign buyers under processing
trade increase the trustworthiness of Chinese firms as borrowers, conducting PA or PI might improve
their access to external finance in the Chinese capital market, as well as to trade credit from input
suppliers. We would then be less likely to find empirical support for our hypotheses.
      Finally, some of our results might be spurious because of how standard accounting practices affect
measured financial health. Recall that liquidity and leverage are defined respectively as (current assets
– current liabilities) / total assets and current liabilities / current assets. 22 Since current assets include
input inventories, inventories of foreign inputs provided by foreign buyers do not enter the financial
ratios of Chinese firms under PA, whereas inventories of foreign inputs acquired by Chinese firms under
OT and PI do. It is not obvious if this systematically affects the measured liquidity of firms with different
export regimes: Foreign-input inventories enter both the numerator and the denominator, and their
outstanding cost is netted out of the numerator since accounts payable are part of current liabilities. It is
also unclear how foreign input inventories might vary across trade modes, even if foreign input
purchases do. As for leverage, it might be mechanically higher for firms conducting more PA relative




22
   Current assets (“Liu Dong Zi Chan”) include inventories, cash, accounts receivable, investments, and pre-paid
expenses, where inventories comprise finished products in the process of being sold and materials and inputs intended
for future production. Note that the latter differs from the value of inputs used in production. Current liabilities (“Liu
Dong Fu Zhai”) include short-term loans, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, where accounts payable may include
input purchases that have not yet been settled. Total assets (“Zong Zichan”) are the sum of fixed and current assets.

                                                                                                                      22
to PI and OT because foreign input inventories enter only the denominator. This concern would be
mitigated to the extent that their outstanding cost is part of accounts payable in the numerator.
       To establish the causal effect of credit constraints on firms’ choice of trade regime, we complement
the evidence above based on the cross-firm variation in financial health with a series of results that
exploit other sources of variation in the data for identification purposes.

6.3 Firms’ financial health: dynamics
We next provide consistent time-series evidence for the relationship between firms’ financial health and
export activity using panel data for 2002-2006. 23 We separately examine export entrants and continuing
exporters to assess how changes in financial status affect trade behavior upon entry and subsequently.
We also study how firms respond to an exogenous shock to export demand depending on their access to
capital prior to the shock – the cleanest set-up for identifying causal effects in the time series.

Changes within firms over time
We explore whether changes in financial health lead continuing exporters to reorient operations across
trade regimes by including firm fixed effects 𝜑𝜑𝑓𝑓 in a panel version of equations (2`) and (3`):

         𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 ∙ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑓𝑓,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛤𝛤 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑓𝑓,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝜑𝜑𝑓𝑓 + 𝜑𝜑𝑑𝑑 + 𝜑𝜑𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓               (4)
         𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 ∙ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑓𝑓,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛤𝛤 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑓𝑓,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝜑𝜑𝑓𝑓 + 𝜑𝜑𝑑𝑑 + 𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖 + 𝜑𝜑𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓   (4`)

The unit of observation in these regressions is either the firm-destination-year or firm-ISIC industry-
destination-year. The 𝜑𝜑𝑓𝑓 ’s subsume the role of firms’ ownership type, province and primary industry
affiliation, and control for time-invariant unobserved firm characteristics such as entrepreneurial ability
or stable bank relationships that permanently improve access to credit. Coefficient 𝛽𝛽 is thus identified
purely from adjustments across trade modes within firms over time. We allow for common cost and
demand shocks across manufacturers with destination 𝜑𝜑𝑑𝑑 , ISIC industry 𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖 , and year 𝜑𝜑𝑡𝑡 fixed effects.
We also condition on the full set of time-variant firm controls 𝑍𝑍𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 introduced above, and cluster standard
errors by firm. 24 We report results using binary indicators as the outcome variable, but qualitatively
similar patterns hold with continuous measures.
       Of note, we have less identification power in the panel than in the cross-section: While the averages
(standard deviations) of liquidity and leverage are 0.09 (0.32) and 0.99 (1.28) in the cross-section for
2005, they are 0.08 (0.13) and 1.04 (0.34) within the average firm over the 2002-2006 period. At the

23
   Customs data are available 2000-2006, but the census panel begins in 2001 and we use 1-year lagged 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑓𝑓 .
We have verified that our baseline cross-sectional results hold in the pooled panel with year fixed effects.
24
   Since we observe material intensity only in 2004, it is subsumed by the firm fixed effects in the panel regressions.

                                                                                                                                         23
same time, there is significant turnover, with many firms entering and exiting different markets and
frequent changes in the trade-regime composition of exports within surviving firm-destinations over
time. For instance, 7.2% of firm-destinations with 100% processing exports in 2002 have switched to
100% ordinary exports by 2006, while another 21.8% have adopted mixed export strategies. Of firm-
destinations with mixed trade regimes in 2002, 25.4% switch to purely ordinary exports by 2006, and
another 34.7% reduce their share of processing trade closer to 0. Of firm-destinations with 100%
ordinary exports in 2002, only 13% initiate processing trade by 2006. A sizeable number of firm-
destinations thus gradually move from processing to ordinary exports, although the opposite trajectory
also exists. The composition of processing exports in terms of PA and PI behaves similarly.
       Table 6 indicates that improvements in financial health within firms are indeed followed by export
activity shifting away from processing trade towards ordinary trade and away from pure assembly
towards processing with imports (Columns 1-4). The estimates for 𝛽𝛽 are, however, substantially smaller
than in Tables 4 and 5. This suggests that continuing exporters do not modify operations on an annual
basis, possibly because of sunk adjustment costs and uncertainty about future demand and credit
conditions. Combined with our earlier results, this implies that financial frictions are an important
determinant of the variation in trade activity across firms, but play a lesser role in surviving exporters’
dynamics in the short run. The latter may be more responsive over a longer horizon than our panel
permits us to study. For example, exporters that begin with processing trade may be able to accumulate
sufficient financial resources through retained earnings and gradually transition into ordinary trade.

Export entry and MFA reform
We next turn to first-time exporters, and study how financial health prior to entry affects companies’
choice of trade regime upon entry. We postulate that if a producer begins exporting in year t, he will be
more likely to choose trade modes with lower liquidity requirements if he had access to less financial
capital in year t-1. We test this hypothesis by re-estimating specifications (4) and (4`) in the subsample
of firms exporting for the first time in year t. 25 We once again report results for binary outcome variables,
but similar patterns hold for continuous trade shares. As expected, new exporters with ex ante less
liquidity and more leverage conduct more processing trade and more pure assembly at export entry
(Columns 5-8). These effects are typically 2-3 times bigger than those for financial health in the cross-
section: A one-standard-deviation improvement in liquidity (leverage) prior to export entry translates
into 1.3% (2.1%) lower probability of processing trade and 1.2% (2.3%) lower probability of pure

25
   We consider a firm to be a new exporter in year t if it did not export in years t-1 and t-2. Our results are not sensitive
to making this filter stricter, for example by requiring that f also did not export in year t-3, or by focusing only on entry
in 2005 conditional on no exports in 2000-2004.

                                                                                                                         24
assembly conditional on processing trade upon entry. By contrast, lagged productivity is frequently not
a significant determinant of the trade-regime composition of export entrants (not reported).
       These findings reinforce our conclusion that the extensive margin of export entry is an important
channel through which financial frictions impact firms’ trading strategy, as constrained firms cannot
easily switch across trade regimes once they begin exporting.
       The results for export entry also strengthen the case for a causal effect of credit constraints. To the
extent that a firm and its lenders do not have complete information about export profitability before
export entry, lagged financial health is less likely to be endogenous to the future trade regime of new
exporters than of continuing exporters. Lagged financial ratios are also not subject to concerns with the
accounting of future foreign input inventories. Endogeneity would be especially unlikely if export entry
occurs in response to an exogenous shock to foreign demand that is beyond the control of individual
firms. We next provide consistent evidence using precisely such a natural experiment.
       An important reform during our sample period was the removal of restrictive quotas on Chinese
exports of textiles and apparel to the US, Canada and EU-25 on January 1, 2005 as part of the Multi-
Fiber Agreement (MFA). Not all textile and apparel products were affected, and not all MFA-affected
products faced binding quotas prior to 2005 (i.e. actual quantities shipped exceeding 90% of the specified
limit). We test whether Chinese firms that began exporting MFA-affected products to the US, Canada
and EU-25 in 2005 after the exogenous reforms chose trade regimes based on their prior financial status.
In Columns 9-10 of Table 6, we estimate equation (4) in the cross-section of such firms and find patterns
very similar to those in the panel of export survivors and entrants. Analogous results obtain for new
exporters of quota-bound products, which we can identify in the case of the US (available on request).

6.4 Sectors' financial vulnerability
While the evidence in Sections 6.1 and 6.3 strongly supports Hypotheses 1 and 2, there might be sources
of simultaneity bias that we are unable to address even with our analysis of export dynamics, because
this still uses balance-sheet measures of firms’ financial health. To more convincingly establish the
causal effect of financial frictions, we next test Hypothesis 3 and examine the variation in export activity
within firms across sectors at different levels of financial vulnerability. Financial vulnerability is
technologically determined and reflects innate characteristics of the manufacturing process in an
industry. It is by construction exogenous to individual firms, allowing us to circumvent concerns with
endogeneity due to reverse causality, omitted variables or accounting bias.
       Exploiting the rich customs data, we estimate two specifications using four alternative measures
of sectors' financial vulnerability 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 :


                                                                                                           25
         𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 ∙ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 + 𝛤𝛤 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 + 𝜑𝜑𝑓𝑓 + 𝜀𝜀𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓                           (5)
         𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 ∙ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 + 𝛤𝛤 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 + 𝜑𝜑𝑓𝑓 + 𝜑𝜑𝑑𝑑 + 𝜀𝜀𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓               (5`)

The outcome variable of interest is the share of different trade regimes in firm f’s exports by ISIC
industry i in equation (5) and by ISIC-industry i and destination d in equation (5`). 26 We include firm
fixed effects 𝜑𝜑𝑓𝑓 to control for observed and unobserved company characteristics that affect trade activity
in all sectors, such as financial health, productivity, size, ownership type, familiarity with foreign
markets, etc. The effect of 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 is hence identified solely from the exogenous variation across
sectors within multi-sector producers. 27 It reflects the way in which exporters allocate their limited
financial resources across trade modes and industries with different liquidity needs. Importantly, even if
firms’ total access to capital were endogenous to their trade operations, a significant 𝛽𝛽 would imply that
financial factors determine companies’ export strategy. We cluster errors by firm, to account for the
potential correlation in cost or demand shocks across industries and destinations within firms. 28
      We are careful to isolate the impact of financial vulnerability from that of other sector
characteristics 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 that might influence firms’ trade regime. Since specifications (5) and (5`) do not permit
industry fixed effects, we condition on sectors’ physical and human capital intensity, as well as on the
importance of relationship-specific investments in input production. These variables come from Braun
(2003) and Nunn (2007). We also use four different measures of sectors’ financial sensitivity that are
imperfectly correlated with each other. This makes it difficult for a single omitted industry characteristic
to simultaneously explain robust results for all four measures.
      Table 7 clearly indicates that exporters choose different means of servicing foreign markets based
on the financial characteristics of the sector. Firms actively pursue processing trade, especially pure
assembly, in industries with high working capital requirements as proxied by the inventories-to-sales
ratio (Columns 1-2 in Panel A). Increasing short-run liquidity needs by 20% would translate into 10%
rise in the share of foreign revenues generated through processing trade and 4% uptake in the share of
pure assembly in processing exports. These magnitudes are large relative to the means of the two trade
shares (30% and 19% respectively).



26
   Since this analysis does not require any balance-sheet data, we are no longer restricted to the matched sample of firms
with both customs and census data, and are able to include the universe of exporting firms.
27
   45% of all exporters in the sample are active in two or more ISIC 3-digit sectors. They capture the vast majority of
trade flows and of the observations in regressions (5) and (5`), ranging 64%-77% across columns in Table 7.
28
   Moulton (1990) argues that errors should be clustered at the most aggregate level at which the relevant explanatory
variable varies in the sample, which in our case is the sector. However, Angrist and Pischke (2008) show that standard
error asymptotics require a sufficiently large number of groups (50) that exceeds the number of sectors in our data (29).
We have nevertheless confirmed that qualitatively similar results obtain if we instead cluster by sector.

                                                                                                                      26
      We next examine the importance of sectors’ reliance on outside finance for long-term investment
in capital and R&D. As expected, industries’ external finance dependence and R&D intensity affect the
choice between ordinary and processing trade (Panels B and C). The trade-off between pure assembly
and processing with imports, on the other hand, appears unrelated to the funding of long-run investment
projects. This is consistent with the idea that the two processing regimes differ only in terms of the
financing of short-run, variable input costs. By contrast, fixed costs incurred in product design,
equipment purchases, marketing and distribution constitute a key distinction between processing and
ordinary trade.
      We finally turn to industries’ asset tangibility in Panel D. While the three sector measures above
capture liquidity needs, tangibility reflects the capacity to raise capital by pledging collateral. Our results
confirm that exporters are indeed more likely to choose processing over ordinary exports in industries
with softer assets (Column 1). As with the financing of long-term investment, asset tangibility too seems
less important for the choice between the two processing methods (Column 2).
      In terms of economic significance, financial frictions are a key determinant of firms’ choice of
trade regime across sectors. Based on our estimates, the effect of a one-standard-deviation change in
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 on the share of processing exports in total exports is similar across the four measures (1.8%-
2.5%). Compared to the implied impact of a one-standard-deviation change in other sector
characteristics, financial vulnerability exerts an effect 5.6 times as large as that of physical capital
intensity, 6 times that of human capital intensity, and 16 times that of relationship specificity.
      Even within narrowly defined industry categories, the optimal trade strategy might depend on
characteristics of the export market. We account for this possibility by estimating equation (5`) for the
firm-industry-destination as the unit of observation, adding destination country fixed effects. We obtain
consistent results for all four sector measures of financial vulnerability in Columns 3-4. In Columns 5-
6, we record stable patterns when we instead use binary trade shares set to 1 for all values above 0.
      These findings are robust to a number of specification checks presented in Online Appendix Table
3. First, we exploit the full granularity of the data, and define the outcome variable for each firm-HS
product-destination triplet instead of at the firm-ISIC sector-destination level. Second, while the firm
fixed effects in the regression control for the average tariff each firm pays for its imported inputs,
effective import tariffs might vary systematically across output industries within a firm because different
output industries combine inputs in different proportion. Our results survive when we control for the




                                                                                                             27
average imported input tariff by output sector, 29 or alternatively, when we exclude firms that face import
duties because they import inputs under the ordinary trade regime.
      One implication of the conceptual framework in Section 3 is that financially healthier firms should
be able to sustain export activity in more sectors and in more financially sensitive sectors. While other
factors also influence the operations of multi-sector firms, we provide evidence consistent with this
pattern in Online Appendix Table 4. We show that companies with higher (lower) levels of lagged
liquidity (leverage) export a bigger number of ISIC sectors. Moreover, the average financial
vulnerability of firm exports is higher for less constrained companies, where we calculate the former as
the unweighted or weighted average 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 across all industries i in firm f’s export portfolio, using
f’s exports by industry as weights.
      While Section 3 makes clear predictions for the direct effects of firms’ financial health and sectors’
financial vulnerability on exporters’ choice of trade regime, it has ambiguous implications for the
differential impact of firms’ access to capital across sectors with different financial sensitivities.
Regardless of its financial health, any firm would prefer export modes with lower liquidity requirements
in financially more dependent sectors, compared to financially less dependent sectors (Hypothesis 3). In
any industry, less constrained firms would be more likely to pursue trade regimes with higher liquidity
needs, compared to more constrained firms (Hypothesis 2). However, the regime choices of less
constrained firms might be equally, more or less reactive to sectors’ financial dependence relative to
those of more constrained firms, because all three scenarios would be consistent with firms’ profit
maximization. Interaction analysis suggests that in practice, all firms adjust their trade shares
proportionately in response to sectors’ financial vulnerability (not reported).

6.5 Provinces’ financial development
Hypotheses 2 and 3 are valid only in the presence of financial market imperfections: Firms’ need for
external capital will distort their export activity only if they face financial constraints. Otherwise,
producers will freely obtain the outside finance they need to implement their first-best export strategy,
and Hypotheses 2 and 3 will not apply. We can therefore exploit exogenous differences in the strength
of financial institutions across space to provide more causal evidence for Hypotheses 2 and 3.
      The financial sector in China is known to be segmented, with banks typically serving firms in the
same geographic region (World Bank 2005). This generates variation in the availability of external
capital across Chinese provinces that is exogenous to individual firms. We thus expect the export

                                                                                                                28
decisions of manufacturers in financially more developed areas to be less sensitive to their measured
financial health and to industries’ financial vulnerability. In other words, the effect of low liquidity on
the proclivity for processing trade and pure assembly should be smaller for companies based in
financially advanced regions relative to companies based in financially lagging regions. Similarly, across
sectors within a firm, the effect of sectors’ financial dependence on the two trade shares should be
mitigated for firms operating in financially more developed provinces.
        We test these predictions by expanding specifications (2`) and (5`) to include respectively
interactions of firms’ liquidity and of sectors’ inventory-to-sales ratio with a measure of financial
development in the firms’ home province:

             𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 ∙ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑓𝑓 + 𝛤𝛤 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑓𝑓 + 𝛿𝛿 ∙ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑓𝑓 ∙ 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑝𝑝 +
                                          +𝜑𝜑𝑝𝑝 + 𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖 + 𝜑𝜑𝑑𝑑 + 𝜑𝜑𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 + 𝜀𝜀𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓                                                                     (6)
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 ∙ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 + 𝛤𝛤 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿 ∙ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 ∙ 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑝𝑝 + 𝜑𝜑𝑓𝑓 + 𝜑𝜑𝑑𝑑 + 𝜀𝜀𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓   (6`)

Here 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑝𝑝 is a binary indicator set to 1 for provinces with financial development above the
sample median. Following common practice in the literature, we proxy regional financial conditions
with the ratio of total credit to GDP from the Almanac of China’s Finance and Banking (e.g. Héricourt
and Poncet 2015). To account for different trade conditions across countries, we study bilateral trade
shares by firm or firm-sector and include destination fixed effects 𝜑𝜑𝑑𝑑 . As above, in equation (6) we add
the full set of firm controls 𝑍𝑍𝑓𝑓 , province 𝜑𝜑𝑝𝑝 , ownership 𝜑𝜑𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 , and industry 𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖 fixed effects using
information on the firm’s primary industry from ASIF. By contrast, equation (6`) exploits the variation
across sectors within firms by conditioning on firm fixed effects 𝜑𝜑𝑓𝑓 and sector controls 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 . The main
effect of 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑝𝑝 is subsumed by either 𝜑𝜑𝑝𝑝 or 𝜑𝜑𝑓𝑓 . We continue to cluster errors by firm.
        We report results for binary bilateral trade shares in Columns 1-2 and 5-6 of Table 8. As expected,
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑓𝑓 and 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 enter as before, while the interaction terms are significant and of the opposite
sign. Comparing the estimates for 𝛽𝛽 and 𝛿𝛿 , financial health affects firms’ proclivity for processing trade
2.7 times more in financially underdeveloped regions in China than in financially advanced provinces.
Raising sectors’ working capital needs by 10% makes processing exports 12.5% more likely when firms
face a weak banking system, but only 4.7% more likely when they can access strong capital markets.
        These results are robust to the inclusion of an extensive set of control variables in Columns 3-4
and 7-8. First, we add the interactions of 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑓𝑓 or 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 with other province characteristics:
GDP per capita, contract enforcement, physical- and human capital abundance. This ensures that we
isolate the effect of financial development separately from that of overall economic development,


                                                                                                                                                      29
broader institutions and factor endowments. Second, in equation (6) we control for the interaction of
firm productivity with financial development. Third, in equation (6`) we include the interactions of other
sector characteristics (capital-, skill- and relationship-specific intensity) with corresponding regional
characteristics (capital endowment, skill endowment and contract enforcement). Finally, we introduce
industry fixed effects in specification (6`) to absorb unobserved industry characteristics. We then
identify only the interaction term, but not the main effect of 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 . Our findings remain qualitatively
the same, while the coefficients on most control variables are insignificant.
      These results bolster the case for causal effects of financial frictions on firms’ trade regime choices:
While concerns with the endogeneity of 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑓𝑓 or omitted sector characteristics correlated with
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 might bias the level effects 𝛽𝛽, they could not explain the differential impacts 𝛿𝛿 in provinces
with exogenously weaker bank systems because any estimation biases would be invariant across space.

6.6 Additional evidence
We have so far considered the optimal choice of trade regime from the exporter’s point of view. The
three export modes, however, entail different financial terms that the Chinese seller and foreign buyer
must jointly agree on. What regime the Chinese producer pursues thus also depends on the incentives
and financial capacity of his trade partner: The foreign buyer should be willing to bear more of the
financing costs of the transaction if he has access to cheaper capital and if doing so increases the
probability of successful production and delivery.
      The data reveal two patterns consistent with this idea (available on request). Both are difference-
in-differences results that would be difficult to attribute to reverse causality or omitted variable bias,
lending further support to our main conclusions.
      First, we exploit the variation in financial development across export markets as a proxy for the
foreign party’s access to external finance. Superior financial development in the destination makes it
more likely for Chinese exporters to choose processing trade, especially pure assembly, in sectors with
higher working capital needs. The impact of industries’ inventory ratio on both trade shares is doubled
for destinations with private-credit-to-GDP ratio above the median relative to countries below the
median. This aligns with recent theoretical and empirical evidence that the relative cost of capital in the
exporting and importing country affects the choice between cash-in-advance and post-shipment payment
in international transactions (Antràs and Foley 2015, Demir and Javorcik 2014, Hoefele et al. 2013).
      Second, we study the cross-sector variation in the importance of product customization via
relationship-specific investments in production. The extent of relationship specificity can affect firms’
ability to raise external capital and hence choice of trade regime. Financiers can better monitor a


                                                                                                                 30
borrower to alleviate moral hazard if they can more easily ascertain that contractual agreements about
input sourcing and assembly have been observed. 30 Similarly, the higher the outside market value of a
product, the greater the expected return to an investor in case of default, as he could seize and liquidate
assets more profitably. If lenders are less likely to fund Chinese firms in industries with more
relationship-specific investments, credit constraints would be more binding for such firms and their
foreign buyers induced to provide more funding to ensure production. Indeed, interaction analysis
indicates that firms’ financial health (liquidity) and sectors’ financial vulnerability (inventory ratio)
affect the choice of trade regime relatively more in relationship-specific intensive sectors.


7 Conclusion
This paper examines how firms choose to participate in international trade and how this decision affects
performance. We study three export modes that implicitly capture firms’ production technology and
position in the global value chain: ordinary trade, processing trade with imported inputs, and processing
trade via pure assembly. Using matched customs and balance-sheet data for China, we show that
conducting more steps of the supply chain increases value added and profits. However, it requires more
working capital because it entails higher up-front costs. As a result, credit constraints restrict firms to
low value-added stages of production, and preclude them from pursuing more profitable opportunities.
         Our findings highlight a novel mechanism through which liquidity constraints impact firms' export
outcomes and ultimately profitability. They further suggest that financial frictions influence the design
of international trade contracts and the organization of global production across firm and country
boundaries. Strengthening financial markets in developing countries might thus be instrumental in
increasing aggregate value added, profits and income. A promising direction for future research is the
potential for firms and entire economies to grow over time by starting with processing trade restricted
to few assembly tasks and gradually expanding along the value chain into more profitable activities.
         These conclusions shed light on the gains from trade in the context of global production networks
and on the distributional consequences of trade policy in the presence of financial frictions. In particular,
processing trade may allow more credit constrained firms to share in the gains from trade when they
would have otherwise been unable to engage with global markets. More broadly, we provide one of the
first firm-level studies of processing trade and inform current discussions of the effects of global value
chains on optimal trade policy, exchange-rate pass-through, and the transmission of supply and demand
shocks across nations.

     Table 1. Summary Statistics: Firm Performance

This table provides summary statistics for all exporting firms in the
matched sample of firms with ASIF and CCTS data. Productivity is
constructed as value added per worker (VA) or according to Levinsohn-
Petrin (2003) (LP). Firms' financial health is measured by liquidity = (
current assets - current liabilities ) / total assets or leverage = current
liabilities / current assets.

                     Table 3. Trade Regimes and Firm Characteristics

This table examines the relationship between firms' export trade regimes and other characteristics. Each cell
reports the coefficient from regressing the variable in the row heading on the trade share indicated in the
column heading. PA, PI, and OT denote pure assembly, processing with imports, and ordinary trade,
respectively. All regressions include firm size (log employment), province, industry, and ownership fixed
effects (using the main GBT 4-digit industry of each firm). Columns 2 and 4 restrict the sample to pure
exporters with no domestic sales. T-statistics based on robust standard errors reported in parentheses. ***,
**, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level.

This table examines the relationship between firms' export trade regimes and financial health in the cross section. The unit of observation is the firm in Columns 1-6 and the firm-destination in
Columns 7-10. All variables are defined in the text. PA, PI, and OT denote pure assembly, processing with imports, and ordinary trade, respectively. The outcome variable is continuous in columns 1-
8 and equals 1 for all values above 0 in Columns 9-10. Columns 3-10 control for lagged productivity and log employment. Columns 5-10 further control for age and lagged capital-, skill-, and material
intensity. All regressions include province, industry, and ownership fixed effects (using the main GBT 4-digit industry of each firm). T-statistics reported in parentheses based on robust standard
errors in columns 1-6 and clustered by firm in columns 7-10. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level.

This table examines the relationship between firms' export trade regimes and financial health in the panel. The unit of observation is the firm-destination-year in Columns 1-2 and 5-6, the firm-
destination-year-ISIC sector in Columns 3-4 and 7-8, and the firm-destination in Columns 9-10. The sample covers all firms in 2002-2006 in Columns 1-4, only firms with positive exports in year
t but not in the previous two years in Columns 5-8, and only firms exporting MFA-affected products to the US, Canada and/or EU-25 in 2005 but not in the previous two years in Columns 9-10.
All variables are defined in the text. PA, PI, and OT denote pure assembly, processing with imports, and ordinary trade, respectively. The outcome variable equals 1 for all values above 0. All
regressions include firms' age and lagged productivity, size, capital-, and skill intensity, as well as firm, year, and destination fixed effects. Industry fixed effects are included based on the main
GBT-4 digit industry of each firm in Columns 5-6 and 9-10 and on ISIC-3 digit industries in Columns 3-4 and 7-8. T-statistics based on robust standard errors clustered by firm reported in
parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level.

                                                  Table 8. Financial Development across Chinese Provinces

This table examines the relationship between firms' export trade regimes and home-province financial development. All variables are defined in the text. PA, PI, and OT denote
pure assembly, processing with imports, and ordinary trade, respectively. The unit of observation is the firm-destination in Columns 1-4 and the firm-destination-ISIC 3-digit
sector in Columns 5-8. The outcome variable equals 1 for all values above 0. High Fin Devt is a dummy set to 1 for Chinese provinces with financial development above the
median. Columns 1-4 include firms' age and lagged productivity, size, capital-, skill-, and material intensity, as well as ownership, province, and destination fixed effects.
Columns 5-8 include sectors' physical capital (K), human capital (H) and relationship specific (RS) intensity, as well as firm and destination fixed effects. Industry fixed effects
are included based on the main GBT-4 digit industry of each firm in Columns 1-4 and on ISIC-3 digit industries in Columns 7-8. T-statistics based on robust standard errors
clustered by firm reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level.

                   Figure 1. The Distribution of Firms Across Trade Regimes

This figure summarizes the composition of firms' trade activity in 2005. Each segment gives the percentage share
of firms active in a given set of export trade regimes. Firms in the red circle are engaged in ordinary trade (OT); in
the blue circle - in pure assembly (PA); and in the yellow circle - in import and assembly (PI). Firms in overlapping
segments of the three circles export under multiple trade regimes. The percentages reported sum to 100%.

This figure shows how the propensity for firms to pursue different trade regimes varies with firms' financial health
and with sectors' working capital requirements in 2005. In Figure 3A, firms are split into two subsamples with
liquidity above and below the sample median. In Figure 3B, sectors are split into two subsamples with inventory
ratios above and below the median. The left bars (red) report the average share of processing trade in total
exports across firms in a sample. The right bars (yellow) report the average share of pure assembly in
processing trade across firms in a sample.

This table examines the relationship between firms' export trade regimes and financial health in the cross-section. The unit of observation is the firm in Columns 1, 2, 7, the firm-
destination in Columns 3, 4, 8, and the firm-destination-ISIC 3-digit sector in Columns 5, 6, 9. All variables are defined in the text and measured as in Table 4, except that in Columns 1-6
firm size is measured by log sales instead of log employment and material intensity with the ratio of material inputs to total sales instead of the ratio of material inputs to the total wage bill.
PA, PI, and OT denote pure assembly, processing with imports, and ordinary trade, respectively. The outcome variable equals 1 for all values above 0 in Columns 3-6 and 8-9. All
regressions include firms' age and lagged productivity, size, capital-, skill-, and material intensity, as well as province, industry, and ownership fixed effects. Columns 3-6 and 8-9 also
include destination fixed effects. The industry fixed effects are based on the main GBT 4-digit industry of each firm in Columns 1-4 and 7 and on ISIC 3-digit sectors in Columns 5-6 and 9.
T-statistics reported in parentheses, based on robust standard errors in Columns 1-2 and 7 and clustered by firm in Columns 3-6 and 8-9. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%,

           Online Appendix Table 3. Trade Regimes and Sectors' Financial Vulnerability: Robustness

This table examines the relationship between firms' export trade regimes and sectors' financial vulnerability in the cross-section.The unit of
observation is the firm-destination-HS 8-digit product in Columns 1-2, the firm-ISIC 3-digit sector in Columns 3 and 5, and the firm-destination-
ISIC 3-digit sector in Columns 4 and 6. PA, PI, and OT denote pure assembly, processing with imports, and ordinary trade, respectively. The
outcome variable equals 1 for all values above 0. All regressions include sectors' physical capital (K), human capital (H) and relationship
specific (RS) intensity, as well as firm fixed effects. Columns 1-2, 4, and 6 also include destination fixed effects. Columns 3-4 include a sector-
specific imported-input tariff. Columns 5-6 exclude firms with only ordinary imports. T-statistics based on robust standard errors clustered by
firm reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level.

       Online Appendix Table 4. Firms' Financial Health and Multi-Sector Activity

This table examines the relationship between firms' export activity in multiple sectors and financial health in the
cross-section. The unit of observation is the firm. The outcome variable in Column 1 is the number of ISIC 3-digit
sectors in which a firm exports. The outcome variable in Columns 2-5 is the weighted average financial
vulnerability of a firm's exports using its exports by sector as weights and the four sector measures of financial
vulnerability in Table 7. All regressions include firms' lagged productivity and size, as well as province, industry,
and ownership fixed effects. The industry fixed effects are based on the main GBT-4 industry of each firm. T-
statistics basd on robust standard errors reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%,
5%, and 10% level.
