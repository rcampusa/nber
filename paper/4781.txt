       We use Japanese prefectural wage and land price data to estimate the magnitude of

agglomeration effects in manufacturing and finance. We also examine the range of

agglomeration effects by estimating the extent to which they diminish with distance, using a

specification that encompasses the polar cases of purely local agglomeration economies, on the

one hand, and national increasing returns to scale, on the other. We fmd that agglomeration

effects are slightly stronger in financial services than in manufacturing, and that they diminish

substantially with distance in either sector. Our estimates indicate that agglomeration effects can

explain about 5.6 per cent of the growth in Japanese output per worker in manufacturing and

about 8.9 per cent of the growth in output per worker in fmancial services during 1976-1988.

Our estimates imply that, while the average elasticity of productivity with respect to

agglomeration is between 10 and 15 per cent, agglomeration economies in the largest prefectures

are nearly exhausted.

1. Introduction



    A number of explanations of edonomic growth focus on increasing returns

to scale external to the firm as a source of increased productivity.1

External effects also play a central role in the        literature   on urban location,

where they provide an explanation for the existence of cities.2 Indeed, Lucas

(1988) notes the similarity of his explanation of economic growth and

explanations for cities:



      1t seems to we that the 'force' we need to postulate for the central

     role of cities in economic life is of exactly the same character as the

     'external human capital I have postulated as a force to account for

     certain features of aggregative development. If so, then land rents

     should provide an indirect measure of this force,...(p. 39).




     The two   literatures   differ in two   basic   respects, however. For one

thing, the growth literature has assumed externalities at the aggregate level.

while the urban literature treats externalities as local. Second, most models

of growth have not incorporated a productive role for land; all factors of

production except labor are reproducible. Hence there is no natural limit to

the supply of complementary factors available to an individual worker.

However, not surprisingly, land plays a central role in the urban literature.-

The competition among factors for scarce land in an


 1See, for example, Arrow (1962), Romer (1986), and Lucas (1988).
 2Exsmples of models that focus on externalities at the urban level are Mills
 (1967), Arnott (1979), Helpman and Pines (1980), and Henderson (1988).
 Henderson (1987) surveys this literature.

 urban location provides a centrifugal force to offset centripetal

 agglomeration effects. Congestion effects explain the existence of multiple

 cities and economic activity in nonurban locations. If agglomeration effects

 are never offset by competition for scarce land then activity should converge

 to a single point that would become a 'black hole' of economic activity.

Presumably the limitations on economic activity implied by finite natural

resources act as a constraint on economic growth as well.

     Data on urban activity over time and across countries indicate a
                                                                             strong

correlation between economic growth and urbanization. This relationship

suggests that the benefits of proximity increasingly outweigh the costs of

congestion as economies develop.'

     The relationship between urbanization and growth has been attributed to

various interrelated factors.' One      is   local scale economies, both internal
and external to the firm,   in   industrial activity (as modeled, for instance, by

Henderson (1988)). Another explanation is that the increased specialization

of labor and differentiation of coodities associated with development make

trade at a central location more desirable (as suggested, for example, by

Diamond's (1982) models of search). The first argument       explains   urbanization

and city size by the development of particular industries. Sassen (1991), for

example, relates the most recent growth of New York, London, and Tokyo       to the
growth   of international finance.' The second suggests that urbanization is



'Kuznets (1966, pp. 272.273) found that the per cent of the population living
in urban locations grew substantially between the beginning and the middle of
the twentieth century in all of a sample of twelve now industrialized
countries. Chenery and Syrquin (1975), applying pooled time-series
cross-sectional regression analysis to international data, found that the
population of a typical country became more than 50 per cent urban once its
per capita income exceeded $500 (in 1964 US $), and tapered off at 75 per cent
once per capita CNP exceeded $2000.
'Jacobs (1969, 1984) is, of course, the basic reference.
'Boone (1989) finds that higher land prices in Japanese prefectures are

likely to be associated with agglomerations of more specialized, and more

educated, individuals (as suggested by Glacier stat. (1991)).

       The lack of comprehensive, uniform data on land rents or prices across

time and     space   has impeded seriousinvestigation of the extent and range of
agglomeration effects on       productivity. An exception to this absence of data
is Japan, where the Economic Planning Agency of the Government of Japan has
reported commercial and residential property values by prefecture since the
early l9lOs. Given the enormous rsnge in the intensity of land use across the
46 prefectures of the Japanese archipelago, these data provide an excellent
source of information on agglomeration effects. Our purpose here is to
exploit these data to measure the intensity and scope of the effects of
agglomeration on productivity.
     We proceed as follows. In Section 2 we develop a model of industry
production     with positive production externalities among firms:        More

production     by one firm raises productivity in firms nearby. The effect

diminishes across space. The model encompasses the two polar cases that have

received the most attention:

       In one, agglomeration effects are completely local, with possible

positive     spillovers between firms within a region but not across regions. The
urban   economics literature has devoted the most attention to this case.

Ciccone and Hall (1993) have recently estimated the extent of spillovers of

this   type with 12.5.     county   and   state data, finding an elasticity with respect

to   density of .04. A maintained assumption is that spiltovers are purely
local.
        In   the other polar case, spillover effects are nationwide, with distance

imposing no impediment. The international trade and macroeconomics literature



associated with greater production of financial services.
                                              -4-

has    focused on externalities of this type.'          Caballero   and Lyons C1992)

 recently estimated the external economies in U.S.           manufacturing   as a whole at

about 20 to 30 per cent.T

        In Section   3 we   describe how we   use the   model to infer the magnitude   and
geographical      reach of external economies from Japanese prefectural data on
land prices, wages, outputs, and regional characteristics. We use annual data
for the period 1976 through 1988. Because of spectacular growth in the output
of    financial services in Japan during this period, and the attention given to
it by Sassen (1991) and Boone (1989), we estimate            the extent and range of

agglomeration      effects in manufacturing and financial services separately.
        Section   4 analyses   our results. We find elasticities of productivity
with    respect to local activity between 10 and 15 per cent in manufacturing and

between 12 and 20 per cent in finance. Our estimates of the elasticities with

respect to nationwide activity are about 2 to S per cent higher in each case.

For both sectors we find that the impact of agglomeration on productivity

diminishes   substantially     with   distance. Activity 10 kilometers away has half
or    less the impact of activity in the mnediate vicinity. The estimated

effect of agglomeration on productivity is within two per cent of the

theoretical maximum implied by our specification for the largest prefectures,

but   only about three-fourths of the theoretical maximum in prefectures with
the smallest agglomeration effects. Agglomeration influences the comparative
advantage of prefectures a. financial and manufacturing centers, and we
discuss how this comparative advantage has shifted over time. Our estimates
imply   that increased agglomeration can explain about 5.6 per cent of the


'Helpman (1984) surveys models of international trade with positive production
externalities.

'We focus on economies of agglomeration across space rather than over time.
Henderson (1994) has recently estimated the extent of temporal rather than
spatial decay of agglomeration effects.

growth of output per worker in manufacturing and about 8.9 per cent of the

growth   of output per worker in finance during the period that we examine.
      section 5 discusses some implications of our results.


2. A Model of Prefectural Production and      Land      Rents


      We first discuss the theoretical framework that we use to estimate the

extent and range of agglomeration affects in manufacturing and finance. As is

standard in much of the literature on externalities, we treat technology      at
the   plant level as linear homogeneous in the plant's inputs, but allow

productivity at the plant level to depend on the general level of activity at

nearby plants in that industry in the region. specifically, we measure the

agglomeration economies provided by prefecture p in industry I with the index:



                                       46     Y
                                  '
                                Ai —t
                                      j—l (l+6idj)
                                                  i.1
                                                        2'                   (1)



where        is a measure of the overall activity of industry i in prefecture j,

and d is the distance between prefecture p and prefecture j. At one

extreme, if S —   • then   agglomeration economies are purely local in nature:

Increased activity in neighboring prefectures creates no externalities. At

the other extreme ifS —0 then increased activity in this industry anywhere.

in the country increases productivity in prefecture p to the sane extent:

External economies are then nationwide.'

        We introduce agglomeration effects into the production function as


"Cravity models of international trade employ a similar specification to
estimate trade intensity between countries: Intensity increases with the
product of the trading partners' incomes but diminishes with the distance
between them. Deardorff (1984) discusses the model and its origins.
follows: Output Yfip of plant f in industry I producing in prefecture p. as a

function of its inputs kfip of capital, 1fi of labor, and tfip of land, and

prefectural agglomeration in that industry,             is:




                         — e                                                     (2)




where:


                         ci(k.l.t) —   k           1     t    .                  (3)


Here       captures the extent of external economies in industry i and
                                                                              Li'
and 1•8Li'Ti are factor shares for that industry. The function                contains

time and prefectural characteristics c that affect productivity as arguments.

The    ten        is a lognormally distributed error.
       We adapt this functional form for the     contribution     of external economies
from Henderson (1987). This specification implies that the elasticity of
productivity with respect to total economic activity is large at low levels              of

activity     and diminishes with increased economic    activity as the contribution

of   agglomeration reaches its theoretical maximua of one.' The specification
differs, for example, from what i.     implied   by the Dixit-Stiglitz (1977) model
of product differentiation, which has been applied to urban analysis by Fujita
(1988). two simple aicroeconomic models that yield this specification are the
following:



'If production is Cobb-Douglas and all     factors except land are mobile then the
elasticity of production with respect to urban activity must diminish for
cities of finite size to emerge. If external effects have a constant
elasticity that is lower than the land share then activity will spread out
evenly across space, while if the elasticity exceeds the land share it will
collapse to a single point. See Henderson's (1987) discussion.

Product Di.! I stan elation:




       One model captures the same Smithian notion that productivity increases

with th. division of labor among plants as the Dixit-Stiglitz (1977)

framework. Specifically, say that the output y1 of plant I is a function of

the number of plants N in its industry from which it buys inputs to produce

its own output. In particular, let:




                               Yf   Le           'k 1 t
                                            'i' I' I' f



If the minimum efficient plant size in the industry is 1i' then the number of

plants in a prefecture will be proportional to industry output. Say that the

output of a plant used as an input elsewhere is tradable at zero cost over a

radius r. Also assume that it is so expensive to trade the output over a

larger radius that it is not worth using elsewhere, If r has distribution

1-l/(l+Er)2, then the probability that that a plant will buy from another

plant a distance r awayis l/(l+&r)2. Together these assumptions imply the

specification that we use here.




Karki C   Its! orma tion


       Another   motivation for this specification is the superior knowledge about

market conditions provided by greater levels of economic activity. Say, for

example, that consumers desire a characteristic of a product •t     at   time t,   and

that       evolves continuously according to the random walk process:




                                         dot —   cdt
                                              -8-

where z is     a standard   normal Wiener process. Consumers value a                     commodity

 embodying characteristic S as equivalent to                              of a product embodying

characteristic 9*• Hence producers of a product with characteristic S will

have to price it at a discount of • •
                                              -   •   2
                                                          .     Plants   can embody any value of I

in their products at equal cost.

       Producers form their beliefs about S by observing the price at which

products of different qualities are sold. The most recent observation

provides the best estimate of the current value of I, and will predict the

current value with variance c2t, where t            is        the time that has lapsed since

that transaction.

       Suppose that the frequency of transactions in a prefecture is

proportional to economic activity in the industry there, with a share

1/(l+Sr)2 of transactions observed in a prefecture a distance r away. Under

these assumptions, finn in prefecture p will have a forecast error that is

proportional to l/ZY/(l+Ed)2.             The average value of their products will
fall as this forecast error rises according to the specification in equation

(2).




3. Data and Estimation



       Our   task   is to estimate the parameters #.and & from Japanese prefectural

data. We do so not by estimating the production function in equation (2), but

by estimating the corresponding cost function. Cost minimization by firms

implies that prefectural external economies and prefectural production

amenities should exactly offset differences in factor costs across

prefectures.        Our procedure   is to relate prefectural factor cost to external

economies    and prefectural amenities in order to estimate 4                 and   6.
                                         -9-



     We use data for the period 1976-198B.'° Hence we have a panel with 598

observations (46 prefectures over 13 years). All data are in 1980 real yen't.



flctoral D.coszpoaitlon



     We estimate the parameters       and S for manufacturing   and for financial
services separately. Of the remaining sectors listed in Table 1, we remove

agriculture and mining from the analysis. Both contribute negligibly to

output and employment, and we regard the determination of their location.as

largely   independent   of the agglomeration and congestion effects that we

address here.''

     Of the remaining sectors, we treat (1) manufacturing and (2) finance and

insurance as producing output that is primarily tradable among prefectures,

and subject to the external economies modeled in Section 3. We treat the

remaining 6 sectors as producing outputs that are nontradable, selling either

to businesses or to households within the prefecture. We assume that these

sectors produce at constant returns to scale at both the, plant and industry

levels, so are not themselves subject to external economies.




'°Prior to 1915 the sectoral decomposition of prefectural value added was not
consistent with the decomposition of the prefectural labor force.
ttWe obtained annual prefectural consumer price indices from various issues of
the Japan Statistical Yearbook.
'21n 1988 agricultural production was 2.7 per cent and mining was 0.3 per cent
of Japanese GDP. Japanese tax policy treats agricultural land that was in
agricultural use before 1950 very favorably relative to other land.
Agricultural land ii taxed at a lower rate than the standard tax and at 1.4
per cent of its assessed value. In most cases, agricultural land is exempt
from inheritance taxes. We treat conversion of agricultural land to other
uses as exogenous (determined, for example, by government policies) rather as
the outcome of market forces. (Nevertheless, the anticipation that policies
that protect agricultural land might be removed could have a significant
effect on nonagricultural land prices, in particular, tending to depress them
in prefectures where agricultural land is more plentiful.)

Local raceor Cost



     We trBat capital as completely mobile across prefectures, so that plants

everywhere face the same cost of capital. Time effects thus pick         up the
effect   of variations in the cost of capital over tine. Hence only differences

in wages and land rents create variation in local fActor costs across

prefectures. In order to obtain estimates of the cost of production by

prefecture for manufacturing   and   financial   services,   then, we need to measure

wage and land rents by prefecture, and their local (direct and indirect)

shares in production.




     Wages



     Wages by industry and prefecture for the two traded and six nontraded

sectors are calculated as the average labor cost per worker.15



     Land Rents



     The user cost of land is the rent, but we could only obtain comprehensive

data on land prices.'4 Denoting the rent during period t as Rt. the price of

land in period t   as     and the nominal opportunity    cost of capital as r. the

magnitudes are   related by:


13We obtained the average labor cost per worker in each prefecture from the
Annual R.port on Pr.f.ctural Accounts. The number of workers in each sector
by prefecture is taken from the Japan Statistical Yearbook.
14We obtain annual prefectural land prices by dividing private land values by
the private usable land area of the prefecture. We take private prefectural
land values from the Economic Planning Agency's Annual Report on the National
Accounts. Prefectural usable land areas are from the Japan Statistical
Yearbook.

infer the expected land rent by estimating the equation:




                          ln(rt_t4t) — PtDt+PrDpr+Upt                        (El)

Dpr that indicates the prefecturets region, p is the coefficient on the time

dummy   DtI and        is the error.1' We use the forecast from this equation as

our measure of local factor cost. We estimate this equation simultaneously

with our estimation of the cost functions in manufacturing and in financial

services.



       Factor shares



       We weight land and labor costs by their direct and indirect shares in

production for each sector, using the 1980 national input-output matrix." We

partition thi, matrix between its two     traded   and six nontraded components as:




t5We   obtained this measure by estimating the total return on equity (dividends
plus   capital gain) as a first order autoregressive moving average process. We
then   used the one-period-ahead forecast as the expected return on capital.
Data   on the total return on equity are from Hamao and Ibbotson (1989).

ten regions: Hokkaido, Tohoku, Hokuriku, ICanto (other than greater Tokyo),

in production for each sector is taken from national accounts data on wage

payments by sector. Data on the reproducible capital stock by sector are

multiplied by the long-ten real interest rate to provide an estimate of the

share of reproducible capital." We treat the residual as the land share.



Industry Activity



    We employ two different measures of industry activity. One is simply

industry   value added in the prefecture. The other is the density of industry
value added1 or value added per unit         of    usable land.1' Which measure is more

appropriate depends upon the nature of agglomeration effects within and
between prefectures. One     possibility is that transportation and
communications    costs within a prefecture are very low relative to those

between   prefectures. This would                             if individual
                                      be the case, for example,

prefectural    boundaries tend to correspond to geographical barriers1 such as
mountain    ranges and rivers, or if transportation and communications systems

were much thicker within prefectures than between them.          In   this case total

prefectural value added would provide the better measure of prefectural

activity. Another possibility is that prefectural boundaries have little

bearing on the range of agglomeration effects, in which case the density of

activity in the prefecture captures economies of agglomeration better than the

total level.

     In fact, as we discuss below, the two       measures   yield similar estimates of

the scale of external economies. The total value added measure provides

somewhat better explanatory power and allows us to identify the role of

distance much more precisely.



Prefectural Amenities



     To   capture other features that might affect productivity, we include the
number of   ports (PORTS) and   Shinkansen (bullet train) stations in the
prefecture.'°    Only the number of ports was significant, and results with the

number of Shinkansen stations are not reported.



     Hence for the two    sectors   i—K,? we estimated the equation:

Newspapers (1991).

jointly with equation (El) to determine Pt.Pd•WoPwtPwd•#ti,            and g.   We   also

estimated   the equations without the regional dummies in the          cost equation.

       A potential source of simultaneity bias is that unobserved prefecture
characteristics that enhance productivity in the prefecture may simultaneously
raise   value added in that and in nearby prefectures and raise the cost of

labor and land in that prefecture. To correct for possible simultaneity bias

we also estimated equations (El) and (El) using instrumental variables for the

term   Air. Instruments were the amount of          land in the prefecture designated

as capable of development", average temperature, and the average number of

days of sunshine per year.2' Our          instrumental   variables appear to have better

explanatory power for manufacturing than for finance, and for total value

added than for density. Since manufacturing is the larger sector for all of

the prefectures we consider, there is also more reason to think that

simultaneity bias is greater in this sector. For these reasons we place more

weight on the instrumented (IV) equations in the case of manufacturing and on

the uninstrumented (non-IV) equations in the case of finance, although we

report all sets of results.

       We estimated all specifications with the Full-Information

Maximum-Likelihood Technique in TSP. Because of the very nonlinear nature of

the estimation, we estimated    each system of equations for given values of S
between 0   and 1. We report the estimate that laxinized the log likelihood

function.    The reported standard errors for other coefficients, calculated by

21Data on average temperature and on the average number of days of sunshine
are from Asahi newspapers (1991).
                                             -15-



the   Berndt-Mall-Hall-Hausman method, are thus conditional on the indicated
value of S being the true value.
      When density serves as the        industry  scale variable, the likelthood
function    as   a function of    S is very flat. The value of S that maximized    the

log likelihood was consequently very unstable, and sensitive to the use of

instrumental variables. The implied national agglomeration effects at the

national    level are similar to those we      obtain when we use the level, of

activity. For these          reasons our discussion focuses mostly on the results in
which   total    value added rather than its density serves as the measure of
prefectural      activity.



4. Results



      Appendix A reports the basic estimation results. We discuss four aspects

in turn:     (1) the effect of distance, or the range of agglomeration effects,

(2) the elasticity of productivity with respect to agglomeration at the local

and national levels, (3) the magnitude of agglomeration effects across

prefectures and industries, and (4) the contribution of increased

agglomeration to productivity growth both to individual prefectures and

nationally.



Dista,ic.




      Table 3 reports, in its third column, the coefficient S on distance in

the agglomeration term for the various cases. A value of zero implies that

agglomeration effects are nationwide, corresponding to aggregate external

economies of scale, while an infinite value means that agglomeration effects
                                     -16-



are purely local. Except for the case of finance with IV correction, the

estimated distance coefficient I is 0.06 or 0.07 for both manufacturing and

finance. The coefficient on distance in finance with IV correction is .03.

     Table 4 reports the implication., of these estimates for the gradient of

the agglomeration effect. Infact, the range of estimates of & imply a quite

similar, and fairly steep, gradient. Moving activity a kilometer away from a

location reduces its contribution to productivity at that location by between

81 and 94 per cent of its impact in the immediate vicinity, while moving it

away 10 kilometers reduces its impact to between 39 and 57 per cent. Moving

activity 100 kilometer. away dilutes it. impact to only 2 to 6 per cent of its

local impact.22

     We conclude, then, that agglomeration effects are substantially local in

character. Nevertheless, this range of estimates leaves room for substantial

productivity spillovers across prefectures, as we now discuss.



Pr.f.ctural and National Agglomeration Elasticities



     Since the magnitude of the parameter # depends on units in which value

added is measured, we find it more instructive to report the elasticity of the

effect of activity on productivity implied by our estimates of # and S. Our

specification implies that this elasticity decline, as the overall measure of

nearby activity increases, however, so that the effect can vary substantially

from prefecture to prefecture. Hence we calculate the elasticities implied tji

our estimates for each prefecture at the average value of the agglomeration



22When density rather than the level of vilue added served as the activity
indicator, our estimate of & was very sensitive to IV correction. Without
correction the estimate was very high, implying virtually no spillovers beyond
the immediate vicinity, while with the correction the implied spillovers were
national.

variable during the period of estimation, table 5 reports the calculated

elasticities prefecture by prefecture. Note that they vary widely, and are

substantially lower in large prefectures. Table 3 reports the simple average

of the prefectural elasticities.

       We report elasticities of two types. One we call the local elasticity,

which is the percentage increase in productivity at a location resulting from

a one per cent increase in activity at that location holding        activity
elsewher, constant.    We also calculate the national elasticity for each

prefecture, which    is the percentage effect on productivity in that prefecture
of    a one per cent increase in activity in     all prefectures.
       The presence of regional dties in the cost equations tends to reduce

the size of the elasticities by between 3 to 8 per cent. This reduction is
not surprising since the 10 regional d*ies eliminate the contribution of
cross-regional variability to the estimation.
     Instrumental variables correction reduces the estimated elasticities for
finance when total value added measures activity, and for both industries when
density measures    activity. This direction is expected since unobserved

prefectural characteristics that raise productivity in a prefecture will also

raise factor cost in the prefecture. Surprisingly, IV correction actually

raises the estimated elasticities slightly in manufacturing when total value

added measures activity.

       Without IV correction, both the local and      national elasticities in
finance    exceed those in manufacturing by 3 to 8 percentage points. Since

instrumental    variables   correction reduces the estimated elasticities for

finance    considerably, and slightly raises those for manufacturing,
instrumental variable, correction reverses the ordering between the two
industries. Since finance       is a smaller share of prefectural CD? than is
                                         -18-



 manufacturing for all prefecture., there is less scope for simultaneity bias

 in finance. Moreover, our instruments explain manufacturing CDP more

 successfully than they explain financial CDP. For this reason we concentrate

more on the IV corrected equations in manufacturing and     the   uncorrected

equations in finance.

       The elasticities   indicate that externalities for both industries are
largely   local, With total value added    measuring activity,   estimates of local

elasticities range from' 9 to 20 per cent, with the national elasticity a
quarter to half as much higher.
     It is useful to compare our results on the regional scope of
externalities with Caballero and Lyons' (1992) finding about their      sectoral

scope.    Their study finds that,                           external effects
                                    within U.S. manufacturing,

are   small within sectors but substantial across manufacturing as a whole. In
contrast, we find strong externalities within regions but less between them.
Together, our results suggest that location rather than specialization is a
much greater source of external effects,


The Exhaustion of Agglomeration Externalities



      Table   6 reports the contribution of total agglomeration economies in each

industry in each prefecture, i.e. the value of ten exP(#/A         ) where Ai is
givenin equation 1, at the beginning and at the end of the sanple. We report

these for the case in which regional dummies are included in (U), using the

IV-corrected measure of manufacturing activity and the non-IV corrected

measure of financial activity.

      The agglomeration measure exp(.o/Ai ) has a theoretical maximum of 1.

Note that the measure for some prefectures is within one or two percentage
                                           -19-


points of this maximum,     indicating   that the potential for agglomeration
economies   ii nearly   exhausted.
     For manufacturing. Tokyo and Aichi      (Nagoya) prefectures report the

largest agglomeration externalities in 1990, both above .99. At the other

extreme, Aomori prefecture     in northern Honshu   and Nagasaki prefecture     in
Kyushu have the lowest     manufacturing externalities   in   1990,   at about 75   and   77

per cent of   the theoretical maximum, respectively. These figures imply that

the low level   of manufacturing in and    around   this second pair of prefectures
lowered   productivity there to little over three-fourths of what it is in the

first pair.

     In finance, the largest agglomeration effects appear again for Tokyo now

followed by Kanagawa (Yokohama). Miyazaki prefecture in Kyushu,            and then

Akin prefecture   in Northern Honshu, report the lowest level of agglomeration

externalities.
     Relative agglomeration effects also contribute to the comparative

advantage of prefectures between manufacturing and finance. In Chiba and

Hokkaido, for example, the contribution of agglomeration to productivity is

about the same in manufacturing and finance, but in prefectures like Aichi and

Shiga, the contribution of agglomeration to productivity is about 3 per cent

higher in manufacturing than it is in finance.

     Moreover, the contribution of agglomeration economies to comparative

advantage has shifted over time. Over the entire period externalities in

finance have grown by about three per cent in ICanagawa and only by one per

cent in manufacturing. In Aomori prefecture, however, manufacturing

externalities grew by about 9 per cent inmanufacturing, but only by about 5

per cent in finance.

     Our functional form forces the contribution of aggloeration to
                                              -20-



productivity to diminish with the agglomeration parameter A. To test whether

or not a diminishing agglomeration effect is implied by the data, we estimated

the model using the following variant of the production function (2):




                  'fip —
                           cAiP)(0l+0zl1ip)cickfijfi,tfi)i(c,t)Uit.                  (2')



This specification allows the agglomeration elasticity either to increase

(02
      > 0)   or    to decrease (02 < 0),   and encompasses   the special case of a
constant     elasticity     of productivity with   respect to agglomeration (02 —    0)
assumed, for example, by Ciccone and Hall (1993). For most values of 6, we
obtained significantly positive estimates of              and significantly negative

estimates of 02. For all values of $ that we considered, the estimated

coefficients imply an average agglomeration elasticity for Japan as a whole

similar to what we report here, and negative agglomeration elasticities for

the largest prefectures.



Agglomeration and Growth



      Table 6 also reports the growth in the agglomeration measure during the

semple period for each prefecture. The CDP-weighted national average growth

in the manufacturing agglomeration measure is .17 per cent while the growth in

the finance agglomeration measure is .26 per cent. These measures compare

with an overall growth in output per worker of 3.0 per cent in manufacturing --

and 2.9 per cent in finance. Hence, agglomeration effects can account for a

small but nontrivial part of overall growth in per capita output in these

sectors.

5. Conclusion


      This paper has used data on land prices and wages in the Japanese
prefectures to infer the extent and      range   of agglomeration economic. in
manufacturing and infinancial services. The main implications are that:             (1)
while the extent of agglomeration economies in both sectors ii        significant

(with   agglomeration elasticities of around 10 per cent or more), they are

fairly localized geographically. (2) ass conclusively we find agglomeration

economies to be larger in finance than in manufacturing. (3) Agglomeration

economies appear to be nearly exhausted in the prefectures       where they are most

pronounced.     (4)   The lowest observed measures of agglomeration economies imply

productivity levels that are about three-quarters of the highest observed

agglomeration economies. The exploitation of agglomeration economies can

explain about 5.6 per cent of the labor productivity growth in manufacturing

and 8.9 per cent of labor productivity growth in finance during the period of

our sample.

      These results suggest an explanation for the increase4 concentration of

land prices in Japan      based on the growth of the financial service sector, If
financial     services tend to occupy localities with larger land areas, either

because of historical accident or because agglomeration effects are more

pronounced in these sectors, then an increase in the relative price of these

services in terms of manufactures will act to increase relative land prices in

larger areas. Of the ten regions in Table Al1 the Greater Tokyo region has

the   largest area of land that could b. used for building purposes,      followed by

the   Kinki   area,2'   As a consequence of higher land prices in these areas, and

2Other regions such as Hokkaido and Holcuriku have higher total land areas,
but most of this land is mountainous, forested, or agricultural and hence not
available for private development. Within the Tokyo region, even the
                                         -22-


of higher   wages that workers must   therefore   be paid to compensate thea for the

higher   cost   of living in these areas, manufacturing activity will shift toward

smaller areas. The net effect on total prefectural output may be relatively

small.




individual prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa, and Tokyo have more usable land
area than any others except Hokkaido and Aichi.

All specifications were estimated by the Full-Information Maximua-Likelihood
routine in TSP. Reported equations are for the value of distance deflator
delta that maximizes the log likelihood function. Standard errors are
calculated by the Berndt-Rall-Hall-Hausman method, and are conditional on the
reported estimate of delta being the true value.
