                  The Behavior of U.S. Deficits


                              ABSTRACT




    The tax—smoothing theory suggests that deficits would respond particu-

larly to recession, temporarily high government spending, and anticipated

inflation. My empirical estimates indicate that a relation of this type is

reasonably stable in the U.S. since at least 1920. In particular, the sta-

tistical evidence does 'not support the idea that there has been a shift toward

a fiscal policy that generates either more real public debt on average or

that generates larger deficits in response to recessions. Further, the def?—

cits for 1982—83 and projections for 1984 are consistent with the previous

structure. The high values of these deficits reflect the customary response

to substantial recession (interacting with big government) and to expected

inflation.

    Much recent attention has focused on the large values of actual and

projected federal deficits. In order to evaluate this discussion we have

to know whether these deficits represent a shift in the structure of the

government's fiscal policy, or just the usual reaction to other influences,

such as recession, inflation and government spending. A related, but

broader, question is whether the process that generates deficits in the

post—World War II period differs systematically from that in place earlier——

say, during the interwar period of 1920—40. For example, has there been

a change in the average deficit or in the magnitude of the countercyclical

response of deficits?

     I begin by describing the tax—smoothing theory of deficits that I

developed earlier. Then I estimate this model on U.S. data since 1920.

Basically, the results are consistent with an unchanged structure of deficits

since that time. Specifically, the recent deficits and the near—term pro-

jections of deficits reflect mainly the usual responses to recession and,

it turns out, to anticipated inflation.



The Tax—Smoothing Model of Deficits

     I analyze the determination of deficits within the framework of the

tax—smoothing model that I developed in an earlier paper (Barro, 1979))

In this approach the government faces the exogenous, deterministic stream

of real expenditures, other than interest payments, as given by g(t)

The base of real taxable income is the deterministic amount y(t) , which
                                                                                            2




generally depends on the path of tax rates. I think of y(t) as a fixed

fraction of the economy's real GNP for period t .             Let   -r(t)   be the average

tax rate at date t , so that the amount of real income—tax revenue is

t(t)y(t) .          Then, if the real interest rate is the constant r and the

initial real public debt is b(O) , the government's budget constraint

in terms of present values is2



                        Ir(t)y(t)etdt =     1g(t)ertdt    + b(O)



         In the present formulation I do not separate out the revenue from money

creation from the government's other revenues. Rather, I think of infla-

tionary finance as a tax on the holdings of money. Then, in order to focus

on taxes in one period versus those in another, I combine the inflation tax

with the variety of other levies (on income, sales, property, etc.) that

apply at the same date. In particular, there seems to be no reason to give

special treatment to the inflation tax.3

         Suppose that the allocative effects from taxation depend on the "average

marginal tax rate," Tm() ,          for   each period. That is, the time path          of
                                               m
average marginal tax rates,
                                     in
                                    -r (1) , -r (2) ,   ... , influences    people s

incentives to work, produce and consume in the various periods. Here I

take a Ramsey—like, optimal—taxation perspective in order to formulate a

testable positive theory of the government's choices of tax rates over time.4

In particular, if each period is similar In terms of elasticities of labor

supply, etc., then the Ramsey formulation dictates roughly equal tax rates,

Tin(t)    ,   for   each period.5 More generally, this approach would allow the tax

rate to depend on time—varying features of the economy, such as war-or peace,
                                                                                         3




boom or recession, and so on. But, in order to bring out the main implica-

tions of the approach, I assume to begin with that the government plans

for equal average marginal tax rates, Tm() ,                in   each period. Then I

examine later some perturbations from this path of uniform taxation.

       I assume that the average marginal tax rate for any period bears a

stable relation to that period's average tax rate, t(t) ——that is,



                                        =   f[t(t)]                                      (2)




where the function f is invariant over time. In this case, the stabiliza-

tion of average marginal tax rates entails stabilization of average tax

rates. If r denotes the constant value of the average tax rate, then the

government's intertemporal budget constraint in equation (1) implies that

this tax rate is



                      =                                                                   (3)
                          ((g(t)ertdt       + b(O)]/ y(t)e_tdt            .




       Suppose that real government spending, g(t) , and the real tax base,

y(t) ,   are fluctuating around trend values that grow at the common rate n
That is, the time paths, g*(t) =        g*(O)ent and y*(t) =            y*(O)et     have the

                 values as the respective adtual time paths, g(t) and y(t)                    •6
same   present
Then the current "normal"     values,       g*(O) and y*(O) ,         satisfy   the conditions,



                                                      -rt
                           g*(O) =            g(t)e         dt
                                     (r—n)                                                   (4)
                           y*(O) =            y(t)e_ttdt
                                     (r—n)
                                                                                           4




Dropping the time subscripts and substituting back into equation (3) yields

the formula for the (stabilized) average tax rate,



                                =   [g* +        (r_n)b]Iy*                                (5)




Hence, the tax rate equals the ratio of normal real spending to normal real

income, where normal real spending includes the real interest payments on

the outstanding public debt, rb ,                less   the amount financed by the usual

growth of the real debt, nb ,           I       discuss this last item further below.

     The current deficit—which I think of as the change in the real quantity

of interest-bearing public debt, db/dt —is given at any date by



            db/dt=g+rb_tyg+rby(g*+(rn)b]/y*


After rearranging terms, this expression becomes



              db/dt   (1        y/y*)(g* + (r—n)b] + g              g* + nb   •            (6)


   The first term on the right side of equation (6) indicates that the real debt

rises when output is below "normal"——that is, when y/y < 1.                   Effectively, tax

revenues fall in proportion to the fall in output (in order for the average

tax rate not to change). Hence, the amount of revenue lost is the proportional

shortfall of output, (1 —       y/y*)       ,    multiplied   by the normal amount of real

government spending (and revenues), g* + (r—n)b. Note that, when tax rates

are stabilized over tIme, the coefficient of the cyclical variable,

(ly/y*)[g* + (r—n)bl ,     is   unity in equation (6). Alternatively, If the
                                                                          5



government were to set relatively low tax rates during recessions, then

it would have to engineer a more dramatic countercyclical response of

deficits. In this case, the coefficient of the cyclical variable would

be greater than one. In any case, the present analysis does not distinguish

the automatic cyclical response of tax revenues under a given tax law

(which people sometimes try to filter out in the construction of a "full—

employment deficit") from that effected through "discretionary" fiscal

policy. For example, under a proportional income tax, average tax rates

tend automatically to be stabilized over the business cycle, while under a

graduated—rate setup, the average tax rate tends to be below normal during

recessions and vice versa for booms. Thus, a well designed tax system may

make it unnecessary to change the tax laws frequently in order to achieve

the desired cyclical pattern of tax rates. If the analysis included adjustment

costs for altering the tax laws, then it would be possible to study the

optimal design of these laws. But, for the present analysis, I assume that

some combination of automatic response within the tax system plus discretionary

changes in the laws achieves the desired behavior of deficits.

     The second term on the right side of equation (6), g_g* ,   indicates
that the real debt rises by the amount of temporarily high real government

spending. Thereby, the government avoids abnormally high tax rates during

periods when its expenditures are unusually high. Empirically, my measure

of temporary spending focuses on the unusually high levels of military

spending during wartime. Thus, the unitary coefficient on the (g_g*)

variable inequation (6) reflects the government's desire to equalize tax rates

during wartime and peacetime periods. Alternatively, if tax rates were above

normal during wars, then the coefficient on the (g_g*) variable would be less

than one.
                                                                                                                  6




       Finally, other things equal, the last term in equation (6) says that

the real debt grows at the rate n , which is the trend growth rate of the

economy. If the debt did not grow along with the economy, then interest

payments would fall over time relative to GNP, which would be inconsistent

with stabilizing the average tax rate.

       Note that the present formulation deals with the conventional con-

cept of the funded real public debt, b .                           Sometimes people suggest adding

the implicit debt that corresponds to the anticipated present value of social

the pertinent variable for the government's decisions on taxes is g*

(plus the amount,             (r—n)b) ,      which is the anticipated flow of normal

real spending.            Aside from differences in the degree of uncertainty

attached to various categories of expenditures, it is clear that future social

security benefits play no special role——rather, they enter the analysis in

a manner analogous to future defense spending, etc. However, the debt could

be redefined if desired to include either the present value of social security

benefits or of other expenditures, This change in definition would not alter

the central economic problem, which concerns the government's choice of tax

rates at different dates. But, different concepts of deficits would surely

behave in different manners.

        Suppose, for example, that people expect a bulge in social security

benefits to occur 5 years from now and to last for 10 years. On this count,

current spending g is below the normal flow g* , which calls for a surplus

(db/dt <      0)    in equation (6). That is, the government raises taxescurrently

in order to prepare for the eventual bulge in spending. However, if the debt

included the present value of social security benefits, then the rise over

time in this present value (as the bulge in spending approaches) would
                                                                                7




offset the surplus in the funded debt. That is, the broader concept of

public debt——which included social security——would not tend to decline over

time. But, no matter how one defines the debt, the important point is that

the prediction for tax rates is identical. Namely, the expectation of a

bulge in future spending calls for a rise in current tax rates. (Unfortunately,

I have not yet isolated empirically this type of effect for prospective

government spending, whether for social security or for other types of

spending.)

     Dividing through in equation (6) by the level of real debt, b ,        the
results can be written in terms of the proportionate growth rate of the

real debt:



             (l/b)db/dt =   (1 — y/y*)(g*/b + r—n) + (g_g*)/b + n                 (7)




Empirically, the term r—n is small relative to g*/b .         (That   is, norma].

real spending g* is large relative to real interest payments, rb ,          less
the growth term, nb .) Hence, I neglect the term, r—n ,       in    the subsequent

analysis. Then it is appropriate to measure g* as the normal amount of

real government expenditures exclusive of interest payments.

     When the time paths g(t) and y(t) are uncertain, the values g* and

y* are also uncertain. I interpret these magnitudes in equation (7) as

corresponding to anticipated present values of real government spending and

GNP, assuming a known value of the real interest rate r . Possibly, some

further results could be obtained by modeling explicitly the uncertainty for

future government spending and private endowments.7
                                                                           8




     The main point is that new information about the long—run values of

spending, g* , and income, y* , lead to corresponding changes in the average

tax rate, I   , as   shown in equation (5). Thus, the tax rate adjusts for sur-

prise changes in spending and income, but the sign or magnitude of the

necessary adjustments cannot be predicted in advance. In other words, the

tax rate follows a Martingale. However, some predictable changes in tax

rates may appear if——as mentioned before——the tax rate depends on the state

of the economy. For example, if tax rates were lower than normal during

recessions, then predictable increases in tax rates would occur along with

the (predictable) ends of recessions, Similarly, if tax rates were higher

than normal during wars, then predictable declines in tax rates would show

up at the (predictable) ends of wars. Thus, the Martingale property for

tax rates is not central to the approach followed in this paper.8

     Another property of the theory is that it prescribes no target value

for the level of public debt or for the ratio of debt to income. A higher

initial value of debt is "undesirable" in the sense that it requires a

higher tax rate at each date (equation (5)), which then entails a larger

excess burden from taxation. But (with default ruled out), it is not worth-

while for the government systematically to run surpluses in order to pay

off the debt.9 Such a policy implies temporarily high tax rates, which

violates the tax—smoothing criterion. Thus, given the right—side variables

in equation (7), there is no independent effect on the growth rate of debt

from the starting value of the debt—income ratio. (This conclusion would still

follow even if the government varied the tax rate with the business cycle or

ith conditions of war and peace.)
                                                                                              9




       The above argument   is    consistent with the marked tendency of the

 ratio of public debt to GNP to fall during peacetime, non—recession years.

 (See Barro, 1984, Chapter 15, for the long—term evidence on this behavior

 from the U.S. and the U.K.) The variable g* incorporates a country's

propensity to experience infrequent but possibly large wars. Therefore,

temporary spending, g —      g*      ,    is   negative rather than zero during the typical

peacetime year. Hence, the debt—income ratio tends to fall during peace-

time, and to rise sharply during the infrequent large wars.

       If the price level follows a known path, then equation (7) describes

the time path of the real debt. Hence, the nominal debt——denoted by B——grows

at the rate of inflation, r ,            plus    the amount shown on the right side of

equation (7). That is (neglecting the term, r—n ,                     in     equation (7)),



                (1/B)dB/dt = n   +       ir + (1 —    y/)(g*/b)   +   (g —    g*)/b   .       (8)


Note   that   the inflation rate, 71, has a one—to—one effect on the growth rate

of the nominal debt.

       A one—time surprise jump in the price level would shift the real debt,

b ,   by a discrete amount in the opposite direction. Then, except for the

shift in b on the right side of equation (8), there would be no alteration

to the subsequent path of growth rates of the debt——in particular, there is

no tendency to adjust the nominal debt in order to compensate for the unex-

pected inflation (and thereby to restore some target value of the real debt).

It follows in equation (8) that the variable r should be replaced by the

expected rate of inflation, ¶e •                (In   the presence of indexed public

debt, the actual rate of inflation would be appropriate.)
                                                                             10




Th. main point is that the planned growth rate of the real debt,

(l/B)(dBldt) —       , depends on the real variables (other than ii   that
appear on the right side of equation (8). Hence, the government's deficit

policy is specified in real terms, rather than being subject to some form

of money illusion.

      Given the expected real interest rate r , a higher value of anticipated

inflation shows up as a higher nominal interest rate. Hence, the previous

result says that the government finances the (expected) inflation part of

its nominal interest payments by issuing new nominal debt, rather than by

levying taxes. Although this interpretation is suggestive, it turns out

that the results do not depend on a one—to—one relation between expected

inflation and nominal interest rates. Any discrepancy here appears as a

different value for the expected real interest rate. But a different level

for the real interest rate does not affect the growth rate of the debt in

equation (8) (assuming a given real growth rate, n , and neglecting the

effect from the r — n      term in equation (7)). A permanently higher real

interest rate induces a once—and—for—all adjustment of the tax rate (equation

(5)), but no response of the deficit. On the other hand, if the expected

real interest were temporarily high or low, then the deficit would adjust

accordingly. Thus far, I have not investigated this possibility empirically.
  •


      When the debt is long term there are also changes in the real market

value from changes in long—term nominal interest rates. A one—time jump in

the nominal interest rate shifts the current market value of the debt

by a discrete amount in the opposite direction. For example, Butkiewicz (1983)

shows that the market value of the debt (Bm) can be well approximated

empirically from the par value (Br) by using the formula,
                                                                         11




                          Bm B(l + hc)/(l +   hR)       ,                (9)


where c is the average coupon rate on the outstanding bonds, R is the

overall market yield, and h is the average maturity of the bonds. For

given values of c and h , the effect of a change in market yield on the

market value of debt is approximately



                          dBm/Bm —dR.h/(l + hR)     .                    (10)


     Equations (7) and (8) describe the paths of the market value of the real

and nominal debt, respectively, subsequent to the initial discrete shift in

market value at the moment of the one—time shift in yield. In particular,

this discrete shift affects subsequent growth rates of the debt only through

the change in b on the right side of the equations (and by any change in

expected inflation that accompanies the shift in the long—term nominal

interest rate). As with a surprise change in the price level, there is no

tendency to return to a normal real market value of the debt. But, in order

to explain the overall movements in the market value of the debt, it is necessary

to include an additional variable——such as that shown in equation (l0)——in

order to measure the effect of surprise changes in interest rates. In

practice, I assume that all changes in the yield on government bonds, R ,     are

unanticipated.
     When considering the public debt, most researchers deal with the par

value, rather than the market value. (However, some reliable estimates of

market value are now available for the post—World War II period, as discussed

below.) A surprise jump in nominal interest rates has no immediate effect

on the debt when measured at par value. But, as the old debt matures, the
                                                                                12




government effectively replaces it   with   new debt, which bears say a higher

coupon. (I assume that all debt is issued at par.) Thus, if nothing else

changes, the government would face a rising path of real interest payments—--

that is, current real payments would be low relative to the average of anti-

cipated future real paymit.s. As with any path of rising real expenditures,

the government's policy of tax-smoothing requires a rise in the current

tax rate, which means a smaller current deficit. In other words, a surprise

increase in nominal interest rates leads to a gradual reduction over time in

the real debt when measured at par value. In fact, if there are no further

surprises in interest rates (and the debt has finite maturity), then the

real par value gradually approaches the real market value, which fell in a

discrete fashion at the moment of the one—time shift in interest rates.

    Using equation (9), the effect on the par value of the debt from a change

in the average coupon rate is



                          dB/B —dch/(l + hc)             .                      (11)


Suppose that the retirement of old debt means that the coupon rate, c

approaches the market yield, R ,    gradually,   with the speed of adjustment

depending inversely on the average maturity, h——that is,



                            dc/dt     (l/h)(R —   c)


Then, using equation (11), the effect on the par value of the debt is



                      (1/B)dB/dt       —(R—c)/(l +     he)   .                  (12)
                                                                                               13



I   add the    right—side      variable (unsuccessfully) to some of the equations

that I estimate below.                  (I have data on R , c     and h only for the period

since 1946.)



Setup of the Empirical Analysis

       The equation that I estimate with annual U.S. data over sub—samples

of the period 1920—82 takes the form,



         1o(BIB1) =                     + a1rre +            + a3GVAR + a4RVAR + u ,           (13)
                                   a0               a2YVAR



where u is an error term with the usual properties and the other variables

are as follows:

       B: end—of—calendar year (par or market) value of the U.S. government's

              interest—bearing public debt, exclusive of holdings at federal

              agencies and trust funds or the Federal Reserve. Market—value

              figures are based on Seater (1981) and Butkiewicz (1983).

              expected rate of inflation (for the CP110), generated as a fore—

              casting relation based on the following: two annual lags of inflation,

           t—l and t—2' two annual lags of monetary growth (based on annual

              averages of Ml),                  and           and the interest rate on 4—6

           month conunercial paper at the end of the previous year, RCt1

              That is, the equation for inflation is



              =
                  b0 + b171t   1   + b21r 2 + b3 1•'t—l      + b4i2   + b5RC   1
                                                                                   + error term. (14)




          This        equation     for inflation is estimated jointly with the debt equation

              (13).
                                                                              14




     The behavior of inflation in the post—World War II period differs

markedly from that before the war. First, there is positive persistence

in inflation rates from year to year, which is not true earlier; second,

lagged monetary growth is a positive predictor of inflation, which also

does not apply earlier; and third, the variance of the inflation rate——

conditioned on information from the previous year——is much smaller now

than before. Some experimentation indicated that the main break in the

structure of the inflation equation occurred around the Korean War——possibly

with the accords between the Fed and the Treasury, which relieved the Fed

from strict stabilization of interest rates. In any event, I estimate

separate coefficients of the inflation equation (14) for the period up to

1953 and for the recent period, 1954—82. (It turns out that, in order to

maximize the overall value of the likelihood function, it would be slightly

preferable to break the sample at 1955/56. But I have retained the break at

1953/54, which has some rationale a priori.) Note that in equation (13)

the hypothesized coefficient of the e variable is a1 = 1

     Returning to the specification of variables in equation (13),

              GVARt
where        is a geometric average of the year—end values, B and Bt_l

divided by the GNP deflator for year

        I base the measure of temporary real federal spending, g —   g   ,   on

the variable that I used previously (Barro, 198lb) to explain fluctuations

in real GNP. In that approach I isolated mainly the temporary parts of military

spending that accompanied wars. Shifts in the ratio of federal non—defense

expenditures to GNP and shifts during peacetime in the ratio of military

spending to GNP were treated as predominantly permanent (in the sense that
                                                                                              15




the ratios followed random walks). Sahasakul (1983) finds additional com-

ponents of temporary real federal spending from the following: 1) a drift

since the 1930s in the ratio of federal transfers to GNP, 2) the tendency

since the 1930s of real federal transfers to move countercyclically, and

3) the tendency of wars to crowd out the non—military components of federal

spending. However, these influences do not introduce variables that are

independent of those that I include anyway in the equation to explain the

growth rate of debt. Mainly, there are implications for the interpretations

of coefficients——for example, the variable GVAR will measure the impact of

temporary wartime spending net of the typical transitory decline in the other

components of real federal spending during wartime. Recall that the tax—

smoothing model predicts that the coefficient of GVAItt                   in   equation (13) is

a3 = 1   •   But the crowding—out of other federal spending during wars implies

a3 < 1   •   In   addition, if tax rates are somewhat above normal during wartime,

then the coefficient a3 would be reduced further below one.

     For the cyclical variable YVAR in equation (13), I need a measure of the

temporary shortfall of output, (1—Y/Y) .                    In   my previous study (Barro,

1979), I used the deviation of current real GNP, which measured y ,                        from

trend real GNP, which measured y •13 I again report results with this con—

struct, although it deals incorrectly with permanent shifts to the level of

output. In these cases the variable indicates a permanent departure of

output from normal. The results improve if I use instead the unemployment

rate,        ,    to   proxy for the shortfall in output,        (1 —
                                                                        y/y    .   As long as the

unemployment rate is stationary in levels, this variable will work satisfact-

orily even when there are permanent shifts to the level of output.
                                                                               16




     My main results use the     total   unemployment rate (including the military

in the labor force14). Then I assume a stable relation between percentage

shortfalls in output and the departure of the unemployment rate from a fixed

natural rate:



                          (1 —            =      — .054)                       (15)




I take the natural unemployment rate in this formulation to be 5.4%, which

is the median rate over the sample .1890—1982. (The value 5.4% is also

close to the median and mean over the period 1948—82). For the post—World

War II period (for which data are available), I obtain similar results if

I use instead the prime—age male unemployment rate, U .          Some people argue

that this variable is more stable over long periods than the overall unemploy-

ment rate. Note that in equation (15) the parameter A is an Okun's Law

type coefficient, which is likely to lie between 2 and 3.

     As a general statement it would be preferable to construct normal output,

y* , as an explicit time—series representation for "permanent income." (My

measure for     —
                    g   does take this approach, although only for military

spending.) But I have thus far been unsuccessful along these lines in the

construction of the variable y*

     The variable YVAR depends also on normal real federal spending, g

I use here Sahasakul's (1983) concept of normal real federal spending, which

combines normal military spending (which entered above into the construction

of the GVAR variable) with measures of normal real federal spending for

transfers and non—defense purchases. In this context the results are relatively

insensitive to the precise measure of g , as long as the variable picks up

the longer term movements in the size of the federal government. But, when
                                                                                    17



making comparisons over long periods, it is important to recall that the

growth rate of the debt in equation (13) depends on the YVAR variable, which

equals the percentage shortfall in output, (1 —              , multiplied   by the

ratio, g*/b .      For example, in 1982 this last variable is .83, while in

1933 it is .17. Hence——because of the high value of normal real federal

spending in recent years—a one percentage point shortfall in output has

5 times as much effect on the growth rate of debt as it would have in 1933

(where the percentage shortfall in output was much larger).'5

     The tax—smoothing model suggests that the coefficient of YVARt in equa-

tion (13) would be a2      1 .   However, the countercyclical behavior of trans-
fers and any tendency to lower tax rates during recessions lead to         a2 >     i
When the unemployment rate proxies for the shortfall in output (equation (15)),

the estimated coefficient on 7AR is also multiplied by the Okun's Law

coefficient, A

     The variable RVARt in equation (13) accounts for the effects of change

in interest rates. With the debt measured at par value, the interest—rate

variable (available since 1946) is RVARt =          — c)/(l +       ,   whetE   R

is the yield, h is average maturity, c is the average coupon rate, and

overbars signify averages over the year. When the debt is measured at

market value (available accurately since 1941), the interest—rate variable

is RVAR =          —             + hR) .   In

coefficient in equation (13) is a4 = —l

Empirical Results

     Table 1 shows joint, maximum—likelihood estimates for the debt equation

(13) and the inflation equation (14). For the debt equations in this table,

the RVAR variable is omitted and the YVAR variable is based on the overall

unemployment rate. The first six sets of results refer to the sample, 1920—40,

48—82, which excludes the years associated with World War II. The inflation

equations report separate coefficients for the two sub—periods, 1920—40, 48—53,

And 1954—82. Also, the observations in the inflation equation for the first

sub—period, 1920—40, 48—53,     are weighted by .40 in order to correct for

heteroscedasticity (that is, for a higher error variance in the earlier

sample).

     For set 1 in Table 1, the coefficients of the inflation equation in the

earlier sub—period are insignificant except for               effects of the

lagged interest rate (coefficient of —1.2, s.e.        0.2) and of the second

lag of monetary growth (—.29, s.e,        .09). The first effect probably

reflects the tendency for (real) interest rates to be high during financial

crises, which were also times of deflation. The second effect picks up the

tendency for reversals in monetary growth under the earlier monetary regime.

By contrast, for the later sub—period 1954—82, the coefficients of the first

lags of inflation and monetary growth are each strongly positive (.81, s.e             .18;

and .67, s.e.      .15, respectively). Surprisingly, the coefficient of the

nominal interest rate is still negative (—.37, s.e. =       .14).   The results

for the inflation equation remain basically similar in the specifications

discussed later.

     Expected inflation,       ,   is   calculated from the coefficients in the

inflation equation. In set 1 of Table 1, the coefficient of              in the

debt equation is constrained to equal one, while in set 2 this coefficient

 is left free. Note that the unconstrained estimate for this coefficient is

 .97, s.e. =   .12,   which is consistent with the theoretical value of unity.

Therefore, I focus on the constrained results, which appear in set 1.

     The estimated coefficient of GVAR (.27, s.e. =       .09)    is significantly

positive, but well below the value of unity that is suggested by the tax—

smoothing model. The results in Sahasakul (1983) indicate that a small

part of this discrepancy reflects the crowding—out of other components of

federal spending during wartime. But the main element is the tendency

for average tax rates to be above normal during wars. I discuss these results

further when the observations for World War II are included.

     The estimated coefficient of YVAR (3.88, s.e. =       .26)   is positive and

highly significant, which shows the strong countercyclical behavior of

deficits. Dividing by an Okun's Law coefficient of 2—1/2 (see equation 15))

suggests that the reaction of debt growth to shortfalls in output involves

a coefficient of about 1—1/2. The excess of this coefficient above one

reflects the tendency during recessions for average tax rates to be below

normal and for real federal transfers to be above normal (see Sahasakul,

1983, for a detailed breakdown between these two elements). To see the

quantitative effect of unemployment on the deficit, recall that the pertinent

variable is           =     — .054)-(g/)    ,   which has an estimated coefficient

of 3.9. In 1982 the variable gt*Ib equals .83, which means that a one

percentage point increase in the unemployment rate raises the estimated

growth of the debt by 3.9(0.83) = 3.2 percentage points per year. For a

debt level of $850 billion (December 1982), the corresponding increase in

the deficit is by 3.2%850 = $27 billion.
                                                                              21




     The standard—error--of—estimate for the debt equation is a    = .023

(that is,     2.3   percentage points per year). This result corresponds to

an R2 of .91, although the maximization of      R2 is not the criterion for

the estimation.       The Durbin—Watson Statistic of 2.2 suggests that serial

correlation of residuals is not a problem.

     The results in sets (3)—(6) of Table 1 check whether the debt equation

is stable over various sub—periods. Sets 3 and 4 allow the coefficients

for 1920—40 to differ from those for 1948—82. Sets 5 and 6 specify the

first sub—period as 1920—40, 48—53, and the second as 1954—82. Also, sets

3 and 5 constrain the coefficient of the 1e variable to unity, while sets

4 and 6 relax this constraint. In all cases the hypothesis of stable coeffi-

cients over the two sub—periods is accepted at conventional significance

levels by likelihood—ratio tests. For example, for set 3 (where the samples

are 1920—40 and 1948—82, and where the coefficient of     e is fixed at one),

the value of —21og(likelihood ratio) is 3.2, which is below the 5%

critical value for the x2 distribution with 3 degrees of freedom of 7.8.

For set 4 (where the e coefficients are unrestricted), the test statistic

is 8.2, with a 5% critical value with 4 degrees of frdom of 9.5. The results

are basically similar in sets 5 and 6, where the break in the sample is at

1953/54.

     These findings are important, since they indicate that the process for

generating deficits in the interwar period, 1920—40 (or the period, 1920—40,

1948—5 3) is broadly similar to that in the post—World War II period, 1948—82

(or 1954—82). In particular, the statistical evidence does not support the

idea that there has been a shift toward a fiscal policy that generates more real

public debt on average or that generates larger deficits in response to

recessions.     (In set 3 of Table 1, the estimated coefficients of the YVAR
                                                                                22



variable are 3.48, s.e. = .45 for 1920—40; and 4.54, s.e. = .45 for 1948—82.

However, even this pattern of higher point estimates in the later period

reverses later when I consider an alternative measure of the YVAR variable.)

       Sets 7 and 8 of Table 1 deal with the full sample, 1920—82, which adds

the years associated with World War II, 1941—47, to the previous sample.16

Aside from the deterioration in fit——as measured by the standard—error—of—

estimate,        ——the most striking change is the increase in the coefficient of

cits   during World War II. The estimated coefficient is now .76, s.e.          .05,

which is highly significant and closer to the hypothesized value of unity. But

it is also clear that the present formulation does not satisfactorily include the

observations from World War II into the specification that works satisfactorily

for the other years. One of the problems is that the estimated inflation

eqaution (using the coefficients from the earlier sub—period, 1920—40, 1948—53——

see n. 16 above) generaces implausibly low values of anticipated inflation

during World War II. Specifically, these values are close to zero through-

out the period 1941—45. The specification has to be changed to allow the

earlier monetary regime to generate high values of monetary growth and

inflation during wartime. (similar problems arise when I attempt to add the

observations from World War I, 1917—19.) It is also clear that the measure

of temporary wartime spending, GVAR, is subject to substantial measurement

error during the major wars, which accounts for some of the increase in the

standard—error—of—estimate. This problem can probably be handled by estimating

the GVAR variable (as I did in Barro, 1981b) jointly with the debt and inflation

equations.

respectively) are similar to those for the longer sample (with World War II

excluded), as shown in sets 1 and 2 of Table 1.    Sets 11 and 12 of Table 2

change the YVAR variable to use the prime—age male unemployment rate,

   — .041   ,   where .041 is the mean value of m over the period 1954—82.

Although the fit of the equation for debt growth in sets 11 and 12 is slightly

worse than that in sets 9 and 10, the general nature of the results is similar.

     Sets 13 and 14 of Table 2 use the estimated market value of the public

debt, rather than the par value, in the construction of the dependent vari-

able. The equation for debt growth now includes an interest—rate variable,

RVARt, which picks up the effect on the market value of debt from changes in

interest rates. For set 13 (where the coefficient of ,1e is fixed at one),

the estimated coefficient of RVAR is —.83, s.e. =     .13,   which differs insigni-

ficantly from the hypothesized value of —1. The other results are broadly

similar to those found in sets 9 and 10, which are based on the par value of

public debt.

     In sets 15—18 of Table 2 I attempt to find an effect from changes in

interest rates on the growth in debt when measured at par value.       (The

variable RVARt is now based on the difference between the yield and the coupon

rate——see the notes to Table 2.) Although the hypothesized coefficient of

RVARt is —1, the estimated values in sets 15 and 16 are positive, but with

very high standard errors. Since the RVARt variable may be proxying for

within—period revisions of expected inflation, I used instead the lagged

value, RVARi, in sets 17 and 18. The estimated coefficients do decrease——

for example, to —.13, s.e.      .60, in set 17. These results are consistent

with the theoretical value of —1, although the estimates are very imprecise.
                                                                                24




     Table 3, which refers to the sample, 1920—40, 1948—82, uses output

relative to trend rather than the unemployment rate in the construction

of the cyclical variable, YVAR. The fits for the debt equation are sub-

stantially worse than those achieved with the unemployment rate——compare,

for example, sets 19 and 20 in Table 3 with sets 1 and 2 in Table 1. It

turns out that the main differences arise in the post—World War II sample,

especially during the 1974—76 recession. In any event the results based on

output relative to trend are still consistent with an unchanged structure

of the debt equation over either the sub—periods, 1920—40 and 1948—82 (sets

21 and 22 of Table 3) or 1920—40, 48—53 and 1954—82 (sets 23 and 24).

     One advantage of the results in Table 3 is that the estimated coeffi-

cient of the YVAR variable reveals directly the effect on debt growth from

shortfalls in output. For example, in set 19, the estimated coefficient

is 1.35, s.e.   .13. This estimate is significantly above the value of

unity that comes from the tax—smoothing model, although some of this excess

reflects the countercyclical behavior of federal transfers. (Sets 21—24 show

that the point estimates of the YVAR coefficients from the earlier sub—periods

exceed those from the later sub—periods, which reverses the pattern found

before with the unemployment rate. However, these differences across sub—

periods are statistically insignificant.)

debt, DB , and the inflation rate,          ,   over   the sample 1920—40, 1948—82.

The estimated values come from the regressions shown in set 1 of Table 1

Notes to Tables 1—3

     For the debt equation, the dependent variable, DBt , is the growth rate
from end—December to end—December of the privately—held, interest—bearing
public debt. The figures are par value except for sets 13—14, which use
market values. For the inflation equation, the dependent variable,
is the growth rate (January to January) of the CPI (measured without the
shelter component since 1947).

     The inflation equation (in sets 1—8 and 19—24) allows for separate coeffi-
cients for the sub—period up to 1953 and for the later sub—period, 1954—82.
The earlier observations are weighted by .40 (the maximum likelihood estimate
from set 1) to correct for heteroscedasticity. In sets 7—8, which include
World War II, the observations for 1943—47 are deleted from the inflation
equation.

     For the debt equation, there are separate coefficients over two sub—
periods in the cases indicated (Sets 3—6 and 21—24). Otherwise, a single set
of coefficients applies for the full sample. In any event, the variance of
the error tenu is assumed to be constant for the full sample.

      E is the log of the value of the likelihood function. The independent
variable ye   is calculated as a forecast of     from the coefficients of the
inflation equation. The value I indicates that the coefficient of this variable
is constrained to unity, The variable GVAR, based on temporary military
spending, is discussed in the text.

     The cyclical variable YVAR, described in the text, is based on the overall unem-
ployment rate, Ut—.054, for sets 1—10 and 13—18. Sets 11 and 12 use the prime—age
male unemployment rate, Um — .041. Sets 19—24 use real CNP relative to trend.

     In sets 13—14 of Table 2 (which use the market value of debt), the variable
RVARt = ht(Rt   R..i)/(1 + lrR)  ,
                                     where R is the average yield on government
debt and h is the average maturity. Overbars indicate_estimates of averages
over the year. For sets 15—16 the variable is RVARt  (Rt —   )'(1 + t C)
where c is the average coupon rate on government debt. Sets 17—18 use the
lagged value of this last measure of RVAR.

     a is the standard—error—of—estimate. D.W. (shown below )     is   the Durbin—
Watson statistic.

     In the inflation equation, ir.1 and        are lagged values of the
dependent variable, t—l and Ut..2 are lagged values of monetary growth
(based on annual averages of Ml), and RCt..l is the value from the previous
December of the 4—6 month rate on commercial paper.

                                                                                27




values of the explanatory variables, CVAR and YVAR (based on the overall

unemployment rate), as well as the ratio, g*/b , which enters into the

construction of the YVAR variable.

       Note first the negative values of DB and           (i.e., "surpluses")

throughout the 1920s. These derive first, from negative values of anticipated

inflation, especially for 1921—22; second, from the economic boom (negative

values of the cyclical variable, YVAR) for most of 1923—29; and third, from

relatively low values of the GVAR variable. From 1931—40 the values of debt

growth are all positive (i.e., "deficits"). This behavior reflects the

countercyclical response of deficits to the Depression (that is, to the

positive values of the cyclical variable, YVAR, particularly for 1931—35).

There are large increases in real federal spending during the New Deal

period after 1932, but not in the wartime spending that is the basis for my

measure of temporary spending, GVAR. Therefore, higher federal spending

is not a major element in my estimates of debt growth during the 1930s.

(The variable GVAR equals (g —    g*)/,   which is negative but declining in

magnitude during the 1930s because of the substantial rise in the real debt,

b.) However, the higher real spending on non—defense items——which I implicitly

treat as permanent——would account for the 1arg increases in tax rates that

occurred under Hoover and Roosevelt from 1932—36. (See Barro and Sahasakul,

1983, for further discussion.) In any event, the actual debt growth, DB
                                                    'St
is   reasonably in line with the esthnated values, DB ,   throughout   the 1930s.

       I have already mentioned that the dramatic increases in public debt

during World War II derive primarily from the hi values of temporary federal

spending, as reflected ii the GVAR variable. In fact, the average growth

rate of the nominal debt from the end of 1940 until the end of 1945 is 34%

per year. (From the ewi of 1916 until the end of 1919 it is over 100% per year.)
                                                                              28




However, since my detailed results for the periods of the world wars are pre-

sently unsatisfactory, I cannot say much more about these episodes.

        For the post—World War II period, note first that neither the actual

noT estimated values of debt growth are very high during the Korean War,

say 1951—53. The values of GVAR are high, but those for the cyclical variable,

YVAR, are low. Also, the calculated values of expected inflation,

are relatively low at this time. The response of deficits to recessions

shows up, for example, in 1949, 1954, 1958 and 1961. The Kennedy—Johnson

tax cuts for 1964—65 do not correspond to notable residuals in the equation

for debt growth.

        For the Vietnam War——say 1966—68—the positive residuals for debt

growth support the common view that taxes were raised insufficiently at this

time.     But,   perhaps because of the surcharge on the income tax, a substantial

negative residual does show up for 1969.

        Since 1969, expected inflation has become an important influence on

the deficit, as measured by the growth in the nominal debt. In particular,

the values of        e (which have a one—to—one effect on the estimates of debt

growth,
           A
           DB) are between 4 and 6% for 1969—73, increase to 9% for 1974—75,

fall to between 6 and 8% for 1976—79, reach 10% in 1980, and then decline

to 6% for 1981—82.

        The debt equation underpredicts the deficits during the recession years,

1975—76. (However, the error is much greater if the YVAR variable is based

on real GNP relative to trend rather than the unemployment rate.) But

the debt quation is basically on track for the 1980—82 recession. For 1982,

the actual growth rate of the nominal debt is 20% (corresponding to an increase

by $155 billion in the nominal, privately—held, interest—bearing debt),

while the estimated value is 19%. This estimate breaks down into
                                                                                            29




6 percentage points due to anticipated inflation (rt = 6%                ,   although
    = 4%) and 13 percentage points due to the recession (YVAR = .034                    ,


based on the unemployment rate of 9.5%). Because nothing special is going

on with the constructed measure of temporary federal spending, GVAR, it

turns   out    that the constant and the contribution from the GVAR           variable
essentially cancel out.

        I also use the estimated equation to forecast deficits for 1983 and

1984. The inflation equation implies the value                   = 4.8% for 1983.       (The

actual value of the inflation rate for 1983 is around 3.5%.) The main element

in the decline of inflationary expectations from 1982 to 1983 is the low

actual rate of inflation,          = 4.1%   ,   for   1982. Using       the actual

unemployment rate of 95% for 1983, the resulting estimate for debt growth,
A
DB ,     for   1983 is 16.6%. Note that 4.8 percentage points of this total

come from expected inflation, while 11.8 percentage points derive from the

continuing effect of the recession. (The combined effect of the constant

and the GVAR variable is near zero..) The projected value for debt growth

implies that the level of debt would increase from $848 billion at the end

of December 1982 to $1,001 billion at the end of December 1983. Thus, the

predicted nominal deficit—in the sense of the change in the privately—held,

interest—bearing public debt——for calendar 1983 is $153 billion. (In order

to get closer to conventional measures of the deficit, one should add the

increase in high—powered money, which is roughly $15 billion for calendar

1983.) The data that I have at this writing (kindly supplied to me by Eric

}janushek) indicate that the actual value of privately—held public debt at

the end of December 1983 is around $1,018 billion. This figure implies

an actual growth rate of the debt, DB ,               of   18.3% for 1983, as compared to
                                                                                 30




my projected value of 16.6%. The gap of .017 between actual and estimated

values is not out of line w-ith the fitted equation, for which the standard—

error—of—estimate was   =   .023.     The actual deficit——in the sense of the

change in the nominal, privately—held debt for calendar 1983 is about $170

billion, as compared to my forecast of $153 billion.

     For 1984, the value of           turns out to be 6.6%. The main reason for

the rise from 1983 (where           = 4.8%) is the increase in the annual

average rate of monetary growth from 6.3% in 1982 to 10.3% in 1983. Assuming

an unemployment rate of 7.8% for 1984 (see, for example, Litterman, 1984),

the projected value of debt growth, DB ,        for   1984 turns out to be 13.37..

This forecast breaks up into 6.6 percentage points from expected inflation

and 6.7 percentage points from the cyclical variable, YVAR. The forecast

implies that the level of debt would rise from about $1,018 billion at the

end of 1983 to $1,163 billion at the end of 1984, or by $145 billion during

calendar 1984. (Again, one should add about $15 billion for the creation of

high—powered money to get closer to the standard concept of the nominal

deficit.) This forecast seems to be roughly in line with other near—term

projections of deficits. It also turns out that my forecasts for 1983—84

are basically similar if I use either the equation where the YVAR variable

is based on output relative to trend (Table 3, set 19), or the one based

on the pr-ime—age male unemployment rate (Table 2, set 11).

     The main point is that the actual behavior of public debt through

1983——as well as popular forecasts for 1984——are reasonably well in line

with the experience of debt issue since at least the end of World War I. The

main things that are out of line with the previous structure are projections

of longer—term deficits on the order of $300 billion, conditioned on relatively

low values of the unemployment rate and expected inflation. Since there is
                                                                                  31




nothing yet in the data to suggest this type of structural break, I view

these forecasts of deficits as amounting to predictions that either taxes will

be increased or spending decreased. Standard projections of deficits should

not be regarded as forecasts, once the endogeneity of taxes and spending

is taken into account.

     For recent years, where the effects of the constant term ad the GVAR

variable turn out to cancel, the forecasts of debt growth——and hence deficits——

The values for g*Ib       until   1982 appear in Table 5, while the values for

1983 and 1984 are .75 and (roughly) .71, respectively. Using the value .71

in the expression above, the forecasting equation becomes

Equation (16) provides a close approximation to the previously mentioned

forecasts of debt growth for 1983—84. The equation would also apply satis-

factorily to projections further out, subject to the absence of major changes

in the ratio of normal federal spending to the debt,            .   (Recall   that

this ratio rose by a factor of 5 from 1933 to 1982.17) Notably, equation (16)
                                                                    e
implies that the planned growth rate of the real debt, DBt —            , would
approach zero if the unemployment rate were to decline to about 5—1/2%. It

implies further that the projected growth rate of the nominal debt, DBt__

which determines the conventional nominal deficit (aside from changes in

high—powered money)——would approach zero if, in addition, the expected rate
                                                                        32




of inflation were to approach zero. The point is that there is nothing in

the experience of actual deficits through 1963 that conflicts in any major

way with these projections.

     1Some related work is Kydland and Prescott (1980) and Lucas and Stokey

(1983). The general idea of the implications of tax—smoothing for the behavior

of deficits appears also in Pigou (1928, Ch. VI).




     2This formulation assumes that the real interest rate exceeds the economy's

steady—state growth rate. For a discussion, see McCalluxn (1984).




     3.nticipated inflation amounts to a form of excise tax. But, unanti-

cipated inflation entails a capital levy, which has different implications

for the excess burden of taxation (see, for example, Barro 1983). However,

changes in other kinds of taxes can also imply capital levies.




     4For dlscussion9 of Ramsey taxation, see Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980,

Chapter 12) and Ramsey (1927).




     5Kydland and Prescott (1980, pp. 185—86) suggest that this rule will

be close to optimal if intertemporal substitutions effects are strong.




     6These assumptions rule out any drift in the ratio, gly.           In   the long

run this drift would be subject to the bounds,      0 <   g/y   <   1




      7See Lucas and Stokey (1983) for a treatment of uncertainty.
                                                                            35




         a previous study (Barro, 1981a), I accepted the random—walk hypo-

thesis for average tax rates, although the statistical tests were not very

powerful. Subsequently, I have rejected the random—walk hypothesis for

some revised systems. Sahasakul (1983) finds evidence that average marginal

tax rates are lower than normal during recessions and higher than normal

during wars.




     91f an increase in the debt—income ratio raises the required real

interest rate payable on public debt (perhaps because of an increasing

probability of the government's default), then there would be a force that

deters the government from amassing very high debt—income ratios.




    10These inflation rates are January—to—.January values, using the CPI

less shelter since 1947. For 1943—47, the data are strongly affected by

price controls. Instead of using the reported price levels, I substituted

values based on the extrapolation of an estimated price—level equation from

some previous research (Barro, 198lc, p. 157). This adjustment shifts the

inflation rates as follows: from 2.9% to 25.8% for 1943, from 2.3% to

13.0% for 1944, from 2.2% to 3.2% for 1945, from 16.7% to —4.8% for 1946,

and from 10.2% to —2.9% for 1947. This procedure affects the subsequent

results mainly for the samples that include the World War II years.   (There

are also some effects of lagged inflation rates on the estimates for 1948—49.)




    Theoretica1ly, the annual average of        would matter, which means

that some updating of expectations for current—period information comes into
                                                                               36




play. The   present    procedure excludes current—period information (and

thereby avoids some econometric problems). I used the commercial paper rate,

rather than say a 1—year Treasury Bill rate, in order to have a consistent

variable for the full sample. The difference between a 4—6 month maturity

and a 1—year maturity would not be of major significance for the results.

      The forms

an approximation for discrete—time data to the continuous—time formulation

in equation (8). The approximation seems to be satisfactory except for the

very large values of          — g)Ib    that arise at the start of World War I.




    13For trend real GNP, the growth rate was 3.4% per year since 1946 and

before 1914. From 1915—45, the two trend lines were connected, implying an

average growth rate of 2,5% per year.




    14 also adjust the values from 1933—43 as suggested by Darby (1976)

to include New Deal workers as employed.




    15The ratio of the real deficit to real GNP, (db/dt)Iy , depends on

         This last variable is .21 in 1982 and .06 in 1933.




    16Because of the problems with price controls (n. 10 above), I exclude

the years 1943—47 from the inflation equation. The values of            for these

years are those implied by the estimated coefficients for the earlier sub—

period, 1920—40, 1948—53.

         one plugs in the 1933 unemployment rate of 27% into equation (16),

then (with      = 6%) the projected growth rate of debt is a remarkable 67%.

The actual growth rate of debt for 1933 was only 16%, which I attribute pri-

marily to the smaller size of the federal government, as measured by the

ratio, g*/b .    My assessment is that, if the U.S. encounters a much more

serious recession than that in 1982, then (with no change in structure) we

will observe numbers for deficits that dwarf those experienced recently.

The main element that generates high real deficits is the interaction between

recession (high unemployment) and big government.
