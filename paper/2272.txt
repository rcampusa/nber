                    Housing Finance Imperfections and Private Saving:
                 A Comparative Simulation Analysis of the U.S. and Japan


                                        ABSTRACT
         This paper presents a life—cycle simulation                analysis of the
  interaction       among savings decisions, housing purchase             decisions, and
  the tax system in the United States and Japan.                 To investigate this
  issue, we first document the stylized fact that the typical Japanese
  household purchases a house later in the life—cycle with a higher
  downpayment ratio than its U.S. counterpart. Second,                     a life—cycle
  simulation model that includes the housing                 purchase decision is
  constructed       and used to compare the behavior of typical U.S.                and
  Japanese households.          The Japanese household is induced to save more
 early in the life cycle in order to meet the higher downpayment
 requirement.          The saving—consumption pattern resulting from a higher
 growth rate is shown to contribute to a higher appreciate saving rate
 in Japan compared to the U.S.               However, the contribution of the
 induced early saving due to the downpaymerit requirement seems to be

 too small to explain a large differential in the saving rates of the
-two countries.          Only if we introduce a bequest motive can the model
 generate the observed saving rate in Japan..                 Finally, tax reform
 concerning the tax deductibility of mortgage interest payments or the
 tax exempt status of interest income is shown to have a small impact
 on the aggregate saving rate in either country.                  For example, the
 introduction of tax—exempt saving in the U.S. would increase the
 saving rate by only 1.57..

1.   INTRODUCTION

     It is widely noted that one   of   the major differences between the
U.S. and Japanese economies is found in the institutions and regula-
tions of financial markets. In addition, the tax incentives for
saving and borrowing in the two countries are quite different.      Most
of the interest income from consumer savings is          tax—exempt and
interest payments of consumer mortgages and debts are not tax deduc-
tible in Japan, while the opposite is true in the United States.*
Institutional arrangements concerning housing, one of the major
expenditure items in a lifetime for most consumers, are also quite
different in the two countries.    Many economists have suggested that
differences in housing financing between the two countries may be
partially responsible f or the large gap in the personal saving rate
between the two countries.   (See Hayashi (1986) for a survey of the
literature.)   In a world with perfect capital markets where a
consumer can borrow and lend over his lifecycle, whether a consumer

decides to rent housing or purchase a house would not have any effect

on the lifetime consumption—saving pattern. However, in the presence


* In Japan, interest income from the following savings (with a
ceiling on principal amounts) are tax—exempt:     (i)  regular postal
saving up to 3 million yen;   (ii) postal saving earmarked for housing
purchase up to 0.5 million yen;   (iii) "Maru—yu", that is, any depo-
sits in banks securities and mutual funds, up to 3 million yen; (iv)
"special maru—yu", that is, government and municipal bonds, new
issues and secondary, up to 5 years after issue., up to 3 million yen;
and (v) only for employees of age 54 or younger, for the purpose of
accumulating assets for housing and retirement funds up to S million
yen.   Thus a young employee who wants to save for housing purchase
can receive tax—free interest up to 14.5 million yen    $90,625, if
                                                         (

$1=160 yen). Even beyond the tax—exempt ceiling, there are financial
instruments    (discount  bonds issued by investment     banks   and
governments) which are subject to a low tax rate (16X) regardless of
the income tax bracket of the bond holder. About 58 7. of personal
savings are in one of the above forms of tax exempt savings (Bank of
Japan (1986; p.156)).

of   a liquidity constraint (i.e.,        a   downpayment   requirement)

purchasing a house many create a distortion in the Ufetime consump-

tion—saving decision.    A higher dawnpayment requirement may induce

households to postpone consumption early in the lifecycle in order to
build up enough assets to qualify for buying a house.
     The goal of this paper is to investigate the effect of          tax

incentives and downpayment requirements on households' tenure     choice

(own or rent) concerning housing and on consumption—saving patterns,
with a comparison of the United States and Japan in mind.      In parti-

cular, a life—cycle simulation model will be constructed to quantify

the effect of these policies on the personal saving rate.            The

methodology is based on Slemrod (1982), which constructed a lifecycle
model with endogenous home ownership decisions.* He showed that
although the favorable tax treatment of owner—occupied housing in the

United States favors an early purchase of housing, the downpaynient
constraint induces the consumer to delay the purchase to avoid
distortion in the consumption— saving pattern. Thus, an optimal hf e—
time pattern of tenure choice of housing is determined as a tradeoff
between the tax incentives and the required distortions in the
lifetime consumption stream.
     In this paper, we apply an expanded version of the Slemrod model

to a comparative study of the U.S. and Japanese housing markets. The
model predicts that due to the imperfect capital market, transaction
costs and the relatively higher housing price, the Japanese are

*     As in Slemrod's model, land, a non—reproducible asset, is not
explicitly introduced in our model.   The value of land relative to
total household wealth is much higher in Japan than in the U.S.
Moreover, land has presumably appreciated more than financial wealth.
The potentially important role of land in the saving process and its
implications for the differential performance of the U.S. and Japan
ant not explored in this paper.

                                      2
induced to save more toward the down payment and to acquire a home
later in their lifecycle.

     One simplification adopted in the paper is that the model
considers only the demand side of the asset.   The supply of housing
is not modelled and the general equilibrium response of prices to
changes in policies is not included in the analysis.

     Reasonable values are substituted from the stylized facts of the
two countries.    Most parameter values in the simulation model are
based on observed data of the U.S. and Japanese economies. Some
parameter values are chosen so that the tenure pattern and saving
rates that our model predicts are matched with the observed tenure
pattern in each country.

     Exercises with the simulation model are developed to show how
much the difference in ta incentives contributes to the savings rate
gap between the two countries.    It is particularly interesting to
investigate how tax reform would affect the aggregate saving rate and
housing tenure choice.      In Japan, a proposal to abolish the tax
exemption for saving and replace it with a uniform low tax rate has
been gaining momentum recently.    Furthermore, a tax break for the
purchase of owner—occupied housing, in one form or another, has been
proposed.   In the United States, incentives for saving have been
introduced in the form of the all—savers' certificate and individual.

retirement accounts! although these programs have been cut back
recently.    In addition, same recent tax reform proposals, in
particular flat tax proposals, feature the elimination of the tax
deductibility of home mortgage interest payments.

     In the discussion of tax reform in either country, no one has
presented quantitative estimates showing how much the house tenure

pattern and the saving rate would change due to the proposed reform.
This paper will take up this task using a simulation model.
     In Section 2, we describe a life—cycle model with housing tenure

choice, which is a special case of Slemrod's (1982) model.     Sections

3 and 4, respectively, summarize the stylized facts of the U.S. and

Japanese housing markets.   Section 5 presents the results of various

exercises using the simulation model to investigate the effect of
changes in the economic environment in both countries.        Section 6

offers some concluding remarks.

2. A Lifecycle Model with Housing Tenure Choice
     In this section, we describe a six—period life—cycle model which
will be used for the simulation analyses to be discussed later. Each
period is meant to represent ten years of a person's adult lifetime.
The household, which lives six periods, chooses the consumption of a
composite commodity and housing services for each period over the
lifetime.   Housing services may be obtained either by purchasing a

house or renting housing.     Imperfect capital markets are assumed in

that the household cannot borrow to finance nonhousing consumption.
The household can, however, obtain a mortgage toward purchase of a
house, provided it can come up with a downpayment which is some
fraction of the house value. The liquidity constraint may be binding

for two reasons.   First, when income early in the life cycle is less

than income later, as will be assumed, consumption smoothing may
become impossible. Second, if owner—occupying as opposed to renting
is preferred, the household has to save in order to accumulate enough

wealth for the downpayment.       Even if the liquidity constraint +or

consumption smoothing is binding, there may be positive saving in
order to build up the downpayment.


                                        4
     The desirability of owning a house comes from two sources.
First, it is assumed that a house owned would yield services with
higher utility than the identical house if rented, even if the cost
is identical.   This assumption is meant to represent some advantages

of eliminating the principal—agent relationship if one rents from
himself, i.e., a renter cannot alter, paint and improve a house as
desired, and a renter is subject to a risk of termination of lease or

rent increase in the future.    Second, in the United States, the
imputed income from owner—occupied housing is untaxed, while interest
payments are tax deductible and interest income from saving is tax-
able. This feature makes owning a house more attractive than renting
one, unless there are offsetting tax advantages offered to landlords.

This argument does not apply identically to Japan, where interest
payments are not tax—deductible and most of personal interest income

is practically tax—exempt.     To the extent that rental income is
taxed, however, there is a tax—related advantage to owning housing as
opposed to renting in Japan as welL as in the U.S.
     It is assumed that in the first period the household cannot
purchase a house because of the liquidity and downpayment con-
straints.   Likewise, by the beginning of the last period, the house-
hold must sell any owned housing and move into a rental unit, con-
suming all the proceeds of the house sale in the last period.      (We

abstract from the bequest motive until later.) Thus the household
has a choice of owning a house during any of the second, third,
fourth and fifth periods, but can only buy once.     For each own/rent

lifetime pattern, the household can calculate the optimal consump—
tion/saving pattern by maximizing the discounted sum of lifetime
utility subject to the lifetime budget constraint, the liquidity and


                                      S
downpayment constraints.         By comparing the maximized levels of life-

time utility for different patterns of tenure choice the household
picks the own/rent pattern that yields the highest utility..               (For

simplicity, depreciation on a house is ignored.)
     We assume housing purchases and sales take place at the end of a

period. When a house is purchased with a downpayinent d of the house
value, the downpayment expenditure is deducted from income of the
period of house purchase. The mortgage debt (1—d) becomes (1-t-R) (1—d)

at the beginning of the next period. An equal payment of V for                in



periods amortizes the mortgage debt. (Later, m2 for Japan and m=3
f or the United States will be chosen).           The interest portion of the

mortgage repayment is tax deductible in the United States.             Thus the

"net" mortgage repayment V(m) in the United States is the mortgage
payment less the (deductible) interest portion of the repayment for

the m—th installment.          When a house is sold, after the mortgage is
paid up, the value of the house is used for consumption after the
period of the sale.
     The instantaneous utility function is assumed to be log—linear
in consumption and housing services and lifetime utility is assumed
to be additively separable over time.             For example, suppose that a
household purchases a house at period t(b) and sells at period t(s).

The household has to solve the following problem:                 Maximize with

respect to t(b), t(s), {c(t), t =             1,.-..    6),   Ch(t), t1,..t(b),

     The liquidity constraint implies that total borrowing must be
less than or equal to the value of owned housing. The calculation of
V(m) needs some explanation. For Japan, where there is no tax deduc-

tibility for interest payments, V(m) = V,    and the equal installment

is calculated from a condition that the mortgage is just paid up
after the maturity of mortgage.     For the United States, V(m) repre-

sents the equal payments of mortgage less the tax rebate resulting
from tax—deductibility of the mortgage interest payment..*



*    For Japan, suppose that the mortgage matures in 2 periods
(twenty years). The condition of equal payments is
          (1+R)C(t—d)(1+R)—V)—V =   0.
Solving this, we have
          V(m) = V = (1—d)(1+R)4/(2+R),                      in =   1. 2.

          V(0) =0,                                           m=3,...
In addition, interest income from saving is tax—exempt, i.e., T = 0.
     For the United States, suppose that the mortgage matures in 3
periods (thirty years). The condition of qual payments is
          (1÷R)L(1+R)C(1—d)(1+R)—V}V1—V = 0

Solving this, we have
          V = (1—d)(1+R)/C1+(1÷R)÷(1÷R)2).
     In the period of first installment, the interest portion of
mortgage payment is (1—d)R. Therefore multiplying the tax rate t, we
obtain the amount of tax saving, y(1—d)R. The "net" mortgage payment
is defined as, V(1) = V — (1—d)RT.
     Since the principal balance is shrinking as the installment
continues, the interest portion of installment change. Accordingly
the net mortgage payment in the m—th installment is calculated as:

     V(2) = V — C(1—d)(1+R)—V}RT

     V(3) = V — [(1+R)C(1—d)(1+R)—V}V]RT.




                                         S
     Due to time separability and log linearity of the utility func-
tion, backward induction yields an explicit solution for optimal
consumption, (rent/own) housing service for all periods.
         One extension of the model that we consider is to include a

bequest motive.        In particular, we specify that a fraction q of
benefactor's first—period income is left at the paint of death.
Assuming that heirs are thirty years younger than parents, bequests
are equally divided by the heirs who are at the end of their third

period of life.       The population is larger and the lifetime income is

higher for later generations.       Thus, the size c-f the bequest on the

receiving end has to be adjusted accordingly. The budget set must be
modified as follows:

  y(3,q)     y(3) +   qy(1)/{((1+n)(1+g))3};       A(6,q) =   qy(1),
where n is the population growth rate, and g is the <generational)
income growth rate.
3. Characteristics of the U.S. Housing Market
     Data for mortgage financing with a government guarantee are
available from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
<HUD).      In 1979, the average ratio of mortgage value to the value of

a new one—family house whose finance was government guaranteed was
0.921.     This ratio seems very high, partly due to a sample bias of
government guarantees. The average loan—to—value ratio, 1—d, of con-
ventional mortgage financing, according to the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board (1982). 4cr a new home was .731 in 1980 and .748 in 1981.
Based on these data, our first stylized fact is that the downpayment
ratio is about 25 to 30 percent for conventional mortgages and only

about 10 percent for housing with government loan guarantees.          We

select 257. as a benchmark of the U.S. downpayment ratio.


                                          9
     Second, the average age of inortgator was about 30 years old for

an owner occupant transaction in 1980, according to the FHA Trends of

Home Mortgage Characteristics.           Another source, Annual Housing
Survey, confirms that among the cohort 0+ 25—30 year—old household
heads, more than 50 percent own a house rather than a rent.

     Third, the average maturity of a mortgage is about 30 years,
according to HUD (1979, p.293).          Fourth, the house—value/annual—
income ratio is 1.97 for a typical transaction of one—family housing,

according to HUD (1979, p. 134).)
     Lastly, the lifecycle income pattern of the U.S. household is
calculated by multiplying the average income for an age bracket by
the labor participation rate in 1980.          (Source: U.S. Department of
Commerce (1981), Department of Labor (1985).) As a proportion to the
20—30 year old average income, the income of the 6 age brackets we
are interested in are calculated as follows, after normalizing so
that yLl)+y(2)+. . .+    y(6)   =   1;
            =   0.169; (2) = 0.248;              =   0.257;
            =   0.218; (Z) = 0.108;              =   0.000.
      Since     this income pattern with respect to age bracket is an
observation at a point of time t, the lifetime pattern of a genera-
tion must be estimated in order to be used in the lifecycle maximiza-
tion problem of one particular generation. In the steady state, this
can be done by multiplying the growth rate of (real) lifetime income
over a generation.        We assume that a lifetime income of a generation

later receives income in every age bracket g higher income than a
generation before: Y+(k) = (1+q)5y(k).                    k = 1, 2,...,6.

Therefore, from the cross—section observation, we simulate the

4.,     Stylized Fact, in the Housing Market. in Japan
4,1 Loans vs. Self—financing**
        The ratio of downpayment (literally translated as a ratio of
self—financing) is defined by the ratio of the average amount the
owner of new home raised to the average cost of construction or
purchase of the home.       In the 1980s, the ratio of downpayment has
been about 40 percent for both (custom—made) home builders and home
purchased from developers. The rest, about 60 percent of purchase
costs, comes from subsidized and privately financed loans.        (See

TABLE A4—la for details.)

        However, there are two problems with using these figures..
First, "downpayment" in this table is literally defined •as 'the
portion of self—financing", including the owner's savings, gifts
to the owner, and sales of another real asset. "Loans" in this table
refers to funds cther than the owner's.         If a new owner borrows
without collateral some amount of money from his parents and applies
it toward the "downpayment" to the developer, the amount of money

*   There are various ways to approximate the decade income growth,
depending on which income measures and which deflator is used,   For
example, the per capita real GNP growth over the past ten years less
the population growth rate is about 107..
** The facts are summarized from the survey study by the Ministry of
Construction in Japan, conducted annually since 1974.  (See Ministry
of Construction (1986).) The survey of 1985 was conducted to about
ten thousand individuals who ordered custom—made homes or bought
homes from developers.


                                       11
would still be counted as "loans" instead of "downpayment". The ratio
of "downpayment" in this table may therefore be biased downward.
Although the exact division between "self—finance" and "loans" in
this Japanese table may not be comparable to the division into
"downpayment" and "mortgages" in the United States, this is the
closest approximation possible and the direction of possible bias

would not weaken our argument.
     Second, the ratio of 407. is inclusive of second time buyers who

have trade—ins.    If we take the downpayment ratio of the first—time

buyers only, the downpayment ratio is about 35/..   (See Table A4—lb.)

In light of these facts, a plausible average for the downpayment ratio
for the first—time buyer is about 35%. This is our first stylized
fact for the Japanese housing market.


4.2 Average Age of New Owners
     The average age of the head of households who built custom—made
house in 1985 is about 43.9 years old. However,     if only first—time

buyers are surveyed, the average age is about 40 years old.       (See

TABLE A4—2 for details.)
     This evidence is not quite sufficient for the purpose o-f     our

study of an own/rent tenure choice in the life—cycle context.
Although it shows a distribution of ages of purchasers, it does not
show in the cross—section how many of the cohorts have previously
owned houses.     In order to overcome the difficulty, we consult a
source of representative cross—sectional data in Japan, the Survey o-f
Saving Movement, collected by the Statistics Bureau of the Prime
Minister's Office. The survey shows that the house ownership ratio
(among the cohort) increases monotonically up to the age of 85.     At



                                        12
the age of 65, 86.7 7. of heads of households own housing. it is
between the ages of 35 to 39 when the majority of the cohort becomes
a home owner. The ownership rate increases rapidly between age of 30
and 40.     (See Table A4-3 for details.)

     We present the second stylized fact: In Japan, the average age
of initial home purchase is about 40 years old.

     However,    looking at the percentage of households holding
liabilities for purchase of houses and/or land, we note that less
than 407. of households hold such liabilities.        Investigating other
statistics, we can conclude that more than one third of house owners
have no liabilities connected to housing.        This is supporting evi-
dence that liabilities due to home/land purchases are rather quickly

paid up.


4.3 Japanese Idiosyncrasies:      Extended Families
     Care must be taken in comparing the Japanese housing market with

its U.S. counterpart, in light of the prevalence of extended
families.    It is still common in Japan for young adults between the
age of 18 and the time of marriage to live with their parents, if
they live in the same town.       The prevalence of this arrangement is

partly due to the high relative cost of housing, both rental and
owner—occupied, and partly due to social customs.

     Even after their marriage,        it is not uncommon that children
continue to live with their parents.        This phenomenon appears in the
above—mentioned survey concerning the question o-f what kind of hous-

ing the new owner had before.       About 137. of owner—construction and

6X of buyers used to "live together (with family)." This is a signi-
ficant proportion, because as mentioned before the survey includes
replacement and improvement demand for homes.       (See TABLE A4—4.)


                                        13
     It is common in Japan that when parents become very old, or
especially when one of them dies, they are "looked after" by one of
the children.     A parent (or parents) might move into a house of one
of the children, usually the eldest son; or the family of a child
might move into the parents' house. In the former case, they lose the
"head of household" status and become a dependent in the household
survey, thus dropping out of statistics using a classification by the
age of head of households. In the latter case, in "return" for being
taken care of, it is usual that the child who looks after the parents
inherits the parent's home.     (This is an extreme form of "strategic
bequests", as advocated by Bernheim, Shleifer and Summers (1983).)
The parent(s) usually remains as the legal owner of the house.      One
reason for this arrangement is that for real estate, as opposed to
financial securities, the inheritance tax is reduced since an asses-
sed value for the inheritance tax is usually less than the market
value.     In either case, it is rare that the elderly sell the home in
order to move into a rental unit.     These social and economic aspects

in Japan partly explains why the ratio of homeowners among 65 years
old and over, among "heads o-f households",       does not (seem to)
decline.

     To repeat, the second case implies that a typical Japanese
family keeps an owner—occupied house, or even buys a new larger home,
after retirement.     This is very much in contrast to the typical U.S.

household that sells a big house after the children become adults,
This aspect might not be adequately dealt with in a model based on
the standard life—cycle theory, in particular Slemrod's life—cycle
model of tenure choice.

     Careful consideration of the bias caused by extended families in

                                       14
our study must be given.     As for the effect of the living—in arran-

gement after parents become old, we have two conflicting effects on
the validity of our study.     If the first case (parents moving in to
their children's home) is dominant, we do not have to worry about the

comparability of the two countries, since an apparently high owner-
ship ratio among the retired household heads is caused by selection
bias     (upward).   In other words, in reality as opposed to in the
data, many sell their houses and live with a son's family or a
daughter's family. Thus, the life—cycle framework of own/rent tenure
choice still applies. However, if the second case (a son's or
daughter's family moving in to parent's home) is dominant, then a
bequest motive should be seriously modeled, and it may be the case
that we have to argue that the difference in saving and house—owner-
ship between the U.S. and Japan is due to the extended family prac-

tice and a peculiar bequest motive in Japan. (See Hayashi (1986) for

the extended family explanation of why the Japanese saving rate is so
high.)    Since we will not analyze the bequest motive seriously, we
are implicitly assuming the second aspect of extended family rela-
tionship to be relatively insignificant.       Further theoretical and
empirical analysis is required to investigate how much the Japanese
extended family relationship would affect housing tenure choice and
saving decisions.

4.4 Lifecycle Labor Income Pattern and Price of Housing
       We need the lifecycle labor income pattern for the typical
Japanese household for our simulation model.     The method of calcula-
tion is the same as the United States.         The result is given in
Hayashi <1986: Table 3):


                                     15
               = 0.09;   y2(t)
                                 = 0.22;     y3(t) =   0.28;

               = 0.29; y5(t) = 0.13;         y6(t)
                                                     = 0.00.
       y4(t)
       The above number is the cross—section observation at time t of
the income pattern with respect to age brackets. As was discussed in
the preceding section, the income pattern of a particular generation
derived from this table depends on the growth rate of labor income

over generations: y(k) =         (19)k     'Yt(IC) k =   1,2,....6,   where g is the

growth rate of lifetime (real) labor income over a generation..
The decade income growth rate, g, is approximated at 40Z.* The popu-
lation (age 15 and over) growth rate, n, is approximated at 13.057..
        Lastly, some kind of an indicator of housing price is required.
It is difficult to pin down the price of housing relative to consump-
tion goods. In Japan, about a third of the price of housing services

can be traced to land. The average housing—price/annual—income ratio
for buyers of a house with a land (excluding those who rent land and
who are given land by family and relatives), constructed from a
survey by Ministry of Construction (1982, p.82), was 5.29.

5. Simulations
5. 1   Benchmark
       In this section, the model presented in section 2 is used as a

simulation model with relevant parameter values set from observed
facts summarized in sections 3 and 4. Those parameters for a typical
resident in each country are summarized in Table 5—1.

                           Insert TABLE 5—1 about here


*   Again, the income growth rate can be approximated several ways.
For example, the growth rate of household disposable income less the
CPI growth rate less the population (age 15 and over) growth rate
from 1970 to 1980 would yield about 41X, while the per capita real
GNP growth rate is about 407..

                                               16
     First, we calculate the optimum housing tenure choice predicted
by our simulation model. Given a rent—own pattern n-f housing -for six

periods, maximum lifetime utility is calculated by solving a dynamic
problem of consumption (size of housing and consumption goods) and
saving. The model then compares the maximized values of lifetj
utility to decide the optimal pattern of tenure choice.

     The model, as summarized as the benchmark case in Table 5—2
predicts that the representative Japanese resident rents in periods
1, 2 and 6 of his life, and that the representative U.S. resident
rents in periods 1 and 6 only.     That is, the typical Japanese pur-
chases a house when he is 40 years old with a 20—year mortgage and
the typical American purchases a house when he is 30 years old with a

30—year mortgage. These predicted patterns match the stylized facts
summarized in previous sections.

     The saving rate predicted by the model is 8.817. for the U.S. and

11.16% for Japan. Hayashi (1986) calculates private saving rates for
the two countries after correcting -for the difference in statistical
definitions.   According to Hayashi's estimates, the average private
saving rates for the U.S. and Japan during the 1970s were 8.07. and
18.3% for Japan, respectively.     Thus the prediction for the U.S. is
quite reflective of the stylized fact but the prediction for Japan
-falls short of the actual rate by 7 percentage points.

     The model also shows that in Japan, the housing stock share in
national wealth is much lower than in the United States despite the

high saving rate.    We will investigate contributing factors to the
low housing stock in Japan by simulation experiments later.
     We next check to see how robust the benchmark result is with
respect to the pride of ownership parameter about which we do not


                                      17
have strong confidence.      The tenure choice pattern and the saving

rate predicted by the model was found to be      not sensitive with

respect to this parameter for either country.   (See Table A5—1)

     In the rest of this section, simulations with respect to the
bequest motive, downpayment ratio and the income growth rate will be

conducted to evaluate the impact of changes in the financial institu-

tions and economic environment on the housing market.


5.2 Beguest Motive in Japan
     According to the above results, the saving rate predicted by the

simulation model seems rather too low for Japan.        One possible
source for saving, which has not been incorporated so far,     is the

bequest motive.*    I-f   the the oldest generation does not consume
all its wealth, especially the proceeds from the house sale which
becomes available at the beginning of the last period of the
lifecycle, then the aggregate saving rate would increase.**
     Thus, we investigate how large a bequest motive is required to
predict a saving rate comparable to the actual rate. Table 5—2 shows
that if a bequest motive that directs the benefactor to leave three
times his first—period income to his heir, then the predicted saving
rate in the model to be 17.38%, which is quite comparable to the
actual rate of 18.29%.

*   One Of the reasons that the bequest motive is more important in
Japan is the popularity of the extended family relationship.     If
parents expect to live with (and/or to be taken care of by) children,
they might leave bequests in return.
** Without a bequest motive, an assumption that the individual sells
the house at the beginning of the sixth period is not critical. With
a bequest motive, the assumption becomes problematic, because in
Japan houses are often used as a vehicle for making a bequest due to
the tax advantage relative to bequeathing financial assets.        A
serious treatment of bequest strategy is an important topic for
future research.

5.3 Simulations with respect to downpayment ratios.
     We next investigate how much difference the downpayment con-
straint makes in the housing tenure choice and the saving rate,      Of

course, the higher the downpayment ratio, the more distortion in the
lifetime consumption pattern is required to finance the same amount
of owned housing.

     Table 5—3 shows how sensitive the housing tenure pattern is with

respect to changes in the downpayment ratio. The U.S. housing tenure

pattern would look like Japan's (housing purchase postponed until the
third period) if the downpayment requirement was raised to 407..     In

Japan, the tenure pattern currently observed in the U.S. would emerge
only if the downpayment ratio was reduced to a mere 7.57..   Therefore,
although a change in the downpayment ratio could alter the tenure
choice pattern, the change would have to be very large. The observed
tenure pattern in each country is predicted -fOr a wide range of the
downpayment ratios around the respective benchmark cases.
    Table 5—3 also shows that the saving rate is positively related
to the downpayment ratiO.     An increase of 107. in the downpayment
ratio increases the saving rate by slightly less than one—half a
percentage point in each country, given that the tenure choice
pattern is not altered.     The magnitude of the downpayment ratio
effect is not as large as one night think, because there are two
offsetting impacts from a higher downpayment ratio.     First, higher
saving is required for a given size of house.      Second! a higher
downpayment ratio causes a smaller house to be purchased given the
tenure choice pattern.    The simulation results show that the -first


                                     19
effect is only barely dominant.
            Table 5-3 also shows how the relative share of housing in natio-
nal wealth would be affected when the downpayment ratio is changed.
When the downpayment ratio in Japan becomes as low as 7.5%, so that
the tenure pattern becomes identical with that of the United States,
the housing share in national wealth becomes comparable, too.
However, the housing- share would be way down if the bequest- motive is

strong.                                               -




            In sum, this model suggests that the difference in the required
downpayment ratios in the U.S. and Japan is not a major source of the

difference in the saving rate. However, a large enough decline in the
required downpayment ratio in Japan would induce a saving rate and
lifecycle tenure pattern similar to that of the U.S.

3.4          Simulations with respect to the Income Growth Rate
            First, note that the model is constructed in such a way that the

slope a-f the earning profile for one generation is positively related
to the expected income growth over generations.             This feature comes
-from         the fact    that the observed cross—section data has to be
converted into a steady state lifetime earning profile. Thus, in the

+ollowing experiments, faster growth implies a steeper earnings
profile.

            Results of the sensitivity analysis with respect to the income
growth rate are summarized as follows.             It is well—known that the
aggregate saving rate increases i-f the steady state growth rate of
labor income over generations increases as long as the younger
generations are the savers.             This is confirmed in our simulation


                                             20
model.      In fact, if the Japanese growth rate is only 107., the growth
rate of the United States, then the predicted Japanese saving rate
(without a bequest motive) would be 7.187., which is even below the
current U.S. saving rate simulated in the model.        The tenure choice
of the Japanese case is not affected by the change in the income
growth rate.

     However, in the U.S. the renting period is extended by ten more
years if income grows at the Japanese rate, i.e. the age earning
profile becomes steeper.       The steeper earning profile implies that
the utility penalty imposed by the distortion caused by saving toward
downpayments becomes more burdensome.        The saving rate is increased
to 9.587., which is far short of the actual and less even than the
simulated Japanese saving rate.

5.5 Simulations of tax reforms

     Our final simulation experiments concern changes in the tax laws
which determine incentives for saving and borrowing.              As was-
discussed in the introduction, the tax incentives affecting saving
and borrowing in the two countries are quite different.
     The United States and Japan differ in two aspects:        tax—exemp-
tion of an interest income from saving and tax deductibility of
mortgage interest payment.     For each aspect, the simulation will be
conducted for hypothetical situations given all other parameters.
     Our model gives simulation results shown in Table 5—4 for a full

range of interesting policy questions both in the United States and
in Japan:     How much would the U.S. low saving rate be stimulated if
interest income becomes tax exempt?          How would tenure choice and
average housing size be affected if mortgage payments become non-
deductible?     What are the combined effects of tax—exempt saving and

                                        21
                                             The last question can be also
the interest payment non_deductibility?
paraphrased as follows.           If the United States switched to the
Japanese tax system, what would happen to the saving rate and housing

tenure pattern?

                           Insert TABLE 5—4 about here


        Some economists think that the United States saves      too little

and propose ways to increase the saving rate, including adopting          a

more favorable tax treatment of interest income.          The experiment of

issuing all savers' certificates was one such attempt, though tem-

porary.      The results of allowing tax—exempt saving is shown in the
(YES—YES) column in TABLE 5—4.          The simulated aggregate saving rate

increases by 1.5%, without changing the tenure choice pattern, if
interest income from savings becomes tax—exempt, as in "maru—yu"

accounts in Japan.          The increase is not insignificant, if one is

interested in raising the saving rateS           However, even with an in-

crease of 1.%. the gap in the savings rates of the two countries
would remain large.*
        Suppose next that mortgage interest payments become not tax
deductible in the United States.         This is the case indicated by (NO—

NO) in TABLE 5—4.          The model predicts that the saving rate would be

reduced by a small amount, less than 50 basis points.           This result

contrasts tO the usual presumption that the tax deductibility            of

 interest payments reduces the saving rate because it makes the cost

 c-f   borrowing   less.    However, since buying a house does not represent


 * Note that the model is not general equilibrium in nature, so that
 the interest rate is held constant when tax policy and the capital
 stock are changed.    Introducing general equilibrium considerations
 would presumably dampen the predicted changes in the saving rate.

                                            22
 dissaving (rather a change in portfolio) the aggregate saving rate in
 -fact increases when the cost of borrowing to buy a house falls, due
to the increased saving required to purchase the now—optimal larger
house. *

     Suppose that the U.S. switched to the Japanese tax       system in
that interest income is tax—exempt and mortgage interest payments are
not tax deductible.   In this case the model predicts that the saving
rate would increase by one percentage point.

     Simulation experiments are then conducted for the Japanese case
in order to answer questions symmetric to the U.S. experiments:      How
much would the high Japanese saving rate be reduced if the tax exempt
saving system is abolished? Would the typical Japanese tenure choice
pattern be affected by the favorable tax treatment on mortgage      pay-
ments, like in the United States?         What would be the combined ef-
fect, i.e. i-f Japan switched to the U.S. tax system?

     The first question is quite relevant since the Japanese     govern-
ment is currently considering abolishing the tax exempt status on
certain interest income (the "maru—yu" accounts)   -    The second ques-
tion is also relevant, since adopting a mare favorable tax treatment
a-f mortgage payments is always proposed when housing     problems are
discussed in Japan. The presumption is that the housing stock is one
are of comparative disadvantage For Japan compared to the U.S.


*   Remember that a liquidity constraints equivalent to a ban on
borrowing in excess a-f housing capital is imposed in the model.
Therefore, tax incentives for borrowing will not increase the demand
-for the composite consumption good during the first period, when the
liquidity constraint is binding.     I-f our focus is shifted from the
downpayment constraint to borrowing constraints for consumption, we
could investigate th.e effect of eliminating the tax deductibility of
interest payments on consumer loans.    In this case elimination could
raise the saving rate


                                     23
        The model predicts that abolition of the "maru—yu" accounts in
Japan would cause a drop in the saving rate by two to three percen-
tage points (depending on how strong the bequest motive is). The
housing tenure pattern would also change, so that the Japanese would

rent 10 more years before purchasing a house.

        If    Japan were to introduce tax—deductibility of mortgage
interest payments, then the model predicts a very slight increase in

the aggregate saving rate, without changing the tenure choice pat-
tern.        If Japan adopts the U.S. tax system with respect to interest
income and interest payments, then the model predicts a drop in the
saving rate of 2 percentage points if the bequest motive is strong,
or by 3 percentage points, if there are no bequests.
        The tax—exempt status of interest income has a stronger impact
on the saving rate than the tax—deductibility of mortgage interest
payments in both countries. The latter does not change the aggregate
saving rate more than 50 basis points in any case in either country.
Simulation results indicate that differences in the tax incentives
between the two countries explain only one to three percentage points
out of the 10 percentage point gap between the saving rates of the
two countries.


6. Concluding Remarks
        We constructed a simulation model in order to evaluate the
effects of changes in housing finance institutions and tax policy on
the housing tenure and the saving rate.       Simulation results suggest
that the factors do not offer a complete explanation of the large gap

in the saving rate between the two countries.       There are two reasons
behind this conclusion.        First, although the typical downpayrnent


                                         24
ratio varies across the two countries, the variation is not suffi-
cient to affect the aggregate saving rate by a significant amount.
Second, tax reform experiments indicate that only one to three perce-
ntage points out of the 10 point gap is attributable to the
difference in the tax incentives.

     The model suggests that the difference in the income growth rate

over generations can explain a greater amount of the saving rate gap.
Given the difference in the income growth rates, we suspect also that

the Japanese have a stronger bequest motive, perhaps due to their
extended family relationships.      The actual saving rate is reproduced
in the model if the benefactor is planning to leave three times as
much as their first—period income.

     As is true for all numerical simulation analyses, the quantita-

tive results presented here depend on our choices about the specifi-
cation of the model.     Several aspects of this specification are
especially worthy cf note.   The use of a log linear utility function

implies an intertemporal and intratemporal elasticity of substitution
equal to one.     This is likely to overstate the actual degree of
substitutability, and thus understate the welfare cost of a given
distortion in saving/consumption patterns.     For example, with less
intertemporal substitutability, an increase in the required down
payment ratio is more likely to cause a household to postpOne and
reduce the size of a housing purchase, rather than have to reduce
consumption early in the lifecycle.
     The six—period formulation is also rather arbitrary and allows
the consideration of only large discrete changes in the lifetime
tenure pattern. A model with more periods would be able to treat the

more continuous adjustment of tenure patterns in response to a change


                                       25
in the economic environment. The cost of such a model is, of course,

the increased computational expense.
     Finally, an improved model would more carefully treat the be-

quest motive and, in general, transactions between generations. Dif—
4erences in these transactions between the U.S. and Japan potentially

play a large role in the determination of housing decisions and
saving decisions as well as the effect of tax policy and other insti-

tutional arrangements on these decisions.

     In spite 0+   these qualifications, we believe that this analysis
represents a valuable contribution to the quantitative analysis of
the interaction of housing market institutions, tax policy,        and

savings behavior in the U.S. and Japan.       It has demonstrated the

importance of treating demand for housing and savings behavior simul-

taneously within the context of a dynamic model.

*  The labor income and saving rate profile is a life—time labor
income stream of a typical agent in the model.   The profiles are
calculated as longitudinal predictions, while the aggregate saving
rate is a cross—section prediction.
**   Wealth is the sum of financial assets and housing equity (value
minus outstanding mortgage) .  Income in this table is measured on an
annual basis.
***  The value of land is not included in the measure of housing or
the measure of wealth.    The observed housing/wealth ratio is indeed
higher in the United States than in Japan, as suggested by this
simulation table. However, the ratio of land value to wealth is much
higher in Japan than in the United States.   See also footnote 2 in
the text.
