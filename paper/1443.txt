                      Are Tax Cuts Really Expansionary?



                                   ABSTRACT



        In this paper, we re—examine the standard analysis of the short—run

effect of a personal tax cut. If consumer spending generates more money

demand than other components of GNP, then tax cuts may,   by   increasing the

demand for money, depress aggregate demand. We examine a variety of evidence

and conclude that the necessary condition for contractionary tax cuts is

probably satisfied for the U.S. economy.

 I. Introduction

       This paper re—examines the standard Keynesian analysis of the short—rin
effect   of a personal tax cut.     The textbook conclusion is that a tax cut

expands aggregate demand and output so long as the money supply is held
constant. Conversely, a tax increase is contractionary according to the
conventional analysis. This result, however, is sensitive to the form of

the money demand function.1 In particular, if consumer expenditure genera-

tes   more money demand than other components of GNP, as is plausible a
priori, then the effect of a tax cut on aggregate demand is in general ambi-
guous. If money demand is sufficiently interest inelastic, then tax cuts
are contractionary.
      Theory thus does   not provide a clear answer to the question of whether

tax   cuts are expansionary. Despite its    importance for macro—economic

policy, however, there is surprisingly little empirical work addressing this

issue. As we discuss more fully below, the existing studies of money demand

do not support the textbook formulation. Moreover, tax cuts have histori-

cally been coupled with accomodating monetary policy. Case studies of these

policy interventions can shed only little light on the question of what the

effects would have been bad the monetary authority held the money supply

constant.    Although simulations   of macro—econometric models support the
textbook    conclusion, these simulations assume particular specifications of

the money demand function   and   are thus not probative regarding the issue we

address. Existing empirical work, therefore, provides little evidence upon

which to evaluate the standard conclusion that tax cuts are expansionary.

We are told that this sensitivity has formed the basis of exam questions at
Princeton and Yale Universities.

       In this paper, we exam.ine the evidence and   conclude   that    consumer

expenditure does generate more money demand than      other   components of GNP.
At    the very- least, this conclusion implies that tax cuts are much less

expansionary    than is   widely believed. Whether they are expansionary- at all
depends upon parameters of the IS curve as well as those of the LM curve.

Using estimates from other studies, we show that the condition for tax cuts

to be contractionary appears to be satisfied for the U.S. econoiiy.

       Our results have implications for recent policy- discussions. Since a

more monetarist policy environment prevailed in the period between 1979 and

1983, the large tax cuts during this period may have been partly responsible

for the deep recession and the concurrent reduction in inflation. Moreover,

tax increases to reduce the large current and prospective deficits are not

likely to depress the econoir unless the Fed responds to them by reducing

the rate of money growth.

       This analysis o± fiscal policy follows the standard practice of'

assuming the money supply is held fixed. In practice, however, the monetary

authority is unlikely to ignore the actions of the fical authority. Even

if the monetary authority is non—reactive,     the effects of fiscal policy rest
critically on the rule the monetary authority is following. For example,
even if tax cuts are contractionary under a constant money supply rule, they

are   nonetheless expansionary under an interest rate rule and         have   no effect
under   a nominal GNP rule.     It is impossible to examine fiscal policy in a
vacuum.
       Section II of this paper demonstrates the theoretical importance of the

money demand specification for the sign of the tax multiplier. Section III
                                           —3—



examines the evidence, both econometric and non—econometric, on the scale

variable in the money demand function. Section IV discusses the historical

experience with two tax cuts: the l961           tax   cut and the 1981 tax cut.

Section V concludes with a discussion of implications for policy and direc-

tions for future research.


II. Theory-



      Here we work with a slight extension of the textbook Keynesian IS—LM

model. We examine the effects of fiscal policy only on the aggregate demand

schedule. We do not address the issue of the appropriate aggregate supply

function. Our model is fully consistent with a variety of theories of

aggregate supply. In particular, to examine the impact of fiscal policy on

the level of output, our model could be coupled with a traditional Phillips

curve, a Lucas 11973] supply function, a model of nominal wage contracts

(Fischer [1977], Taylor [1980]), or a model of price stickiness (Okun

[19821, Rotemberg [1983], Manklv [1983]). The aggregate demand schedule is

the locus of price levels P and output levels Y that satisfy the IS and LM

curves. Without loss of generality, we can hold the price level P fixed;

changes in output Y thus represent shifts in the aggregate demand schedule.


      A.A Simple Model


      We   begin with a very simple model to illustrate the importance of the
money demand specification. In particular,             we postulate that


(1)        Y C(Y—T,r) +   I(Y,r)   +   G
                                                _14_



(2)        MI?   = L(C,I,G,r)

where the notation is standard. We dify                       the     liquidity preference function

(2) by allowing the demand for real balances to depend separately on C, I

and G rather than simply on their sum.2

       The standard comparative statics exercise performed on this idel

yields the following fiscal policy nniltipliers:3



(3)        dY =      (LG   —
                               Li)Ir    + (LG —   L)Cr       —
                                                                 Lr
           dG




(1)        dY = -.Cy((L          —
                                     Li)Ir — Lrl
           dT

where     = —(i — Cy —      Iy)(LiIr      + LCCr +     Lr)           (Ir +   Cr)(LCy + L11y).
  is unambiguously positive under the standard assumptions that ly )                              0,
Cy >      'r     0, Cr (    0,   L. (    0,   and Cy +    ly     <   1.
       Equations (3) and (4)          demonstrate      that the effects of both tax and

spending changes are indeterminate without any                        further     restrictions.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for the standard results to obtain are:



()        dY     >                        < IrLI       + CrLC        +       Lr
           dG
                                                  Ir4Cr

(6)        dY    <0        iff       LC <         + Lr/Ir
           dT




      2We assume that all componants generate non—negative tney demand; that
is, L >    0, L1 ) 0, and Lr )' 0.
    3We focus on these two in.iltipliers because the                         ney ltipier has the
same sign as in the standard textbook analysis.
                                         —5—



Expression   (5)   implies   that the spending niltiplier is positive as long as

government spending generates less money demand than a weighted average of

consumption and     investment.     As we discuss below, this condition seems

likely to be satisfied in practice. Expression (6)         states   the necessary

condition for expansionary- tax cuts. It is less clear whether this con

dition is satisfied. If consumer expenditure generates more money demar:

than investment and     if   money demand is sufficiently interest inelastic re...a—

tive to investment, then tax cuts reduce aggregate demand.

       To illustrate the ichanism driving the results graphically, consider

the special case of the model in which money demand depends only upon con-

sumer expenditure. Equation (2) becomes


(2')       M/? =   L(C(Y—T,r),r).

As in the standard analysis, a reduction in taxes causes an expansionary

shift in the IS curve. As shown in Figure 1, at any interest rate, the tax

cut raises consumption and thereby- increases the equilibrium level of out-

put. Contrary to the standard analysis, a tax cut also shifts the LM curve

in a contractionai-y direction. At any given level of income and interest

rate, consumption and thus money demand is greater. The net effect of the

tax cut on the level of output is ambiguous, as the IS and LM curves shift

in opposite directions.

       Equation (2') suggests another model in which tax cuts are potentially

contractionary. If money demand depends on disposable income, then a tax

cut also shifts the LM curve in a contractionary direction. We concentrate

on the   model in iich consumption is the relevant scale variable on        the

basis    of   our   empirical   results.   From the standpoint of the simple IS—LM
model    discussed in this section, the model based on disposable income           is

equivalent to the model based on consumption) If money demand depends on
after—tax      income or upon some variable       that is functionally related to
after—tax      income, such as consumption, then tax cuts may be contractionary.


        B. A Preliminary Calculation


        Before proceeding any further, we consider whether the condition for a

contractionary tax cut is possibly satisfied. Suppose that consumer expen-

diture is the correct scale variable, as in equation (2'). Are the parame-

ters of the IS and LM curves in the range necessary           to yield a perverse tax
multiplier?
        If only C generates money demand, then expression (6) implies that a

tax cut is contractionary if and only if


(6')          cC    ) CXCr
where Cc = the quantity elasticity of money demand,
         Cr = the interest semi—elasticity of money demand, and
              = the interest semi—elasticity of investment.

To ge.uge the sign of the tax multiplier, we must obtain estimates of these

economic paramenters.
       It seems reasonable to posit that the quantity elasiticity of         money
demand is somewhat less than unity over a period of a few           quarters. This



      more complete consumption function than that in our simple model
would highlight the difference between consumer expenditure and disposable
income as the scale variable in the money demand function. For example,
consumer expenditure also depends on expected future income. An anticipated
tax    cut would shift the LM curie if C is the stale variable bt nt          if
                                          —7—




conclusion     is broadly consistent with the estimates      of   Friedman 11978], Hall
[19T71, Goldfeld [19T3,19T6] and       others. We therefore use CC = 0.8.
       More difficult to obtain is consensus on the parameter Li..         The   results
of Friedman, Hall,     and   Goldfeld vary considerably but center around      an

interest elasticity of about one—tenth. At an interest rate of eight per-

cent, this estimate implies a semi—elasticity of about 1.25.

       The most difficult parameter estimate to obtain in the literature            is
the   interest semi—elasticity of investment. Friedman estimates that the

interest elasticity of real spending is 0.17 over a period of several qiar—

ters. Attributing two thirds of this sensitivity to investment and eva-

luating at I/Y = 0.15 and       r = 0.08,   we obtain a value of r of about 9.

Hall uses a Cobb—Douglas production function and argues that the capital

stock adjusts about one fourth       to   the long—run value in the first year. His

figures     impl7 r is about 11. Based on these      two estimates, we use r =           10

for   our   preliminary calculation.

       To   judge the reasonableness of these parameter estimates, it is useful
to calculate the fiscal poiicy m.iltipliers in the standard IS—LM model.
With these estimates and the further asuxxrptions that Cy = 0.7 and
ly =   Cr = 0,   the tax miltiplier in the standard model is —0.6, while the
spending miltiplier is +0.8. These          miltipliers   are in line with those
implied     by large macro—econometric models. Eckstein [1983, p. 371         reports
similations of the DRI model under alternative assu.mptions           regarding mone-

tary   policy. If the level of non—borrowed reserves or the interest rate is




current Y—T is the scale variable.

held constant, the spending multiplier reaches a peak of 1.6 or 2.1, respec-

tively, after six quarters.5 In contrast, if the Fed holds the ney supply

constant (the experiment we consider), the spending multiplier begins at 0.7

and declines steadily to zero after three or four years. Thus, our para-

meter estimates appear a reasonable stylized approximation to this larger

and ire complete del.

        Using these estimates and noting that C/I is about four, we can now

check whether (6') is satisfied. We find:


            0.8 )        14 x 1.25/10

            0.8    )     0.5

Thus,    although the uncertainty is necessarily large, expression (6') does

appear satisfied. If consumer expenditure is the correct quantity variable

in   the xney demand function, then tax cuts are probably contractionary.
      Using our estimates and again assuming that Cy = 0.7 and ly =                   Cr
                                                                                           = 0,
we can   compute       the multipliers for our       alternative     IS—LM formulation using
equations (3)     and (14). We find that the tax multiplier is +0.3, while the

spending   multiplier is       +0.7. Thus,       although   the spending multiplier is not

greatly affected by the change in ney demand specification, the tax

multiplier   changes from —0.6          to   +0.3.


      C. Implications of the Model


      The de1 outlined above has important               implications      beyond the sign and

size of the fiscal policy- multipliers. If              tax   cuts   are   indeed contrac—



    SStandard estimates of the fiscal policy multipliers, such as those in
the CBO Multipliers Projects 11977], assume the Fed holds the level of non—
borrowed reserves constant.
                                        —9—




tionary,    then much standard Keynesian doctrine requires amendment. In this

section, we briefly      note   some of the model's implications.

       First,   if consumption is the scale variable in the money demand     func-

tion, as in equation (2'), then the balanced budget multiplier is unity.
This value is, of course, larger than in the standard IS—LM model, in which
crowding out of investment implies a balanced budget multiplier less than
one. In our alternative model, there is no crowding out after a balanced
budget fiscal stimulus, since the increase in taxes reduces the demand for
money. This result also indicates that the full—employment deficit is an
inadequate measure of fiscal stimulus.
       Second, while    transfer payments are often called a form of government

spending,    they should be regarded as negative taxes for the purposes of the
issues at hand. Transfers, like tax cuts,         stimulate   consumer spending. In
the    above model, they may also     shift the LM curve in a contractionary direc—
t ion.
       Third, our results suggest that policies to stimulate saving may

increase aggregate demand. Analytically, shocks to the consumption func-

tion, whether exogenous or induced by policy, have the same effects as per-

sonal tax cuts. Likewise, these results suggest that, in a world where the

money stock is held fixed, the paradox of thrift may not be a paradox at

all.

         Fourth,   these results imply that tax cuts aimed at stimulating business

investment have very different effects on aggregate demand than tax cuts

aimed at stimulating consumer spending. Even if personal tax cuts are

contractionary, business tax cuts may nonetheless be expansionary, since
                                        —10—


 investment may generate less money demand than consumption.

      Fifth, this analysis calls into question the efficacy of the tax

 system as a stabilizer against shocks to aggregate demand. If, following a

positive shock to investment, automatic increases in tax collection further

 stimulate aggregate demand, then the tax system exacerbates cyclical fluc-

tuations. More generally, whether the tax system acts as an automatic sta-

bilizer or an automatic destabilizer may depend upon whether the monetary

authority is targeting interest rates or the money supply.


     D. Extensions of the Model


    The textbook IS—LM model that we consider above is designed only to

focus on the short—run impacts of alternative macro—economic policies.

Complicating the model along a variety of dimensions, however, would leave

the fundamental result unchanged. If money demand depends on consumer

spending more than other components of GNP, then a tax that stimulates con-

sumer spending shifts the LM curve      in a contractionary direction.
     One possible    modification of the model would be the inclusion wealth

effects and the government budget constraint, along the lines discussed by

Blinder    and Solow [19731 and Christ [1969]. Taking account of wealth
effects does not alter the impact effect of fiscal policies. Rather, wealth
effects become important in the intermediate run as asset stocks change.
Because    increases in wealth affect   consumption directly, but not   other corn-.

ponents of demand,   using consumption as the scale variable in the      money
demand function would reduce the intermediate—run tax
                                                      multiplier in these
models 6




   6We are inclined to discount the relevance of these
                                                       e'ects, because we
                                        —11—



       Another possible extension of the model would involve allowing for
expectational effects      of policies on asset prices and      consumption   decisions,

as    in Blanchard's [19811   development    of a rational expectations version of
the   IS—LM   model.   A permanent tax cut   would   shift the LM curve   inward   as
consumers spent out      of both the current and     expected future proceeds from
the   tax cut. Moreover, long term interest rates would rise          in the short      run

in anticipation of future tax cuts. Simulations by Fair 119T91 indicate

that taking account of expectational effects reduces estimated fiscal policy

multipliers. This finding suggests that an explicit treatment of expec—

tatiorial effects would only strengthen our conclusions.

       So far we have assumed that consumers treat government bonds as net

wealth so that tax cuts increase consumer expenditure. The qualitative

character of our results would be identical if the private sector treats

only a fraction of bonds as net wealth. If government bonds are not net

wealth at all, as Barro [l9T1 suggests, then tax cuts do not stimulate con-

sumption and therefore shift neither the IS nor the LM curve. We believe,

however,      that there is ample   reason to doubt Barro's conclusion. The

existence of liquidity constraints, alternative models of the bequest motive

(Bernheim, Schleifer and Summers 1198111), and the non—lump—sum nature of

taxation      (Barsky, Mankiw and Zeldes 1198111)    make it   is reasonable to posit
that tax cuts do stimulate consumer spending. The point of this paper is
that    a stimulative effect on consumer spending is not sufficient to generate
a    stimulative effect on aggregate demand.




believe that the "long run" in which asset stock changes are important is
longer than the "long run" in which price flexibility restores full
employment.

III. The Scale Variable in the Money Demand Function


        The above discussion demonstrates the possibility that tax cuts are

contractionary. We nov address the empirical question of whether the

necessary condition for contractionary tax cuts is in fact satisfied.

Outside the stylized fantasylands of our models, there is no unambiguous a

priori   answer. The answer in large part     depends upon the parameters of the

money    demand function which, as Cooley and LeRoy [19811 point out, are at
best difficult to estimate convincingly. We therefore draw upon a variety
of evidence, both econometric and    non—econometric,   to determine whether con-
sumer expenditure is likely to generate more money      demand   than other com-
ponents of GNP.

     A. Existing Studies

     Despite the theoretical importance of the scale variable in the money
demand function, relatively little is known about It. A consideration of
existing theoretical and empirical work, however, does point toward a
consumption—based view of money    demand.   In reviewing previous work, we
distinguish between studies that    take a   transactions view of money demand
and those that take a portfolio view.
    Much work assumes that money is held primarily for transactions pur-
poses. Although no one has yet provided a fully satisfactory micro—
foundation for the theory of money, most work on this topic employs
forüations in which money holding is closely linked to aggregate consump-
tion. Consider, for example, models emphasizing a "Clover cash—in—advance
                                         —13—


constraint," such as    those   of   Grossman and Weiss [1983] and Rotemberg

[198141.    Similarly, dels placing money in the utility          function, such as

that of    Sidrauski [19671, imply a first order condition         linking consumption

to money holding. Indeed, these        models treat money      holding exactly as

another consumption good.7

       Existing empirical evidence comes        largely from   studies comparing the

explanatory    power of alternative variables. In        contrast to our procedure

below, these studies do not typically nest the alternative hypotheses in a
single     equation. Both Goldfeld [19761 and Enzler, Johnson and Paulus [19761

try using a "weighted" GNP variable on the grounds that different categories

of expenditure are unlikely to generate the same quantity of transactions.

Rather than estimating the weights simultaneously with the parameters of the

money    demand function,   they impose them a priori. Although        Goldfeld finds
only   a slight improvement with this variable over standard GNP, Enzler,

Johnson and Paulus [p. 2781      conclude   that "the result is a slight improve-

ment in sample—period fit and a substantial reduction of post—sample error.

It appears that this line of inquiry should be         pursued further."
       One approach to money    demand is to disaggregate either by type of asset

or   by sector. Goldfeld [19731       reports that his evidence "provides some

independent    support for   model builders who     choose to use separate   currency

and    demand deposit equations and who include       consumption in   the currency
equation." Goldfeld [19761 also experiments with estimating money demand




      TPoterba and Rotemberg [1983] empirically implement such a formulation
of money   demand with some success.
functions for household      money holding, which accounts for about two—thirds

of the total. He concludes [p. 7151 that "of the three transactions

variables, in the pre—197l period, GNP is clearly the worst, while consump-

tion    and   personal income are equally good." Both of these results from

disaggregate data suggest that tax cuts shift the 114 curve in a contrac—
tionary direction. If some part of money demand is a function           of consumer

expenditure, while the remainder is a function of total expenditure, then a
dollar of consumer expenditure generates more money demand than a dollar of
investment.
       A second tradition views money demand as emerging out of a portfolio
allocation decision.       The essence of the portfolio view is that money demand

should depend on the level of wealth or permanent income. Friedman and

Schwartz [1982, p. 38] suggest in their chapter on monetary theory that


              Income as measured by- statisticians may be a defective
              index of wealth because it is subject to erratic
              year—to-year fluctuations, and a longer—term concept,
              like the concept of permanent income developed in
              connection with the theory of consumption, may be
              more useful.


The correct measure of total wealth is permanent after—tax income. In this

portfolio view, a tax cut reduces perceived wealth for any given level of

before—tax      income and thus shifts the LM curve   in   a contractionary direc-
tion.
       Laidler [1977], in his comprehensive review of the money        demand   litera-
ture, concludes [pp. 139_1t81 that the evidence favors permanent income over

current income or non—hun wealth as the scale variable. Judd and
                                      —15—


Scadding, in their recent survey paper [1982, p. 10081, write     that   "one of

the conclusions reached about the demand for money in the pre—1973 period

(mostly based on annual evidence) is that permanent income or wealth outper-

formed rrasured income in producing a stable money demand function." They

point out that subsequent work has shed only little new light on the rele-

vant scale variable.

        After reviewing monetary trends in the United States over the past

hundred years, Friedman and Schwartz [1982] also conclude that permanent

income   best explains the demand for money. If permanent income or total
wealth is the appropriate scale variable in the money demand function, then
economic theory suggests consumption as an     ideal proxy for these unobser-
vable   variables. Indeed, it has often been noted that the procyclical beha-

vior of the velocity of money is evidence for a permanent income view of

money demand, since the ratio of GNP to consumption is also strongly pro—

cyclical.

     In summary,   neither   the transactions nor the portfolio view of money

demand points toward the use of current income as the scale variable. Both

theoretical and empirical considerations suggest the use of consumption in

the money demand function.


     B. The Distribution of Money Holdings


     Since the critical issue is the marginal propensity to hold money out

of different components of GNP, it is natural to inquire about the distribu-

tion of money holding.8 Table la presents some data on the ownership of the



    8This distribution provides direct evidence on the average propensities
to hold money rather than on the marginal propensities. The average propen—
sies, however, do seem inforrrtive.

financial      assets contained in Ml        and M2 as they are   currently defined. For

both definitions of money, a very- large fraction is held by households.

This result is not entirely surprising. For at least two reasons, busi-

nesses are likely to be able to better economize on cash balances than

households. First, businesses are typically more sophisticated at financial

management than households. Second, economies of scale allow larger enti-

ties to hold less money relative to their size than small entities. Indeed,

theories of the transactions demand for money, such as Baumol 11952], Tobin

[1956]   and   Miller and Orr [1966], imply         a   much less than unit    elasticity
with respect to quantity. The empirical distribution in Table la is thus

broadly consistent with economic theory.

       Table lb presents a rough attempt to allocate the holdings of Ml and M2

to different categories of expenditure. We allocate household holdings to

consumer   expenditure and government holdings to government expenditure. The
remainder, which is mostly       holdings by- business, seems most related to total

production.      Thus, we    allocate   it   to   each component in proportion to that
component's share in G1qP. While these allocations               are crude, they are

nonetheless     suggestive of the effect of output composition on money demand.
       The allocations in      Table    lb suggest that consumer expenditure generates
much greater money demand than investment. While consumer expenditure is
only   614 percent   of GNP,   86 percent of      Ml holding is allocated to this

component——a ratio      of   1.314. Investment, on the other hand,        is   15 percent of

GNP,   but only 5 percent      of Ml holding is allocated to this component——a

ratio of 0.33. These allocations indicate that a dollar of                consumer    expen-

diture generates four times as much Ml demand as a dollar of investment.

        The results using information on M2 are even more striking. Only 1

percent of       holdings is allocated to investment, while 96 percent is allo-

cated to consumer expenditure. Following the same calculation as above, we

find that the propensity to hold money         out of   consumer expenditure is twenty

times the propensity to hold money out of investment.

        Our theoretical discussion in Section II shows that the spending

multiplier may have a negative sign if government spending generates more

money demand than a weighted average of consumption and investment. Table

lb suggests that this result is unlikely, as relatively little money holding

is allocated to government spending. Moreover, all the money holding that

is allocated to G is by state and local governments; holdings by the federal

government are not included in the aggregates as currently defined.9 We

therefore confine our investigation to expression (6) and the effect of tax

cuts.     Our examination of the    distribution of money holding suggests that

the   condition necessary for tax cuts to have a perverse effect may in fact
be satisfied.

        C. The Stability of Velocity


        The conclusion that "money matters" for the determination of aggregate

demand    is now widely accepted among macro—economists. Its acceptance is to
a large extent attributable to the empirical work of Friedman and          Schwartz

[1963,19821 and others showing the close empirical connection between mone-.
tary    fluctuations and   the   business cycle. These     studies emphasize that over



    9These aggregates are the relevant concept of money if they are the
aggregates targeted by the Federal Reserve. If   the Fed were targeting an
aggregate that included Federal holdings of some financial assets, then a
perverse spending iltiplier would be more plausible. This observation
highlights the irToortance of the monetary policy rule for the fiscal policy
                                          —18—



long    periods of history and    under   a variety of institutional arrangements,

nominal GNP moves in tandem with       the   money supply. Equivalently, velocity

appears relatively stable.

       Even if velocity measured with respect to nominal GNP is stable,

however, this fact does not imply that GNP is the correct quantity variable

in the quantity equation. Gross national product is only a proxy for total

transactions, and     another   variable may be a better proxy. Empirically,

velocity measured with respect to another variable may be even more stable

than velocity traditionally defined. In this section, we therefore compare

alternative velocity measures. In particular, we compare velocity measured

with   respect   to gross national product (Y/M) to velocity measured with

respect    to nominal consumer expenditure (c/M). Our goal is to find the
nominal aggregate that yields the most stable measure of velocity.10
       We also examine velocity calculated using other plausible aggregates.

One possible scale variable for the quantity equation is personal disposable

income (Y—T). Equation (2') above suggests this formulation. For the

question   of   whether tax cuts are expansionary, disposable income is func-

tionally the same as consumption. For both formulations of money demand,
tax cuts shift the 124 curve in a contractionary direction. Another can-
didate variable is private spending (c+i). As expression (6) demonstrates,
the relevant parameters     for the determining for effect of a tax cut are      the
marginal propensity to hold money out of         consumption   (L0) and the marginal


multipliers.
  10We recognize that comparisons of the stability of velocity are just
comparisons of the goodness of fit of crude money demand equations. Below
we examine more standard money demand equations. We have two reasons for
examining velocity. First, it is an atheoretic approach which does not
require us to take a     stand of   the exogeneity of income or interest rates.
                                     —19—


propensity to hold money out of investxnent (L1). We therefore directly com-

pare   the use of C to the use of C+I as the scale variable. The last aggre-

gate we examine is final sales, which is gross national product less

inventory investment. As Blinder [19811 documents, inventory fluctuations

are very large over the business cycle. One might thus suspect that a jor

difference between fluctuations in C and Y is attributable to inventory-

behavior. Moreover, since ny theories of money holding are based on the

transactions motive, final sales appears a more reasonable variable to

include    in the money dend function than total production. We therefore
consider   the use of final sales as the    quantity variable.11
       There   is no unambiguous way to measure the standard deviation of velo-

city. We therefore compute this standard deviation under a variety of

alternative assumptions. Velocity has historically trended upward, which

suggests   either detrending or first—differencirig the data. We compute the
standard   deviation both ways. We   detrend by regressing the log of velocity
on time and the square of time. For longer time periods, we also try
including the cube of time. The residuals from this regression are always

highly correlated, suggesting that the detrended series is possibly not sta-

tionary. As Plosser and Schwert [19781 suggest, examining the data after

first—differencing iy be preferred in this situation. Paralleling the

above equation, we regress the change in the log of velocity on time. The



Second, in examining velocity, it is more natural to allow the the influence
of lagged money on output, which similar lags are less natural in money
dend functions.

   11Another plausible variable to examine in this context is domestic
absorbtion, defined as GNP less net exports. We do not examine it here
because it varies so little relative to GNP in U.S. historical data. We
return to the question of international effects in the concluding section.
                                          —20—



time   trend is typically not significant in this regression and the residuals

are not highly correlated, indicating that velocity is well described as a

random walk.

       It is widely believed that the money supply affects nominal GNP with a

lag. The relative success of the alternative nominal aggregates y be sen-

sitive to this timing        issue.   We therefore also examine, for the more recent

data, velocity defined as the nominal aggregate divided by the money supply

lagged six months.

       Table 2a presents the standard deviation of Ml velocity for the

period between 1961 and 1982 using annual data. These figures do not

at all    support     the traditional formulation using   nominal GNP. First,
velocity    measured using consumer expenditure (c/M) is unambiguously
more stable than velocity measured using total production (Y/M).
Second, among the five hypotheses, consumer expenditure yields the most
stable measure of velocity in three out of four specifications. In the
fourth specification, disposable income produces the most stable velo-
city. Both       of   these scale variables imply   that tax cuts shift the LM
curve in    a contractionary direction.

       An examination of M2 velocity, also presented in Table 2a, suggests a

similar   conclusion for this broader monetary aggregate. For three of the
four specifications, consumer expenditure yields the most stable measure of
velocity.    For recent data, consumer expenditure appears the most
appropriate variable in the quantity equation.

Schwartz 11982], is M2 under    the   old Federal Reserve definitions.     It is

more inclusive than the current Ml and less inclusive than the current l2

As the period we   examine in Table a is      very long, we try   including the cube
of time to see whether this more general detrending affects the results. We

find that its inclusion alters no result. Since this longer period includes

both the Great Depression and World War II, it is not surprising that velo-

city is much more volatile than during the shorter post—war period.

      The figures in Table 2b again do not confirm the traditional use of GNP

in the quantity equation. When we examine the standard deviation of velo-

city around its trend, we find that disposable income produces the most

stable velocity. When we examine the first difference of velocity, consumer

expenditure yields the most stable velocity.

      In sum, our examination   of   the stability of velocity provides no sup-

port for using GNP in the quantity equation. Consumer expenditure (c)          is
the   most successful scale variable of the five we consider. Disposable

income (Y—T) appears in second place. Both of these two formulations of the

quantity equation imply that tax cuts are contractionary.


      D. Money Demand Estimates


      One can view the quantity equation as an extremely simple money demand

function in which the quantity elasticity is unity and the interest elasti-

city is zero. Under these restrictive assumptions, consumer expenditure

appears the best scale variable in the money demand function. It is natural



   12Ag discussed in more detail below, there is more variation in the con—
sumption share of GNP in the period between 1930 and 1955 than in the period
since 1955. Examining the entire period necessitates using old M2, as it is
the only aggregate for which comparable data are readily available.
                                               —22—



to    ask   whether      this conclusion would hold after relaxing these restrictions.

       We    therefore turn to the direct estimation of ney demand functions.
In particular, we compare the standard formulation, in which real GNP is the
scale variable and the GNP deflator is the price level, to the alternative
formulation, in which            real   consumer spending is the scale variable and the

consumer expenditure deflator is the price level. We also compare the

consumption—based            ndel to the other alternative hypotheses discussed above.
       We estimate this equation:

(T)      log(M)          =       + (1-A) log(Py) +      A       log(P) +   r
                                 +   U2 ((i—A) log(Y) +     A   log(Cfl

where M = the iney supply per capita,
        Py =      the   GNP deflator,

              =   the    consumer expenditure deflator,

        r = the nominal interest rate,
        Y = real GNP per capita,
        C = real consumer expenditure per capita.

The parameter A is the "consumption weight". If A = 0, then the equation
reduces to the standard del is which GNP is the scale variable. If A = 1,
then we obtain the other polar case in which consumer spending is the scale

variable. For intermediate values of the consumption weight, all components

of GNP      generate ney         demand but consumer expenditure generates ire ney

tion weight is sufficient to generate a contractionary shift in the LM curve

     We estimate equation (7)   using   non—linear least squares. In all the

regressions, we also include a time trend, as is standard. To correct for

serial correlation, we quasi—difference (7) and estimate the autoregressive

parameter (rho) simultaneously with the coefficients.1 The interest rate we

use is the commercial paper rate, although the use of other interest rate

series has no important effect on the results. All the other right hand

side variables are annual National Income Accounts series.

     Tables 3a and 3b present the estimates of (7)     for    the recent sample

using    and M2, as currently defined, as the monetary aggregate. The first

column in both tables contains estimates in which the conventional model

based on gross national product (Y) is compared to the consumption—based

model. The value of the consumption weight is 0.76      for   Ml and 0.011   for M2.
The standard errors of these numbers, however, are about 0.5. These figures

indicate that neither polar hypothesis can be rejected. That is, we cannot

reject the conventional specification (A =    0).   We also cannot reject the

other extreme that money demand depends only on consumer expenditure (A =          1).
     The reason for the recent data's inability to speak on this issue beco-

mes apparent in Figure 2, which displays the ratio of nominal consumer



   13We use annual data and do not use lagged dependent variables in an
attempt to avoid some of the statistical problems that plauge earlier work
on money demand. While the use of lagged dependent variables is standard in
money demand studies, we avoid them because of the difficulty in identifying
distributed lags in this way in the presence of serial correlation.
Quarterly money demand functions with distributed lags on the explanatory
variables are presented in the next section. For a discussion of this and
other problems, see Cooley and LeRoy f 19811 and Gordon [198I].
   ll4Estlmatjng the equations in first—differenced form produces results
almost identical to those reported. This result is not surprising, as the
estimated value of the serial correlation correction is very high, indi-
cating that uasi—differericing is close to first—differencing.

expenditure to nominal GNP. During the past two decades, this ratio has
been very   stable. The data cannot distinguish between the two hypotheses

because there has been little ixvement in the relevant independent variable.

During the 1930s, 192405, and early 1950s, however, there is substantial

movement in     the   consumption share of GNP. This earlier period thus provides

a natural experiment that my allow us to distinguish between our two

hypotheses.

      The first column in Table 24a compares the consumption—based model to

the GNP—based model for      the period between 1931   and 1979. The monetary

aggregate is the old M2, which Friedman Schwartz use and is available only

through 1979. As expected, this larger sample period does provide more

Information. The estimated value of the consumption weight is 0.82 with a

standard error of 0.13. We can reject the conventional specification (A =

0)   at the one percent level. We cannot reject the consumption—based alter-

native (A = 1) at even the ten percent level. This regression provides

strong evidence that consumer expenditure generates more money demand than

other components of GNP.

      Columns    (2), (3) and   (14) in Tables 3a, 3b, and 14a compare the

consumption—based model to the other hypotheses discussed above. The esti-

mates indicate the data are more consistent with the view that consumer

expenditure is the relevant scale variable in the money demand equation.

When we use the longer sample period in Table 4a, the consumption weight is

always closer to one than to zero.

      The standard specification of money demand equations places the money

stock   as the left hand side variable. Although in the previous three tables

The two specifications,      (7)   and   (8), represent the same     structural model.

Their estimation, however, need not lead to the same result. Least squares

estimation     of (7) assumes that    the residual is orthogonal to the interest

rate, while estimation of (8)        assumes that the residual is orthogonal to the
money stock. It seems reasonable to examine the robustness of our conclu-
sion regarding the consumption weight to this alternative identification

assumption.

       Table 14b presents the results of estimating (8) for the longer sample
period, 1931—1979, during which there is variation in the consumption share
of GNP.15 The results are similar to those we obtain when we estimate
equation (7). The point estimate for the consumption               weight when the

consumption—based model is         compared to the     conventional specification using

GNP   is 0.96.    We can reject the hypothesis that the consumption weight is

zero, while we cannot reject the hypothesis that the consumption weight is

one •16




   1SEstimating (8) with only recent data produces estimates of A with
standard errors so large that rio inferences can be drawn.
   l6in some ways, the results in Table Ib are unsatisfactory. For example,
the first column implies an income elasticity of 1.6 and an interest semi—
elasticity of 11.5, both of which are taich higher than the range of
generally accepted values.

       E.   Implications of the Estimates

       Our estimates of the money demand                        function allow   us   to make some   crude

inferences         about      the sign of the tax multiplier. Algebraic manipulation of

condition         (6)   with      the       specification (T) shows that tax cuts are côntrac—

tionary if:


(6")          A       >CXCr
                         I    X         X



where       A = the           consumption weight

            Cr =        the   interest semi—elasticity of money demand,
                  =     the   quantity elasticity of money demand,
                  =     the   interest semi—elasticity of investment.


If   private          spending (c+i) or final sales is substituted for GNP in equation

(T),   the implied condition (6") remains the same)7 If disposable income
(Y—T) is      the       alternative, however, then (6') above is the relevant condition

determining the sign of the tax multiplier.

       We can now use              our       estimates   of the money demand function      to check

whether tax cuts are expansionary or contractionary. The only missing para-
meter is the interest semi—elasticity of investment. Table 5                              presents    the
critical value of this parameter for each of                         our   money demand estimates. If
this semi—elasticity exceeds the critical value, then                            tax cuts are contrac—

tionary. As we discussed earlier, estimates of this semi—elasticity suggest



   1TThe data are not powerful enough to allow separate estimation of the
propensity to hold money out of each component of GNP. The theoretical aria—
lysis in Section II indicates that the crucial propensities are LC and L1.
One can view our spec1fication as allowing estimation of these two propen-
sities while imposing alternative a priori constraints on the propensities

a value about     10.

       Not surprisingly, the results from Tables 3a and 3b do not provide a

clear answer to the question of whether tax cuts are expansionary. The

estimates for the post—war period are imprecise and vary widely. For some

specifications, the critical value is far above the plausible range, while

for others, it is far below. Since the recent period provides little infor-

mation on the      relevant scale 'ariable in the iney demand function, it sheds
little    light on the    sign   of   the tax multiplier.

       The results from Tables 1a, however, are unequivocal.              As long as
the   interest elasticity of investment exceeds 21'2,           these   estimates indicate

that tax cuts are contractionary. All             the   estimates using   the entire   sample

imply   that the ratio of the quantity elasticity to the interest semi—

elasticity exceeds two. Moreover, the consumption weight is always close to

one. These two findings imply a critical value of about two or less. Thus,

our   estimates of      the money demand function, together with any         plausible
estimate of the interest semi—elasticity of investment, imply that tax cuts
depress      aggregate demand.18


IV. The Experience of Two Tax Cuts


        The empirical work above indicates that the condition for tax cuts to

be contractionary is probably satisfied for the U.S. econonv. This result,

however, may at first appear incredible. Tax cuts are not an untried



to    hold money out     of other components.

         noted in a previous footnote, the parameter estimates implied by the
      18A5
results in Table 1b are out of line with the range of generally accepted

experiment. Why     does   the historical    experience   not directly refute our
seemingly bizarre    conclusion?

      In this section, we discuss two      of    the largest tax cuts in post—war

history. The first is the 1961e Kennedy—Johnson tax cut,             which   appears to

have had   the   conventional stimulatory effect. The second is the recent

Reagan tax cut, which was followed by the deepest post—war recession.


      A. The 19614 Tax Cut


      The 19614 tax cut is    often viewed    as   the prototy-pe of an   expansionary
tax cut. At the time, it       was   widely considered a successful experiment with
the use of fiscal policy for cro—economic stabilization. The results of
this experiment, however, do not contradict the our            conclusions.    We examine

in this paper the    effect of a tax cut given a particular path of the            uney
supply. In the afterth of the 19614 tax             cut, the   ney supply was    not   in

fact held to a constant path.

      in the his   classic   analysis of the 19614 tax cut, Okun [19681 writes:19


              By arr measure of interest rates or credit conditions I
           know, there were no significant zxnetary changes that would
           have either stiuiuj.ated or restrained         investment to a jor
           degree. Obviously, the rising incomes and investment of this
           period generated increased dends for financial assets and
           for loans. In this environment, the .intainance of stable
           interest rates and stable credit conditions required action by
           the nnetary authority to expand the reserve base re
           rapidly so as to accomodate expansion.

Okun suggests that the experiment tried in 19614 was         effect of a tax
                                                               the

cut   given a particular     path of interest rates. The sign of this tax



   19Ok's analysis of the 19614 tax cut provides the basis for the textbook
discussion in, for example, Dornbusch and Fischer [1981j.
                                       -29-


imiltiplier is negative, regardless of the scale variable in the money demand

function. In fact, the ex post real return on three month treasury bills

declined from 2.3 percent in 19614 to 2.1 percent in 1965 and to l. percent

in 1966. This fact indicates that monetary policy did even more than stabi-

lize real rates in the period following the 19614 tax cut.

       Okun also writes:


                  Itis reasonable to ask how much slower the overall eco-
            nomic advance might have been and how niich less expansionary
            the tax cut would have been if monetary policy bad not been
            accomodatirig. One could hypothesize an alternative monetary
            policy which held the growth of bank reserves or the money
            supply (or other liquidity variables) to some stated degree.
            And one could then try to assess what difference this tighter
            monetary policy would have made in the pace of the economic
            advance. That would be an interesting statistical exercise.
            It just does not happen to be the particular statistical
            exercise which this paper attempts to perform.


Thus, the conventional conclusion that the 19614 tax cut bad a important

role in the subsequent expansion sheds no light on the question we address.


       B. The Recent Episode


       The tax cuts enacted in 1981 provide a better experiment to gauge the

sign   of the tax imiltiplier. The Federal Reserve was committed to           a more

monetarist   policy in the early 1980s than in the 1960g. On its         face, this

recent   experience is not supportive of the conventional Keynesian doctrine.
The increase in the unemployment rate from T.5       percent   in   January   1981 to
10.8   percent   in   December 1982 does not suggest a large stimulatory effect.2°



   200ne   might argue that     the tax cuts took time to have an effect, espe-
cially since the bulk of them took effect only in 1982 and 1983. The widely
accepted permanent income hypothesis, however, implies that their stimula-
tive effect should occt,r as soon as they are announced. In fact, the con—
sumptiori share of      GNP rached a thirty year   peak in 1982.
                                       —30—


     The   large increase in unemployment and      large   fall in output    during this

period was not independent of the monetary policy          pursued.   But nor can the
recession be fully explained by a deceleration of money          growth.    The growth
in Ml, fourth   quarter   to fourth   quarter, was 7. percent     in 1980,   5.2   per-
cent in 1981, and 8.T percent in 1982. The comparable figures for ! are
9.0 percent, 9.3 percent, and     percent. These monetary growth figures do
                                 9.5

not in themselves suggest that monetary policy was overly contractionary.
    The    behavior of velocity during this period, however, was abnormal, and

this fact largely explains the collapse in aggregate demand. Velocity con-

ventionally defined (Y/Ml) fell by 5.7 percent between the fourth quarter of

1981 and the fourth quarter of 1982. The historical average of the change

in velocity between 1961 and 1981 is a increase of 3.2 percent with a stan-

dard deviation of 1.7 percent. Thus, this large fall was by recent histori-

cal standards a very unusual event. An examination of M2 tells a similar

story. The average change in M2 velocity between 1961 and 1981 is about 0.2

percent, with a standard deviation of 2.5 percent. In 1982, however, it

fell by 6. percent. Again, the tall        in   velocity in 1982 was abnormal by

recent historical standards.

     If we examine velocity defined using personal consumer expenditure, the

recession appears more normal. C/Ml fell from the fourth quarter of 1981 to

the fourth quarter of 1982 by only 1.1 percent, Although still large rela-

tive to the historical average increase of 3.0 percent, this drop is less

unusual than the 5.7 percent fall in Y/Ml. dM2 fell by 2.8 percent, which

is only slightly more than one standard deviation from the mean change of

zero and mich less that the 6.1 percent fall in Y/M2. With both monetary
                                         —31—



aggregates,    the behavior of consumption velocity is more normal than the

behavior of velocity conventionally defined.

        The same   story emerges   from an examination of the forecasting perfor—

mance    of conventional money demand equations. We estimate quarterly money
demand    functions for the period 1961:1 to 198O:I.        The interest     rate and
quantity    variable enter the equation as a second order Almon           lag over the
current and    three     past quarters. The residual is assumed      to   follow a first—
order autoregressive        process. We estimate both the standard specification,

in   which GNP is the scale variable, and the alternative specification, in
which    consumer spending is the scale variable. The results from this esti-

mation are summarized in Table 6a.21

        Using the two formulations, we forecast money holdings from 1981:]. to

198:1 using the observed path of interest rates, GP arid             consumer   spending.

The   forecast errors      are presented, quarter by quarter, in Table 6b.

Although    not reported, we also     tried   breaking the sample   at other points

besides 1981:1. The results were almost identical to those in Table 6b.

      An examination of the forecast errors from the standard specification

demonstrates      a large increase in money     holdings starting toward the     end of
1982. By the trough of the recession (l982:I), this specification underpre—
dicts money demand by 4.l percent. The alternative specification underpre—
dicts   by only    1.6   percent. Similarly, the conventional specification

underpredicts M2 holding by 2.T percent at the trough, while the alternative

specification actually overpredicts by 1.1 percent. The root mean squared

and decrease (in absolute value) the interest semi—elasticity, making the LM
curve more vertical.

 error, which summarizes the       forecasting performance    of the two equations,

 indicates that the specification based on consumption outperforms the sped-

 fication based on GNP by thirty or forty percent.

        In suary-, the collapse in aggregate demand leading to the 1982

recession is largely attributable to the abnormal fall in velocity or,

equivalently, to the large increase in money demand. We can              explain   at

least    part of this change by the strength in consumer spending. If           policy—
makers had     viewed money   demand as determined by consumer spending, the
recent     behavior of money demand and the depth of the recession would have

been less surprising.22


V. Conclusions


        Our analysis calls into question the standard Keynesian conclusion that

personal tax cuts increase aggregate demand even without monetary acconioda—

tion.      Both a   priori considerations and historical experience suggest that

GNP is     not the   appropriate scale variable in money demand functions.

Replacing GNP with consumer        expenditure or disposable income is sufficient
to   alter dramatically the implications of standard Keynesian models. The

econonor's   expansion following the 19614 tax easily explained by the
                                                  cut is

accomodative monetary policy. Moreover, our modification of the standard
money demand function can      help   explain the anoinolous behavior of velocity
following the 1981 tax      cut.

      It   is important to recognize two     limitations   of our   analysis.   First,

   22The rapid recovery of output in 1983 does not provide evidence of the
efficacy of the tax cuts. Ml growth was 10.1 percent from the fourth
quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, compared with 8.7 percent in
1982 and 5.2 percent in 1981. Three—month Treasury bill yields declined by
14io basis points betveen July 1982 and January 1983. There is every reason
                                         —33—


we examine only the effects of tax cuts on aggregate demand. We do not

discuss their effects on supply decisions. Our             conclusions,   therefore, do

not shed light on the appropriate level of taxation or public spending in

the long run. Second, our analysis considers the effect of tax cuts

assuming a constant path of some monetary aggregate. Depending on the Fed's

reaction function, a wide range of alternaite outcomes is possible. Our

assumption    that the money    stock   is held constant in the face of tax changes,

however,     is a natural and conventional benchmark.
        Our results have important implications for economic policy during a
period    of large budget deficits. They suggest that even large personal tax

increases or reductions in transfer payments need not reduce the level of

economic activity. Indeed, by reducing interest rates, they might even

speed the recovery. In contrast, sharp          reductions    in government purchases

might    significantly reduce aggregate demand if      a    constant   monetary policy

were    pursued.   A similar conclusion applies to business tax increases.

Unlike personal tax increases, business taxes do not reduce the demand for

money; these taxes thus have the standard contractionary effect on aggregate

demand. In short, assessing the short—run impact of deficit—reducing

measures requires a careful examination of their implications for money

demand.

       Our   results   also have important implications for monetary policy.

Government fiscal policy actions that change the composition of GNP systema-
tically affect the velocity of money. Tax increases, for example, which




to believe that monetary       and not fiscal policy   is    thecauseof     therécovery.
 reduce the share of consumption and d.isposable income in GNP, increase velo-
city. By suggesting yet another reason for expecting velocity to be
variable, our results further call into question the desirability of
targetting netary aggregates.
    Our analysis considers the impact of fiscal policy changes in a closed
econor. It would be easy to extend it by considering open econonj effects.
In an open econoxxr, it would be natural to consider the possibility that

money demand depends on absorbtion rather than GNP. Along               with   the standard

Mundell—Fleming small country assumptions, this dification could imply a

negative miltiplier for both increases in government spending and                   cuts   in

taxes •   The   U.S •   current   account has   not varied enough   to make   it    easy to

identify separately the marginal propensities to hold cney out                 of   GNP and

absorbtion. Such an examination, however, should be possible using data for

other countries. In addition, international data would be valuable in

shedding further light on whether consumption, GNP or some other component

of   domestic income is the appropriate scale variable in the ney demand
function.

      Future    research could extend our empirical results in several other
directions. Cross—sectional data could be brought to bear on the question
of what scale variable is appropriate in the ney demand function. Our
empirical analysis could be replicated using alternative m,netary aggregates
and adding other variables to the ney demand function along the lines
discussed   in Laidler [197T1 and  Judd and Scadding [1983). In addition, it
would   be valuable to embed a money demand function with consumption as a
scale variable in a large Keynesian macro—econometric de1 and then to exa—

mine its properties. This experiment would refine   the   highly   stylized
calculations presented here.
