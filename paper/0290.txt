        Current views about flexible exchange rate systems are based, to a
large extent, on the lessons from the period of the 1920's during which
many exchange rates were flexible. This paper re—examines the evidence from
the perspective of the recently revived monetary approach (or more generally,
asset—market approach) to the exchange rate. The analysis starts by developing
a simple monetary model of exchange rate determination. The key characteristic
of the model lies in the notion that, being a relative price of two monies,
the equilibrium exchange rate is attained when the existing stocks of the
two monies are willingly held. The equilibrium exchange rate is shown to
depend on both real and monetary factors which operate through their influence
on the relative demands and supplies of monies. The analysis then proceeds to
examine the relationship between spot and forward rates for the Franc/Pound,
Dollar/Pound and Franc/Dollar exchange rates and the results are shown to be
consistent with the efficient market hypothesis.
        The monetary model is then estimated using monthly data and using the
forward premium on foreign exchange as a measure of expectations. In addition
to the single—equation ordinary--least—squares estimates, the various exchange,
rates are also estimated as a system using the mixed—estimation procedure which
combines the sample information with prior information which derives from the
homogeneity postulate and from known properties of the demand for money. The
various results are shown to be consistent with the predictions of the monetary
model.

Introduction

        Current views about flexible exchange rate systems are based, to a

large extent, on the lessons from the period of the 1920's during which

many exchange rates were flexible. The experience of that period has proven

to be extremely important in shaping current thinking about, and understanding

of, the operation of flexible exchange rates. It led to an examination of

various issues that are associated with a regime of flexible exchange rates

like speculation, the efficiency of the foreign exchange markets, the

purchasing power parity doctrine, the factors which determine equilibrium

exchange rates, and the like.1 This paper reexamines some of these issues

from the perspective of the recently revived monetary approach (or more

generally, asset—market approach) to the exchange rate. In Section I we

develop a simple monetary model of exchange rate determination. The key

characteristic of the model lies in the notion that, being a relative price

of two monies, the equilibrium exchange rate is attained when the existing

stocks of the two monies are willingly held. The equilibrium exchange rate

is shown to depend on both real and monetary factors which operate through

their influence on the relative demands and supplies of monies. In Section II

we examine some of the efficiency properties of the foreign exchange market

where we analyze the relationship between spot and forward rates for the

Franc/Pound, Dollar/Pound and Franc/Dollar exchange rates. Section III

        'See, for example, Aliber (1962), Dulles (1929), Fara and Ott (1964),
Frenkel (1978 ), Hodgson (1972), Stolper (1948) and Tsiang (1959—60).

contains the results of the empirical test of the monetary model of exchange

rate determination. Using monthly data we estimate various versions of the

model and allow for interrelationships between the various exchange rates,

we then use the estimated parameters for dynamic simulations. Section IV

contains some concluding remarks.




I. A Model of Exchange Rate Determination

       In this section we outline a simple model of exchange rate determina-

tion which reflects the recent revival of the monetary approach (or more

generally, the asset—market approach) to the analysis of exchange rates.1

The monetary view of exchange rate determination emphasizes that the exchange

rate, being the relative price of two national monies, is determined primarily

by factors which affect the relative supplies and demands for these monies.

Since the demands for the various national monies depend on expectations,

incomes, rates of return and other considrations which are relevant for

portfolio choice, the approach is referred to as an asset—market approach to

the determination of exchange rates. The major building blocks of the theory

are hypotheses concerning (i) the properties of the demand for money (ii) the

purchasing power parity condition and (iii) the iteret -parity theory

        Consider first the equilibrium in the money markets. The supplies

of domestic and foreign real balances are M/P and M*/P* where M and P denote

the nominal money supply and the price level, respectively, and where variables

pertaining to the foreign country are indicated by an asterisk. Denoting the

        1For theoretical developments and applications of the approach see,
for example, Dornbusch (1976a,1976b), Kouri (1976), Mussa (1976), Frenkel
(1976), Frenkel and Johnson (1978), Bilson (1978) and Hodrick (1978).

demands for real balances by L and L* (both of which are functions which

will be specified below), equilibrium in the money markets is attained when


(1)     L = M/P and


(2)        =   M*/P*.

From equations (l)—(2), equilibrium in the money markets implies that the

ratio of the two price levels is:


()
        P _N L*
        p* M*L
        The second building block links domestic and foreign prices through

the purchasing power parity condition according to which,


(4)     P=SP*

where S denotes the spot exchange rate——the price of foreign exchange in terms

of domestic currency.1 Using equation (4) in (3) yields

          _M L*
        S_M*L
which expresses the exchange rate in terms of domestic and foreign supplies

and demands for money. To gain further insight, into the determinants of

the exchange rate, assume that the demand for money depends on real income

(y) and the rate of interest (i) according to:


            n    —cii
(6)     L=aye
                   11*    —c*j*
(7)     L* =   b*y*      e

Using equations (6)—(7) in (5) and assuming for simplicity of exposition that

foreign and domestic parameters of the demand for money are the same, i.e.,

         'For a discussion of the choice of the relevant price index to be used
 in equation (4) see Frenkel (1978 ). To the extent that purchasing power parity
pertains to traded goods only, the exchange rate equation would also contain terms
which relate to the relative prices of traded to non—traded goods; for a formulation
                                                        4

that a =         a*,   and that           = n*, we   obtain:


(8)        Zn S = C + Zn                  + r Zn       + a(1 —   i*)
where C          Zn(b*/a).

           Denoting a percentage change in a variable by a circumflex (e.g.,

x =    L\xIx),    the percentage change in the exchange rate is:


(9)        S = (M — M*)           + (y* — y) + a(i

Equation (9) relates the percentage change in the exchange rate to the

differences between domestic and foreign (i) rates of monetary expansion,

(ii) rates of growth of real incomes, and (iii) changes in interest rate

differentials.

           The third building block is the interest parity theory according to

which, in equilibrium, the premium on a forward contract for foreign exchange

for a given maturity is (approximately) equal to the interest rate differential:


(10)       i —     i* =   Tr;   ir       Zn (F/S)


where ir denotes the forward premium on foreign exchange and where F denotes

the forward exchange rate. Substituting (10) into (8) and (9) yields:

                                     M
(11)       Zn S         C + Zn            + r Zn y*—   + cr

(12)              S = (M — M*)           + (y* — y) + aMr

The role of expectations in the determination of exchange rates is summarized

by the forward premium or discount on foreign exchange. The monetary approach

that is summarized in equations (1l)—(12) differs from previous approaches to

exchange rate determination in that concep1 like exports, imports, tariffs and

along these lines see Dornbusch (1976b). A more refined specification would allow
for the effects of tariffs on the relationship between domestic and foreign prices
as well as for short—run effects of unanticipated money on output rather than only
on prices and the exchange rate.

the like, do not appear as being fundamentally relevant for the understanding

of the evolution of the exchange rate. Rather, the relevant concepts

relate to two groups of variables: first are those which are determined by

the monetary authorities andsecond, are those which affect the demands

for domestic and foreign monies.

        The implications of the model are that, ceteris paribus, (i) a rise

in the supply of domestic money will depreciate the home currency (i.e.,

raise 5) while a rise in the supply of foreign money will appreciate the

home currency; (ii) a rise in domestic income will appreciate the currency

(lower S), while arise in foreign income will depreciate the currency,

and (iii) a rise in the forward premium on foreign exchange will depreciate

the currency (raise 5). This dependence of the current exchange rate on

expectations concerning the future rate (as summarized by the forward premium) is

a typical characteristic of price determination in asset markets. Thus,

an expected future depreciation of the currency is reflected immediately

in the current value of the currency. The model yields the following predic-

tions concerning the values of the various elasticities (1) the elasticity

of the exchange rate with respect to the domestic money supply is unity

and the elasticity with respect to the foreign money supply is minus unity, (ii) the

elasticity with respect to domestic and foreign real incomes should approxi-

mate the income elasticities of the demand for money   (positive for foreign

income and negative for domestic income), and (iii) the (semi) elasticity

with respect to the forward premium should approximate (in absolute value)

the interest (semi) elasticity of the demand for money. These predictions

are examined in Section III below.

        In the above model we have not drawn the distinction between "the

demand for domestic money" and "the domestic demand for money." Implicitly
                                      6

it has been assumed that domestic money is demanded only by domestic

residents while foreign money is demanded only by foreign residents.

Furthermore, the formulation of the demands for real cash balances (in

equations (6)—(7)) included the domestic interest rate in the domestic

demand, and the foreign interest rate in the foreign demand; it has been

implicitly assumed that the only relevant alternative for holding domestic

money is domestic securities while the only relevant alternative for

holding foreign money is foreign securities. Inprinciple, however, the

alternatives to holding domestic money are domestic securities as well as

foreign securities and foreign exchange. It follows that a richer formula-

tion of the demand for money would recognize that, as an analytical matter,

the spectrum of alternative assets and rates of return that are relevant

for the specification of the demand for money is rather broad, including

both rates of interest, i and i*, as well as the forward premium on foreign

exchange it.   Furthermore, to the extent that under a flexible exchange rate
system individuals might wish to diversify their currency holdings, the

demand for domestic money would include a foreign component which depends

on foreign income, while the demand for foreign money would include a domestic

component which depends on domestic income.1 These characteristics reflect

the phenomenon of currency substitution which is likely to arise when the

exchange rate is not pegged.2


        1For a discussion of the specification of the demand for money under
a flexible exchange rate regime see Frenkel (1977, 1979 ) and Abel, Dornbusch,
Ruizinga and Marcus (1979).
        2For an analysis of the phenomenon of currency substitution see
Boyer (1973), Chn (1973), Chrystal (1977), Girton and Roper (1976), Miles
(1976), Stockman (1976) and Calvo and Rodriguez (1977). On the extent of
currency substitution during the German hyperinflation see Frenkel (1977).
                                              7

           The above discussion suggests the need for a more detailed specif i—

cation of the demand for money. Let domestic demand for domestic money

depend on domestic income and on the three alternative rates of return

according to:


(13)       L1 = ay   exp(—a11 —          —


and let the foreign demand for domestic money be

                     1*
(14)       L = a*y* 1exp(—ai— ii* —
where the total demand for domestic money is L1 + L = L.          Analogously, the

demand for foreign money is also composed of domestic and foreign components:
domestic demand for foreign money L2 and foreign demand for foreign money L*

according to:


(15)       L2 = by
                     12.
                     exp(—ct2l —   21*   +


(16)       L = b*y*     exp(—cti —   i*      + 'yr)

where the total demand for foreign money is L2 + L =        L*.


           Using the above relationships, the domestic and

the foreign demands for money are L1 + L2 and L + L, respectively. Substi-

tuting equations (l3)—(16) into equation (5) yields the more general relation-

ship between the exchange rate and the various components of the supplies

and demands for the two monies. For expositional simplicity, assume that

all the various income elasticities of money demands are equal toe, i.e.,

that       =       =2   =   = r,   that the semi—elasticities of the demands for

money with respect to both interest rates are equal, i.e., that           =    =

*   (i =   1,2),   and that the semi—elasticities of the demands for money with

respect to the forward premium on foreign exchange are equal to y, i.e., that
                                                 8

     =      =2         =
                                y•   Under these assumptions the exchange rate can be

written as:


(17)             = M by + b*y*1
                   M*
                           ay +   a*y*11
                                           e
where            2y.

From (17), the percentage change in the exchange rate is


(18)        S = (M — M*)          + r (A* + A — 1) (y* — y) + Mr

where

                       L/L* and
             A
                       L1/L.
            The implications of equation (18) are similar to those of equation
(12) except for the inference concerning the elasticity of the exchange rate
with     respect to real incomes. When individuals hold diversified portfolios
of   currencies, the effects of income growth on the exchange rate depend on

the income elasticity of the demand for money as well as on the parameters

A and A* indicating the currency mix of money holdings. If domestic and

foreign residents hold portfolios with identical currency mixes, changes in

incomes will not affect the exchange rate. In general, it is expected that

the typical portfolio of currencies will be intensive in the local currency

and thus, that both A and A* are each larger than one—half and, therefore,

that A + A* >           1.     Under these circumstances it is expected that the elasticity

of the exchange rate with respect to domestic income would be negative while

the elasticity with respect to foreign income would be positive but somewhat

less than the corresponding income elasticities of the demands for money since

(A + A* — 1) is less than unity. In the special case where currency holdings
                                    9

are not diverisifed, individuals hold only local currency, A =    = 1,
and equation (18) reduces to equation (12).

             In this section we outlined a simple model of the determinants

of the relative price of two monies. The major determinants of the exchange

rate and its evolution were      described in terms of the relative supplies

and demands for domestic and foreign monies. The prime determinants of the

relative demands    were   shown to be relative incomes, the currency mix

of portfolios and expectations concerning the future evolution of the exchange

rate as measured by the fonqard premium on foreign exchange. The special role

that is played by expectations concerning future course of events is a typical

characteristic of the determinants of prices in asset markets. From the

policy perspective, the model highlights the unique role played by the

monetary authorities in affecting the rate of exchange.

        Prior to concluding this section it should be emphasized that the

monetary (or the asset—market) approach to the exchange rate does not claim

that the exchange rate is "determined" only in the money or in the asset—

markets and that only stock rather than flow considerations are relevant for

determining the equilibrium exchange rate. Obviously, general equilibrium

relationships which are relevant for the determination of exchange rates

include both stock and flow variables. In this respect, the asset market

equilibrium relationship that has been used, may be viewed as a reduced form

relationship. Furthermore, the fact that the analysis of the exchange rate

has been carried out in terms of the supplies and the demands for monies,

does not imply that "only money matters"; on the contrary, the demand for

money depends on real variables like real income as well as on other real

variables which underlie expectations. The rationale for concentrating on
                                   10

the relative supplies and demands for money is that they provide a convenient

and a natural framework for organizing thoughts concerning the determinants

of the relative price of monies. It is the same principle which has been

used by proponents of the monetary approach to the balance of payments in

justifying the use of the money demand—money supply framework for the

analysis of the money account of the balance of payments under a pegged exchange

rate system.1

II. Efficiency of Foreign Exchange Markets

        In the previous section we outlined the basic building blocks of an

asset market approach to the determination of exchange rates. We have argued

thát:-since the exchange rate is the relative price of two assets, it

depends (like other asset prices) on expectations concerning the future course

of events. We have suggested to measure these expectations by using data

from the forward market for foreign exchange.

        The assumption underlying the use of data from the forward market

for foreign exchange is that this market is indeed useful in conveying

information concerning expectations held by market participants. Therefore,

prior to incorporating such data in the empirical analysis of exchange

rate determination, it is important to study some of the characteristics

of the market. In this section we examine some of the efficiency properties

of the market for foreign exchange.2___________



        'See for example Mussa (1974) and Frenkel and Johnson (1976); in
the context of flexible exchange rates the same argument is made by Dornbusch
(l976b) and Mussa (1976).

         2For an application of the same methodology in analyzing the efficiency
properties of the foreign exchange market during the German hyperinflation
 (1921—1923) see Frenkel (1976, 1977, 1979).   For an application to the l920's
and the 1970's see Krugman (1977) and for a survey see Levich (1978).
                                    11


         If the foreign exchange market is efficient and if the exchange

rate is determined in a fashion similar to other asset prices, we should

expect that current prices reflect all available information. Expectations

concerning future exchange rates should be incorporated and reflected in

forward exchange rates. To examine the efficiency of the market we first

regress the logarithm of the current spot exchange rate, 2n S, on the

logarithm of the one—month forward exchange rate prevailing at the previous

month, Ln Ft_i, as in equation (19). Similar regressions are also computed

using the levels of the exchange rates rather than their logarithms, as

in
     equation_(19').
(i9)            in S = a + bin Ft_i + u


(19')
                  Sa'+b'F1+v
         If the market for foreign exchange is efficient and if the forward

exchange rate Is an unbiased forecast of the future spot exchange rate,

then we expect the following three properties: (I) the constant terms

in equations (19) and (19')should not differ significantly from zero, (ii)

the slope coefficients should not differ significantly from unity and, (iii)

the residuals      should be serially uncorrelated. We examine three

exchange rates: the Franc/Pound, the Dollar/Pound and the Franc/Dollar.

Obviously, only two of the three rates are independent due to triangular

arbitrage. Equations (]9)—(19') were estimated using monthly data for

51 months over the period February 1921—May 1925 (for details on the data

and on data sources see Appendix B). The resulting ordinary—least—

squares estimates are reported in Tables 1 and 2. Also reported in these

Tables are regression results which include F_2 as an additional explana—

       As can be seen the results are consistent with the three hypotheses outlined

above. In all cases the constant terms do not differ significantly from zero at the

95 percent confidence level. Furthermore, the Durbin—Watson statistics are consis-

tent with the hypothesis of the absence of first—order autocorrelated residuals.1

In all cases, at the 95 percent confidence level, we cannot reject the joint hypoth-

esis that the constant terms are zero and that the slope coefficients are unity.

      We have argued above that in an efficient market, expectations concerning

future exchange rates are reflected in forward rates and, that spot exchange rates

reflect all available information. If forward exchange rates prevailing at period

t—l summarize all relevant information available at that period, they should also

contain the information that is summarized in data corresponding to period t—2.

It thus follows that including additional lagged values of the forward rates in

equations (19) and (19') should not greatly affect the coefficients of determination

and should not yield coefficients that differ significantly from zero. The results

reported in Tables 1 and 2 are consistent with this hypothesis; in all cases the

coeffcients of F2 do not differ significantly from zero and the inclusion of

the additional lagged variables has not improved the £ it.2


        1With n = 50 and with one explanatory variable and a constant, the lower
and upper bounds of the 5 percent points of the Durbin—Watson test statistic are
dL = 1.50 and d = 1.59. The corresponding bounds of the one percent points are
dL = 1.32 and dU = 1.40. Thus in all cases, at the one percent confidence level,
we cannot rejec the hypothesis that successive residuals are not correlated. At
the 5 percent confidence level we reach the same conclusion in all cases except
for the Dollar/Pound exchange rate for which the value of the Durbin—Watson
statistic falls in the inconclusive range. We have also examined higher order
correlation up to 12 lags; no correlation of any order was significant.
        2To test whether F — contains all available information, we have also
followed the procedure uses y Fama (1975) and have included the lagged dependent
variable S1 instead of the additional lagged independent variable Ft2 Since,
however, S1 andF1 are highly correlated, the resulting point estimates are
imprecise.   However, as expected the sums of the coefficients of Ftl and 5t—l
do not differ significantly from unity. It might be noted that since F 1 and
S —  summarize information concerning the same period, they are expecte to be
hgily correlated. In this sense the use of the pair Ftl and Ft2 seems preferable.
On the relationship between forward and future spot rates, see      Fama (1976).

                   The results reported in this section are consistent with the

         hypotheses that during the period under consideration the markets for

_____foreign exchange seem to have been effjcjen, and            the   various   forward exchange
         rates   seem to have been unbiased forecasts of the future spot exchange rates.

         These results provide support to the notion that data from the forward market

         for foreign exchange provide useful information concerning expectations held


          by market participants. In the following section we win use these data

          as measures of expectations in the analysis of the determinants of exchange rates.


          III. Empirical Tests of the Monetary
               Approach to the Exchange Rate

                   In this section we incorporate the information about expectations into

          the estimation of the monetary model of exchange rate determination. We start

          with an analysis of the sampie information.


          111.1 Estimates of the Model: Sample Information

                   The analysis in Section I implies that the exchange rate between two

          currencies can be expressed in terms of domestic and foreign monies, incomes,

          and the forward premium on foreign exchange which reflects expectations. Thus,

          for estimation purposes, the exchange rate between currencies i and j at time t

          can be written as:


          (20)     thS
                         ijt
                                    c0ii + 1ij2.nMit +c2ii ZnMjt +a3ij nyit

                               ii       it    ii ijt     ijt


          where u .
                 ijt
                       is   a stochastic disturbance term.             -    -


          In   terms of our previous notations, if i denotes the home country and j the

          foreign country then 2n M refers to 2n N, 2n Mi refers to Ln M*, with analogous
                                    16
notations pertaining to real incomes. As indicated above, the prior expec-

tations are that the elasticity of the exchange rate with respect to domestic

money supply is unity while the corresponding elasticity with respect to

foreign money supply is minus unity. The discussion concerning currency

substitution suggests that we do not have clear prior expectations concerning

the magnitude of the income elasticities; we expect, however, that the

elasticity with respect to domestic income is negative while the elasticity

with respect to foreign income is positive. Finally, we expect the elasticity

of the exchange rate with respect to the forward premium to be positive,

and related to the magnitude of      the interest semi—elasticity of the

demand for money.

        We have examined three pairs of currencies: the Franc/Pound, the

Franc/Dollar and the Dollar/Pound exchange rates. Since, however, only two

of these rates are independent due to triangulararbitrage, we analyze in

detail only the Franc/Pound and the Franc/Dollar exchange rates.1 Using

monthly data on exchange rates, monies, incomes and the forward premiaon

foreign exchange, we have estimated equation (20) in first differences for

the two rates.2 These results are reported in Table 3. As is apparent, due

to the high degree of collinearity, the individual parameter estimates are

extremely imprecise; we will deal with this problem below. It should be noted,

however, that in terms of the overall fit the regression equations as a whole

are reasonably satisfactory,.particulary in view of the fact that the model is

estimated using monthly data. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the overall fit


        11t should be noted that some of the results obtained for the Dollar!
Pound exchange rate are not in full agreement with the implications of the
other two rates. We intend to elaborate on the analysis of the Dollar/Pound
rate in a separate paper.

by plotting actual and fitted values of the two exchange rates.1

        The foregoing analysis has viewed the equation determining the

Franc/Pound exchange rate as being completely separated from the corresponding

equation determining the Franc/Dollar exchange rate. Implicitly it has been

assumed that the right—hand side of equation (2Q) represents all that there

is to know about the specific regression equation. In practice, however,

various exchange rates may be subject to common shocks reflecting the fact

that markets are interrelated and that in a fundamental sense, the various

exchange rates belong to a global system. To allow for the correlation among

disturbances we have viewed the two exchange rates as forming a system of

equations and have reestimated the system using Zeilner's (1962) method for

estimating seemingly unrelated regressions.2 The estimates are reported in

Table 4 and, as may be seen, the qualitative results are similar to those of

the single equation estimates: the individual parameter estimates are extremely

imprecise while the overall fit is reasonably satisfactory. In what follows

we attempt to improve the precision of the individual parameter estimates.


111.2 Combining Sample and Prior Information

         Due to the high degree of collinearity, the information that is con-

tained in the sample is not sufficient to provide precise estimates of the

various parameters; at best the sample information can provide estimates of

the overall fit of the various regression equations. In order to obtain

         1In computing the fitted values of the exchange rate, we have added
the fitted change in the exchange rate (from Table 3) to the previous periods'
actual level of the exchange rate; thus, in effect, we have computed the one
period forecast. The dynamic simulations reported in Table 7 below deal with
the multiperiod forecast.
         2This procedure allows for both heteroscedasticity and correlation
across equations by applying the Aitken estimator to the model when it is
stacked equation by equation.

estimates that are more precise, a proper procedure is to supplement the

information that is contained in the sample with some prior information.

In incorporating the prior information, one may     follow   the Bayesian procedures

or, alternatively, apply the mixed—estimation procedure.1 In what follows

we implement the mixed—estimation procedure which, as is shown in Appendix A,

may be given a Bayesian interpretation.

         We turn now to the specification of the prior information. The

homogeneity postulate along with other studies on the relationship among

money, prices and the exchange rate yield prior information concerning the

elasticity of the exchange rate with respect to domestic and foreign monies,

while evidence on the demand for money provide prior information concerning

the elasticity of the exchange rate with respect to the forward premium. The

prior knowledge is formulated in terms of stochastic restrictions on these

     consistent with other studies on the relationship between money prices and

     the exchange rate, our prior estimates of the elasticities of the exchange

     rate with respect to domestic and foreign money supplies are unity and minus

     unity, respectively. We allow however for some uncertainty about these

     parameter values by including the random terms v and w which are assumed to

     be distributed normally with a zero mean and a variance of .01. Thus, using

     the 2—sigma range, the approximate 95 percent confidence intervals for r.

     and r. are (.8, 1.2) and(—.8, —1.2) respectively.

             The prior knowledge about the elasticity of the exchange rate with

     respect to the forward premium stems from estimates of the demand for money

     and is formulated in a similar fashion. It is assumed that
                                                                                     —-

            r.   =   c. + s..; E(s..) =   0, E(s) = 1.00 for all i and j,

                                            = 0 for all i # i', j
     (22)



                               E(V..s.,.t)E(w.s,,)Ofor all 1, i', j, j'.

     Our prior estimate of the coefficient on the forward premium is 4. In terms

     of equation (9), with a monthly interest rate of one percent, this amounts to

     an interest elasticity of the demand for money of —.04 which is consistent

    with Goldfeld's (1973) estimates for the United States. The variance of the

     disturbance terms s implies that the 95 percent confidence interval for the

    prior estimate of the interest elasticity of the demand for money is approxi-

    mately (—.02, _.06).1
            The basic idea underlying the mixed—estimation method is to combine

     the prior information about some of the parameters with the information that

_____is contained in the sample. The_prior information has been     summarized in

              'In terms of the currency substitution model (equation (18)),, this
     amounts to an interest elasticity of —.02 with a 95 percent confidence
     interval of (—.01, —.03).

equations (21)—(22) and the sample information has been summarized in Tables

3 and 4. Themixed—estimation procedure combines these two sources of inf or—

mation. Since neither of these two sources provides complete information

about the coefficients, the estimates that are implied by the two sources may

differ om each other. Therefore, prior to implementing the mixed—estimation

procedure, it is important to verify that the sample and the prior information

are compatible with each other. Under the null—hypothesis that the sample and

the prior information are compatible, the relevant test is a x2 test with

degrees of freedom corresponding to the number of restrictions. Performing

the compatibility test resulted in     values of 2.88 and .74 for the Franc!

Pound and the Franc/Dollar exchange rates while the critical value for 2(3)

at the .05 level is 7.82. Thus, since we cannot reject_the compatibility
hypothesis, we proceed with combining the two sources of information by

implementing the mixed—estimation procedure to the first differences of the data.

Details on the estimation procedure are provided in Appendix A.

          The resulting mixed estimates forthe two exchange rates are reported

in Table 5. As may be seen, the results are consistent with the predictions

of the monetary model. For both exchange rates the constant terms do not differ

significantly from zero indicating that when we take account of the economic

variables, there is not further autonomous trend to the exchange rates. Also,

for both-exchange rates, the elasticities with respect to domestic and foreign

money supplies are unity and minus unity, respectively. These estimates are

highly significant; they are about ten times the size of the corresponding

standard errors. The semi—elasticities of the exchange rates with respect to

the forward   premia are about 4. Also these estimates are   highly significant;

they   are about four times the size of the corresponding standard errors. The
high level of significance reflects the fact that the sample provides    very little

information concerning the magnitude of the individual parameters and,

therefore, in computing the various parameter estimates, a high weight is

given to the prior information. In Table 5 the income elasticities are not

significant at the 95 percent confidence level. In the only case where the

income elasticity comes close to being significant (foreign income in the

Franc/Pound exchange rate) it has the correct positive sign. The low values

of the income elasticities may reflect a poor measure of income' as well as

some of the implications of diversified portfolios of currencies that were

outlined in Section I.

         In an anlogous manner to the procedure of the single equation analysis

we have also applied the mixed—estimation procedure to the system of equations

using the method for estimating seemingly unrelated regressions. The results,

which are reported in Table 6,are similar to those of the single equation

estimates: the estimates are consistent with the predictions of the monetary

model of exchange rate determination. The constant terms do not differ

significantly from zero, the elasticities of the exchange rates with respect

to domestic and foreign money supplies and the forward premia are significant

and have the expected size, and all income elasticities have the expected

sign even though, as before, they are not significant. Also reported in Table

6 is the correlation coefficient between the residuals of the two exchange

rate equations. The high correlation (.954) indicates the potential gain from

the application of the estimation method of seemingly unrelated equations.2


         1We have also estimated these equations using some measure of permanent
income (a distributed lag of the measure of current income) instead of the
income variable used here. The resulting income elasticities did not differ
significantly from zero.
             might be noted that in this case the    statistic testing for
compatibility of the sample and prior information is 14.72 which exceeds 12.59——
the critical value of 2(3) at the .05 level; it is, however, smaller than 16.81——
the corresponding critical value at the .01 level. Note that the quasi—R2 that
is reported for each equation is only suggestive since, strictly speaking, the
goodness of fit should be analyzed for the sytem as a whole.

     111.3 Dynamic Simulations of the Model

               In what follows we investigate how well the estimated models track

     the (logarithm of the) levels of the exchange rates over the sample period.

     We simulate the model dynamically by taking only the initial value of the

     exchange rate as given and taking the simulated value to be the predicted rate

     of change plus the lagged (logarithm of the) exchange rate as predicted by the

     model for the previous month. It should be emphasized that this dynamic simula-

     tion is a severe test of the predictive ability of the model since simulation

     errors may accumulate over time.

               Table 7 contains the results of these dynamic simulations for the

     various             models using parameter estimates derived from the single
                     -



     equation and the system estimation methods As may be seen the various models

     perform reasonably well in tracking the exchange rates over the sample period.

—   Th        ror for the Franc/Pound exchange rate ranges from 0.7 percent to-3.4
      percent while the mean error for the Franc/Dollar exchange rate ranges from

    —4.7 percent to —8.0 percent. In general, the simulations of the Franc/Pound

      rate perform better than those of the Franc/Dollar rate. On the whole there

     is no marked difference between the performance
                                                         of simulations based on the

     sample estimates and those that are based on the mixed estimates. This result

     is noteworthy since it highlights the fact that the sample does provide satis-

     factory information on the overall relationship, and that the application of

     the mixed—estimation procedure is aimed at improving the precision of the indi-

     vidual parameter estimates. Comparison of the performance of the single equation

     estimates with those of the system estimates show that the simulations based

     on the single equations perform somewhat better.

value of the previous period's level plus the predicted change for the current period. Recall that the model is esti-
mated in  firstdifferences. Since the simulations refer to the logarithm of the exchange rate levels, the error stat-
istics are percentages when multiplied by 100.

IV. Concluding Remarks

       The evolution of the international monetary system into a regime of

floating exchange rates has led to a renewed interest in the economics of

exchange rates which resulted in new developments in the theory of exchange rate

determination. The central insight of the monetary approach to the exchange

rate is that the exchange rate, being a relative price of two monies, is

determined in a manner similar to that of other asset prices. Equilibrium

is attained when the existing stocks are willingly held and one of the important

determinants of current prices is expectations concerning the future course of
events. Since current views concerning the operation of flexible exchange

rate systems are based, to a large extent, on the experience of the 1920's,

we have reexamined in this paper the determinants of exchange rates during

the 1920's from the analytical perspective of the monetary approach. After

developing a simple model of exchange rate determination, we have examined

the efficiency of the foreign exchange markets and have estimated the model

using monthly data. We have found that the foreign exchange markets were

efficient and that the forward exchange rate was an unbiased forecast of

the future spot rate. We have then used the forward premium on foreign

exchange as a measure of expectations in estimating the monetary model of the

exchange rate. The various results were found to be consistent with the

theoretical predictions.

         Rather than summarizing the results, we wish to highlight some of the

methodological issues raised by the empirical work. The first involves the

use of monthly data. Since it is believed that asset markets clear relatively

fast, it is desirable to use frequent observations. We have used monthly

data since this is the shortest maturity for which data on forward contracts

are available. Second, since the various exchange rates may be subject to

common shocks, it might be desirable to supplement single equation estimates

with system estimates. Third, since the various determinants of the exchange

rate are likely to be highly collinear (like the time series of two national

money   supplies),   estimates might be            It is desirable in such cases

to apply techniques such as the mixed—estimation procedure or Bayesian approaches

which complement the sample information with prior information. Using the

monetary model, the prior information derives from the homogeneity postulate

and from known properties of the demand for money. From the policy perspective,

the monetary approach to the exchange rate serves as a reminder that the exchange

rate and the conduct of monetary policy are intimately linked to each other and

that, as a first approximation, policies which affect the trend of domestic

(relative to foreign) monetary growth, also affect the exchange rate in the

same manner.

                                    ESTIMATION PROCEDURES


          In this Appendix we outline some of the details of the estimation

procedures for incorporating prior knowledge with the sample information.

We start with the mixed estimation procedure and then provide a Bayesian

interpretation of the estimator.

         Let the T—vector of observations on the dependent variable y be

generated according to



(Al)                            y =   X   + U;          U   N( 0, OIT)



where X is a matrix of observations on the k independent variables,

      is a parameter vector, and u is a disturbance vector. The stochastic

prior information on the parameter values can be written as



(A2)                 r R + v; E(v) = 0, E(') = V. E(uv') = 0,


where r is a vector Qf 'andom prior estiniat.es of R,                    is a-knowninatrix,

and          isaneiror   vector. Combiniii(A1) and (A2) yields


(A3)                     =   53 +     E(i) =     0,   E(iii') =



in   which

                     =
                         [y'   r          =
                                                       Rd',   = E' ' and

                         L°'




       Applying the Aitken principle to (A3) gives the mixed estimator of :




()         =(                      = (R'V1R        +   X'X/a2) 1(R'V1r + X'y/a2)




The covariance matrix of           is




                           v(s) =       (R'vR      +




To make these expressions operational, the unknown para1neter a2 is replaced

by an estimate. For further details, see, e.g., Theil (1971, pp. 3)46—352).

       The mixed estimator can also be viewed in a Bayesian framework. The

expression given in (A)4) is the mean of the conditional (in the sense indicated

below) posterior density of the parameter vector when the prior distribution is

normal. To show this, let           and A1 be the prior mean and covariance

matrix of ,     and let the prior density be multivariate normal:
                                              33

(A5)                                     ( - )'A( -

where         denotes proportionality. Assuming that the disturbance variance

in   (Al)     a2   is knom. and denoting its knom value by          the   likelihood

function associated with (Al) is




                                          L2ao                  j
where

                                     =
(A7)                                     (X'X)X'y

            Using Bayes' theorem to combine the prior density (A5) and the likeli-

hood function (A6), we obtain the following conditional posterior density:



                y, x)    p()p(yI,
     p(Iag,                          o, x)

                        exp{4 [( - )'x'x( - )/a + ( -)'A( -)]}
(A8)                     exp[- ( - )'(A + X'X/a)( - )]

where

                                              34



Thus from (A8), the conditional posterior distribution of           is normal with

the following mean and covariance matrix:


                        E() =          v(s)   =    (A



             The conditional posterior mean given in(A9) is a matrix weighted

 average of the prior mean          and the least squares estimator      defined in

 (A1). The weight matrices are the relative precisions of             and 1: the

 information contained in the data is given a larger weight the greater is

 its relative precision. The weight matrices are both positive definite

 and they sum to the identity matrix.

             The expression given in(A9) corresponds to the mixed estimator (A)4) with

             The Bayesian interpretation can also be extended to the situation in

 which G2 is an unknown parameter. Assuming that nG, has a uniform piior

 distribution together with the normal prior for 3, it can be shown that

 the quantity given in (A9) is the mean of the leading normal term in an asymp-

 totic expansion approximating the posterior distribution of 3. For details,

 see Zeflner (1911b, Chapter 4). Thus, in this case the previous interpretation

 of the mixed estimator applies approximately.

             For an analysis of Bayesian and alternative approaches, see Zeliner (1911a).

                                 THE DATA BASE

         In this appendix,   we give the detailed definitions of all the
variables in   the data   base, the primary data sources, and   a   listing of
the    entire data base. The data base is made up of 53 monthly observations

on each variable for the period January, 1921 to May, 1925.

         We use the following country subscripting convention: France, the

United States, and the United Kingdom are denoted by the subscripts 1,

2, and 3, respectively.


I. Exchange Rates and Forward     Premia
         The franc/pound and dollar/pound spot rates are taken from Einzig

(1937, Appendix 1, pp. )45O—)-58). In that source, weekly rates are given, and

we use the rate quoted nearest the end of the month for that month's rate.

         The spot franc/dollar rate is computed as the ratio of the spot

franc/pound rate to the spot dollar/pound rate. That is, we use the

triangular arbitrage condition.

         The three spot exchange rates are given in Table Bi. Here, we use

S. .    to denote the spot rate between countryi's currency and country          j's;

S.. is expressed as the cost of a unit of the currency of country j in

terms   of the currency   of country i. Country   i   can be thought of as the

home country, and j as the foreign country. For example, using our sub-

scripting convention, S13 is the spot franc/pound rate, and a rise in S13

means that the franc has depreciated relative to the pound.

           The one month forward exchange rate for both the franc/pound and
    dollar/pound are   also    from Einzig (1931, Appendix 1, pp. 5O-58).               We

    again use the forward rate quoted for the last week in a month for that

    month's forward rate.

           The one month forward franc/dollar rate is computed from the

    triangular arbitrage relationship, as before.

           The three one month forward rates are given in Table B2. Here,

    F     is used to denote the one month forward rate between country i's
     lj
    currency and country j's. The interpretation of F.. is exactly

    analogous to that for S.. given previously.

            The one month forward premium, JL.,            is   computed as


                              = 9,n(F.•/s. •)         j > i ;      3:   1, 2, 3

                                                        of ..     means that the currency

    of country j for delivery in one            month's time is selling at a premium
    relative   to country l's currency——the home country's currency is expected

    to depreciate relative to that of country j.

            The forward premia are given in Table B3. Notice that for each

    month, apart from rounding errors, the franc/dollar forward premium (Tr12)

    is exactly the difference between the franc/pound and the dollar/pound

    premia (TI13 and 23 This is because the triangular arbitrage relation

    is used to construct both the spot and forward rates for the franc/dollar.


    II. Money Supplies

           For the French money supply, we use the Bank of France note circu-

    lation, which is given in Tinbergen (l931, pp. 66—6i, column 11). The

    units of the French money supply are milliards of francs.

                     The U.S. money supply variable is currency held by the public

           plus demand    and time   deposits at commercial banks   (i.e.,   it is

           from Friedman and     Schwartz (1970, pp. 19—23, column 9). The units of this
           variable are thousands of millions of dollars.

                     Our U.K. money supply variable is the total deposits of the London

           Clearing Banks. The source for this is the Committee on Finance and

           Industry (1931, pp. 285—287). Here, the units are        tens     of millions of

           pounds.

                     The three money supplies are   given   in Table B)4. Here, M. denotes

__________ the money supply of country i.                                             _______

           III.   Real Incomes

                     For real income in France, we use the General Index of Production

           from Tinbergen (193)4, pp. 75—76, column 52).

                     The U.S. real income variable is the Index of Volume of Manufactured

           Output, also from Tinbergen (193)4, pp. 213—1)4, column )42).

                  Real income data for the U.K. are readily available only on an

           annual basis. We use the monthly unemployment series to interpolate the

           annual industrial production index as follows. First, we regress annual

           industrial production on a time trend and the annual unemployment rate.

           This yields (standard errors are given in parentheses below each estimated

           parameter):


                            y    98.)46+ 0.)4277t - 0.000767)4t2 - l.2799u
                                 (3.59) (0.1035) (0.0007591)      (0.2023)


           in which                          R2=0.965l,
                  y      is the annual U.K. Total Industrial Production Index,

                  t =    6, 18, 30, ..., 126, an annual time trend, and
                  u      is the U.K. unemployment rate in June expressed as a percentage

                         (e.g., u =   3.0   if the unemployment rate is 3 percent).

This equation is estimated with data for the period 1920 to 1930. The

source for the Total Industrial Production Index for the U.K. is Felnstein

    (l976,-p. T112, colun l)
-
        Our measure of u is the Trade Union and National Unemployment

Insurance "Unemployed" Percentages, given in International Industrial

Relations Institute (1932, pp. 259—260). We then compute a monthly real

income series by using a monthly time trend and the monthly unemployment

rate in the estimated relationship. Hence, we use the interpolated

monthly industrial production index for real income in the U.K.

          The three income series are given in Table B5. Here,      is the

real income for country i.
