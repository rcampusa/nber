The Evolution of Inequality in Productivity and Wages: Panel Data Evidence

                                            ABSTRACT

There has been a remarkable increase in wage inequality in the US, UK and many other countries
over the past three decades. A significant part of this appears to be within observable groups (such
as age-gender-skill cells). A generally untested implication of many theories rationalizing the growth
of within-group inequality is that firm-level productivity dispersion should also have increased. The
relevant data for the US is problematic, so we utilize a UK panel dataset covering the manufacturing
and non-manufacturing sectors since the early 1980s. We find evidence that productivity inequality
has increased. Existing studies have underestimated this increased dispersion because they use data
from the manufacturing sector which has been in rapid decline. Most of the increase in individual wage
inequality has occurred because of an increase in inequality between firms (and within industries).
Increased productivity dispersion appears to be linked with new technologies as suggested by models
such as Caselli (1999) and is not primarily due to an increase in transitory shocks, greater sorting or
entry/exit dynamics.

I. Introduction


Wage inequality has increased substantially in the United States and the United

Kingdom in the last thirty years. Acemoglu (2002) reports that the difference in wages

earned by a worker in the 90th percentile of the wage distribution compared to a

worker in the 10th percentile increased by 40% in the US from 1971 to 1995. For the

UK, the 90-10 differential increased by 48% from 1975 to 2000 (see Machin, 2003;

Machin and Van Reenen, 2007). Increases in within-group inequality, i.e. increases in

inequality among observationally equivalent workers, account for a significant

proportion of the rise1.

        Many theories have been proposed to explain the rise in wage inequality.

These include demand-side explanations (trade with developing countries or

technological change)2, supply-side explanations (changes in the relative supply of

highly-educated workers across cohorts)3 and institutions (decline in union power

and/or the minimum wage4). Technology-based theories have proven popular in

explaining the within group rise. They generally assume some type of labor market

friction whereby workers’ wages are linked with the productivity of the worker-firm

match. Such effects arise naturally in search based models of equilibrium wage

dispersion, but there are other theoretical foundations based on bargaining that

  Lemieux (2006) argues that the scale of this increase may have been exaggerated in some early
studies due to compositional effect. Autor et al. (2005) still find a substantial within component
especially in the upper tail of the distribution.

  See, among others, Machin and Van Reenen (1998) and Autor et al. (1998) for evidence that the rapid
spread of computers has increased the demand for skills. See, among many others, Caselli (1999),
Aghion et al. (2004) and Violante (2002) for models in which rapid technical change increases the
demand for skills and causes a rise in inequality.

  Differences in labor market institutions are often proposed to explain cross-country inequality (e.g.
Blau and Kahn, 1996). Unions have declined just about everywhere and in the US the real value of the
minimum wage fell substantially until the mid 1990s (see, e.g., DiNardo et al., 1996).

                                                  2
generate similar implications5. When a “general purpose technology” like information

and communication technologies (ICT) becomes available, firms will adopt

technologies at different rates and be successful to different degrees. This generates

increased wage dispersion even for observationally identical workers (e.g. Violante,

2002; Aghion et al., 2002, 2004). An under-appreciated implication of these models is

that they imply that productivity dispersion between firms should also have risen.

         Unfortunately, very little is known about the evolution of the productivity

distribution. Wages are not a sufficient statistic for productivity once we move away

from the simplest models of spot competition in labor markets. Some authors have

examined in detail the determinants of the cross sectional distribution of productivity

and others have decomposed aggregate productivity growth into incumbent firm

productivity growth and reallocation effects driven by entry, exit and the relative

growth of more productive firms. This literature strongly suggests that the between

firm effects (ignored by representative agent models) are very important6. As useful

as this literature is, however, it has generally focused on explaining the evolution of

the first moment of the productivity distribution and has not focused on how the

higher order moments of the productivity distribution have evolved over time.

Understanding the dynamics of productivity dispersion is the main contribution of this

paper.

         Data constraints are an important reason why the changing productivity

distribution is under-studied. In order to examine secular changes, a long time series


5
  Mortensen (2003) and Postal-Viney and Robin (2003) contain theoretical models linking equilibrium
wages with employer heterogeneity in productivity. They use these models to structurally estimate the
cross sectional wage distribution in Denmark and France, respectively. Layard, Nickell and Jackman
(2005) show how the link between workers wages and employer productivity can arise across a range
of models – union bargaining, efficiency wage, rent-sharing and search-based.
6
  For the cross sectional dispersion of productivity see among others Haltiwanger et al. (1999) for the
U.S. and Martin (2004) for the UK. For decompositions of productivity changes see among others,
Bailey et al. (1992), Olley and Pakes (1996) and Bartelsman et al. (2005).

                                                  3
of data is needed and firm-level data is usually only available for such periods on the

manufacturing sector7. Since this sector only now employs about 14% of the British

workforce and 13% of the American workforce, it is problematic to extrapolate to the

whole economy from just manufacturing industries. It is particularly a problem for

productivity analysis as the rapid decline in manufacturing in the OECD over the last

three decades is partly due to increased competition from less developed countries

with much lower labor costs. With heterogeneous firms, increases in competition will

generally lower the productivity dispersion (see Syverson, 2004, for a model and

empirical evidence confirming the importance of this intuition). Consequently, the

existing studies of the change in productivity dispersion may have seriously

underestimated the importance of the growth of productivity inequality. Although

production data on non-manufacturing is available in the US in Compustat, this only

includes firms listed on the Stock Market. Since most firms are private, an analysis of

productivity inequality that ignored these unlisted firms is unconvincing8. The new

US Longitudinal Business Database is available for non-manufacturing firms in the

US, but it does not contain data on sales or capital (see Davis et a.l, 2006).

        To tackle these data constraints we use the UK as a test bed – wage inequality

has risen rapidly since the early 1980s and we use a data source (FAME) covering

listed and unlisted firms in both manufacturing and service sectors. This is an

unbalanced panel and is available since the early 1980s.

         Figure 5a shows the headline finding from this data where we look at the

firm-specific distribution of labor productivity measured by value added per worker.

We will discuss more data details later in the paper (e.g. see Table A1 for levels of

7
 See Dunne et al. (2004) for the US and Haskel and Martin (2002) for the UK.
8
  For example, several papers have argued that there is an increase in the dispersion of firm-specific
shocks over time as the variation of firm sales growth in Compustat appears to have increased (e.g.
Comin and Philippon, 2005). Unfortunately, this does not seem to be generally true across the US
economy (see Davis et al., 2006).

                                                  4
productivity dispersion). We consider the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles of the log

(labor productivity) distribution where we normalize these values to unity in 1984, so

the lines show what has happened to growth at each of these percentiles. The data

reveal a dramatic growth in the dispersion of productivity between firms. Productivity

increased by 60 log points at the 90th percentile between 1984 and 2001 whereas it

increased by only 20 log points at the 10th percentile (there was a growth of around 40

log points at the median). This is a substantial increase in productivity inequality and

we investigate in detail the cause of this change in this paper. We report three major

findings.

         First, using individual and firm level data we find that the vast majority of the

increase in individual wage inequality in the UK is a between-firm (rather than

within-firm) phenomenon9. This implies that understanding the evolution of the

between firm productivity distribution may be critical in understanding the between

firm wage distribution and therefore the overall wage distribution (we also show that

the correlation between wages and productivity has become more important over

time). Furthermore, the vast majority of the growth of wage and productivity

dispersion is within industries, suggesting industry level data on productivity and

wages will not be able to identify the causes of the changes.

         Second, we show that the increase in the productivity dispersion (as with the

wage dispersion) is mainly in the service sector of the economy suggesting that the

focus on manufacturing in the existing literature has indeed underestimated the rise of

economy wide productivity inequality.




9
 This is interesting as it suggests the media-grabbing attention attached to CEO pay relative to workers
pay in the same firm may be misplaced, as the overall increase in inequality has relatively little to do
with this. Nevertheless, we are not including many components of CEO remuneration such as share
options that are important.

                                                   5
        Third, we show that the increase in labor productivity dispersion is mainly

driven by an increase in total factor productivity dispersion (rather than being due to

just an increase in the dispersion of capital-labor ratios or greater sorting as in Kremer

and Maskin, 1996). This suggests technological differences may be driving our results

as suggested in the theories of in Caselli (1999) or Acemoglu et al (2001)10. We

present some direct evidence in line with this idea by using ICT data to explain the

increase in within industry productivity dispersion. We also examine (and reject)

other possible explanations including increasing a greater incidence of transitory

shocks, differential entry/exit rates, institutional changes and/or measurement error.

        To our knowledge, there are only two studies that have looked at changes in

productivity dispersion across many sectors. Dunne et al (2004) analyse changes in

the distribution of firm productivity across US plants. They show that inequality of

plant wages and productivity dispersion increased between 1975 and 1992 and much

of this was a between-plant phenomenon (this is consistent with what we find below

for the UK). Haskel and Martin (2002) examined changes in labor productivity in UK

establishments (the Annual Business Inquiry Respondents’ Database) and also found

some increase in dispersion. We argue that since both of these earlier studies look

only at the manufacturing sector they have seriously underestimated the magnitude of

the change.

        The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we briefly discuss the

theoretical framework and Section 3 details the data sources we use. Section 4

describes the main results and Section 5 discusses what could explain the trends

observed in the data. Section 6 offers some concluding comments.



10
  Acemoglu et al (2001) present a model where skill biased technical change causes deunionization.
This amplifies the direct effect of technology to further increase wage inequality. We investigate
institutional change and unionisation directly in sub-section 5.4. and 5.5.

                                                 6
2. Theoretical framework

        In this section, we use the papers by Caselli (1999) and Kremer and Maskin

(1996) to generate some empirical predictions regarding the distribution of wages and

productivity. Caselli (1999) models the impact of a technological “revolution” on the

dispersion of wages and productivity. In the Caselli model, there is a distribution of

worker types and machine types and operating a given type of machine requires a

given type of skill. The cost of learning a skill varies across workers and is lower for

more skilled workers and a technology is a combination of workers of type i who

have the appropriate skills to operate machines of type i. A technological “revolution”

occurs with the introduction of a new type of machine. Since workers of different

abilities are distributed heterogeneously across firms and for each period firms

consider as given the skill composition of their workforce, there will be differential

adoption of new technology by firms. High-skill workers will tend to use the new

technologies since it is less costly for them to acquire the new skills.

        This model has at least three implications that are relevant for our empirical

analysis. Firstly, we will expect increased wage dispersion between (and within)

firms11. Secondly, labor productivity (value added per worker) dispersion increases

between firms due to the fact that more skilled workers are now more productive.

Thirdly, since capital is also reallocated to its best use total factor productivity

increases in firms that introduce a new technology so Total Factor Productivity (TFP)

dispersion also rises.

        It is worth noting that the Caselli model is different from a pure sorting model

where between firm wage (and labor productivity) dispersion could rise because


11
   There are two effects in operation: a direct effect and an indirect effect. The wages of high-skill
workers rise because they now operate on more productive machines (the direct effect). There is also a
reallocation of capital away from old technologies towards new technologies, depressing the wages of
the low skilled and benefiting the wages of the high skilled (the indirect effect).

                                                  7
“good” workers tend to cluster in one type of firm and “bad” workers cluster in

another. Kremer and Maskin (1996) present an example of such a model that accounts

for the simultaneous existence of increased wage inequality and increased segregation

of workers by skill. They introduce a set of specific assumptions regarding the firm

organisational structure: imperfect substitution of workers of different skills;

complementarity of tasks within a plant, and differential effects of a worker skill

depending on the task performed. Under this set of assumptions and further assuming

a rise in the dispersion of skills across workers, Kremer and Maskin derive an

equilibrium solution where low-skill workers are sorted in low-productivity plants

and high-skill workers sorted in high-productivity plants (i.e. sorting or segregation).

Therefore, if dispersion of skills has increased due to increased educational inequality

for example, this could lead to increased sorting12.

         This model predicts an increase in the dispersion of wages across firms. There

will also be an increase in the dispersion of labor productivity because skilled workers

will be segregated into different firms. However, unlike technology-based models like

Caselli’s, because increased wage and productivity dispersion is due to sorting there

should be no effect on total factor productivity dispersion. We therefore look

explicitly at TFP as well as labor productivity and wages to distinguish between the

two approaches.




12
    In this model the degree of asymmetry/complementarity of tasks within a plant is crucial in shaping
the distribution of workers across plants. The asymmetry of tasks in the production function favours
cross-matching across workers (less segregation). Conversely, the complementarity of tasks favours
self-matching (more segregation). Workers of different abilities will be cross-matched up to the point at
which differences in skills or abilities are so great that segregation will be inevitable. If the distribution
of skills is sufficiently compressed, cross-matching seems to be the most probable outcome. If the
distribution of skills is dispersed, self-matching or sorting workers by skill will prevail. This gives
some ambiguity to the predictions as although the level of educational achievement has risen over time,
it is less clear whether educational inequality has risen.

                                                      8
3. Data description

         All datasets are described in detail in the Appendix B. The main dataset we

use is FAME (Financial Analysis Made Easy) which is a UK company-level panel

data set available since 1982. In Britain, all incorporated companies are legally

required to register their accounts at Companies’ House and given a unique (VAT)

registration number. Unlike the US, this includes not only companies listed on the

Stock Exchange (which are held on databases such as COMPUSTAT) but also all

unlisted companies. In 2003, we arranged a special purchase of this data with a

private sector company that has converted this data into electronic form. This is

unbalanced panel data and includes all firms that had exited the database prior to 2003

(by either bankruptcy or takeover)13.

         In our main analysis, we drop some firms. In general, this could lead to

selection bias causing us to find smaller or greater increases in inequality over time,

we argue in Appendix B that these biases are not generally large by checking the

sensitivity of the results to including the dropped observations and using

complementary datasets (contrast Figures 5a and 5b to see that these exclusions have

little effect on the overall trends). Firstly, we drop firms with less than ten employees

because small firms are not required to report certain key variables we need for our

analysis such as the wages bill. Secondly, we use the consolidated accounts of parent

firms and drop the unconsolidated accounts of their subsidiaries. We would be double

counting if we used both parents and subsidiaries. Because some subsidiaries are

below ten employees, we would be missing parts of the economy if we just used

subsidiaries. Thirdly, we start the sample in 1984 because sampling of FAME was not


13
  Under UK law, firms are also required to report a great deal more accounting information on their
wage bills than in the US (where declaration of staff expenses is a voluntary item). Because of this, we
are able to construct measures of average firm wages that are unavailable for most firms in the US
public accounts.

                                                   9
complete in the early 1980s. Finally, we generally drop certain sectors: agriculture,

mining, utilities, health and education. We were concerned that these sectors were

heavily influenced by state control for at least some of the sample period covered. We

also drop the financial sector because of the well-known problems of measuring

productivity in banking and insurance.

       Our final sample we use contains about 11,000 firms a year between 1984 and

2001 (we cover about 13 million workers each year). We have information on a large

number of variables. We use information on employment, capital, sales, total worker

remuneration, gross profits and industry. Note that we do not have information on the

demographics of the workforce or hours worked. But we investigate biases associated

with this omission in sub-section 5.4.

       The main measure we use for labor productivity is value added per worker, but

we also consider using sales per worker as an alternative. Sales has the advantage that

it is reported as a line item in the accounts, but the major disadvantage is that it will

be influenced by the purchase of intermediate inputs, so “labor productivity” could

rise simply because a firm was buying more materials per worker – this will

particularly be a problem in the service sector. We also examine total factor

productivity (TFP) calculated in various ways. The main way we calculate TFP is as a

residual of outputs from weighted inputs, but we also consider estimating firm

production functions and using the estimated parameters to construct TFP measures.

       There are numerous well-known problems with measuring labor productivity

and TFP. Some of these are discussed below (e.g. appropriate choice of weights). One

issue is that the value added numerator is not measured in physical units so will

reflect differential mark-ups among firms as well as physical productivity increases.




                                           10
Thus, when we say productivity it is shorthand for “revenue productivity”14. This is

still an interesting measure to look at as the ability of firms to sustain mark-ups is

partly a reflection of product quality, and technological change may enable firms to

improve quality (see Appendix B and Table A2 for an analysis of the changing

variation in profitability). Undoubtedly, there are other sources of market power and

the increased variation of market power could be a reason for increased measured

productivity dispersion. We have reason to doubt this explanation, however, as

competition has almost certainly increased over time in the UK due to waves of

policy-driven liberalization and globalization of markets. Other things equal, this

would lead to a reduction in productivity dispersion as the least efficient firms are

driven from the market.

         The second dataset we use is the New Earnings Survey (NES) data which give

consistent information on individual wages, and covers one per cent of the entire UK

working population (those whose National Insurance/Social Security numbers end in

the same two digits, 14). We currently have access to data for all years between 1975

and 1999 in NES. We use annual gross pay as our measure of the wage in NES which

matches most closely with FAME’s measure of annual staff costs. The FAME

measure is higher on average because it includes the employers’ payroll taxes15.




14
   We use an economy wide deflator, the Retail Price Index for value added. Industry-level deflators are
available at a more disaggregated level for manufacturing and the results are robust to using these
deflators. Industry-level deflators are not, however, available for the service sector (due to the difficulty
of defining price). Since the comparison between manufacturing and services is important, we chose to
report our main results using a common aggregate deflator.
15
   In FAME, we cannot distinguish employers’ payroll tax costs from total annual staff costs.
Employers National Insurance is a relatively small part of total wage costs so it is unlikely this could
account for an increase in dispersion. Nevertheless, we investigate this issue by looking at
demographics (gender, age, part-time proportion, etc.).

                                                    11
        4. The evolution of the wage and productivity distribution

In this section we document the changes in wage (sub-section 4.1) and productivity

(sub-section 4.2) dispersion. We then decompose the trends in sub-section 4.3.

        4.1. Trends in Wage Dispersion

        We begin by first examining wage trends with our data. Using individual data

(NES) and firm level data (FAME), we compute log real annual wages for male

workers aged 16-64. We compute values at the 90th, 50th (median) and 10th

percentiles and normalise these to unity in 1984. The series therefore represent

cumulative changes relative to the initial year, 198416. We split the sample by

manufacturing and private services. Looking at private services first in Figure 1,

wages at the 90th percentile increased by about forty log points between 1984 and

1999. By contrast, the wage earned at the 10th percentile increased by only seventeen

log points, thus generating an increase in the 90-10 differential of about twenty-three

log points. The increase in inequality was stronger in the 1980s than in the 1990s. The

picture does not fundamentally change when we restrict the sample to include only

16-64 full-time17 male workers or measure earnings using hourly instead of annual

wages (we are using annual wages so that we can compare these with FAME). Figure

2 presents the equivalent changes for manufacturing. Although it is clear that wage

inequality has also risen in this sector, the rise is much less dramatic than for services.

Indeed, there is hardly any change at all in the 1990s. Studies focusing on

manufacturing will therefore miss a large part of increased inequality.

        Figures 3 and 4 present similar evidence on wage dispersion using the FAME

firm-level data. Recall that we are examining the distribution in the average firm wage

(rather than individual wage) in these diagrams. Wage dispersion has risen for both
16
   See Gosling et al (2000) for similar analyses from earlier time periods in the UK.
17
  As documented in Machin (2003), the NES data under-sample part-time low-wage individuals so
focusing on full-time men eliminates a lot of this bias.

                                             12
sectors, but again the rise is much stronger for services (Figure 3) than for

manufacturing (Figure 4).

       Although the trend analysis is interesting, the samples are somewhat different

– the NES figures cover men and all firms whereas the FAME figures cover all

workers and only firms with more than 10 employees. Below in sub-section 5.3 we

match the samples more exactly to estimate how much of the overall changes in

individual wage variation are due to an increase in inter-firm wage dispersion

compared to the intra-firm wage dispersion.

       4.2 Trends in the Productivity Dispersion

       We discussed the change in the overall productivity distribution briefly in the

Introduction (Figure 5a). As with the wage distribution there was a substantial secular

increase in productivity inequality 1984-2001. For example, comparing the 1984 to

1989 average with the 1996 to 2001 average the 90-10 differential rose from 1.44 to

1.71. Essentially, this is the main new “stylized fact” of the paper. Note that Figure 5a

“Whole Economy” is the entire raw FAME data before we exclude particular

industries and size classes discussed in the data section. The pattern is remarkably

similar to Figure 5b “manufacturing and services” which is the sample after these

selections have been made.

       In addition to the secular increase there is also an interesting cyclical pattern

of productivity dispersion. There was an increase in productivity dispersion in the late

1980s followed by a reduction during the recession of the early 1990s. Afterwards,

productivity dispersion continued to increase until at least the year 2000. This pattern

is consistent with the idea of the “cleaning effect of recessions” (e.g. Caballero and

Hammour, 1994). The least productive firms are more likely to exit an industry (see

the analysis of entry/exit in sub-section 5.3 below) and this effect is likely to be


                                           13
particularly strong during cyclical downturns. Consequently the productivity

distribution is compressed due to a truncation of the left tail in the early 1990s. Note

that this selection effects implies that macro-economists are probably underestimating

the degree of pro-cyclicality of productivity over the business cycle.

        Increases in productivity dispersion for the whole economy are largely driven

by increases in private services (see Figure 6). Productivity dispersion across UK

manufacturing firms has increased, but to a much more limited extent (see Figure 7).

The service sector also displays a stronger cyclical component in the variation of

productivity, decreasing very strongly in the early 1990s recession.

       Overall, we find that the inter-firm productivity distribution has moved in a

similar way to the inter-firm wage distribution over the last twenty years, suggesting

that the two patterns may be linked. We explore this link in more detail in the next

sub-section.

       4.3 Decomposing trends in wage and productivity inequality

       We first consider decomposing the overall increase in individual wage

inequality into between firm and within firm components. We can further sub-divide

the between firm component into a within and between industry component. We use

comparable NES and FAME samples to accomplish this, so we restrict the NES

sample in the same way we restricted the FAME sample (same industries, both male

and female workers, both part-time and full-time workers, etc.).

      Our decomposition methodology follows Davis and Haltiwanger (1991) and

Dunne et al. (2004). We use the NES data to estimate the overall variation of

individual log wages denoted V (W NES ) , and the FAME data to estimate the variance

of between firm ln(wages) denoted V (W FAME ) . The within firm component denoted

VˆWF , is then the residual between the two series:

                                            14
                      VˆWF = V (W NES ) − V (W FAME )                                  (1)


Details and further discussion of the decomposition methodology are in Appendix A.

        Figure 8 contains the first results of this decomposition. The bold line shows

the total individual variation of ln(wages) between 1984 and 1999 which has

increased by about 16 log points. This trend is well documented in several papers. The

dashed line shows the “between” component (the inter-firm wage variation) and the

dotted line the within firm component (the difference between overall wage

dispersion and the between firm dispersion) over the same period. Looking first at the

cross section in the 1980s, about half of the variation in wages is attributable to the

variation within firms and half is between firms. The interesting aspect, however, is in

the time series. The trend increase in between-firm wage variation is similar to the

trend increase in the overall variation of wages. In fact, the between firm component

essentially accounts for just about all of the increase in the growth of aggregate

inequality (the within firm increase rises a little in the second half of the 1990s, but is

essentially flat).

        Figure 9 takes this one stage further and decomposes the between firm

variation into a between and within industry component. The between industry

component has risen, but only by a minor amount. In short, the dominant reason for

the increase in wage inequality appears to be the growth of inequality between firms

within industries. This suggests that examining how firms’ productivity have changed

over time could help account for the changing wage distribution as many of these

recent theories by Caselli and others have suggested. Figures 10 through 13 show the

breakdown between manufacturing and services to illustrate, as before, that the results

are driven by the service sector.



                                            15
         We now turn to productivity again. Since productivity is a firm-level measure,

we cannot look within firms, so our decompositions are into within and between

industry components. We find a consistent picture that the increase in productivity

inequality is a within industry phenomenon (Figure 14). There is only a small increase

in the productivity dispersion between industries in services (Figure 15) and in

manufacturing (Figure 16). One may be concerned that the industry decompositions

are based on two digit sectors and this is too aggregated. We replicated the results on

more finely disaggregated industries that lead to similar qualitative results18.



5. Explaining the rising dispersion of productivity

         Our key finding is that there has been a secular increase in labor productivity

dispersion in the UK. We now seek to explain this by first showing that this is not

simply due to an increase in dispersion of factor inputs (sub-section 5.1), in transitory

shocks (sub-section 5.2) or in entry/exit behaviour (sub-section 5.3). We the present

some direct evidence in line with the idea that information technology has an

important role to play (sub-section 5.4). We end with some international evidence

(sub-section 5.5) and some evidence on magnitudes (sub-section 5.6).

         5.1. Total Factor Productivity

         The main theories of within group wage inequality emphasise that there has

been some increase in the technological heterogeneity between firms over time. We

would expect this to be reflected in differences in total factor productivity (TFP).

Labor productivity differences could arise from TFP differences, but could also arise

from increases in the dispersion of capital intensity (fixed capital per worker) between

firms. Of course, some of this increased capital heterogeneity could reflect

18
   There is a trade-off here as the cell size per industry year used to construct the variance components
is obviously rather small when we go to more disaggregated industries.

                                                  16
experimentation with different technologies (such as ICT). However, we would still

expect some TFP differences (recall the discussion of Caselli’s model in Section 2).

Theories of increased sorting (e.g. Kremer and Maskin, 1996), by contrast, do not

have this implication.

         We can construct TFP in a number of ways. The basic method is the

difference between weighted inputs and outputs. Measured TFP (MTFP) for firm j at

time t is:



                             MTFP = ln Q jt − α j ln L jt − (1 − α j )ln K jt                           (2)




Where Qjt denotes value added, αj denotes the share of labor costs in output, Ljt

denotes labor and Kjt denotes the capital stock. This is the simplest method to

compute TFP. There are more sophisticated ways19 to compute the parameters αj and

to derive measures of TFP. We compute αj as firm specific weights, i.e. αj is

measured as the ratio of total wage bill over value added at the firm level and

averaged over 1984-200120.

         We start with analyzing the dispersion of capital intensity (in Figure 17).

Although this has indeed risen over the period, it cannot fully account for the increase

in the productivity dispersion, as TFP has risen significantly over this period as well




19
    Griffith et al. (2004) discuss the methods common in the growth accounting literature. Direct
estimation of the production by the methods of inter alia Olley and Pakes (1996) and Blundell and
Bond (1998) is another possibility.
20
   We also compared this with (i) imposing αj = 0.7, the typically value for labor’s share used in the
literature on productivity and (ii) estimating αj as industry specific weights, i.e. αj measured as the ratio
of total wage bill over value added at the two or three digit industry level and averaged over the sample
period. These produced similar results.

                                                    17
(see Figure 18). Comparing the evolution of labor productivity dispersion and TFP

dispersion, we find that the two series follows each other very closely21.

          Since the sorting models do not predict such as rise in TFP, we view this as

giving some support for the technology-based explanations of Caselli (1999) and

others.



          5.2. Transitory Shocks

          Statistically, a rise in the cross sectional dispersion of firm productivity could

arise purely from an increase in the transitory productivity shocks hitting firms22. The

environment may have become more volatile for firms due to globalization,

liberalization of product markets and/or financial markets. Some analyses of listed US

firms have claimed that the variance of firms’ sales growth has increased over time23.

Since productivity tends to rise with positive demand shocks (see Figures 5a and 5b,

for example), perhaps the increased variability of firm-demand then maybe this could

account for the patterns in the data.

          We analyze this hypothesis by looking at transition probability matrices of

labor productivity, TFP, wages and profits. Our objective is to investigate whether

increasing productivity dispersion over time simply reflects increasing firm mobility

across points in the productivity distribution. We consider productivity deciles and

construct transition probability rates for the distributions of labor productivity over

the years 1986-2001. We compare transition probability rates between 1986/87 and

1988/89 (the “early period”), between 1992/93 and 1994/95 (the “middle period”),


21
   Interestingly, between-industry effects are slightly more important in explaining variation in TFP
than in labor productivity. While they explain 17% of the increase in labor productivity dispersion, they
account for 25% of the variation in TFP.
22
    Dickens (2000) or Blundell and Preston (1998) are examples showing that the increase in wage and
income inequality are partially driven by increases in the transitory component.
23
   See the debate between Comin and Philippon (2005) and Davis et al (2006).

                                                  18
and between 1998/99 and 2000/01 (the “late period”)24. We pool the data into two-

year blocks and compute the transition probabilities between adjacent blocks of years.

For example, in the early period we pool data for the same firms between 1986 and

1987 to calculate the firm’s position in the productivity distribution in “t”, and then do

the same exercise for the firms in 1988 and 1989 (t+1). We then compare where firms

in each decile of the distribution in t ended up in t+1 (including the state of exiting

from the sample).

        It can be misleading to compare transition probabilities rates at different points

of the business cycle, because recession (expansion) years are characterised by an

unusual number of firms exiting (entering) the market. Given our way of shaping the

data, the early and late periods correspond to a roughly similar position in the

business cycle. The middle and late 1980s were expansionary years as well as the

middle and late 1990s. The early 1990s were recession years.

        The results are summarized in Table 1 for the top and bottom deciles (the full

matrices for labor productivity are in Table 2)25. We focus on the probability that a

firm stays in the same decile it began with, and measure a decrease in this probability

as indicating a rise in mobility. Unsurprisingly, firms that start in the top decile of the

productivity distribution tend to stay there. In the early period, for example, 60% of

firms who were in the top decile of the productivity distribution were still in the top

decile two years later. Similarly, 46% of the firms who began in the bottom decile of

the productivity distribution were still there two years later (this underestimates the

persistence because the least productive firms are disproportionately likely to exit the

dataset as we show in Table 2). This is a much higher frequency than would be



24
   We pooled data in order to keep the cell sizes reasonably large for the decile analysis. Other
grouping lead to similar findings.
25
   We condition on the sub-sample of firms that appear in two consecutive years.

                                               19
expected by random fluctuations suggesting that productivity differences are

persistent over time.

       The key column for our purposes is column (4) of Table 1 that compares the

early and late years (these are at similar points in the business cycle). There is a very

small increase of firms at the bottom of the productivity distribution moving up: only

45% of firms in the bottom decile stayed there in the late period, a one-percentage

point fall from the early period. Similarly, the most productive firms were two

percentage points less likely to stay in the top decile in the late period relative to the

early period (58% down from 60%). So mobility has increased, but only by a small

amount.

       The next rows of Table 1 perform the same exercise for TFP. For the least

productive firms, there is an increase in mobility between the early and the late

period. In the late period, 59% of the firms in the bottom decile of the productivity

distribution were still there two years later (compared to 61% in the early period).

However, the opposite is true for firms at the top: they show a decrease in mobility

(50% up from 47%). As with labor productivity there is no sign of a large increase in

mobility: although mobility rates have increased slightly for the bottom decile by two

percentage points, they have declined at the top decile by three percentage points.

       We also investigated transitions for average wages and productivity. Looking

at average wages, we find some increase in mobility between the early and the late

period. This is true for firms both at the top (six percentage points) and at the bottom

(four percentage points) of the wage distribution. This finding is not surprising and is

also consistent with the results obtained by Dickens (2000) and Blundell and Preston

(1998). Looking at average profits, we find an increase in mobility at the top only,




                                           20
with a decrease in mobility at the bottom. The decrease at the bottom (four percentage

points) outweighs the increase at the top (two percentage points).

         Overall, then it appears that there is no evidence of a substantial increase in

the transitory productivity shocks facing firms, implying that this is not the main

explanation for the increase in the cross-sectional productivity distribution.

         Table 2 shows the transition matrices in full detail. Because we have many

small firms there is a lot of exit26, especially for the least productive firms. In the early

period, for example, 30% of firms in the lowest productivity decile exited compared

to 20% in the highest productivity decile. This pattern of greater exit probability for

the less productive firms is unsurprising as is the greater level of exit during the

middle period in the early 1990s when demand was low. This prompts the question of

whether these differential exit and entry patterns explain the aggregate increase in

productivity dispersion.

         5.3. Exit and Entry of Firms

         One possible explanation of the rise in productivity dispersion that we observe

could be that there was a rise in productivity dispersion among entrants. If entry

barriers have declined due to liberalization or improved access to finance, for

example, then a wider variety of entrants could enter the market with higher levels of

productivity dispersion than previous cohorts27. In principle, incumbents could have

no increase in dispersion.

         We analyse cohorts of new entrants and incumbents for the early (1987-1989),

middle (1993-1995) and late (1999-2001) periods. We then look at the evolution of


26
   Note that exit includes exits to bankruptcy as well as exits due to takeovers. Takeovers are less likely
to be a signal of under-performance than bankruptcy.
27
   Of course, the tougher competition associated with lower entry barriers could reduce productivity
dispersion if the least productive firms exit. Similarly, lower entry barriers may mean that less efficient
forward looking firms rationally choose not to enter assuming they can observe their productivity in
advance of entry.

                                                   21
the top half (90th-50th differential) and the bottom half (50th-10th differential) of the

labor productivity distribution. Table 3 shows that entrants are indeed more dispersed

in terms of productivity than incumbents. In the early period, for instance, dispersion

in the top half of the distribution was 0.92 for entrants and 0.79 for incumbents. This

pattern has also been found in similar datasets for other countries. There has not been

an increase in aggregate entry rates, however, so this finding by itself could not

account for the increase in aggregate productivity dispersion28.

         Looking at changes in the productivity dispersion of entrants between the

early and late periods, we do see that there has been an increase: the differentials have

increased by seventeen log points and thirty-one log points in the top half and bottom

half, respectively. Nevertheless, we also see an increase in the productivity inequality

of incumbents. Productivity inequality for the top half has increased at a similar rate

for entrants and incumbents (0.17 vs. 0.15). More interestingly, the 50-10 has

increased faster for entrants (0.31 vs. 0.11). So this suggests that increased

heterogeneity of entrants may have some role to play in accounting for the increase in

“lower tail” (but not upper tail) productivity inequality.

         We also conduct a further check in Table 4. We exclude all entrants and

exiters, and we look at the evolution of productivity dispersion for two balanced

panels of “continuing” firms (i.e. those who were alive throughout the period 1984-

2001 and those who were alive throughout the period 1990-2001). We find that there

is an increase in productivity dispersion even among continuing firms, suggesting that

entrants are not the only cause of the rise in productivity dispersion that we observe

within the economy.




28
  The higher overall entry rates in the early period are due to the fact that there was strong cyclical
growth in the late 1980s and much merger and acquisition activity.

                                                    22
           5.4. The role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in

explaining the growth in productivity dispersion within industries

           In the previous sections we discussed and systematically eliminated alternative

explanations for the rise in productivity dispersion within the UK economy (i.e., more

sorting between firms, a rise in transitory shocks, and a rise in productivity dispersion

among entrants). As a consequence, we consider technical progress the most likely

cause and in this sub-section, we directly examine the role of ICT may have in

explaining the growth in within-industry productivity dispersion.

           ICT information at the firm level does not exist for a long enough time period

to perform a micro-analysis (See Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen, 2007, for a

discussion). We can, however, evaluate the impact of ICT on within-industry

productivity growth using the Bank of England Industry Dataset29 (BEID) which

contains information on ICT services, total capital services, hours of work, output,

value added, etc. at the two-digit industry level.

           We use FAME data to compute the between-firm dispersion of labor

productivity. We measure this as the 90-10 differential in log (real value added per

employee) within each industry and calculate the change between 1984-1988 and

1996-2000. We regress this long-difference change in productivity dispersion on the

change in ICT intensity and various controls.

           The first column of Table 5 simply presents the bivariate regression between

the change in productivity dispersion and ICT intensity revealing a large and

statistically significant coefficient on ICT. A 10% increase in the share of ICT capital

in total capital services is associated with a 2.7% increase in the dispersion of labor

productivity. Column (2) includes a dummy for the manufacturing sector. As we

29
     See Oulton and Srinivasan (2003). We thank Nick Oulton for making this data available to us.


                                                    23
would expect given the earlier analysis, the dummy is significantly negative

indicating that even conditional on ICT the growth in productivity dispersion is lower

in manufacturing. Column (3) includes additional controls for the growth of total

capital services per hour, the growth of the proportion of workers with college degrees

and the change in union density (the proportion of workers who are members of trade

unions). Including these extra controls reduces the magnitude of the coefficient on

ICT intensity, but it remains significant at the 5% level. The other variables take their

expected signs. Capital intensity is positive and significant which is consistent with

the idea that some technology is embodied in non-ICT capital. ICT capital growth

could be reflecting the growth of skills, which is why we condition on human capital

– the variable is positive and significant. Institutional explanations of the rise in

inequality emphasis that union decline may allow low wage/low productivity firms to

survive. The union coefficient is indeed negative but it is insignificantly different

from zero.

       We were concerned that the observed increase in dispersion may be due to the

problem that hours are not available at the firm level. Increased dispersion of

productivity could simply reflect increased dispersion of hours worked. To control for

this we calculated the dispersion of hours worked in each industry using individual

level data from the NES (in column (4)) and the Labor Force Survey (in column (5)).

These variables were both insignificant and did not affect the coefficient on ICT

intensity. We also included other demographic controls (female workers and part-time

workers) as possible correlates with the increased use of ICT capital (and as factors

that could affect labor productivity). Again, the ICT coefficient remains significant.

       In summary, after controlling for various factors, the positive association

between increases in productivity dispersion and changes in ICT intensity still holds.


                                           24
The ICT variable is economically as well as statistically significant. ICT intensity has

grown very rapidly over this period (from 3.4% of all capital services in 1984-1988 to

15% in 1996-2000). Given the estimated coefficient we can essentially account for all

of the increase in productivity dispersion (0.266 points) by the increase in ICT

intensity30.




        5.5. International Data

        If the growth of productivity inequality was technology based we would

expect to observe this in other countries. In particular, France and Norway where

there has been little change in wage inequality (e.g. Machin and Van Reenen, 2007).

Figure 19 shows us the situation in France between 1989 and 2000 (we chose these

years because we have consistent data). Interestingly, like the UK, there has been a

clear increase in the variation of productivity over this period. Note, however, the y-

axis scale is much narrower than in previous graphs. Productivity has grown by about

10% for firms at the 90th decile and has fallen by 10% for firms at the lower decile.

The median firm has experienced productivity growth of about 5%. This is in the

same direction as the UK, but the rise in productivity dispersion has been less

dramatic.

        Figure 20 shows the situation in Norway in the 1995-2002 period (the only

period for which we have value added per worker information in non-manufacturing

as well as manufacturing). There has been a small growth in the 90-10 decile ratio

over this period. Interestingly this increase is confined to the upper part of the




30
  See Table A2. ln(ICT services/capital services) increased by 1.605 over this period so the implied
“effect” is 0.37, more than 100% of the observed change.

                                                25
distribution (the 90-50); the lower half of the distribution has shown some small

decrease in inequality.

        It is well known that inequality of wages in France and Norway has also

grown more slowly than in the UK or US in the last 25 years. So although the

increase in productivity dispersion is not unique to the UK, it seems more muted in

countries where there has been a slower growth of wage inequality. This suggests that

institutional factors may play a role in the change of productivity dispersion.



        5.6. Quantification: How Important are the results for the wage

distribution?

        How important could the change in the structure be in explaining the change

in the wage distribution? We have not yet written a formal general equilibrium model

of the simultaneous determination of the wage and productivity distribution31 so all

we can do is to give some intuition over the magnitudes. Appendix C gives a simple

model that could help us estimate some of the magnitudes. The model assumes that

productivity is driven by technological factors and that wages are determined by a

mixture of human capital characteristics and firm characteristics. Our model allows us

to estimate the impact of the changing productivity dispersion on wage dispersion as:

                                                ⎛ Q⎞
                                           ∆ var⎜ ln ⎟
                                        β2      ⎝ L⎠                                              (3)
                                           ∆ var(lnW )

        Between 1984 and 2001 the variance of ln(productivity) rose by 0.26 and the

variance of firm ln(wages) rose by 0.21. If we assume that β = 0.3 (e.g. Van Reenen,

1996) then this implies that 10% of the increase in the variance of inter-firm wages is

accounted for by the variance of inter-firm productivity. Therefore, this still leaves a
31
  See Klette and Kortum (2004) or Lentz and Mortensen (2005) for an attempt to do this in the cross
section.

                                                 26
big residual for such factors as the increase in the return to observable skills (and

possibly increased sorting). Nevertheless, the increased productivity dispersion is a

significant part of the story.

        Furthermore, there is some evidence that the between firm distribution of

productivity could have become more important over time in accounting for the wage

dispersion. Running wage regressions separately for different time periods reveals

that β has been increasing over time. For example, Table 6 reports specifications of a

regression of wages on productivity with controls for time dummies and industry

effects. We estimate separately for an early period (1984-1989), a middle period

(1990-1995) and a late period (1996-2001). The first column reports simple OLS, the

second column adds a full set of fixed effects and the third column reports GMM

“System” estimates in the manner of Blundell and Bond (1998). All results show an

increase in the importance of the effect of productivity on wage. For examples in the

GMM estimates the coefficient rises from 0.325 in the mid 1980s to 0.382 in the late

1990s. This suggests that firm heterogeneity has become more important in explaining

the overall wage distribution.

        Although this shows that firm heterogeneity remains important for the wage

distribution, it is difficult to estimate how important this phenomenon is for the

overall increase in inequality. As Appendix C shows, the effect will depend on such

hard to measure things as the variation of human capital and the degree of worker-

firm sorting (and the changes in these objects).



        6. Conclusions

        In this paper we have examined some evidence for the explanation of the

growth of residual wage inequality. We have shown that a generally untested


                                           27
implication of many technology-based theories of within group wage inequality is that

there should be an increase in the dispersion of productivity between firms. We argue

that existing studies will underestimate the importance of the growth of productivity

inequality because they focus on the manufacturing sector that has experienced a

surge of international competition truncating the lower tail of poorly performing firms

and therefore compressing the (counterfactual) productivity distribution.

       Using new panel data on UK firms over the 1984-2001 period we show that

the substantial increase in individual wage inequality is mainly a between firm (rather

than within firm or between industry) phenomenon. More importantly we show that

there has been a substantial increase in the between firm productivity dispersion. The

90th percentile of the productivity distribution grew by 60 log points between 1984

and 2001 whereas the 10th percentile grew by only 20 log points. Furthermore, we

show that the increase was driven by the private service sector – the growth of

dispersion in the manufacturing sector was muted.

       We examined several hypotheses that sought to explain the growth of the

productivity dispersion. Overall, we conclude that the data gives some support for

models along the lines of Caselli (1999) or Acemoglu et al. (2001). The diffusion of

new technologies heterogeneously across firms has increased both the spread of

productivity and the spread of wages. We found that those industries that had the most

rapid increase in the use of ICT also had the most rapid increase in productivity

dispersion.

       We argued that increases in the dispersion of inputs (such as ordinary capital)

could not fully account for this pattern as TFP dispersion has risen - which implies

that increased sorting is unlikely to be the main cause of the change. In addition, the

pattern was not due to an increase in transitory shocks as the transition matrices


                                          28
appear to be relatively stable at the beginning and end of the period. Thirdly, we

showed that increased dispersion amongst entrants was not the only cause of the

increased productivity inequality as productivity inequality grew even among

survivors.

       The next steps in our analysis are to combine the information here with

explicit measures of firm-level technology to test the theories more rigorously. Such

data is available and is being constructed (Bloom et al., 2007). We also need to use

more of the data from other countries, especially matched worker-firm data where we

can do more to control for worker heterogeneity. Moreover, we need to address

whether institutional or trade explanations have any purchase on the data. Finally, a

tighter match with the theory of equilibrium wage and productivity dispersion is also

a pressing need (e.g. Klette and Kortum (2004) or Lentz and Mortensen (2005)). This

research is in progress.

Note: Labor Productivity is defined as log (real value added /employment). We compare the
transitions between (two year) periods by decile (see Table 2 for the full matrix for labor
productivity). For example, the element in the first row and column indicates that 60% of the
firms who were in the top decile of productivity in the 1986-1987 period remained in the top
decile in the 1988-1989 period. Column (4) is the absolute difference between columns (3)
and (1). Column (5) is the absolute difference between columns (3) and (2).

Notes: Labor Productivity is defined as log (real value added /employment). We compare the
transitions between (two year) periods by decile (see Table 2 for the full matrix for labor
productivity). For example, the element in the first row and column indicates that 60% of the
firms who were in the top decile of productivity in the 1986-1987 period remained in the top
decile in the 1988-1989 period. Column (4) is the absolute difference between columns (3)
and (1). Column (5) is the absolute difference between columns (3) and (2).

Appendix A: Variance decomposition of the between-firm component
        Following Davis and Haltiwanger (1991) and Dunne et al. (2004), we
decompose wage dispersion into between-firm and within-firm components. Our
objective is to measure the contribution of the between and within components in
explaining wage inequality.
        Total variation in W = ln (wages) across workers is defined as V and can be
divided into a within firm (VWF) and between firm (VBF) component:
                       V = VWF + V BF                                           (A1)
The between firm component can be further divided into a between industry ( VBI ) and
within industry (but between firm) component ( VBFI ). This can be written:
                    V = VWF + VBI + VBFI                                        (A2)
More explicitly write the individual variance of wages as:

 V = ∑∑∑ (Wijk − W ) 2 = ∑∑∑ [(Wijk − W jk ) + (W jk − W )]2                      (A3)
         k       j   i                      k     j       i



where Wijk is the ln(wage) for worker i at firm j in sector k, Wjk is the average
ln(wage) at firm j in sector k and W is the mean wage across all workers in all firms
and sectors.
        Multiplying and dividing the first term of the right-hand side of equation (A3)
by Njk, (the total number of workers in firm j) and considering that the
 ∑ (W jk − W ) = N jk (W jk − W ) , equation (A3) becomes:
 i

                             (Wijk − W jk ) 2
V = ∑∑ N jk ∑                                   + ∑∑ N jk (W jk − W ) 2          (A4)
     k       j       N jki                            k       j

Equation (A4) can be written as:

V = ∑∑ N jk V jk + ∑∑ N jk (W jk − W )
                                                                  2
                                                                                 (A5)
     k       j                  k    j

        Dividing through by N, the total number of workers in the economy, we obtain
the decomposition of overall variation into within firm (WF) and between-firm (BF)
components:
       1                1
  V = ∑∑ N jk V jk + ∑∑ N jk (W jk − W )
                                              2
                                                                                 (A6)
       N k j            N k j
Define VWF as the employee-weighted variance of mean wages within firms and VBF
denotes the employee-weighted variance of mean wages between firms.
         ⎛1⎞
  VWF = ⎜ ⎟∑∑ N jk V jk                                                          (A7)
         ⎝N⎠ k j
         ⎛1⎞
  V BF = ⎜ ⎟∑∑ N jk (W jk − W )
                                 2
                                                                                 (A8)
         ⎝N⎠ k j
Substituting (A7) and (A8) into (A6) gives us equation (A1). It is straightforward to
show how this can be further decomposed into an industry specific component.
       The between-firm and within-firm variance terms in (A8) and (A7) cannot be
isolated from individual surveys like the NES, although the NES does permit
estimation of their sum, V. To isolate the components, we first calculate VBF directly
from the wage data in a firm-level database, FAME. We then estimate the within-firm

                                                                      50
wage variance as a difference between total variance and the between-firm component
using equation (A1)
                   VˆWF = V (W NES ) − V (W FAME )                             (A9)

where V(W NES) is the variance of measured wages in the NES and V(WFAME) is the
variance of wages in FAME. By applying this straightforward approach, we assume
that there is no bias resulting from measurement error in the NES32.




32
   Our approach of using equation (A8) to estimate within-firm variance of wages relies on the
assumptions that the variance of measurement error in the NES wage observations and the covariance
between true wage and the NES measurement error are negligible. Testing these assumptions requires
both employer-reported and worker-reported wages for a sample of workers. Unfortunately, we do not
have employer-employee linked data for the UK.

Appendix B: Data and additional results

B1. The Datasets used

Firm level dataset - FAME (Financial Analysis Made Easy)

        This database consists of company account data for the United Kingdom as
discussed in the main text. The main dataset we use is FAME (Financial Analysis
Made Easy) which is a UK company-level panel data set available since 1982. In
Britain, all incorporated companies are legally required to register their accounts at
Companies House and given a unique registration number. Unlike the US, this
includes not only companies listed on the Stock Exchange but also all unlisted
companies. In 2003, we arranged a special purchase of this data with a private sector
company (Jordan’s) that has converted this data into electronic form33. This is
unbalanced panel data and includes all firms that had exited the database prior to 2003
(by either bankruptcy or takeover).
        Under UK law, firms are also required to report a great deal more accounting
information on their wage bills than in the US (where declaration of staff expenses is
a voluntary item). Because of this, we are able to construct measures of average firm
wages that are unavailable for most firms in the US public accounts.
        We define average firm wage as the log ratio of total remuneration over the
number of employees. We define labor productivity as log real value added per
worker. Value added is calculated as the sum of gross profits before tax and staff
expenses (see Griffith, Harrison and Van Reenen, 2006). We also consider a
definition based on sales minus estimates of intermediate inputs.
        We apply three different measures of total factor productivity (TFP): (1) TFP
measured by the Solow residuals with fixed weights, (2) TFP measured by the Solow
residuals with industry specific weights and (3) TFP measured by the Solow residuals
with firm specific weights (this is the preferred measure used in the Figures). All
financial variables are expressed in thousands of pounds sterling and deflated by the
annual Retail Price Index (RPI).
        We made the following selections in the main analysis (selection biases
discussed below)
        • We exclude firms whose main industry was in agriculture, fishing, mining,
            utilities, public administration, health, education, social work and finance
            (the “manufacturing and private services” sample).
        • We keep consolidated company accounts data.
        • We keep firms with at least 10 employees.
        The final sample of firms contains information on about 11,000 companies
each year between 1984 and 2001. The database provides detailed information on
employment, tangible fixed assets, sales, gross profits, profits before tax and the
industry in which the firm is operating (as well as many other items from the balance
sheet).
        In testing the incidence of transitory productivity shocks hitting firms (sub-
section 5.2) we compute transition probabilities matrices of labor productivity, TFP,
average wage and average profits. We condition on the sub-sample of firms that also
33
   Bureau Van Dijk (BVD) supplied AMADEUS which contains FAME as a UK sub-component
(licensed from Jordan’s). Unfortunately only firms who died within the previous ten years are kept and
AMADEUS was not very complete until around 1999. This is why we needed to deal directly with
Jordan’s and arrange a dump from their mainframe.

                                                 52
satisfy the conditions that we have labor productivity values in a two-year periods.
The two-year periods are 1986/87 and 1988/89 (“the early period”), 1992/93 and
1994/95 (“the middle period”), 1998/99 and 2000/21 (“the late period”). The final
sub-sample for the entry/exit analysis includes 7,062; 8,092 and 9,590 firms in the
early, middle and late periods, respectively.

The New Earnings Survey (NES) is an employer reported survey, conducted in
April each year, of employees in employment in the UK. The sample frame, based on
national insurance (NI) numbers, covers roughly 1% of all employees – some 200,000
individuals each year between 1984 and 1999. Individuals can be matched across
years by their National Insurance (NI) numbers to form a panel of employees in
employment. Details on personal characteristics are limited, but there is a wealth of
information on earnings, hours, industry, occupation, sector and region. We have
access to the data for the years 1984 through 1999.

In order to compute our measure of gross annual pay, (1) we exclude Northern Ireland
from our sample, thus concentrating on a sample for Great Britain; (2) we select 16-
64 year old males and 16-59 year old females for which their pay and working hours
are not affected by absence; (3) we compute gross annual pay by multiplying gross
weekly pay by 52. Our sample consists of about 160,000 individuals each year. Wage
variables are expressed in thousands of pounds sterling and deflated by the annual
Retail Price Index (RPI).

Datastream contains company accounts data for UK firms listed on the stock
exchange. We exclude firms operating in the financial sector (SIC80 code: 814-832).
The sample at our disposal consists of about 1,350 firms each year between 1983 and
2001. We define average firm wage as real total remuneration per employee. We also
define labor productivity as real value added per employee. We use the annual RPI as
deflator.

Regnskapsstatistikk (REGN data) are the statistics of accounts for non-financial
joint-stock companies prepared by Creditinform and Statistics Norway. The accounts
statistics are from the enterprises’ financial statements submitted annually to the
Register of Company Accounts in Brønnøysund and cover in principle the entire
population of non-financial joint-stock companies. Data are available from 1992 but
the sample is incomplete before 1995. By selecting companies with at least 10
employees, our sample consists of about 18,000 firms each year from 1995-2002. We
define average firm wage as gross pay per employee. We also define labor
productivity as log real value added per employee. We use the annual CPI as deflator.

Bank of England Industry Dataset (BEID). This is a two-digit industry level dataset
covering all sectors of the economy. We drop public administration and defence so we
are left with 33 sectors. (Results are robust to the exclusion of sectors 31 (Education)
and 32 (Health and social work.) It is based on National Accounts data from the
Census. The ICT data is based on the supply and use tables. The full list of industries
is contained in Table A2. Descriptive statistics of the BEID dataset matched to FAME
are in Table A3.

B2. Robustness of the findings to sample selection and choice of productivity
measure

In this sub-section we discuss the sensitivity of the findings to the sample selections
(and other decisions) that we have made on FAME.

Industry Selection
         We considered a sample with no exclusions based on industry (“whole
sample”) as well as the main sample which drops various problematic sectors. These
sectors are problematic either because they have been influenced by government
control and/or because of difficulties in measuring productivity (financial services).
The original data had some missing values on the industry codes of dissolved firms so
we collected this information from other sources. Of the final sample, an average of
6% of firms (which represent 1% of aggregate employment) had missing values on
industry codes (see Table A.4 for details).
         To check the findings we contrast the dispersion trends for the “whole
economy” sample with the “manufacturing and private services” sample. The levels
of the firm and wage productivity distribution are given in Table A1 below. In Panel
A we use the whole economy sample across all sectors and group years into an early
(1984-89), middle (1990-95) and late (1996-2002) period. Mean real wages and real
productivity grew at the 10th, median and 90th percentiles of the distribution. But
inequality clearly grew too. The lower panel (B) shows the equivalent for the more
restricted sample. Although there is less dispersion as a whole (as we would expect
from drawing a more homogenous sample) the trends in inequality of wages and
productivity are quite comparable to the larger sample. This similarity can also be
seen from Figure 5a which contains the whole sample which is very similar to the
trends when we drop the problematic industries (see Figure 5b).

Using sales per worker instead of value added per worker
        Figure A1 uses sales per worker as an alternative measure of productivity to
value added per head. Sales are a line item in the company accounts, but have the
major disadvantage that they will be affected by intermediate materials. An increase
in the intensity of material use will increase sales per worker even if value added per
worker remains constant. This is particularly important in the retail and wholesale
sectors where intermediates are a large share of revenue.
        The variation of sales per worker has increased over this period, but not to the
same extent as value added per worker. In particular the increase in inequality has
come from an expansion of the 50-10 whereas the 90-50 has remained pretty constant.
We conclude that it is important to look at value added as the distribution of
intermediates has changed systematically over time.

Profit dispersion
        A related concern of using value added is that the increase in value added
dispersion is mechanical because value added is partly composed of the wage bill. Of
course, it is quite possible for individual wage dispersion to rise and between firm
wage dispersion to stay constant if the rise in wage inequality was entirely within
firms. Nevertheless, it is useful to examine the other component of value added, gross
profits directly to see if the variation in profits has risen. This is illustrated in Figure
A2. We see that it is indeed the case that profit variability has raised substantially in


                                            54
the data and the increase in productivity dispersion is driven by both an increase in the
inter-firm wage and the inter-firm profit dispersion.


FAME Sampling Frame
        Could our results be driven by some problem with the sampling structure of
FAME? Although FAME is meant to be comprehensive, data errors cannot be ruled
out as the data collectors did appear to become more efficient over time (we dropped
the 1979-1983 data because the numbers of firms were too low to be representative of
the cross section). The total number of firms in FAME rises over time, but this is also
partly due to the booming business cycle after 1983. The fact that inequality rises
consistently after 1987 when the number of FAME firms is very stable gives us
confidence that this is not the case.
        Nevertheless, we tested the “sample composition” hypothesis in several ways.
First, we turned to an entirely separate database, Datastream. The Datastream On-line
service includes only listed firms (like Compustat) but has been running since 1968 so
is much better established. It is comparable to Compustat in the US. The disadvantage
of Datastream, of course is that it does not include unlisted firms. Consequently,
whereas we have 11,000 firms a year in FAME we have around 1,500 firms a year in
Datastream.
        Despite these limitations, we re-ran our analysis on the Datastream sample
using the same variable and sample definitions as FAME. The results were similar, if
not even stronger. Figure A3 gives the productivity dispersion graphs for the whole
economy and is comparable with Figure 5 in the main text. The 90th percentile has
increased value added per worker by 60 log points over this period, almost identical to
FAME. This is all of the Datastream firms are contained in FAME and will generally
be those at the top of the productivity distribution. By contrast, the 10th percentile has
experienced almost no productivity growth. This is a larger increase in dispersion than
we observed in FAME. It is consistent with the Davis, Haltiwanger, Jarmin and
Miranda (2006) finding that listed firms in the US appear to be becoming more
heterogeneous than unlisted firms (possibly due to greater turnover in the Stock
Market as more volatile firms, such as biotechnology and software start-ups enter and
exit).
        When we split by sector, as usual we observe that the growth of inequality in
the manufacturing sector (Figure A4) is much less than the growth of inequality in the
services sector (Figure A5). Again, this is reassuring as it is consistent with the
findings from the FAME database.

Firm Size
        We drop firms with less than ten employees because sales and employment do
not need to be reported for these firms under UK accounting regulations. This could
cause various types of selection bias. One test of this concern is to compare the
variance trends with the 90-10 Figures. The percentiles of the firm distribution treat
each firm as a separate unweighted unit, so dropping the small firms potentially
makes a large difference. The variance calculations, however, weight a firm’s
productivity by its employment size. Since the firm size distribution is highly skewed
the missing firms will only have a small weight in the overall productivity distribution
so are unlikely to have much effect on the results.
        As a second check on the sample composition of FAME we examined the
changing size distribution by looking at employment. In 2002 the median firm had

                                           55
150 employees in FAME. We plot out the 90-50 and 50-10 of the log (employment)
distribution in FAME in Figure A6. There has been some decrease in the size
distribution at the higher end – the 90-50 has fallen, but there has been some widening
of the size distribution at the bottom end as the 50-10 has risen. Overall, the 90-10 is
about the same at the end of the period (4.02) as it was at the beginning of the period
(4.11). We conclude that the firm size distribution has not become systematically
more unequal over this period. This suggests that the sampling frame has not changed
in FAME in a systematic way that would necessarily imply more heterogeneity on all
measures.

        The lack of a trend in the size distribution also makes it unlikely that our
results are due to changes in the degree of outsourcing by firms. A concern with using
consolidated accounts is that firms may be focusing on smaller lines of business and
outsourcing non-core functions. This would give the appearance of increased
productivity dispersion even though all that is occurring is vertical fragmentation. The
fact that the size distribution is reasonably stable makes this explanation unlikely.

Appendix C: Changes in the variance of wages and the role of firm productivity

Assume that wages are determined partially by the worker’s value on the open labor
market and partially by the performance of the firm that he or she is matched to. This
type of equation is rationalised by a number of theoretical models of imperfect labor
market competition (e.g. Mortensen, 2003; Layard et al., 2005). The wage equation is
assumed to be:

ln Wt = α t ln H t + β t ln At = α t ht + β t at                                      (C1)

where W is the average wage in the firm, H is the competitive wage for the workers
(which depends on human capital) and A is the performance (i.e. the productivity of
the firm). Small case letters denotes natural logarithms. Theory restricts 0 ≤ β t , α t ≤ 1 .

In discrete time this becomes

∆(var(wt ) ) =
β t2 ∆(var(at ) )
                                                                                      (C4)
+ 2 var(at ) β t ∆β t + α t2 ∆(var(ht ) ) + 2 var(ht )α t ∆α t
+ 2α t β t ∆ cov(ht , at ) + 2α t cov(ht , at )∆β t + 2β t cov(ht , at )∆α t


So clearly, one way in which an increase in the productivity variation increases the
wage dispersion is through the first term: β t2 ∆(var(at ) ) . The percentage of the increase
                                                                ∆ var(ln A)
in wage variation accounted for by this component is: β 2                   .
                                                                ∆ var(lnW )


To obtain some more intuition on the other terms, consider the situation where the
coefficients do not change over time (i.e. β t = β and α t = α ). In this case:

∆ (var(wt ) ) = β 2 ∆ (var(a t ) ) + α 2 ∆ (var(ht ) ) + 2α β ∆ cov(ht , a t )        (C5)


                                                      57
The variance of wages could increase because the variance of productivity has
increased (the first term, β 2 ∆(var(at ) ) , or because the variance of the human capital
has increased (the second term, α 2 ∆ (var(ht ) ) ) or because the covariance of human
capital and firm productivity has become more positive (the third term,
2α β ∆ cov(ht , at ) ). The final explanation is equivalence to an increased sorting of
“good firms” and “good workers” (Kremer and Maskin, 1996).

Returning to the full decomposition in equation (C4) consider the model
where α t = 1 − β t . Simplifying terms we can express this as:

         ∆(var(wt ) ) = β t2 ∆(var(at ) ) + (1 − β t ) 2 ∆(var(ht ) ) +
         + 2(1 − β t ) β t ∆ cov(ht , at ) + 2∆β t [ β t (var(at ) ) +                      (C6)
         − (1 − β t ) var(ht ) + (1 − 2β t ) cov(ht , at )]


In the paper we show evidence that β t appears to have risen over time, suggesting the
productivity distribution is becoming more important. However, we cannot say for
certain whether this also contributes to increased inequality as it depends on the sign
of the second line. Since most estimates put β t <0.5 and assume cov(ht , at ) >0 the
final term is positive.

Unfortunately, the var(h) is essentially unobservable in our data so we cannot rule out
the possibility that:
 β t (var(at ) ) − (1 − β t ) var(ht ) + (1 − 2β t ) cov(ht , at ) < 0 in which case the increase in
the impact of productivity on wages would contribute to a fall in inequality.

Using β =0.3 and the empirical average variances in our data var(w) = .23, var(a) =
.55. Using (C1) and calculating the cross sectional variance residual var(h) = 0.37 -
0.21*cov(h,a). To calculate the final line of (C6):

β t (var(at ) ) − (1 − β t ) var(ht ) = 0.3*0.55 - 0.7*(0.37 - 0.21*cov(h,a)) = -0.094 +
0.147*cov(h,a). So in order for an increase in the β to have a positive impact on
wage inequality we need cov(h,a)>0.64, a high degree of the level of positive sorting
between firms and workers.
