     This paper deals with the effects of labor and transfer incoaes as

determinants of older women's labor force participation. It examines the

                                                          available from
responsiveness of women aged 48-62 to the level of income

both work and public transfer programs when deciding between work and

nonwork options.     The main focus is on whether the availability and gener-

                                                               of these
osity of disability-related transfers affects the labor supply

women.    A   msximum-likelihood model is estimated separately for heads of

household and wives.           The results suggest income opportunities have s

significant effect only on the work choices of wives.           The responsiveness

to the availability and generosity of public transfers is largest among

older,    disabled women who have low expected earnings.

1.     INTRODUCTION


     A rapid upward trend        in female labor       force    participation baa been

obaerved both in the United States and In other western Industrialized

countries.        Analysis of the determinants of female labor force

participa don——      labor supply——has been described as a maj or 'no ttago
ndustry' (see, for        example, Mincer, 1962; Cain, 1966 and 1985; deckman,
1074    and 1978; Layard,      Barton,   amd   Zabaiza, 1980; Smith, 1980; Smith and

Word,    1985).     Empirical estimates of       the   influence of these determinants

is important for several reasons.              A practical reason for studying female

Labor supply is to evaluate the cost and caseload Implications of respon-

ses of women to changes in the terms of access to and                  the generosity of

Lncome transfer programs, some of which are targeted on women.1                   8 more

basic reason is the benefits that derive from improved forecasts of the

future size and structure of the labor force.2                  The primary motivation of

this study relates       to   both of thesa reasons:           To what extent are the work

decisions    of    the radically larger future cohorts of older woaen covered


by Social Security Disability Imsursnce (5501) and other transfer

programs--attributable to the increased female labor force                  participation

rates--likely to be influenced by the gemerosity and accessibiity of

benefi ts?

     This study,      then, focuses on a particular aspect of the female labor

supply issue in the U.S.:          To what extent do older women with work

experience respond to market and transfer income opportunities when
                                        2



deciding between work and nonwork options?            Because the bulk of public

transfers available to older women are targeted on workers with health

problems or disabilities, this question concerns the effects of

disability-related transfers        on labor supply.     The iaaue baa been exten-

sively studied      in the case of older    men, motivated by the observed secu-

lar decline in their        labor force participation rates    and assertions that

this reduction in work effort has been caused by the growth and genero-

sity of disability transfers (Leonard, 1979; Parsons, 1980 and 1984;

S lade,   1984;   Havenan and Wolfe, l984a and l984b).       Although this effect

is equally relevant for both older women and men,           there   has been no prior


study of this response for women, its importance camouflaged by the

generally increasing trend of women's work.            Among older women however,

this    trend   is less pronounced.

       The issue of the effect of transfer income--especially disability

transfers--on women's work has also seemed less urgent because, until

recently, only a small percentage of women have worked sufficiently              to


accumulate the necessary quarters of coverage to be covered by Social

Security Disability Insurance (5501)        benefits,    the largest source of


disability-related transfer income.3         In 1960 only 99,000 women aged less

than 64 were SSDI beneficiaries on the basis of their own earnings

record.     By 1984, however, this had grown to 849,000, an eightfold

increase.       In 1960,   the average age of these    disabled workers was 56.7;

in 1984 it was 53.2 (U.S.        Social Security Bulletin, Annual Statistical

Supplement, 1986).

       As the incidence of women's work continues to grow,          eligibility for

SSDI will expand,      as will the potential for disability transfers to

influence wometYs work decisions. Hence, for both appraising the future
                                      3


of   older   womens   work patterns and forecasting the future costs and case-

loads of public disability transfer programs, it is important that the

work-transfer linkage for older women also be analyzed.       The common

finding that women's labor supply response to wage and other income

changes is substantially larger than that for men suggests that future

aggregate cost, caseload, and welfare impacts of various social security

policies will be increasingly dominated by women and their choices.

      In this paper, we estimate the responsiveness of older female labor

supply to both the level of income available if not working--primarily

disability-related public transfers--and expected income      if   working.

Because the circumstances and the process of choice is likely to differ

between married and unmarried women, we present estimates for both

household heads and wives.

      In Section 2 we present our model of the labor supply decision of

older    women.   The model suggests that expected income flows if    working   or

not working    are primary determinants of the work choice.    For female

household heads younger than 62 who are working, the primary source of

income    is labor earnings.    The bulk of income available if not working

comes from public income transfers, primarily those providing income

support if disabled.4       The data are described and the results presented

in Section 3.      They are interpreted in Section 4.   Section 5 offers

conclusione.



2•    A I4ODKL OF WOMXSTATUS CHOICE



      Our model begins with the standard assumption of    utility maximization
in   which individuals face a choice between working, with its associated

income flow, and not working, with it. available income flow.         The income
                                                           4



associated with each option,                        together with other sources of utility (such

as time spent in leisure and the stigma associated with public transfer

recipiency), determines well—being.

      Utility in the labor market, L, is


           UL
                 =
                     UL(M
                            +       A ÷ N,      ,                                                                (I)

where N     Is       the income flow            in the labor market or work option,                    A is exo-

genous asset income, N                   is    earned income of other family members and                    ff    is

the hours        of market work.               In analogous fashion,


                =
                     UD(T   +       A ÷ N, 0)                                                                    (2)


is the utility in the nonwork option, 0, where                                     T    is   the income flow and

H     0.    The partial derivatives of both functions with respect to H are

negative and with respect to N, T, A, and N are positive.

      We approximate the utility functions by assuming that they are linear

in their arguments.                  Hence, the utility-maximizing individual followa the

decision function,


           1* =             +   A + N, H) - U0(T               +   A   +   N, 0)                                 (3)
                     UL(M


                     cz(M   +   A   +   N) -   L(T +   A   +    N)     + wX +      V,



where X     is a      vector of parameters of the utility function and V is a

random error term with a zero mean measuring tastes and other unobserved

variables.           Given this rule, and assuming                         Ti is   fixed for those choosing

the   labor market option,
                                                             5



                       1 if 1*               >   0
                  C
            1=
                       0     if       1*         0,

where   I    represents the labor market or work option and 0 represents the

nonwork or transfer recipiency option.

    Equation           (3)    could he directly estimated if all of the right-hand

side variables were observed. The expected coefficient signs are posi-

tive for H and negative for T, if leisure                                   is a   normal good.    However, the

Lncome flows (H, T) are observed only                                 if   the respective choice was made.


(ence, we need to explicitly or implicitly determine H for                                        those with I

  and   T for those with I                            I.   Equations (4) and (5) describe the

determination of H and T as a function of variables Z, including both

exogenous individual characteristics expected to influence income flows

in the work and nonwork options                             and the characteristics of labor and

transfer markets describing the terms on which the respective flows are

vaiiable.          In this theoretical representation we simplify, letting H

represent H        +   N and T represent T                   +   N:



                                  +                                                                          ()
                   -l!lj              tlj'



                                  +
            T1     _2.2]               t2j


Since            ie aasumed to be exogenous,
                                             E(€jj                            )       0 for   i   1,2.

    From this, we can write the model as a simultaneous equation system

in (6),      (7), and (8):

     The selection             rule         presumes      that individuals know the outcome if

either the work or the transfer recipiency option is chosen,                                                       implying

that search activity in both options has been engaged in, and that a

lang-run equilibrium has been achieved.                                         The seiection equation, however,

recognizes that for some individuais search                                        tiny       be incomplete, so that

the realized income flow in an option may fall short of or exceed the ax

ante estimate of expected income.                                 The equation also refiecta the cost of

application and the discretionary role of employers and administrators                                                          to


the extent they depend on observed characteristics,                                              .
     Since             and             are involved in the decision process but our obser-

vation of them depends on the final choice,                                        the observed values are trun-


cated and OLS estimates of (6) and (7) will be biased.                                                   However, given

                                                                                                                              and
sample separation, we observe the final choice.                                                Hence,    l' 82         0112

    This,          then, is an example of a "switching regression," where the

switch    is       endogenous.              Our model has             been   discussed by Lee (1979), who

has shown          that the system can                    be   estimated      by   the   following maximum like-

(12).      Asymptotic standard errors of these estimates are obtained from

the inverse of the Hessian of this log—likelihood with respect to the

coefficients.5      This procedure provides consistent and asymptotic effi-

cient estimates, with the sole restriction that the possibly non-zero

covariance of               £2 cannot be estimated.
                      and

      Starting values for the full maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of

equation (12) are from the two—stage procedure defined by Lee (1979),

which utilizes modified least squares            in the first stage     and probit maxi-

oom   likelihood   in the second.    This probit-OLS model has          gained   popu--


larity for its computational ease.          it    is,   however, less efficient, and

nay underestimate the standard errors of the estimates of the coef-

ficients a and I in the decision function               (8).
      This approach    to   modeling the work-nonwork choice       is   the result of

simplifications—-such as the use of one            global   nonwork income variable

and a linear utility function——which preclude specification of the

complete and nonlinear budget constraint and the estimation of                utility
maximizing    work-nonwork choices with respect to it (Hauaman,             1981).

These simplifications are dictated by the complexity of market-transfer—

family income-generation systems.        For example, in the United States

there is no single transfer program providing support to older nonworking

or working women,      instead, several interdependent programs, each with

its   an   budget set and eligibility criteria, provide cash and in-kind

support to working—age people.        Some of these programs are income con-

ditioned (e.g., SSI);       others are not.      Some of these limit earnings

(e.g., SSDI and SSI);       others do not (e.g., Workers' Compensation).             For

some programs, eligibility depends on past work history (e.g., 55TH); for
                                              9



others,     eligibility depends on the nature of an impairment and its cause

(e.g., Workers' Compensation and Black Lung Compensation); for stilt

others, the presence of the            impairment   is sufficient to confer benefits.

The cost of applying for benefits is very high in some programs (e.g.,

SSDI); application cost for others is effectively zero.                Any person can

receive benefits from a number of the programs simultaneously, depending

on widely disparate coverage and eligibility provisions.                Indeed, bene-

fits awarded in one program often automaticalLy grant eligibility for

)enefits in another.             Moreover, the system   to   lit-defined,   so that Lnfor—

na don    regarding the availability of benefits from the several inter-
dependent programs, and the conditions              under which benefits can be

received,     is poor.     Similar complexities      affect the Labor   market and

interspousal     income flow options.

    In addition       to   the    complex   and interdependent nature of the process

by which income is determined in the L and 0 options, the processes by

which individuals apply and are found eligible for income flows in each

of the options is not well understood.              In particular, the process by

which individuals move from disability transfer recipiency status to the

labor market     is   a complex one,        though such return to work choices are in

evidence in the U.S.         These processes involve decisions by both those who

ultimately determine eligibility for income flows               in these options--


employers, transfer program administrators and husbands, each with their

own objectives and decision rules--and women with their own unique

characteristics and objectives.7              Our reduced-form model attempts      to


accommodate all of this complexity.

3.    DATA AND MODEL SPECIFICATION


      The ML model which we estimate employs static,        cross-sectional data

of the sort used in a wide variety of recent studies of the behavioral

 responses to incentives implicit in tax and tranfer programs (Danziger,

Haveman, and Plotnick, 1981).         The data are for women aged 45-62 in 1978

who have worked full time for     7    years or more,   indicating a strong labor

market attachment.8    This work history provides then with coverage by the

Social Security system.    The observations are from the Michigan Panel

Study of Income Dynamics.   The choice of work status in a given year

(1978) is taken as dependent on the value of the expected income flow in

each option in that year,9 as weLl as taste, health, and stigma factors,

implying that the choice of income or transfers         is reversible.

Being a labor market participant (i.e., as having chosen option L) is

defined as having income fLows or Labor market characteristics defined by

at least one of (1) labor income (earnings plus hours         unemployed or on

strike times average hourly earnings) greater than zero and no

disability—related transfers,   (2) being self-employed and reporting 500

or more hours worked last year,       or (3) having disability-related trans-

fers greater than zero but labor income greater than $3,360.10           Its

complement, option D, is defined as not meeting the criteria for having

chosen the L option.   The panel character of the data allows the use of

time-related information before and beyond 1978 to reflect both prior

work history and expectations of future outcomes (e.g., variables related

to expected future income flows in the L and D options.          See Willis and

Rosen, 1979).   (The specific variables employed are described in Appendix

A.)
                                         11


      The variables included in (12) reflect those demand-side and supply-

side characteristics of both the labor market and the          transfer     recipiency

 market' which are likely to affect the presence of an individual in

either group.       Education, family background, and disability status cap-

ture the individual's perception of potential work capacity and produc-

tivity,    as does age.    They also describe Important determinants of

oligibility for transfers.        The presence of children reflects the income

requirements of the       household   as well as influencing the opportunity cost

 f    working.    The area-specific unemployment rate,     region,   and   urban-rural

background reflect the employment opportunities open to the individual,

and hence the likelihood of both obtaining a job or gaining eligibility

for    transfers.

      The location variables also proxy the differential application of              the
criteria for determining the eligibility for transfer benefits.              Previous

usual occupation and the cause of single status (for household heads)

proxies transfer program coverage, past earnings and the probability of

receiving child support or alimony income.         The race variable captures

the effect of potential labor market discrimination in both employment


opportunities and the determination of eligibility for transfers.

Religion is entered as a taste variable.         In the estimate for wives, the

effect of joint household considerations on the woman's work choice             is


captured by the age difference between the wife and her husband, the

asset income of the family, and by the        earnings   capacity of the husband

(as   opposed    to his actual earnings, which tend to be endogenous to the

wife's labor market decision).
                                            12


     Because    choice of the nonwork option,            D, depends on expected public

transfer income if not working, and because disability-related transfers

weigh so heavily in this expected value,                it is essential that a disabil-


ity or health status variable which La exogenous to the work decision be

included in the set of independent variables.                 We use a multidimensional

"true" disability measure obtained as an unobservable in a separate

Latent variable structural model (LISREL) estimatIon (Joreskog and

Sorbom, 1983).        This measure was developed in Haveman and Wolfe (1985),

and La briefly described in Appendix             B.




4.   EMPIRICAL RESULTS


     Tables 1-3 present the empirical results from the maximum likelihood

estimation.     The    determinants   of   labor market income (N) and nonwork
income (T)    are shown in Tables 1 and          2    for heads    and wives, respectively.

Table   3   contains the structural probability portion of the model and

shows the determinants of the work (N) or no work (D) choice.

     The determinants of market income for household heads are as pre-

dicted by standard human-capital—based theory.                    Age, work experience, and

health status are all positively related to N and all are significant.

The education and education-squared variables indicate that market Income

falls with education up       to   year 7, but rises thereafter.           Being white and

growing up outside the South both contribute positively to N, hut only

race is significant at the .05 level.

     The underlying process of nomwork income determinatiom for household

heads is murkier.       While the signs on the coefficients are all reasonable

and consistent with expectations, only race is sigmificamt.                    Being white
                                        13



tends   to be associated with greater transfer income because public Social


Security benefits are a positive function of earnings while working.

    The labor market income determinants for wives have much the same

pattern as for heads, although in this case growing up outside the South

is both positive and significant.        The nonwork income determinants for

wives again parallel those for heads.          The additional variable in the

estimation for wives-— the age difference between the wife and her
husband—- is positive and significant.  Having a disabled husband adds

positively to the wife's labor income, and significantly so to nonwork
income. The former suggests that a woman nay work more if she Is the

primary   earner;    the Latter that this     increased work leads     to   higher

pension income.        This nonwork income    is likely to   be   further increased   by

lependents'    benefits for a disabled spouse.

    The estimates In Table 3 allow us to measure the work response of

older women to      the income incentives in    both the labor     market and   in the
oarket for        transfers. These estimates also indicate the role of
              income

other factors, including alternative time demands and stigma con-
siderations on the choice of whether or not to work.

    For both heads and wives, expected income if working positively

affects the decision to work outside of the home; it is statistically

significant for wives.        While income expectations if not working appear

to deter a decision to work outside the home for both female heads and

wives, the    coefficient    is not significant in either case.        Older females,

then,   appear somewhat responsive to income incentives in both the labor

market and the "transfer"       market in    making their labor force par-

ticipation choice;       however, in 3 of the 4 cases, these concurrent market

incentives are      not significant)1
                                         14


      The response to income incentives is also captured by the expected

growth or change in income variables1-2 as well as the income level

variables.     The change is included to reflect the long-term consequences

of the work-nonwork choice at any point in time.          Choices made will

generally include an expectation of future income in each option.             These

expectations are based on actual experiences        to 1981   (a three—year


period).    Again, the responses of both female heads and wives ara as

expected, but are not statistically significant for either group.

      A likelihood ratio    test for the joint significance of the expected

labor market income variables (N and change in N) was run for both heads

and wives, and indicates that the combination        is   statistically signifi-

cant (at the    1   percent level) for wives, but not for heads.     Similar

tests for the expected nonwork income variables (T and change in T) and

for   the joint significance of the change in market and        transfer incomes

were not significant (at the      5   percent level) for either group except the

joint change of both incomes for wives.         Finally, a likelihood ratio teat

for   the joint significance of all of the expected income variables (both

levels and changes) was performed.         For wives, this teat was significant

at the 1 percent level, justifying the conclusion that the choice of

whether or not to work is significantly affected by income expectations

for   this group.    It was not significant for heads, suggesting that their

work choice is not significantly affected by income expectations.

      Other coefficients in Table 3 are also of interest.        For both female

heads and wives, health status is an important determinant of the deci-

sion of whether or not to work;        those women with health problems are     less
                                         15


likely to be labor force participants than healthier          women.    This effect
is in addition to the impact of the health variables           on   the work choice,
which operates through the expected income and income-change terms. The

number of   children borne   by   a   woman   before age 25 years is a significant
determinant of the labor supply decision in later years, but             has a quite

different impact for heads and wives.           For female heads, births early in

life tend to discourage labor supply in later years; female headship

proxies for widow, and suggests an income effect from the availability of

survivors' and dependent benefits from Social Security.             For wives,

having children early in life tends           to encourage work in later years; for

such women, child-rearing responsibilities have been significantly

reduced by age 40.    In the estimate for wives, the husband's permanent

wage rate13 and asset income are designed to control for the effect of

nonwork income on the labor supply choice;           both are correctly signed and

significant.

    Table 4 presents the response elasticities of expected M and expected

T for both heads and wives,'4 and the predicted probability of working.

At the mean of the variables in the model, the elasticity of response to

labor market income (N) is very close to unity for both heads and wives.

As with the models' coefficients, the elasticity of response to expected

transfer income (T) is smaller for both heads and wives:             -.73 and - .24,

respectively.15    At the mean, the predicted probability of working is

nearly .6 for heads, and nearly .5 for spouses.            The remainder of the

table presents calculated response elasticities and predicted work proba-

bilities at other points in the distribution.            The patterns are not unex-

pected.   The better (worse) the health or disability status of older

women, the higher (lower)     is their predicted probability of working and
                                   16


the lower (higher) ie their response to income incentives, whether

offered in the labor or "transfer" markets.

    The final comparison shows the responaiveness of women of varying

earning capacities.   Those with skills and, hence, earnings expectations

one standard deviation below the mean are only about one-half as likely

to be labor market participants as those lying one standard deviation

above the mean earnings capacity. More significantly, those with poorer

labor market prospects (and hence superior income transfer opportunities)

are about twice as sensitive to income incentives as are those well up in

the potential earnings distribution.     Changes in income opportunities--

either from working or through transfers--appear to elicit a substan-

tially greater response from low-skilled women than from those with

skills and high earnings potential. The low labor force participation

probabilities for less—skilled women (.4 for heads and .31 for wives)

appear to be rational responses to the income opportunities available to

them in both the labor market and the "transfer" market.

    A test of the accuracy of our estimates is possible by comparing the

predicted results   to the actual participation—nonparticipation decision

of the older workers in the sample.     Of the 196 heads and 264 wives in

the sample who are participants, 75 percent and 72 percent, respectively,

are predicted by the estimated model to have a probability of more than

.5 of being participants.   Of the 148 heads and 278 spouses who are non-

participants, 64 percent and 71 percent, respectively, have a predicted

probability of more than .5 of beimg nonparticipants.    Thus, our predic-

tions are "correct" for 71 percent of the sample.    The accuracy of these

predictions suggests that our model does identify the significant
                                                17


determinants            of the labor force participation decision of older women,

including expected incomes in the labor                    and   "transfer" markets.

          To   obtain a rough estimate of the potential effects of changed expec-
tations regarding both current transfer incomes and changed expectations
regarding future transfer income prospects, we simulate the effect of a
 0 percent increase and a 20 percent decrease in both T and change in T

for each observation in the sample.                  The    results,   which are based       on our
                                                                                             -
nonlinear         NIL   estimates   shown in Table 5, suggest that a 40         percent
increase          in total non—work income flows could account for a five-

percentage-point decrease in older wives'                    labor force participation, and

i    13    point decrease in older        heads.'    participation.      Since Social Security

disability benefits account for approximately 40 percent of                      this       income

flow,          this is equivalent to raising these benefits by 100 percent, or 2

1/3       times    the 43 percent increase that actually occurred over the

1968-1978 period.             Recall however that the head's simulation is based on

a statistically insignificant coefficient and so should be treated with

caution.                                                                                -




5.        CONCLUSION


          These estimates of response suggest that income opportunities,

whether in the labor market or the 'transfer"                     market, have an effect on

the       work choices of older women, whether household heads or wives.                         The

rapid increase in female labor force participation during the 1970s,

which accompanied increased relative female wage rates and an improved

outlook for women's work opportunities, are consistent with these

results (Killingsworth, 1983).
                                   18


    These results are also important for anticipating potential problems

associated with changes in income transfer policy.    For older women at


present, a primary source of income in the "transfer" market is 5501, yet

a relatively small percentage of these    women have worked for a sufficient

number of quarters to qualify for recipiency.    Given recent trends in

women's work patterns, a far greater proportion of older women in the

lS9Os   will be eligible for benefits.   Our results suggest that eligible

women--especially low earners, wives, and those with health problems--dc
                                                                  income.

Sizable increases in expected benefits,    deriving from increases in either

generosity or leniency, may well have substantial impacts on older

women's work petterns.

gained into the relative contribution of other variables to the observed

increase in female labor force participation rates.     While our results

suggest that improvements in labor market incomes and opportunities in

the 1970s have contributed to the increase, the effect of changes in

tastes for work,   social expectations regarding work, the physical demands

of occupations, the incidence of impairments, and income from husbands

and other sources remains unexplained.

                                       Notea


    -A number of studies have focused on           this issue (Garfinkel and Orr,


1974; Levy 1979; Barr and Hall,      1981;    Hausman, 1981;     Burtless   and

Moffitt, 1984).

    21n addition   to   these   reasons, however, the extensive study of female

labor supply has been driven by the knotty conceptual and econometric


problems which dominate this topic.          They include the interdependence of

the husband's and the wife's labor supply decisions in two-adult house-

holds, and the need to account for the process by which some women select

Labor market participation while others,           with apparently similar charac-

teristics, do not.      indeed,   the female labor        supply issue has motivated

                                                                       in
important developments in both consumption (joint utility maximization

household choice) and econometric (techniques for dealin4 with selection

bias)   theory.

        woman requires one quarter of coverage for each year after 1950 up

to the year the woman attains age 62.          Thus, a woman reaching 62 in 1979

would need 28 quarters of coverage, acquired anytime after 1936.

    41n the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics 1978 wave, 91 percent

of nonworking female heads received public transfer income; 60 percent

received SSDI or Supplementary Security Income (SSI) Disabled benefits.

    5The derivatives of the log-likelihood with respect to the coef-

ficients are in the Appendix of Lee (1979), which contains a few errors.

The correct derivatives are available from the authors on request.

    6This is related to the assumption that each individual takes the

value of his expected income in the         work           and nonwork          options
                                                   (Mi)                  (Ti)

from individuals with similar characteristics in these options.

      71f these objectives and rules have changed over time,        the analysis

at a point in time would reflect both past and current conditions.             This

is unlikely to be significant in this case,       as leniency had increased for

most disability programs from their inception to 1973.           Since one can

reapply if denied, the 1973 data are likely        to   reflect 1978 rules and

o bj e c t iv es.

      8We exclude workers older   than 62 because most are eligible for

Social Security early retirement benefits at 62.          Inclusion of oLder

workers would further complicate the estimation problem and mask the role

of disability transfers in the early retirement deciaions.          Evidence

suggests that the availability of disability transfers is Less likely             to


alter the work status of individuals below 45 years of age.           Extensive

research on the effect of disability transfers on men' s labor supply

choices also focuses on this age group.

      9The data set for the ML procedures--a BMDP-routine (P3RFUt4) with a

3elf—supplied supplement-—contains twice the same vector of (work or

nonwork) income observations.     However, for wives some of the obser-

vations of nonwork income are missing owing to the occasional failure of

the data to record the existence and magnitude of interspousal transfers.

We used an "adjusted tobit"-model    to    fill these   gaps with the expected

values of nonwork income.    This entailed running a selectivity-corrected

OLS on the positive nonwork income observations, while the Heckman selec-

tivity term was calculated from a probit explaining the presence and

report of nonwork income.    The probit and OLS-results were combined to

predict

158—60).

      10Rectpients of SSDI benefits are allowed $28 of earned income per

month without calling into question their eligibility status.                            Earnings

beyond this amount is considered "substantial gainful employment" and is

viewed as inconsistent with being "totally and permanently disabled."

      11The correlations between expected nonwork income (T) and expected

labor income (N)         are    .69 (wives)       and .86 (heads). The     large   value for

heads may account for the large-but—insignificant income coefficients for

heads.

      12The   two   expected         change-in-income variables (Change in         NI;   Change in
T) are calculated for each observation from expected income variables in

1978 and 1q81:          Change in M = (M1981 — M1978)/M1978; Change in T

         -
(T1981   T1978)/T1978. For each of the two years, H and T are predicted
From income regressions fit over observations in the labor market (L) and

"transfer"    market      (0)       categories.    The    right-hand variab les in the income
regressions include            age,   education, occupation, race, region, marital

status, disability status, and a Heckman selectivity correction calcu-

lated from a probit regression explaining the presence of observations in

the L and D categories.               For spouses, a stepwise tobit regression was fit

in order to predict                                                      number of spouses
                    T1981 and T1978, as a substantial
in   the D category reported zero income (see note 9).

     13The husband' s hourly wage rate is a predicted value based on a log

wage rate regression run on husbands with a reported wage rate.                           The

explanatory variables are age, education, work experience, race,                          region,

religion, and a Heckman selection variable constructed from a probit

regression fit over all husbands explaining the presence of a wage rate.

      14lnsofar as the underlying income and expected income coefficients

are not significant, these       elasticities are only suggestive cf the rela-

tive differences in the response to income incentives.

      1 5These   elas tici ties are substantially   greater   than those ea dma ted
for   older   men in a related study     (Haveman and Wolfe, l984b).     There,

men's work choice was modeled as a function of expected labor income,

expected disability transfer income, and a variety of taste and stigma

variables in a two-stage       probit framework. The work decision of older

nen was significantly related       to   expected income, but the elasticities

there   ranged from .006 to .0003.       Here the elasticities are larger for

both groups of women but are not significant for household heads.             While

the direction of the difference in response elasticities and significance

Is consistent with findings generally, the substantial magnitude of the

difference suggests a greater labor force attachment of males and female

heads   relative    to female spouses than may be    generally recognized
(Killingsworth, 1983).

                         An Indicator    of Disability and Health          Statu8
                                     Measured as an Unobservable


       The indicator            used   in this work is designed to be a multipurpose

indicator of true disability that emphasizes the functional and work—

related character of impairments (a loss in physiological, anatomical or

mental capacity).                True disability is viewed as an unobservable and its

value is estimated as a latent variable from a system of structural

equations.          The structure of the model is presented in equations 1                     and 2:

(1)         U5 = B'X      +
                              e1

                            +   e.,
                                 1



where D*         is the unobservable variable measuring true disability status;                     X

is a vector of observable exogenous variables; 1
                                                                 1    is    a   vector of indica-
tors    for the unobservable variable D*;                   is the   vector of coefficients
                                                        a
relating       D*    indicator; and e,
                    to each                            are the vectors of           error ternis
assumed to be normally distributed.
      The   model was estimated using LISREL full-information, maximum like-

lihood procedure.               The data used were persons 18-64 in the 1978 Social

Security Administration Survey of the Disabled.                      The model and results

are described more fully in haveman and Wolfe (1985).

      The X vector includes the socioeconomic characteristics of the indi-

vidual,     family income,             personal habits, and the requirements and charac-

teristics of an individual's normal occupation.                      The I Vector of

indicators includes variables which are expected to reflect the presence

or absence of impairing conditions or functional limitations.                             They
                                  32



include the extent of self-reported and interviewer-reported work limita-

tions, medicalcare   utilization, specific health problems, general

health, mobility, and the percentage of weighted occupations for which a

person is qualified based on a comparison of job requirements with indi-

vidual capabilities.

    The results are used to calculate an imputed value of D* for each

observa tion.
