       We examine the impact of monetary injections in the Grossman-Weiss-Rotemberg        Model.

We show that monetary shocks can lead to nominal exchange rates that are much more volatile than

inflation, money growth, or interest rate differentials. Moreover, movements in real exchange rates

following   monetary injections can be persistent and nearly as large as movements in nominal

exchange rates.

1. Introduction

Few puzzles in international           economics     are as perplexing
as the behavior of exchange rates. Since the breakdown of
the Bretton Woods system of managed exchange rates in
the early 1970’s, there have been large and persistent move-
ments in the nominal exchange rates between the currencies
of the United States, Japan, and the countries of Western
Europe.    These movements        in nominal exchange rates have
been much larger than the inflation, money growth, or in-
terest rate differentials     across these countries.        Moreover,
at all but very low frequencies,         these movements          in nom-
inal exchange      rates are associated with movements             in real
exchange rates of roughly the same size and persistence.
    In this paper, we consider whether a model of the im-
pact of monetary injections on asset prices first proposed by
Grossman    and Weiss (1983)        and Rotemberg         (1984,    1985)
can reproduce      these salient features of exchange             rate be-
havior.    These    authors   develop     a model     in which agents
visit the asset market infrequently          to obtain     currency     to
finance extend shopping trips in the goods market. This as-
sumption    is in the spirit of the inventory-theoretic            models
of money demand in Baumol              (1952) and Tobin (1956) and
their general equilibrium      counterparts        in Jovanovic    (1982)
and Romer     (1986),   Agents’    visits to the asset market are
staggered, so, at any point in time, only a fraction of agents
are in the asset market.       When interest rates are positive,
agents choose not to trade currency for other assets between
visits to the asset market since they cannot begin to spend
the currency until they return to the asset market to fetch
it, Thus, in this model, when the government trades bonds
and currency in an open market operation at a point in time,
it does so with only the fraction of agents currently visiting



                                   2
the asset market. As a restit, monetary injections have a
disproportionate impact on these agents’ currency holdings
and consumption            and on nominal           and real asset prices as
well.
    The distributional              effects in the models           in Grossman-
Weiss (1983) and Rotemberg (1984, 1985) complicate the
analysis and effectively limit these studies to one-time unan-
ticipated     shocks in deterministic            settings. 1 We employ the
device introduced          by Lucas (1990) of organizing agents into
families to simplify consideration                of these distributional        ef-
fects.     With this device, we are able to characterize                    the ef-
fects of monetary injections in a stochastic environment.                        We
show that this model                can replicate salient features of ex-
change rate behavior.               In particular, if monetary injections
are highly persistent               and if the fraction        of agents in the
asset market at a point in time is small enough, then nomi-
nal exchange rates in the model are highly volatile relative
to inflation,       money growth,          and interest rate differentials,
changes in nominal and real exchange rates are highly corre-
lated and have roughly the same volatility, and both nominal
and real exchange           rates are highly persistent.              In contrast,
related models in Grilli and Roubini                    (1992)      and Shlagen-
hauf and Wrase (1995) exploring                  the effect of monetary          in-
jections     on exchange        rates in open economy               extensions    of
Lucas (1990) and Fuerst (1992) cannot generate large and
persistent movements                in exchange rates.
    In the Grossman-Weiss-Rotemberg                      model,      trading fric-
tions are described          by a free parameter governing                both the
length of time between agents’ trips to the asset market and
the fraction of agents in the asset market at a point in time.
This paper is an exploration               of the range of outcomes            that
   I B=ter    et,    ~],   (1991)     compute   equilibria   of   a closecf economY
version of the Grossman-Weiss-Rotemberg               model,



                                           3
this model can produce as this parameter is varied. This ex-
ercise is thus similar to that in Lucas (1990), who concludes:

             “There is a wealth of interesting data on flow
         of funds, turnover rates of various kinds of ac-
         counts, and so on that monetary theory ought
         to deal with but generally has not. To do so,
         we will need to get further away from complete
         markets in our theory, just as labor economists
         have had to in their attempts to account for their
         interesting turnover series. If the theory of the
         transactions demand for money is to move in this
         direction,   it is clear that we will need formula-
         tions that place a smaller burden on the idea
         of idea of a fixed period than do the models in
         this paper. I have in mind not so much explain-
         ing the crucial time lags in the monetary system
         (though that would be nice, too) but just de-
         scribing them with free parameters that can be
         more easily varied to fit data than the period
         length in the usual discrete time formulations.”

   Whether       or not the frictions required in this model     to
match exchange rate data are consistent with micro data on
trading patterns is a question we leave for future research.


2. The Behavior              of Exchange        Rates

The behavior of exchange rates since the end of the Bretton
Woods      era has been discussed extensively    in the literature.
See, for example, Meese and Rogoff (1983), Mussa (1986),
Baxter and Stoclunan (1989), and Flood and Rose (1995).
These,     and other,    articles document   several salient facts.


                                   4
First, since the early 1970’s the exchange rates for the in-
dustrial countries have been very volatile, particularly in
comparison    to the volatility of other variables such as infla-
tion, money growth rates, or interest rates. Second, changes
in nominal and real exchange rates are highly correlated and
have roughly the same volatility. Third, movements in nom-
inal and real exchange rates are highly persistent.
   In tables 1 and 2 we present some statistics illustrating
these features of the data on exchange rates for the curren-
cies of the G-7 countries versus the US dollar. Each statistic
reported in these tables is the mean of the corresponding
statistic across the G-7 computed from monthly data cover-
ing the period Jan 1973-Dec         1994. In table 1, we see that
the standard deviation of changes in monthly nominal ex-
change rates is large, particularly when compared with the
standard   deviation    of inflation,     money growth,      or interest
rate differentials    across countries.      Moreover,      we see that
changes in nominal and real exchange rates are highly cor-
related and have roughly the same standard deviation. In
table 2, we see that both nominal and real exchange rates
are highly persistent.     The auto correlations         for these series
decay smoothly and, for real exchange rates, are consistent
with a half-life of roughly three years,
   In what follows,      we examine        the extent     to which the
Grossman-Weiss        and Rotemberg        model    of the impact      of
monetary     policy on inflation,       interest rates, and exchange
rates can generate data with these features,


3. The Model

Time   is discrete,    and denoted        t =   0,1,2,   . . . . Let St G
S denote the exogenous aggregate state realized at t and
s’ = (s0,..., st) denote the history of the state at t. Let


                                    5
n (St) denote the unconditional probability of history St and
7T(s~+~;St) denote the probability of history St+k conditional
on history St.
   There are two countries.           We call the first domestic and
the second foreign. Agents in this economy are organized
in families each of which is composed of one parent and a
continuum      of children of measure 1/(1 – ~). All of the do-
mestic families have the same preferences, endowments,               and
demographic      structure,   so we will consider the equilibrium
behavior    of a representative       domestic family.      Likewise, we
consider the equilibrium behavior of a representative foreign
family.
   There     are two goods:       a domestic       good    and a foreign
good. Neither of these goods are storable. The parent of the
domestic family receives stochastic endowment {y(st)}~o    of
the domestic good and the parent of the foreign family re-
ceives endowment       {y* (St) }~o       of the foreign good,    We as-
sume that members of a family cannot consume their own
endowment.       Instead,     they sell their endowment          for cur-
rency and use currency to purchase goods from other fami-
lies. There are two currencies used to purchase goods: the
domestic currency and the foreign currency. The domestic
currency is used to purchase domestic goods and the foreign
currency is used to purchase foreign goods.               The supplies of
the domestic and foreign currencies are denoted {M(s’)}:o
and {M* (St) }~4 respectively.            The domestic government     in-
troduces new domestic currency by handing out lump sum
transfers {T(St) }~o of currency to the parent of the do-
mestic family. The foreign government              hands out transfers
{T”(St)}:o  to the parent of the foreign family.
    There are two physically separate locations in which trade
takes place:    an asset market and a goods market,               At the
beginning of each period, currencies and nominal claims are


                                      6
traded in the asset market. After asset trade, currencies and
goods are traded in the goods market. Parents and children
perform separate roles in these markets.
    Children carry currency which they use to purchase goods
on extended trips to the goods market. These shopping trips
have stochastic length. Each period, at the end of goods
trading, each child either continues with his current shop-
ping trip for at least one more period or returns home to
his parent in the asset market. The probability that a child
continues with his current shopping trip is ~, while the prob-
ability that he returns home to his parent in the asset mar-
ket is (1 – ~). If a child returns home to his parent after
goods   trading at St, all his unspent currency    is destroyed.
We denote the total unspent home and foreign currency that
is destroyed in equilibrium at St by {d(st), d“ (st)}~o.    These
assumptions about the shopping technology       imply that each
family has measure 1 children returning home to the asset
market at the end of each period.   Those children that return
home to the asset market after goods trade at St-1 receive
a gift of currency from their parent in the asset market at
St and use that gift to finance a new shopping trip starting
with goods   trade at St, We denote the quantities         of cur-
rency that parents give to their children in the asset market
at St by {a~(st), a~(st)}~o. Here the superscript * indicates
the foreign currency and the index i = d, j indicates the
amounts given to the children of the domestic        and foreign
families respectively.
   Parents sell the family endowment in the goods market.
Goods prices are denoted {p(st), p“ (st)}~o , so the domes-
tic parent earns revenue p(st)y(st)     and the foreign parent
earns revenue p“ (St)y” (St). The parents also receive lump
sum transfers   of currency   from their governments,       trade
nominal contingent   claims with each other in the asset mar-


                                7
ket, and decide what gifts of currency                                        {ai(st),     a; (st)}~o      to
make to their children that return home to the asset market.
      We interpret y(st)                  as goods sold in stores in the home
country for the home currency, while y* (St) are goods sold in
stores in the foreign country for the foreign currency. Given
this interpretation, we consider the quantities p“ (st)c~(st)
and   p(st)cf      (St)    as expenditures                   of the domestic and foreign
children respectively                  as tourists in the other country.                                 Ac-
cordingly, we identify                 p(st)         and    p* (St)      with the domestic and
foreign consumer price indices and consider the growth rate
of these price levels to be the domestic and foreign inflation
rates respectively.
      At St, home and foreign children are indexed by the cur-
rency holdings (mi,              m:)           z =    d, f    that they carry into goods
trading.         For children who are continuing                                    a shopping          trip,
these amounts               are carried over from the previous                                    period.
For those who returned to their parent in the asset mar-
ket at the end of the previous period, these amounts equal
the gifts (aa(st), aj (St)) z = d, j. Children allocate their
spending over time to maximize their utility from the cur-
rent shopping trip. Namely, at St children face current and
future goods prices                   {p(s’+k),p”(s’+                 k)}~’         and choose          con-

sumption          {Ci(st+k)lc:(s’+k)                 }:o       and currency                to carry out

of goods trading              {m~(s
                                          t+~),      m~J(st+k)}~4                  to    solve
                                                                              —

                                        Ui(st;       m,m”)        =                                     (3.1)

   2 An alternative          interpretation             is that       there       is trade   between      the
countries       in the two final goods and that                        purchases         of goods are re-
quired to be paid with the currency                            of the seller on the good.                  In
this alternative          interpretation we identi~ p(st) and p“ (St) with the
Gross Domestic            Product deflators of the domestic and foreign country
respectively,

The functions                  ui, z = d, ~, are the children’s                     period utility
functions.             The functions                 Uil z = d, f, are the children’s                 in-
direct utility functions for currency on the current shopping
trip. We denote the decision rules for a child of country z car-
rying currency (m, m“) at St by ci(st; m, m“),    ci (s’; m,m*),                      ●
m~(st;        m,    m*),       and     mj’(st;       m,    m*).

      Parents trade a complete                                 set of nominal       claims in the
asset market. We write the parents’ budget constraint as
a date O budget constraint. Let {Q(st)}~=o denote the date
and state contingent prices of a unit of the domestic currency
delivered at St in terms of units of the domestic                                             currency
at date O. Let {e(st)}~o                              denote         the date and state con-
tingent spot exchange                            rates indicating            the number of units
of the domestic                  currency           at St required to purchase a unit
of the foreign currency                           at s‘. Facing these prices for nom-
inal claims, domestic parents choose quantities of currency

return home to the asset market and amounts of currency

4. Characterizing                          Equilibrium

In presenting           the Grossman-Weiss                 and Rotemberg              model
here, we have employed the device suggested by Lucas (1990)
of organizing agents into families to simplify the consider-
ation of wealth effects.                  With this device, we can compute
equilibria analytically                 for the specific case in which children
have log utility and nominal interest rates are always pos-
itive.     For this case, we characterize                    the equilibrium            price
levels, asset prices, and exchange rates in four propositions.
In the first proposition,                  we show that if nominal                   interest
rates are always positive, then bonds dominate                               currency in
the asset market and parents do not hold currency                                     in the
asset market from one period                         to the next.        In the second
proposition,          we solve for the children’s                   decision rules and
indirect utility.          In the third proposition                  we solve for the
distribution         of currency and consumption                    across children as
a function           of monetary          policy.     In the fourth proposition,
we show how the distribution                      of currency and consumption
across children determines equilibrium                         asset prices, and ex-
change rates.


                                                12
   Consider nominal interest rates in this model.                         The price
at St of a one period bond that pays off one unit of the home
currency for certain at t + 1 is given by

                         1                    Q(s’, st+l)
                     1 + i(st)      x
                                 = ,,+1         Q(st)        ‘

and that of a one period bond that pays off one unit of the
foreign currency for certain at t + 1 is given by

                 1                    Q(s’,    st+l)e(s’,     s,+,)
            1 + i“(st)           E
                             = ~t+,           Q(s’)e(s’)              “

We refer to log(l +i(st)) and log(l +Z”(St)) as the home and
foreign nominal short-term interest rates respectively.
    Assumption     1: Z(st), z*(s’) >0 for all s’.
   Proposition        1: In equilibria in which nominal interest
rates are always positive, then parents’ currency holdings in
the asset market are given by

                       {~i(s’))~;(st)}:o
                                   =o
   Proof      Given assumption 1, bonds dominate cash in the
sense that it is cheaper for the parents to obtain currency
in the asset market at St+l by purchasing                    bonds at St than
it is for them to hold the currency in the asset market from
St to St+1. The cost to the parent of holding                     a unit of do-
mestic currency in the asset market at St is Q(st), while the
benefit is ~,,+1 Q(st, st+l). Assumption                    1 implies that the
cost exceeds the benefit for all s’. Likewise for the foreign
currency. W
   This proposition      implies that when interest rates are pos-
itive, asset prices adjust to induce the parents to give all the
new currency injected into the economy                      at st to those chil-
dren who happen to be home with their parent in the asset


                                       13
market at that time. Since these children cannot trade with
the other children in the goods market, these currency                               in-
jections    have a disproportionate                    impact on their currency
holdings and consumption.
    Assumption           2: Let the domestic children have period
utility function      u~(c, c*) = Olog(c) + (1 – O)log(c*)                      and let
the foreign children have period utility function Uf(c, c* ) =
(1 – d) log(c) + Olog(c”).            Choices for the value of the param-
eter O > 1/2 reflect the preference of children for their own
country’s    good.
    Proposition         2:
                      With preferences as given in assump-
tion 2, a child entering goods trade at St with currency
(m, m“) spends

                    Ci(st; m, m*) = (1 –               ~~)m/p(st)



                   c~(st; m,m”)         = (1 –     ~~)m*/p*(st)


and carries currency

out of goods        trade,     The indirect utility functions                  for cur-
rency for the domestic and foreign children are given by


~d(st;m)m”)= ~ _1b7 (0 log(m) + (1 - O) log(m*))+A,(s’),


Uf (St; m, m*) = ~ _1P7 ((I -0)                   log(m)+           t910g(m*))+Af(st),

where Ai(st)       is given by


Ad(s’)     = ~     (~~)k ~          7r(st+’; S’)[log(l          - p~) + k log(~~)-
             k=O             ~t+k



                                            14
            f3log(p(s’+’))         - (1 -e)         log(p”(s’+k))],

Af(st)   = ~     (p’y)k ~        7r(st+k; S’)[log(l       - P7) + ~ log(PT)-


            (1 - e)log(p(st+k))              - elog(p’(s’+k))].

   Proofi      It is straightforward              to verify that these decision
roles satisfy the sufficient first-order and transversality con-
ditions associated with the (convex) children’s utility max-
imization   problem       and that Ui is the discounted                expected
utility obtained. ■
    We use this proposition              to trace the flow of cash through
the economy     as follows.       By definition, M(st)            is the stock of
the domestic currency at the beginning of goods trade at st.
In equilibria with positive interest rates, the parents will not
hold currency in the asset market, so M(st) is held entirely
by children in the goods market. Proposition 2 implies that
each child spends the constant fraction (1 — ~~) of his cur-
rency holdings,     so total spending of the domestic                  currency
is (1 —~v)A4(s’).        This quantity of currency spent equals the
domestic parent’s receipts           p(st)y(st)       from selling the domes-
tic endowment       in the goods market, so in equilibrium

                    p(st)y(st)       = (1 – B’y)M(s’).

Likewise, for the foreign currency, we have

                  pay”               =    (1 – ~~)A4*(s’).

As a result, we obtain            solutions for the equilibrium             price
levels
                                            M(st)
                         p(s’)   = (1 – p~)m.                               (4.1)

                                            M*(st)
                     p“(s’)      = (1 – p~) ~*(st) .                        (4.2)


                                          15
Thus, in our model,          as long as interest rates are positive,
the velocity     of currency      per period      is constant       and given
by (1 – ~v). In the case that v = O, so shopping                    trips last
one period,     per-period      velocity    is one as it is in the stan-
dard cash-in-advance          model.    The larger is ~, the longer are
shopping   trips, and the lower is per-period              velocity.    As in
a standard quantity-theory             model, inflation is given by the
growth rate of the money supply divided by the growth rate
of the endowment.
    Now consider the flow of currency through asset markets.
From proposition          2, we have that children at St-1 spend cur-
rency (1 — ~~)~(st–l)           and (1 – ~V)M*(St–l)          in the goods
market and retain currency ~~M(st-l)                  and ~~M* (St-l)       at
the end of goods trading,         Only fraction ~ of the children re-
main in the goods market. The other (1 —~) of the children
return to their parents in the asset market. Thus, at St, chil-
dren remaining in the goods market have carried over cur-
rency ~V2 M (St– 1, and ~~2 M* (St– 1) from the previous                  pe-
riod and parents, in total, have currency M(st) –~T2M(St- 1)
and M* (St) — ~T2M* (st–l) in the asset market. Since par-
ents do not hold cash in the asset market when interest rates
are posit ive, we have

                 ~a,(s’)       = M(s’)      - ~~2M(st-1)
                  i

                ~a;(s’)      = M*(st)       - ~~2M*(s’-1).
                 i
To calculate how currency is divided between domestic and
foreign children in the asset market, consider the first-order
conditions of the parents’ problem.            For the domestic parent,
these include

                                    8U~(st; a~(st), aj(s’))
           Q(s’)     = ~~’T(St)
                                                 ~a             ‘

                                       16
where A is the Lagrange multiplier on the parent’s date O
budget constraint.            From proposition        2, we can calculate the
marginal utility of currency and obtain


                                                                            (4.3)


Similarly, from the foreign parent’s problem, we obtain first
order condition


                                                                            (4.4)


where A’ is the Lagrange multiplier on the foreign parent’s
budget constraint.            Equations    (4.3) and (4.4) imply

                          a~(st) = f9z(st)M(st),                            (4.5)

and p(st)   = M(st)/M(s’–l)               is the growth rate of the do-
mestic currency supply and p“ (St) is the growth rate of the
foreign currency supply.
   The expressions             (4.5)   and (4.6) make clear how mon-
etary injections       result in a redistribution             of currency    and


                                          17
consumption       in this model.    In partictiar,     the terms Z(st)
and z* (St) in these expressions are proportional         to the shares
of the total domestic and foreign currency supplies given to
domestic children in the asset market at St. Since every child
spends a constant fraction of his currency holdings each pe-
riod, these terms Z(st) and Z“(st) are also proportional          to the
shares of the domestic and foreign endowments              y(st), y“(st)
consumed      by those children at St. We can compute           the im-
pact of monetary       injections   on the currency       holdings   and
consumption       of children in the asset market through            the
terms z(s’)    and Z“(st).
    Consider first the case in which the parameter v = O. In
this case, shopping trips last only one period, and all chil-
dren return to the asset market every period.               Here, Z(st)
and z* (St) are constant.    Currency and consumption           are dis-
tributed across children every period in proportion to the
wealth of their parents at date O, and all children within
a family have identical currency holdings and consumption.
In this sense, our model nests the standard const ant-velocity
cash in advance model when ~ = O.
    Consider now the case in which y >0.               Here, monetary
injections    at St have an amplified impact on the currency
holdings of those children in the asset market at St and thus
an amplified impact on their consumption             at St. This impact
is captured      in the terms Z(.st) and z* (St). The magnitude
of the impact of changes in the money growth rate on the
distribution of currency holdings and consumption across
children changes with the parameter ~ in the natural way.
In particular,    the elasticity of Z(st) with respect to p(st) is
given by
                         82p    p’yz
                         —— =
                         ap z ~–pT2”

Thus, the larger is ~, the larger is this elasticity.        Given the


                                    18
demographics      of the model, the fraction        of children in the
asset market at any point in time is (1 —~). When ~ is larger,
shopping      trips are longer,    fewer children    are in the asset
market, and monetary injections must be absorbed by this
smaller number of children. As a result, monetary injections
of a given size have a larger impact on the currency holdings
and consumption       of those children,
    Note that, holding      fied    ~, the elasticity of z with re-
spect to p is declining in p. Thus, at higher average money
growth and inflation rates, the share of currency            and con-
sumption going to children in the asset market becomes less
sensitive to a one percentage       point change in money growth
and inflation rates because        these children are, on average,
receiving     a larger share of the total money stock.          As we
shall see below, this result also implies that asset prices and
exchange rates are also less sensitive to changes in money
growth and inflation rates when average inflation is high.
    Observe that the only stochastic        elements in the terms
Z(st) and z* (St) are the current money growth rates p(st)
and p“(st).   This implies that monetary policy will have
a persistent effect on the distribution of currency holdings
and consumption       across children if money growth rates are
persistent and a transitory effect if money growth rates are
transitory,    The parameter ~ determining the len@h of shop-
ping trips has no bearing on the question of whether or not
monetary policy will have a persistent effect on the distribu-
tion of currency holdings and consumption             across children.
Instead, as we saw above, the parameter ~ only determines
the magnitude       of the impact of the current monetary           in-
jection on the shares of currency and consumption             going to
children currently in the asset market.
    Now consider the impact of monetary policy on nominal




                                   19
asset prices. From (4.3) and (4.5) we have

                                     Ap’7r(s’)
                      Q(st) =
                                    zag            “
Likewise, for the foreign currency we have


                  Q(s’)e(s’)    =         ‘Btn(s’)
                                                “
                                     %“(s~)M*(s~)

As these formulas indicate, the price of a unit of currency at
St is inversely proportional     to the amount of that currency
in the hands of children in the asset market at St. In the
case that ~ = O, monetary       injections have no impact on the
distribution   of currency     across children,        so the price of a
unit of currency at s’ falls one percent for each one percent
increase in the aggregate supply of that currency at st. On
the other hand, when ~ >0, then monetary injections at st
have a disproportionately      large impact on the share of that
currency held by children in the asset market at s’, As a re-
sult, these injections have a disproportionately              large impact
on the price of that currency            at St. As we have discussed
above, this impact is larger the larger is ~.
   We can also calculate         the impact        of monetary         policy
on real asset prices.     Observe         that Q(s’)p(st)      is the price
at date O of a claim to enough               domestic       currency    at St
to purchase one unit of the domestic good at s’. Likewise,
Q(s’)e(s’)p”(st) is the price at date O of a claim to one unit
of the foreign good at St. Using (4.1) and (4.2), these prices
are given by




                                    20
As these formulas indicate,              real asset prices drop one per-
cent for every one-percent              increase in the shares z and Z*
of the aggregate         endowment         consumed              by children in the
asset market. Since monetary injections increase this share,
monetary injections depress real asset prices and their effect
is larger, the larger is ~.
   We have characterized              the impact of monetary injections
on date O real and nominal                asset prices. These contingent
asset prices can be used to price any nominal                              or real se-
curity. In the next proposition, we use these asset prices
to construct real and nominal interest rates and exchange
rates.

terest rates are always positive, nominal interest rates and
exchange rates are given by

   Proposition       4 implies that monetary        policy has two ef-
fects on exchange rates in this model.            First, in this model,
as in a quantity-theory       model, an increase in the domestic
money stock M (St) results in an increase in the domestic
price level and a deprecation of the domestic currency rela-
tive to the foreign currency. Second, in this model, unlike a
quantity-theory   model, an increase in the domestic money
stock also affects the real exchange rate. Since the children
in the asset market receive a disproportionate            share of the
increase in the domestic money stock, their consumption               of
the domestic good rises relative to their consumption             of the
foreign good and the price of the domestic good relative to
the foreign good falls. As we saw above, this effect is larger,
the larger is ~,
   The persistence       of the effect of monetary       policy on ex-
change rates depends only on the persistence              of the differ-
ence in money        growth   rates across countries.
                                                  Since, the
real exchange rate is determined by the relative amounts of
the domestic       and foreign goods consumed         by children cur-
rently in the asset market, the current real exchange               rate
depends    only on current endowments             and current money
growth    rates.   Thus, transitory movements in the money
growth    differential across countries will induce transitory
movements     in the real exchange rate while persistent move-
ments in the money growth differential across countries will
induce persistent movements in the real exchange rate. Changes
in the real and nominal        exchange     rate will be correlated,
since both depend on the differential of the money growth
rates across countries.


                                  22
   Monetary policy has two effects on interest rates in this
model as well. First, in this model, as in a quantity-theory
model, events at date t which signal higher money growth
between dates t and t + 1 raise expectations                of inflation and
nominal interest rates. Second, in this model, unlike a quan-
tity theory model, differences in money growth rates at dates
t and t+ 1 also affect the real interest rate. Again, since chil-
dren in the asset market receive a disproportionate                share of
monetary    injections,    changes in money growth rates from t
to ~+1 redistribute consumption           between those children who
are in the asset market at t and those in the asset market at
t + 1. Since parents prefer to distribute consumption                evenly
across their children, these changes in money growth rates
induce changes in the equilibrium            prices at which parents
can transfer consumption from children in the asset market
at t and those in the asset market at t + 1.
    Consider, for example, a case in which endowments                  y(s’)
are constant and money growth rates satisfy



with O < p < 1 for all St+1. Here, the parameter p governs
the persistence of money growth from St to St+l. In this case,
we can compute       the real interest rate as


log(l +T(s’))    = log(l – _ ’72      ) -log(l             - ~)    - log(~)
                           pl-Pp(st)P

and the nominal interest rate as

log(l + 2(s’)) = log(l +T(s’))       + (1 – p) log(p) +plog(p(s’)).

The elasticity of the real interest rate with respect to the
money growth rate p(st) evaluated at p(st) = P is given by

                dlog(l    + r(st))   = (p_   ~,      Q’y’
                  dlog(p(s’))                     p–p72’



                                     23
while the elasticity of the nominal interest rate with respect
to the money growth rate p(st)               evaluated   at p(st)   = ~ is
given by

              dlog(l   + i(s’))
                                   = (P-1)     P!$72      +P.
                dlog(p(s’))

When ~ > 0 and p < 1, an increase in the money growth
rate at St decreases the real interest rate. Clearly the mag-
nitude of this effect depends on the parameter v because
it depends     again on the elasticity of the share z of output
consumed      by children in the asset market with respect to
money growth p. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect also
depends on the persistence of money growth.                If increases in
money growth p(st) are very persistent, so p is very close
to one, then these increases in the money growth rate have
only a small negative effect on the real interest rate because
these increases in money growth have only a small effect on
the relative shares of output consumed             by those children in
the asset market at t and those children in the asset market
at t + 1. On the other hand, if increases in money growth
p(st)    are transitory,      so p is small, then they have a large
negative impact on real interest rates because they result in
a large increase the consumption          of those children in the as-
set market at t relative to those children in the asset market
att+l.
    Combining      these implications         of proposition    4, we see
that if we choose domestic and foreign money growth rates
that are persistent        and not highly correlated        across coun-
tries, then the model will produce nominal and real exchange
rates that are persistent and volatile relative to inflation and
money growth differentials and interest rates that are close
to their Fisherian fundamentals.              In the next section,     we
present a numerical example to illustrate these results,


                                     24
    Compare       the implications        of our model for the impact
of monetary      policy on inflation,       asset prices, and exchange
rates to those of the models          in Lucas (1990),      and Fuerst
(1992), and their open economy variants in Grilli and Roubini
(1992) and Schlagenhauf and Wrase (1995). Schlagenhauf
and Wrase (1995) demonstrate quantitatively that their open
economy variant of the Fuerst (1992) model cannot match
the volatility and persistence of real exchange rates. More-
over, Grilli and Roubini      (1992) show analytically         that the
impact   of a monetary      injection       on the real exchange     rate
and the short-term       interest is the same. Thus, monetary
shocks in this alternative      model cannot produce exchange
rates that are substantially     more volatile than interest rate
differentials.


5. A Numerical             Example

In this section, we solve a numerical example to show that
monetary     shocks in our model            can generate   nominal    ex-
change rates that are persistent and substantially more volatile
than inflation,     money growth,         and interest rates, together
with real exchange rates that are also persistent, are highly
correlated with nominal exchange rates, and have nearly the
same volatility as nominal exchange rates.
    Consider an economy        in which endowments          {yt, y; } are
constant and equal, initial wealth is distributed between do-
mestic and foreign parents so that the Lagrange multipliers
on the parents’ date O budget constraints, A and A“, are
equal, and government       sets lump sum transfers of currency
to parents of families so that quantities




                                     25
follow autoregressive       processes given by

   log(zt+l)=        (l–p)log(~)         +plog(zt) +log(~t+l))                       (5.2)


   log(z;+l)      =(l-P)lo~(~)+Plo~(z;)                           +log(~;+l)7        (53)

where (log Et,log ~~) are independent                    across time and normal
with mean O, variance o:, and contemporaneous                              correlation
p,,. Note that, given the first-order approximation,


        log(p,)    – log (p) = (A)                     (log(z,)     – log (z)),


our specification       for monetary             policy        is similar to one in
which the logarithm of money growth (and inflation) follows
a first-order autoregressive       process with long-run variance




We choose the specification              (5.1) for monetary                 policy    be-
cause we can characterize         short term nominal interest rates
analytically      in this case.    Specifically,               one-period        nominal
interest rates are given by

                                                         l–p

                                                                                I . (5.5)



and the growth rates of the money stocks pt and p; are
given by

     log(7r~) = log(p,)      = log(~)            + 2 log(~) – log(l         – z,)


                                     26
    log(7r;) = log(p;)      = log(~)+     2 log(y) – log(l     – z;).

The logarithm    of the real exchange rate is given by

                     log (z~) = log(z~) – log(z;),                      (5.6)

and that of the nominal exchange rate by

           log(e,)    = log(z,)     + log(M,)   – log(A4~).             (5.7)

   The parameters we choose for this example are

                  7         P~P~cPcE
                .989      .997 .03 .98          .03     .50

We simulated the model for 10,000 observations                to generate
moments in Tables 3 and 4 analogous to those reported from
data in tables 1 and 2. The six parameters in this example
are chosen so that our model in large samples reproduces
six moments     similar to those observed             in the data for the
G-7. These moments are the standard deviation of changes
in monthly real exchange rates (37Y0 at an annual frequency
as reported in table 1), the half-life of real exchange rates
(here set at 36 months),          the mean of inflation       (6.5% at an
annual frequency),       the mean of interest rates (9.570 at an
annual frequency),      the standard deviation of monthly infla-
tion (6% at an annual frequency as reported in table 1), and
the standard deviation       of inflation differentials       (also 6% at
an annual frequency       as reported in table 1).
    The mapping between these six parameters and these six
moments can be approximated as follows. From 5.6, we see
the variance of the first difference of the log of real exchange
rates is given by 4(1 — p6c)a~/(1 + p) and the persistence of
real exchange rates is determined          by the parameter       p, The
mean of the log of inflation          is given by the mean of the


                                     27
term log(~) + 210g(~) – log(l – z) and the mean of the
log of nominal interest rates for p close to one is approxi-
mately the mean of 2 log(~) — Iog(l — z). To a first order
approximation,    the variance of the log of inflation is given
by [2/(1 – Z)]2 a~/(1 – p2) and the variance of inflation dif-
ferentials by 2(1 – p,,) [2/(1 – Z)]2 a~/(1 – p2).
    In this numerical example, we have chosen a high value
for the persistence    p   of monetary policy. We chose this value
so that the model would generate persistent real exchange
rates. As a consequence of this choice, nominal interest rates
in this model are close to their Fisherian fundamentals.               In
fact the correlation       between interest rates and inflation in
this example as reported in table 3 is close to one and nomi-
nal interest rates are less volatile than inflation. If a smaller
value of p is chosen, real exchange rates are less persistent,
nominal interest rates become negatively correlated with in-
flation and substantially      more volatile.
    In this numerical        example    we have also chosen        a low
value for the fraction (1 — y) of children in the asset mar-
ket. The choice of the parameter ~ close to one is neces-
sary to match the relative variances of real exchange               rates
and inflation.   In this example,           the ratio of the variance
of the log of inflation       to the variance        of the first differ-
ence of the log of real exchange            rates is given by the term
(2/(1 - 2))2(1 + p)/(1 - p2). In data as reported in table
1, this ratio is 0.027. Thus, to match the relative variance
of inflation differentials and innovations to real exchange
rates given a the high value of         p   we   have chosen to match
the persistence of real exchange rates, we must choose z on
the order of 0.03.         The parameter         z is the average share
of currency and consumption            going to children in the asset
market. It is only when this average share is small that
small changes in money growth rates have large effects on


                                   28
the portfolios of children in the asset market. Given average
inflation rates observed in the data, this share is small only
if the fraction of children in the asset market is small.


6. Conclusion

In this paper, we have characterized the impact of monetary
policy on inflation, asset prices, and exchange rates in the
Grossman-Weiss-Rotemberg    model.   We have shown that
this model can reproduce some salient features of exchange
rate behavior if its parameters are chosen so that only a very
small fraction   of agents participate    in open market opera-
tions at any point in time and if domestic and foreign money
growth rates are persistent and not highly correlated across
countries.   In particular, given these assumptions,   the model
generates    nominal   exchange    rates that are highly volatile
relative to inflation, money growth, or interest rate differ-
entials, movements in real exchange rates that are highly
correlated with movements in nominal exchange rates and
also very volatile,    and movements     in nominal and real ex-
change rates that are highly persistent.
