                                           ABSTRACT

Electronic cigarettes show potential to reduce the harms from smoking combustible tobacco, but
there is uncertainty about the long-term health consequences. We replicate and extend the study
by Bhatta and Glantz (20192), which reports longitudinal statistical associations between e-
cigarette use and long-term respiratory disease. We are able to closely replicate their results.
When we use a more flexible empirical specification, among respondents who had never smoked
combustible tobacco, we find no evidence that current or former e-cigarette use is associated with
respiratory disease. The statistical associations between e-cigarette use and respiratory disease
are driven by e-cigarette users who are also current or former smokers of combustible tobacco. A
striking feature of the data is that almost all e-cigarette users were either current or former
smokers of combustible tobacco. We then discuss the potential for future applied econometric
research to credibly identify the causal effects of e-cigarette use on health. Challenges include the
potential selection biases that stem from the complex set of consumer choices to initiate and quit
smoking combustible tobacco, use of e-cigarettes, and dual use of both products. We suggest
using a variety of identification strategies to uncover the causal effects that use a variety of
econometric methods.

1. Introduction
After they came onto the U.S. market around 2007, the use of electronic cigarettes has steadily
increased. In data from the 2018 U.S. National Health Interview, 3.2 percent of adults were
current users of e-cigarettes (Villarroel, Cha, and Vahratian 2020). Current e-cigarette use was
highest among former combustible cigarette smokers who had quit within the past year, at just
over 25 percent, and among former smokers who had quit within the past one to four years, at 17
percent. Continuing a decades-long trend, the fraction of U.S. adults who smoke combustible
cigarettes declined from 20 percent in 2007 to 14 percent in 2018 (Thorne, Malarcher, Maurice
and Caraballo 2008, Creamer, Wang, Babb, et al. 2019).
To the extent the growth in e-cigarette use contributed to the decline in adult smoking, e-
cigarettes might be a promising harm-reduction strategy. The consensus report by the National
Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) concluded that: "There is
conclusive evidence that completely substituting e-cigarettes for combustible tobacco cigarettes
reduces users' exposure to numerous toxicants and carcinogens present in combustible tobacco
cigarettes." (NASEM 2018).1 However, the policy statements on e-cigarettes of the American
College of Physicians (Crowley, 2015), American Heart Association (Bhatnagar et al., 2014),
and American Lung Association (2015) emphasize uncertainty about the long-term health
consequences of e-cigarette use.
In this paper we replicate and extend the analysis of a recent study by Bhatta and Glantz (2019,
hereafter B & G) of the association between e-cigarette use and long-term respiratory disease. B
& G analyzed observational data from the first three waves of the Population Assessment of
Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. Based on statistically significant longitudinal associations
between former and current e-cigarette use and respiratory disease, B & G conclude that: "Use of
e-cigarettes is an independent risk factor for respiratory disease in addition to combustible
tobacco smoking." Major news media reported the results, including NBC (2019), Reuters
(2019), and National Public Radio (NPR, 2019). For example, NPR reported that the study
"found that people who used only e-cigarettes had about a 30% increased risk of developing lung
disease, compared with people who didn't use any nicotine products." (NPR 2019, emphasis in
the original). The accompanying press release (Alvarez 2019) and news media reports
interpreted the estimated associations as showing that e-cigarettes are "harmful on their own"
(Glantz, quoted in Alvarez 2019).
Shortly before the publication of the B & G study, in the late summer and fall of 2019 the U.S.
experienced an outbreak of acute lung injury that the CDC termed e-cigarette, or vaping,
associated lung injury (EVALI). As of the final CDC reporting date February 18, 2020, there
were a total of 2,807 hospitalized EVALI cases or deaths reported nationwide, including 68
deaths (CDC 2020). The CDC eventually linked the EVALI outbreak to illegally manufactured

  Conclusion 18-1, italics in original to indicate that the evidence meets the standard for conclusive defined as:
"There are many supportive findings from good-quality controlled studies (including randomized and non-
randomized controlled trials) with no credible opposing findings. A firm conclusion can be made, and the
limitations to the evidence, including chance, bias, and confounding factors, can be ruled out with reasonable
confidence." Conclusive is the highest evidence standard defined in the NASEM report.

e-cigarettes that contain THC (the psychoactive component of marijuana) and vitamin E acetate;
EVALI was not found to be linked to commercially available e-cigarettes that contain nicotine. 2
B & G and our replication examine the association between nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and
long-term respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We do
not study EVALI.
When we replicate the empirical analysis of B & G, we estimate statistical associations that are
very similar to their published results. We extend the analysis by adopting a more flexible
empirical specification. Our regression specification uses a set of eight indicator variables (and a
reference category) based on the exhaustive set of nine possible combinations (3 by 3 design
with never, current, or former smoker of cigarettes being interacted with never, current, or
former user of e-cigarettes). Among respondents who had never smoked combustible tobacco,
we find no evidence that current or former e-cigarette use is associated with respiratory disease.
The statistical associations that B & G find between e-cigarette use and respiratory disease are
driven by e-cigarette users who are also current or former smokers of combustible tobacco.
Compared to only smoking combustible tobacco, dual use of e-cigarettes and combustible
tobacco is associated with a about the same risk of respiratory disease.
A striking feature of the PATH data analyzed by B & G is that almost all e-cigarette users were
either current or former smokers of combustible tobacco. In the longitudinal analysis sample
with 17,601 observations, there were only 12 current e-cigarette users who had never smoked
combustible tobacco. None of the 12 respondents had incident (new) respiratory disease. The
number of respondents who only used e-cigarettes is simply not large enough to draw
meaningful conclusions about the independent association between e-cigarette use and
respiratory disease. More recent data sets will face similar limitations, although to a lesser extent.
For example, in the 2018 National Health Interview Survey data the prevalence of current e-
cigarette use among people who had never smoked cigarettes was 1.1 percent (Villarroel, Cha,
and Vahratian 2020).
In section 2 we present our replication of the main results of B & G. In section 3 we present the
results of our more flexible specification. Section 4 uses the framework of applied econometrics
to discuss future directions to address the empirically challenging problem of identifying the
causal effects of e-cigarette use on health outcomes. Section 5 provides a brief conclusion.
2. Replication of the Main Results of Bhatta and Glantz
In our replication exercise we try to use the same data, variable definitions, and empirical
methods used by B & G. The data are from waves 1 -3 of the PATH Study and span the years
2013-2016. B & G conduct two sets of analyses; the first set examines cross-sectional
associations at wave 1, and the second set examines longitudinal associations between wave 1
and waves 2 or 3. B & G emphasize the longitudinal analysis; as discussed in section 4 below, in
public health research longitudinal associations are often seen as more compelling evidence
about causality.

B & G report a wave 1 sample size of 32,320 respondents (their Table 3), but in the text note that
5.3 percent of the sample was dropped due to missing data. This leaves an apparent sample size
of 30,607 observations for the cross-sectional analysis. We find that the full sample for the wave
1 adult file in PATH is 32,320 respondents, but when we drop observations with missing data
our sample size for the cross-sectional analysis is 28,717.
In the cross-sectional analysis, the dependent variable that measures respiratory disease takes a
value of one for respondents who self-report at wave 1 that they had ever been told that they had
COPD, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or asthma. B & G report that by this measure the
prevalence of lung disease in wave 1 was 15.1 percent; in the Cornell sample the prevalence is
also 15.1 percent.
In terms of independent variables, B & G define four indicator variables to describe wave 1
tobacco product use ­ former e-cigarette use, current e-cigarette use, former smoker of
combustible tobacco, and current smoker of combustible tobacco. The reference category
consists of respondents who never used either e-cigarettes or combustible tobacco. Combustible
tobacco includes cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, pipe tobacco, and hookahs. Additional control
variables include wave 1 demographics and self-reported health conditions. Demographics
measure age, BMI, sex, race/ethnicity, and poverty level. The health condition variables indicate
if the respondent self-reports being told that they had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or
diabetes. As can be seen in Table 1, the means of the independent variables reported by B & G
are very close to the means in the Cornell sample.
The second set of analyses examine longitudinal associations between incident (new) respiratory
disease at wave 2 or wave 3 and e-cigarette use and smoking combustible tobacco at wave 1. The
sample for this analysis excludes respondents who reported respiratory disease at wave 1. After
dropping these respondents and accounting for attrition between waves, the sample size is 19,475
as reported by B & G (their Table 3); after also dropping observations with missing information
our sample size for the longitudinal analysis is 17,601. The rate of incident (new) respiratory
disease between wave 1 and wave 2 or 3 is 4.5 percent in the Cornell analysis sample; in B & G
Appendix Table 2 the weighted sample mean for this variable is also 4.5 percent.
Following B & G, we estimate logistic regressions and report adjusted odd ratios (AORs). We
also present the results from linear models of the probability of respiratory illness as a function
of e-cigarette use, combustible smoking, and the other independent variables. The AORs from
the logistic regressions can be difficult to interpret because they are ratios of ratios. The
coefficients from the linear models are directly interpretable as showing the difference in the
probability of respiratory illness associated with a unit change in the independent variable. The
linear probability model is widely used in applied econometrics (Angrist and Pischke 2009).
Although the linearity assumption cannot be valid throughout the range of the dependent
variable, in most cases linearity is a reasonable approximation and yields estimated marginal
effects that very similar to the marginal effects implied by non-linear models such as probit and
logit. We followed B & G and use the PATH sample weights. We used Stata to estimate all
models; B & G used R.


                                                 3
Table 2 presents our replication of the main results of the B & G study. Our models control for
the other independent variables included in the B & G models. Our results very closely replicate
the estimated AORs and associated 95 percent confidence intervals. In the cross-sectional
analysis, the linear probability model results show that the estimated AORs around 1.3 for
former and current e-cigarette use correspond to a four-percentage point increase in the
probability of respiratory disease. In the longitudinal analysis, the linear probability model
results show that the estimated AORs around 1.3 correspond to a one-percentage point increase
in the probability of incident respiratory disease.
3. Extension to a More Flexible Empirical Specification
In this section we report results from models that extend the B & G analysis by adopting a more
flexible empirical specification. The B & G specification uses four estimated parameters (and a
reference category) to model the relationships between respiratory disease and e-cigarette use
and smoking combustible tobacco. Our more flexible specification uses eight estimated
parameters (and the same reference category ­ never used e-cigarettes or smoked combustible
tobacco). We create eight indicator variables for each of the following categories: former e-
cigarette user/never combustible smoker, current e-cigarette user/never combustible smoker,
former combustible smoker/ never e-cigarette user, current combustible smoker/ never e-
cigarette user/, former e-cigarette user/former combustible smoker, former e-cigarette
user/current combustible smoker, current e-cigarette user/former combustible smoker, and
current e-cigarette user/current combustible smoker.
The added flexibility allows our specification to isolate the relationship between respiratory
disease and e-cigarette use among those respondents who only use e-cigarettes. Our
specification includes all possible interaction terms between the tobacco use indicator variables
in the B & G specification. For example, our specification allows the relationship between
respiratory disease and current e-cigarette use to be different between respondents who were
never, former, and current smokers of combustible products.
The results of the more flexible specification are reported in Table 3. We find no statistically or
practically significant positive associations between respiratory disease and e-cigarette use. In
the cross-sectional sample the estimated AORs are close to one for the former e-cigarette
user/never combustible smoker category and the current e-cigarette user/never combustible
smoker category. In the longitudinal sample, those who were former e-cigarette users and who
had never smoked combustibles had reduced odds of respiratory disease, i.e. the AOR is less
than one, but the AOR is not statistically significantly different from one. The statistical software
(Stata) dropped observations of the current e-cigarette users/never combustible smokers from the
model because the indicator for this category perfectly predicts the outcome ­ all 12 respondents
in this category did not have incident respiratory diseases. In three of the four linear probability
models reported in Table 3, the estimated coefficients are small and not statistically significant
different from zero. In the remaining linear model, current e-cigarette users who never smoked
combustible tobacco have a statistically significant lower probability of respiratory disease. We
do not see this as an informative negative association because the negative coefficient reflects the
outcomes of 12 respondents.

                                                  4
Table 3 highlights a striking feature of the PATH data ­ there are very few respondents who
never smoked combustible tobacco and who are former or current users of e-cigarettes. In the
cross-sectional sample of 28,717 observations, of those who never smoked combustible tobacco
there are only 87 former e-cigarette users and 19 current e-cigarette users. In the longitudinal
sample, there are only 51 such former e-cigarettes users and 12 such current e-cigarette users.
The small numbers of respondents who only use or used e-cigarettes result in large confidence
intervals around the estimated AORs. The small numbers in the PATH data reflect wave 1 e-
cigarette use patterns, i.e. current and past use measured in 2013. Given the upward trend in e-
cigarette use over time, more recent data sets will include higher proportions of respondents who
never smoked combustible products and who are former or current e-cigarette users. In the most
recent data on adolescents, e-cigarette use is more common than smoking cigarettes (Wang et al.
2019). Future data might eventually provide sufficient statistical power to estimate health
outcomes associated with the use of e-cigarettes only. However, the numbers of such
respondents in the PATH data are simply not large enough to draw meaningful conclusions about
the independent association between respiratory disease and e-cigarette use.
In addition to the independent association between respiratory disease and e-cigarette use, B & G
also analyze the dual use of e-cigarettes and combustible tobacco products. They interpret their
results as showing increased risk from dual use; in the press release Glantz is quoted as stating
that dual users "are actually worse off than tobacco smokers" (Alvarez 2019). In the longitudinal
sample, the estimated AORs from our specification provide some support for this claim. For
current combustible smokers who never used e-cigarettes, the estimated AOR is 2.84, compared
to 3.07 for current smokers who were former e-cigarette users and 3.23 for current smokers who
were current e-cigarette users. However, as can be seen in Figure 1, the 95 percent confidence
intervals around these point estimates substantially overlap. It should also be kept in mind that
the rate of incident respiratory disease between wave 1 and wave 2 or 3 is low, at 4.5 percent.
The differences in the estimated AORs thus reflect very small differences in the absolute levels
of the probability of incident respiratory disease. In the results from the linear probability
models, the estimated coefficients (rounded to two digits after the decimal point) are almost
exactly the same for current smokers of combustible regardless of whether they are never,
former, or current e-cigarette users. On balance, we do not see the results in Table 3 as providing
strong evidence that dual use of e-cigarettes and combustible tobacco is associated with a higher
risk of respiratory disease than smoking combustibles alone.
4. Future Directions: Identifying the Causal Effects of E-Cigarettes on Health
Private decisions about e-cigarette use and public policy decisions about e-cigarette regulation
require evidence on the causal effects of e-cigarette use on health outcomes. In contrast, the
study by B & G and our replication and extension are examples of risk-factor epidemiology and
estimate statistical associations, not causal effects. Identifying statistical risk factors is a
potentially useful step in public health research. For example, after public health research
initially identified factors including social class, geography, and ethnicity as risk factors for
neural tube birth defects, subsequent animal studies and clinical trials established
periconceptional folic acid deficiency to be the causal mechanism behind the statistical


                                                 5
associations (Susser and Susser 1996). However, it may be challenging to follow up risk factor
studies of e-cigarette use with research that will establish convincing evidence on causal health
effects, or the lack thereof.3
We believe that the framework of applied econometrics provides a useful framework to address
the challenges of using observational data to estimate the causal effects of e-cigarette use on
health. The key challenge is that in observational data, people are not randomly assigned into e-
cigarette use. Instead, they self-select into e-cigarette use. The high levels of e-cigarette use
among adult former smokers suggest that many adults self-select into e-cigarette use as a way to
stop smoking combustible tobacco. Because health concerns often drive smoking cessation, this
creates potential reverse causality if health problems cause people to select into e-cigarette use.
Public health research often uses longitudinal data to address reverse causality and other sources
of selection bias. To explore reverse causality, B & G (their Table 4) estimate the longitudinal
associations between e-cigarette use at wave 2 or 3 and respiratory disease at wave 1. For this
analysis, the sample is limited to people who at wave 1 had never used e-cigarettes. B & G find
evidence consistent with reverse causality; wave 1 respiratory disease is associated with
statistically significantly higher odds of e-cigarette use at wave 2 or 3 (AOR = 1.44). As
explained above, in their main longitudinal analysis of incident respiratory disease, B & G drop
individuals with wave 1 respiratory disease. They argue that: "The longitudinal design allows
much stronger conclusions about causality than in earlier cross-sectional studies...."
However, the use of longitudinal data is not sufficient to eliminate self-selection bias in
observational studies. Remaining unobservable heterogeneity, also called unobservable
confounders, can still result in biased estimates of causal effects. For example, B & G were only
able to drop respondents who reported that they had ever been told by a health professional that
they had a chronic respiratory disease. Some respondents with diagnosed respiratory disease
might not recall being told.4 Other respondents might never have been told by a health
professional that they had respiratory disease, yet still experienced respiratory symptoms. Such
respondents are likely to self-select into e-cigarette use as a way to quit smoking combustible
tobacco. Because they are more likely to report respiratory disease in wave 2 or 3 due to their

3
  Laboratory research establishes that the vapor from e-cigarettes contains fewer and much lower levels of the
combustion-generated toxicants in tobacco smoke that are linked to cancer, chronic lung disease, and
cardiovascular disease (Hajek et al 2014). Yet the gold standard evidence from human clinical trials is lacking
because of ethical concerns about randomly assigning subjects to use e-cigarettes. Future research on the health
effects of e-cigarette use will probably continue to rely on observational data.
4
  Although we do not observe PATH respondents before wave 1, we can compare self-reports of disease at wave 1
and wave 2. For example, of the 1002 respondents with reported chronic bronchitis in wave 1, 398 of them (forty
percent) do not report in wave 2 having been told within the past 12 months that they had chronic bronchitis. By
definition, chronic bronchitis is a long-term respiratory disease that should be expected to persist across waves.
The 398 respondents who no longer report chronic bronchitis in wave 2 might not have discussed their disease
with a health professional within the past year, or they might have forgotten the diagnosis. Either way, the
comparison of wave 1 and wave 2 self-reports suggests that using the wave 2 measure would result in substantial
misclassification of which respondents have respiratory disease. If there are also substantial rates of
misclassification in the wave 1-based measures, using measures of respiratory disease at wave 1 will not control
for important sources of reverse causality.

                                                        6
pre-existing symptoms, longitudinal associations between newly reported respiratory disease and
e-cigarette use reflects selection bias as well as any true causal effect.
Applied econometrics provides a systematic framework for future research on the causal health
effects of e-cigarette use. A productive line of applied econometrics emphasizes the importance
of finding quasi-experimental variation that credibly identifies the causal effect of an
independent or treatment variable on the outcome of interest. Possible examples include
plausibly exogeneous supply-side shocks or public policies that increase the cost of obtaining e-
cigarettes. The resulting variation in e-cigarette use provides a quasi-experiment where some
people are more-or-less randomly assigned (by the exogenous shifters) to different levels of e-
cigarette use. Quasi-experimental methods in econometrics to identify causal effects include
event studies, differences-in-differences, instrumental variables, and the regression discontinuity
design (Angrist and Pischke 2009).
To date, empirical economic research on the determinants of e-cigarette use is thin (DeCicca,
Kenkel, and Lovenheim 2020). As a result, it is not clear whether within the U.S. there are strong
supply-side shocks or enough variation in public policies to provide the quasi-experimental
variation required to identify causal health effects. Across countries, public policies towards e-
cigarettes range from complete bans, to the regulatory approach in the U.S., to Britain's approach
which actively promotes e-cigarettes for smoking cessation. A careful quasi-experimental
approach to cross-country data is a potential strategy to study causal health effects, keeping in
mind the threats to external validity that might make it inappropriate to extrapolate across
countries.
Another key feature of the applied econometrics framework is that it is guided by economic
theory. Quasi-experimental studies are broadly guided by the insights from the economic
approach to human behavior, while structural studies estimate econometric models that are
tightly linked to well-specified theoretical models. Darden (2017) estimates a structural model of
lifetime cigarette consumption. In each period, the smoker is assumed to decide about her current
smoking to maximize lifetime utility, given her information at that point in time. Medical exams
provide the consumer with new information about future health risks. Consistent with the model,
the empirical analysis finds that major health shocks ­ the onset of cancer or heart disease ­ and
recent changes in biomarkers, e.g. blood pressure and cholesterol levels, significantly increase
the probability of quitting. Darden, Gilleskie and Strumpf (2018) use the same data to estimate
the causal effect of smoking on life expectancy.
Regardless of whether future econometric research adopts the structural approach, the studies by
Darden (2017) and Darden, Gilleskie and Strumpf (2018) provide a starting point that highlights
the potentially complex pattern of lifetime choices of e-cigarette use and combustible tobacco
smoking. Given the complexity, a productive strategy might be to conduct separate analyses of
initiation and cessation (DeCicca, Kenkel, and Mathios 2008). Teens self-select into initiating e-
cigarette use for much different reasons than adult smokers who select into e-cigarette use as a
way to quit smoking combustible tobacco.



                                                 7
To sum up, future applied econometric research into the health effects of e-cigarettes could
usefully use quasi-experimental research designs, perhaps combined with more structural
econometric analysis. Instead of econometric analysis of observational data, another approach
would be to conduct randomized clinical trials (RCTs). While longitudinal RCT's can be very
helpful in identifying causality, they often raise significant ethical concerns, especially in the
area of tobacco use. Moreover, RCT's have their own drawbacks that relate to self-selection of
who participates, attrition within longitudinal trials, and other related issues. RCTs are also
expensive to implement. We suggest using a variety of identification strategies to uncover the
causal effects that use a variety of econometric methods for identification such as instrumental
variables, difference-in-difference models, and regression discontinuity analysis. Taken
together, these approaches can help assess the causal relationships within this complex
environment.
5. Conclusion
Harm reduction is an established part of U.S. public health policy, for example to reduce the
harms from substance abuse and sexually transmitted disease. The development of modern e-
cigarettes has renewed interest in tobacco harm reduction. In his proposal for safer cigarettes
published in the British Medical Journal, Russell (1976) observed that, "People smoke for the
nicotine but die from the tar." Tar is the by-product of combustion, so Russell's observation
explains the harm-reduction potential of non-combusted tobacco products including smokeless
tobacco, e-cigarettes, and heat-not-burn products. After reviewing scientific evidence submitted
by Swedish Match USA Inc., in 2019 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized
Swedish Match to market eight snus smokeless tobacco products through the modified risk
tobacco product pathway. The manufacturer is allowed to market the products with the claim
"Using General Snus instead of cigarettes puts you at a lower risk of mouth cancer, heart disease,
lung cancer, stroke, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis."
Of course, the harm-reduction potential of e-cigarettes depend on whether use actually reduces
harm. B & G report longitudinal statistical associations between e-cigarette use and respiratory
disease. We are able to closely replicate their results, but when we use a more flexible empirical
specification, we find no evidence that current or former e-cigarette use is associated with
respiratory disease. Replication is a vital part of the scientific method. Our study adds to a body
of research that is building the evidence base for e-cigarette regulatory policy.
Looking to the future, we believe that a promising approach is to use the methods of modern
applied econometrics to credibly identify the causal effects of e-cigarette use on health. The
original B & G study and our replication and extension are examples of risk-factor
epidemiology. Even when epidemiologic studies find robust evidence for risk factors, the
statistical associations should not be interpreted as evidence of causation. Unfortunately, this
distinction is often obscured in media reports and sometimes in the epidemiology studies. By the
same token, the lack of statistical associations in our extension should be cautiously interpreted.
The key empirical challenge is that consumers are not randomly assigned but instead self-select
into e-cigarette use. If consumers self-select into e-cigarettes as a way to quit smoking, the
epidemiologic estimates are likely biased away from zero towards finding spurious associations

                                                 8
with health problems. To provide more definitive evidence, we suggest using a variety of
identification strategies to uncover the causal effects that use of a variety of econometric
methods for identification such as instrumental variables, difference-in-difference models, and
regression discontinuity analysis.
