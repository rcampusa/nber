We propose two metrics for asset pricing models and apply them to representative agent models with
recursive preferences, habits, and jumps. The metrics describe the pricing kernel’s dispersion (the
entropy of the title) and dynamics (time dependence, a measure of how entropy varies over different
time horizons). We show how each model generates entropy and time dependence and compare their
magnitudes to estimates derived from asset returns. This exercise — and transparent loglinear approximations
— clarifies the mechanisms underlying these models. It also reveals, in some cases, tension between
entropy, which should be large enough to account for observed excess returns, and time dependence,
which should be small enough to account for mean yield spreads.

1    Introduction

Representative agent models are the workhorses of the macro-ﬁnance literature, with models
based on recursive preferences and habits contributing prominently. The two approaches
are often treated as substitutes, two ways to generate realistic asset prices and returns, yet
their mechanisms are quite diﬀerent. Are they similar, then, or diﬀerent?

    We explore the mechanics of asset pricing models, paying special attention to these
popular examples of representative agent models. Our ﬁrst step is to develop metrics that
summarize the properties of asset pricing models. We base them on the pricing kernel,
because every model has one, and on entropy, for reasons we outline shortly. One metric
concerns the pricing kernel’s dispersion, which we measure with entropy. We show that the
entropy of the pricing kernel is an upper bound on mean excess returns. Roughly speaking,
this entropy bound is a logarithmic version of the well-known Hansen-Jagannathan (1991)
bound. It diﬀers in using entropy as its measure of dispersion of the pricing kernel and
in deﬁning excess returns as diﬀerences in logarithms of gross returns. The other metric
concerns the pricing kernel’s dynamics. We summarize its dynamics with what we call time
dependence, a measure of how entropy varies with the time horizon. As with entropy, we can
infer its magnitude from asset returns: negative (positive) time dependence is associated
with an upward-sloping (downward-sloping) mean yield curve and positive (negative) mean
yield spreads.

    These entropy-based metrics are, in our view, natural ones for our purpose. One reason
is that most popular asset pricing models are loglinear, or nearly so. Logarithmic measures
like entropy and log-diﬀerences in returns are easily computed for them. A second reason
is that entropy extends more easily to multiple periods than, say, the mean and standard
deviation of the pricing kernel used in the Hansen-Jagannathan bound. Finally, entropy
incorporates nonnormal components of the pricing kernel and returns in a particularly
simple and transparent way. Similar reasoning underlies the treatment of long-run risk in
Hansen (2008) and Hansen and Scheinkman (2009). All of this will be clearer once we’ve
developed the appropriate tools.

    We think these metrics give us some insight into the behavior of popular asset pric-
ing models. The data suggests that a realistic model should have substantial entropy (to
account for observed mean excess returns) and modest time dependence (to account for
observed mean yield spreads). In representative agent models, the two features are often
linked. Although the speciﬁcs diﬀer, dynamics play a fundamental role in models based on
recursive preferences and habits. With recursive preferences, dynamics in the consumption
growth process are required to distinguish them from additive power utility. In the popular
Bansal-Yaron (2004) model this takes the form of persistence in consumption growth and
its conditional variance. With habits, dynamics enter preferences directly. The challenge
in each case is to use these dynamics to increase entropy relative to power utility without
producing unrealistically large time dependence. The models are similar, therefore, in this
respect: tension between entropy and time dependence is an inherent feature.
    We illustrate the tension between entropy and time dependence and point to a number
of ways of resolving it. One of the most useful approaches, in our view, is to introduce
jumps: nonnormal innovations in consumption growth. Skewness and kurtosis are evident
in asset returns, so it seems natural to include them in asset pricing models. Such jump
risk can be added to either class of models. With recursive preferences, persistent jump risk
can increase entropy substantially with only a small impact on time dependence.

   These and other approaches are described below. We use closed-form loglinear approxi-
mations to make all the moving parts visible. We think this brings us some useful intuition
even in models that have been explored extensively elsewhere.

    We use a number of conventions to keep the notation, if not simple, as simple as possible.
(i) For the most part, Greek letters are parameters. Latin letters are variables or collections
of coeﬃcients. (ii) We use a t subscript (xt , for example) to represent a random variable
and the same letter without a subscript (x) to represent its mean. In some cases, log x
represents the mean of log xt , but the subtle diﬀerence between the two has no bearing on
anything important. (iii) The letter B is the backshift or lag operator, shifting what follows
back one period: Bxt = xt−1 , B k xt = xt−k , and so on. (iv) Lag polynomials are one-sided
and possibly inﬁnite: a(B) = a0 + a1 B + a2 B 2 + · · ·.



2     Properties of pricing kernels

In modern asset pricing theory, a pricing kernel accounts for asset returns. The reverse
is also true: asset returns contain information about the pricing kernel that gave rise to
them. We show that mean excess returns on equity, bonds, and other assets correspond
to properties of the pricing kernel, speciﬁcally its dispersion and time dependence. We
base these properties on entropy, a dispersion concept that is particularly convenient in the
loglinear environments common in the asset pricing literature.


2.1   Properties of asset returns

We begin with a summary of the salient properties of excess returns. In Table 1 we report the
sample mean, standard deviation, skewness, and excess kurtosis of monthly excess returns
on a diverse collection of assets. None of this evidence is new, but it’s helpful to collect it
in one place. Excess returns are measured as diﬀerences in logs of gross returns over the
one-month Treasury.

    We see, ﬁrst, the equity premium. The mean excess return on a broad-based equity
index is 0.0040 = 0.40% per month or 4.8% a year. This return comes with risk: its sample
distribution has a standard deviation over 5%, skewness of −0.4, and excess kurtosis of 7.9.


                                              2
Nonzero values of skewness and excess kurtosis are a clear indication that excess returns on
the equity index are not normal.

    Other equity portfolios exhibit a range of behavior. Some have larger mean excess
returns and come with larger standard deviations and excess kurtosis. Consider the popular
Fama-French portfolios, constructed from a ﬁve-by-ﬁve matrix of stocks sorted by size (small
to large) and book-to-market (low to high). Small ﬁrms with high book-to-market have
mean excess returns more than twice the equity premium (0.90% per month). Option
strategies (buying out-of-the-money puts and at-the-money straddles on the S&P 500 index)
have large negative excess returns, suggesting that short positions will have large positive
returns, on average. Both exhibit substantial skewness and excess kurtosis.

    Currencies have smaller mean excess returns and standard deviations but comparable
excess kurtosis, although more sophisticated currency strategies have been found to generate
large excess returns. Here we see that buying the pound generates substantial excess returns
in this sample.

    Bonds have smaller mean excess returns than the equity index. About half the excess
return of the ﬁve-year US Treasury over the one-month Treasury (0.15% in our sample)
is evident in the one-year bond (0.08%). The increase in excess returns with maturity
corresponds to a mean yield curve that also increases with maturity over this range. (See,
for example, Appendix A.1.) The numbers are similar: the mean spread between yields
on one-month and ﬁve-year Treasuries over the last three decades has been 1.2% annually
or 0.1% monthly. Backus, Foresi, Mozumdar and Wu (2001, Table 2) is one of the many
sources of evidence on this point. All of these numbers refer to nominal bonds. Data on
inﬂation-indexed bonds is available for only a short sample and a limited range of maturities,
leaving some range of opinion about their properties, including the mean slope of the real
yield curve. However, none of the evidence suggests that the absolute magnitudes, whether
positive or negative, are signiﬁcantly greater than we see for nominal bonds. Chernov and
Mueller (2008) suggest that yield spreads are smaller on real than nominal bonds, which
would make our estimates upper bounds.

    These properties of returns are estimates, but they’re suggestive of the facts a theoretical
model might try to explain. Our list includes: (i) Many assets have positive mean excess
returns, and some have returns substantially greater than a broad-based equity index such
as the S&P 500. We use a lower bound of 0.01 = 1% per month. The exact number isn’t
critical, but it’s helpful to have a clear numerical benchmark. (ii) Excess returns on long
bonds are smaller than excess returns on an equity index and positive for nominal bonds.
We are agnostic about the sign of mean yield spreads, but suggest that are unlikely to be
larger than 0.001 = 0.1% monthly in absolute value. (iii) Excess returns on many assets
are decidedly nonnormal.




                                               3
2.2   Entropy

The next step is to use this evidence to characterize the pricing kernel. Here we intro-
duce entropy as a measure of dispersion and show that the entropy of the pricing kernel
bounds mean excess returns from above. This entropy bound is a close relative of the
well-known Hansen-Jagannathan (1991) bound and extends related work by Alvarez and
Jermann (2005) and Bansal and Lehman (1997).

   The foundation for both bounds is the fundamental result in asset pricing theory: in
arbitrage-free environments, there is a positive random variable m that satisﬁes

                                    Et (mt+1 rt+1 ) = 1                                   (1)

for gross returns r on all traded assets. We refer to m as the pricing kernel . Here Et
denotes the expectation based on the distribution conditioned on the state at date t. In the
stationary ergodic environments we study, the unconditional expectation E is computed
from the unique equilibrium or invariant distribution.

   We deﬁne the conditional entropy of the pricing kernel by

                          Lt (mt+1 ) ≡ log Et mt+1 − Et log mt+1 .                        (2)

This is the entropy of the risk-neutral distribution relative to the true distribution or the
Kullback-Leibler divergence; see Backus, Chernov, and Martin (2011, Section II). Note
that entropy is a measure of dispersion: it is nonnegative and equals zero only if mt+1 is
(conditionally) constant. If mt+1 is lognormal, with log mt+1 |t ∼ N (κ1t , κ2t ), conditional
entropy is

       Lt (mt+1 ) = log Et mt+1 − Et log mt+1 = (κ1t + κ2t /2) − κ1t = κ2t /2.

It includes additional terms if log mt+1 is not normal.

     There’s a nice connection between entropy and the cumulants of log mt+1 . Cumulants,
of course, are close relatives of moments. The (conditional) cumulant-generating function
(if it exists) for log mt+1 is the log of its (conditional) moment-generating function:
                                                    (         )
                                  kt (s) = log Et es log mt+1 ,

a function of the real variable s. As before, we denote conditioning with a subscript t. With
enough regularity, it has the power series expansion
                                        (                )       ∞
                                                                 ∑
                                            s log mt+1
                       kt (s) = log Et e                     =         κjt sj /j!
                                                                 j=1

over some suitable range of s. The (conditional) cumulant κjt is the jth derivative of kt
at s = 0; κ1t is the mean, κ2t is the variance, and so on. Skewness γ1t and excess kurtosis

                                               4
                                                                            3/2
γ2t are scaled versions of the third and fourth cumulants: γ1t = κ3t /κ2t and γ2t = κ4t /κ22t .
Entropy is therefore

        Lt (mt+1 ) = kt (1) − κ1t
                    = κ2t (log mt+1 )/2! + κ3t (log mt+1 )/3! + κ4t (log mt+1 )/4! + · · · .   (3)
                      |        {z      } |                      {z                      }
                        normal term                   high-order cumulants

If the conditional distribution of log mt+1 is normal, then only the variance κ2t appears.
In other cases, high-order cumulants (those of order j ≥ 3) also appear. These high-order
terms are a deﬁning feature of models with jumps and disasters.

    These two ingredients — the pricing relation (1) and the conditional entropy of the
pricing kernel (2) — lead to the entropy bound:
                                            (                )
                         ELt (mt+1 ) ≥ E log rt+1 − log rt+1
                                                          1
                                                               ,                    (4)

where r1 is the (gross) return on a one-period riskfree bond. In words: mean excess returns
are bounded above by mean conditional entropy of the pricing kernel. Closely related
results are reported by Alvarez and Jermann (2005) and Bansal and Lehman (1997). For
convenience, we refer to mean conditional entropy simply as entropy.

    We derive the bound (4) as follows. Since log is a concave function, the pricing relation
(1) and Jensen’s inequality imply that for any positive return rt+1 ,

                         Et log mt+1 + Et log rt+1 ≤ log(1) = 0,                               (5)

with equality iﬀ mt+1 rt+1 = 1. The log return with the highest mean is, evidently, rt+1 =
1/mt+1 . For the excess return, we need the return on a one-period bond (a claim to “one”
next period). Its price is qt1 = Et mt+1 , so the short rate is rt+1
                                                                 1   = 1/qt1 . The log of the short
rate is therefore
               1
          log rt+1 = − log qt1 = − log Et mt+1 = −Lt (mt+1 ) − Et log mt+1 .

If we subtract this from (5), we have
                                           (                    )
                            Lt (mt+1 ) ≥ Et log rt+1 − log rt+1
                                                            1
                                                                  .

We take the unconditional expectation of both sides to produce (4).

    The entropy bound (4), like the Hansen-Jagannathan (1991) bound, produces an upper
bound on excess returns from the dispersion of the pricing kernel. In this sense the ideas
are similar, but the bounds use diﬀerent measures of dispersion and excess returns. They
are not equivalent and neither is a special case of the other. We explore the diﬀerences
further in Appendix A.2.



                                                 5
2.3   Time dependence

With the entropy bound, we use information about excess returns to describe the pricing
kernel’s dispersion. We now show how bond yields can be used to describe its dynamics.

    Bond prices follow from the pricing kernel. Let qtn be the price at date t of a claim to
                                                        n       n−1 n
one at t + n. The one-period return on this bond is rt+1    = qt+1 /qt . Equation (1) then
gives us recursive pricing of bonds:
                                             (      n−1
                                                        )
                                   qtn = Et mt+1 qt+1                                    (6)

starting with qt0 = 1. Repeated substitution leads to

                      qtn = Et (mt+1 mt+2 · · · mt+n ) = Et mt,t+n ,                       (7)

where mt,t+n ≡ mt+1 mt+2 · · · mt+n is compact notation for the multiperiod pricing kernel .
Yields are deﬁned from prices by qtn = exp(−nytn ) or nytn = − log qtn .

   We summarize the pricing kernel’s dynamics with the entropy of the multiperiod pricing
kernel, which we term multiperiod entropy. From the pricing relation (7) for bonds and the
deﬁnition of entropy, you might guess that multiperiod entropy is closely related to long
bond prices. Multiperiod conditional entropy is

                                                                       ∑
                                                                       n
         Lt (mt,t+n ) = log Et mt,t+n − Et log mt,t+n = log qtn − Et          log mt+j .
                                                                        j=1

Mean conditional multiperiod entropy (multiperiod entropy, for short) is therefore

              ELt (mt,t+n ) = E log q n − nE log m = −nEy n − nE log m.                    (8)

The second equality follows from the deﬁnition of the n-period yield y n .

   We use multiperiod entropy to describe the pricing kernel’s dynamics. Suppose, for
example, that successive pricing kernels are iid (independent and identically distributed).
Then mean multiperiod conditional entropy is simply a scaled-up version of one-period
entropy:

                              ELt (mt,t+n ) = nELt (mt+1 ).

This is a generalization of a well-known result: the variance of a random walk is proportional
to the time interval. We refer to this as a case of neutral or zero time dependence. More
formally, we deﬁne time dependence by the per-period diﬀerence between the left and right
sides:

                         T (n) = n−1 ELt (mt,t+n ) − ELt (mt+1 ).                          (9)


                                              6
If T (n) is positive we say there is positive time dependence, if negative, we say there is
negative time dependence. It’s possible for T (n) to be positive for some values of n and
negative for others, but that doesn’t occur in the examples we study. In a loglinear model,
such as the one in the next section, time dependence is governed by the autocorrelation of
the log pricing kernel. If autocorrelations are negative, then time dependence is, too.

   More important for our purposes, time dependence is tied to bond yields. The diﬀerence
between equation (8) for arbitrary n and n = 1 implies

                T (n) = n−1 ELt (mt,t+n ) − ELt (mt+1 ) = −E(ytn − yt1 ).                (10)

In words: time dependence is negative if the mean yield curve slopes upward, positive if it
slopes downward, and zero if it’s ﬂat.

    If we look at time dependence through the lens of the evidence, it’s clear that it must be
small relative to entropy. Why? Because mean yield spreads (and returns on long bonds)
are small relative to returns on other assets.



3     Models of pricing kernels

We apply the concepts of entropy and time dependence to a loglinear example, a modest
generalization of the Vasicek (1977) model. We show, in this relatively simple setting,
how parameter values based on observed asset returns generate the two properties we’ve
emphasized: entropy must be larger than observed excess returns (say, 0.01 = 1% per
month) and time dependence must be small in comparison (no larger in absolute value than
0.001 = 0.1% at 60 months). We then compare the model to one based on a representative
agent with additive power utility.


3.1   The Vasicek model

Consider the loglinear statistical model of the pricing kernel,
                                         ∞
                                         ∑
                    log mt = log m +           aj wt−j = log m + a(B)wt ,                (11)
                                         j=0
                         ∑
where wt is iid N (0, 1), j a2j < ∞, and B is the lag or backshift operator. The implicitly
deﬁned lag polynomial a(B) is described in Appendix A.3 along with some of its uses. The
inﬁnite moving average gives us control over the pricing kernel’s dynamics, which reappear
in bond yields and time dependence. We’ll see that a0 governs entropy and the other
coeﬃcients govern time dependence. Here mt is the real pricing kernel, which provides a
direct comparison with marginal rates of substitution in representative agent models.

                                                7
   Bond prices, returns, and yields follow from their deﬁnitions, the pricing relation (6),
and the pricing kernel (11). See Appendix A.4. The short rate is
                                     ∞
                                     ∑
         1
    log rt+1 = −(log m + A20 /2) −         aj+1 wt−j = −(log m + A20 /2) + [a(B)/B]+ wt .   (12)
                                     j=0

The subscript
     ∑n       “+” means ignore negative powers of B; see Appendix A.3. The partial sums
An = j=0 aj include A0 = a0 . Mean excess returns and yield spreads are
                                              (           )
                          n
                   E(log rt+1 − log rt+1
                                     1
                                          ) = A20 − A2n−1 /2
                                                  ∑n
                              E(ytn − yt1 ) = n−1    (A20 − A2j−1 )/2.
                                                            j=1

We see here how the dynamics of the pricing kernel, represented by the moving average
coeﬃcients aj and their partial sums Aj , aﬀect yields and returns. If aj = 0 for j ≥ 1
(the iid case), then Aj = A0 for all j, interest rates are constant, the mean yield curve is
ﬂat, and mean excess returns on long bonds are zero. Otherwise, excess returns and yield
spreads are governed by terms like A20 − A2j−1 .

   The same components drive entropy and time dependence. Conditional entropy is

               Lt (mt+1 ) = log Et mt+1 − Et log mt+1 = a20 /2 = A20 /2.                    (13)

Entropy is the same. Multiperiod entropy is
                                                      ∑
                                                      n
                                 Lt (mt,t+n ) =             A2j−1 /2.
                                                      j=1

Time dependence is the diﬀerence, averaged over the number of periods:
                                                ∑
                                                n
                                                  (              )
                             T (n) = n−1              A2j−1 − A20 /2,                       (14)
                                                j=1

the mirror image of the mean yield spread. Here, too, you can see how the pricing kernel’s
dynamics interact with its properties. A typical term in the sum can be expressed

                         A2j − A20 = [(Aj − A0 ) + A0 ]2 − A20
                                     = (Aj − A0 )2 + 2(Aj − A0 )A0 .

A realistic model must have large enough entropy to account for observed excess returns and
small enough time dependence to account for the size of term premiums relative to excess
returns on other assets. The former requires large (in absolute value) a0 = A0 . The latter
requires small Aj − A0 , which in turn requires the individual moving average coeﬃcients aj
for j ≥ 1 to be small relative to the initial term a0 . A useful indicator in this regard is the
ratio, θ = a1 /a0 . For |a1 | ≪ |a0 | we need |θ| ≪ 1. Departures from the iid case (aj = 0 for
j ≥ 1) can’t be too big.

3.2   Entropy and time dependence in the Vasicek model

We can see more clearly how this works if we add some structure and choose parameter val-
ues that approximate the salient features of interest rates. We make log mt an ARMA(1,1)
process; see Appendix A.3. This leads to an AR(1) for the short rate, which turns the
model into a legitimate discrete-time version of Vasicek. We set aj+1 = φaj for j ≥ 1 for
0 ≤ φ < 1. That gives us three free parameters: the initial value a0 (positive by conven-
tion), the second value a1 , and the rate of decay φ. All of these parameters can be inferred
from bond yields. We choose φ and a1 to match the autocorrelation and variance of the
short rate and a0 to match the mean spread between one-month and ﬁve-year bonds. The
result is a statistical model of the pricing kernel that captures some of its central features.

   With this structure, we can connect parameters to properties of bond returns. The (log)
short rate, equation (12), is AR(1) with autocorrelation parameter φ. We set φ = 0.85,
an estimate of the monthly autocorrelation of the real short rate reported by Chernov and
Mueller (2008). The variance of the short rate is
                                               ∞
                                               ∑
                                   1
                         Var (log rt+1 )   =         a2j = a21 /(1 − φ2 ).
                                               j=1

Chernov and Mueller report a standard deviation of (0.02/12) (2% annually), which implies
|a1 | = 8.78 × 10−4 . Finally, we choose a0 to match the mean yield spread on the ﬁve-year
bond. If the yield spread is E(y 60 − y 1 ) = 0.001 = 0.1% a month, this implies a0 = 0.1953
and a1 < 0. The ratio θ = a1 /a0 = −0.0045 is, indeed, much smaller than one in absolute
value. If we make a1 positive, the yield spread is negative.

    We see the impact of these numbers on the moving average coeﬃcients in Figure 1.
The ﬁrst bar in each pair corresponds to a negative value of a1 and a positive yield spread,
the second bar to the reverse. We see in both cases that the initial coeﬃcient a0 is larger
by a wide margin. In fact, we have truncated it to make the others visible. The primary
diﬀerence is in sign: an upward sloping mean yield curve requires a0 and a1 to have opposite
signs, which we accomplish here by making a1 and its successors negative. Negative mean
yield spreads lead us to make aj positive for j ≥ 1.

    We see the same thing from multiple perspectives in Figure 2. In each quadrant, the
solid line corresponds to parameter values chosen to generate a positive mean yield spread
and the dashed line corresponds to a negative mean yield spread. The upper left quadrant
contains sequences of moving average coeﬃcients: a0 , a1 , a2 , . . .. From this perspective, the
coeﬃcients are essentially zero after the ﬁrst one and the log pricing kernel is approximately
white noise. Departures from white noise are evident in the lower left quadrant, where we
zoom in on the sequence starting with a1 . Both sequences approach zero at rate φ starting
with a1 . The upper right quadrant shows the resulting partial sums Aj , which appear in
expressions for yield spreads and time dependence. The lower right quadrant shows the
mean yield spreads.

                                                9
    Entropy and time dependence are pictured in Figure 3. The dotted line in the middle is
our estimated entropy lower bound. The top three lines report average multiperiod entropy:
multiperiod entropy divided by the number of periods. The top dashed line corresponds to
positive time dependence: per period entropy rises (slightly) with the number of periods.
The center line is (one-period) entropy, which serves here as a benchmark. The downward-
sloping line below it corresponds to negative time dependence. The three lines at the
bottom are time dependence, which we see is small relative to entropy. The dotted lines
surrounding them are our estimated upper and lower bounds. Time dependence hits the
bounds by construction: we chose parameters precisely to match these quantities at a time
horizon of 60 months.


3.3   A representative agent with additive power utility

In representative agent models, pricing kernels are marginal rates of substitution. Typically
a pricing kernel follows from applying a preference ordering to a given consumption growth
process. The form is particularly simple if the representative agent has additive power
utility. To ﬁx notation, let period utility be cρ /ρ with ρ < 1. Then the pricing kernel is
                                                       ρ−1
                            mt+1 = β(ct+1 /ct )ρ−1 = βgt+1 ,                             (15)

where gt+1 = ct+1 /ct is consumption growth. Here ρ governs both risk aversion and in-
tertemporal substitution.

   If the consumption growth process is loglinear, the pricing kernel has the same form as
the Vasicek model. Let

                               log gt = log g + γ(B)v 1/2 wt ,                           (16)

where {wt } ∼ NID(0, 1), γ0 = 1 (a normalization), and v is the conditional variance. The
pricing kernel is then

                   log mt = log β + (ρ − 1) log g + (ρ − 1)γ(B)v 1/2 wt .

This is equivalent to the Vasicek model (11), with all the moving average coeﬃcients scaled
by (ρ − 1): aj = (ρ − 1)v 1/2 γj . The ratio θ = a1 /a0 = γ1 /γ0 is controlled entirely by the
consumption process.

    With this structure, entropy and time dependence are both scaled by (ρ − 1)2 : if we
increase 1 − ρ to magnify entropy, we also raise the absolute value of
                                                                    ∑ time dependence.
Consider a given consumption growth process with partial sums Γn = nj=0 γj . Entropy is

                ELt (mt+1 ) = a20 /2 = (ρ − 1)2 Γ20 v/2 = (ρ − 1)2 v/2,




                                             10
which puts a lower bound on 1 − ρ. If the conditional variance of monthly consumption
growth is 0.00722 (see Table 2), then to generate entropy of (say) 0.01, we need 1 − ρ ≥
(2 × 0.01)1/2 /0.0072 = 19.6. Time dependence is also scaled by (ρ − 1)2 :

                                                   ∑
                                                   n
                         T (n) = n−1 (ρ − 1)2            (Γ2j−1 − Γ20 )v/2.
                                                   j=1

Our upper bound on the absolute value of time dependence thus places an upper bound on
1 − ρ. Whether we can satisfy both bounds at the same time depends on the consumption
growth process. This tension between entropy and time dependence is a feature of many of
the models we study.

    We study three classes of models in the following sections: models based on recursive
preferences, habits, and jumps. Recursive preferences and habits each add an extra term to
the pricing kernel relative to the additive case. With recursive preferences, the extra term
involves future utility, which in turn depends on the consumption growth process. With
habits, the extra term involves a state variable (the habit) whose dynamics depend on past
consumption. Jumps are a device for introducing nonnormal innovations into models. We
show how each class of models works, focusing on their pricing kernels and the ways in
which they generate entropy and time dependence.



4     Pricing kernels with recursive preferences

Our ﬁrst class of representative agent models is based on Bansal and Yaron (2004), who
show that a combination of consumption dynamics and recursive preferences can generate
risk premiums similar to those we observe. They build on related work by Campbell (1993),
Epstein and Zin (1989), and Weil (1989).


4.1   Recursive preferences

We deﬁne “utility from date t on” Ut recursively with the time aggregator,
                                                                   1/ρ
                           Ut = [(1 − β)cρt + βµt (Ut+1 )ρ ]             ,              (17)

and certainty equivalent function,
                                              [        α
                                                            ]1/α
                               µt (Ut+1 ) =       Et (Ut+1 )     .                      (18)

Additive power utility is a special case with α − ρ = 0. In standard terminology, ρ < 1
captures time preference (with intertemporal elasticity of substitution 1/(1 − ρ)) and α < 1
captures risk aversion (with coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion 1 − α). The terminology is a

                                              11
useful shortcut, but it’s somewhat misleading: α describes risk aversion over future utility,
which depends on (among other things) ρ. As in other multigood environments, there is no
clear separation between preference across goods and preference across states.

   The time aggregator and certainty equivalent functions are both homogeneous of degree
one, which allows us to scale everything by current consumption. If we deﬁne scaled utility
ut = Ut /ct , equation (17) becomes

                            ut = [(1 − β) + βµt (gt+1 ut+1 )ρ ]1/ρ ,                         (19)

where, as before, gt+1 = ct+1 /ct is consumption growth. This relationship serves, essentially,
as a Bellman equation.

    We use a loglinear approximation of (19) to give us transparent closed-form expressions
for pricing kernels. The approach is similar to that of Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2008, Section
III). The loglinear approximation is

                       log ut = ρ−1 log [(1 − β) + βµt (gt+1 ut+1 )ρ ]
                                        [                                 ]
                              = ρ−1 log (1 − β) + βeρ log µt (gt+1 ut+1 )
                               ≈ b0 + b1 log µt (gt+1 ut+1 ).                                (20)

The last line is a ﬁrst-order approximation of log ut in log µt around the point log µt = log µ,
with

                         b1 = βeρ log µ /[(1 − β) + βeρ log µ ]                              (21)
                                   −1
                         b0 = ρ         log[(1 − β) + βe   ρ log µ
                                                                     ] − b1 log µ.

The equation is exact when ρ = 0, in which case b0 = 0 and b1 = β. Otherwise, it is the
only source of approximation in what follows.

   The pricing kernel (marginal rate of substitution) is

                        mt+1 = β(ct+1 /ct )ρ−1 [Ut+1 /µt (Ut+1 )]α−ρ
                                    ρ−1
                                = βgt+1 [gt+1 ut+1 /µt (gt+1 ut+1 )]α−ρ .                    (22)

See Appendix A.5. This has a convenient loglinear structure as long as g and u do. The
pricing kernel reduces to additive power utility (15) in two cases: when α − ρ = 0 and when
gt+1 is iid. The latter illustrates the central role of dynamics. If gt+1 is iid, ut+1 is constant
                                             α−1
and the pricing kernel is proportional to gt+1   . This is arguably diﬀerent from power utility,
where the exponent is ρ − 1, but with no intertemporal variation in consumption growth we
can’t tell the two apart. Beyond the iid case, dynamics in consumption growth introduce
an extra term to the pricing kernel: in logs, the innovation in future utility plus a risk
adjustment.



                                                12
4.2   Entropy and time dependence with consumption dynamics

Our ﬁrst example generates additional entropy relative to additive power utility through a
combination of recursive preferences and a persistent component in consumption growth.
The model is Bansal and Yaron’s (2004) Case I with one change: we replace their bivariate
process for log consumption growth with a univariate process that has the same autocovari-
ance function. We think this captures their idea in a (slightly) simpler way.

   Consider the univariate loglinear consumption growth process (16). Persistence is re-
ﬂected in nonzero values of γj for j ≥ 1. The loglinear approximation to the pricing kernel
is

      log mt+1 = log β + (ρ − 1) log g − (α − ρ)(α/2)γ(b1 )2 v
                     + [(ρ − 1)γ0 + (α − ρ)γ(b1 )]v 1/2 wt+1 + (ρ − 1)[γ(B)/B]+ v 1/2 wt . (23)

See Appendix A.6. This has the same form as the Vasicek model (11) with
                          {
                             [(ρ − 1)γ0 + (α − ρ)γ(b1 )]v 1/2 j = 0
                   aj =
                             (ρ − 1)γj v 1/2                  j ≥ 1.

Entropy then follows from equation (13):

                 ELt (mt+1 ) = a20 /2 = [(ρ − 1)γ0 + (α − ρ)γ(b1 )]2 v/2.

Time dependence follows from equation (14).

     The only departure from additive power utility is in the initial moving average coeﬃcient,
a0 . The key ingredient is the term
                                                   ∞
                                                   ∑
                                     γ(b1 ) =            bj1 γj .
                                                   j=0

The logic for this sum is that the impact of shocks to consumption growth on future utility
depends on their persistence (represented by γ) and discounting (represented by b1 ). If
α − ρ = 0, none of this matters: future utility does not appear in the pricing kernel and
we’re back to the additive case. Similarly, if consumption growth is iid, so that γj = 0 for
j ≥ 1 and γ(b1 ) = γ0 , the coeﬃcient of wt+1 becomes (α−1)γ0 v 1/2 , which is indistinguishable
from additive power utility. The impact of recursive preferences depends, then, on having
dynamics in consumption growth. With γ(b1 ) > 0 and α − ρ < 0, the ratio θg = a1 /a0 is
smaller than with additive power utility.

   We get a quantitative sense of the importance of consumption growth dynamics for
entropy from a numerical example. We impose the ARMA(1,1) structure we used in the
Vasicek model: γj+1 = φg γj for j ≥ 1 with 0 ≤ φg < 1. With this structure, we have

                               γ(b1 ) = 1 + b1 γ1 /(1 − b1 φg ),

                                              13
which increases as b1 and φg approach one. We use parameter values adapted from Bansal,
Kiku, and Yaron (2009); see Appendix A.9.

    We consider two thought experiments that highlight the diﬀerence between recursive
preferences and additive power utility. Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron (2009) use, in our notation,
α = −9 and ρ = 1/3. One thought experiment is to move toward power utility by setting
α = ρ = 1/3. This has the advantage of keeping intertemporal preferences the same in
the two models. The two sets of moving average coeﬃcients are pictured in Figure 4. The
impact of recursive preferences shows up entirely in the initial moving average coeﬃcient,
speciﬁcally the term (α − ρ)γ(b1 ) in (23). Subsequent coeﬃcients are identical.

    A second thought experiment is to move toward power utility by setting ρ = α = −9.
The results are reported in column (1) of Table 2. Entropy is 0.0026, well below our
estimated lower bound of 0.01, and time dependence is 0.0305, well above our estimated
upper bound of 0.001. We can increase entropy by making α = ρ larger in absolute value or
decrease time dependence by making them smaller, but we can’t do both at once. Recursive
preferences make progress along both fronts — see column (2). When we set ρ = 1/3,
keeping α = −9, we increase entropy by increasing (α − ρ) in the initial moving average
coeﬃcient. And with a smaller value of 1 − ρ, we also reduce time dependence.

    Time dependence, however, remains large: 0.0042 at a maturity of 60 months. This
corresponds to an annualized mean yield spread of −5%(= −0.0042 × 1200), which is well
outside our bounds. Beeler and Campbell (2009, Section 7) note the same thing. There
is some uncertainty about the slope of the real yield curve, but the magnitude here is well
beyond existing estimates.


4.3   Entropy and time dependence with volatility dynamics

The most popular version of the Bansal-Yaron model has two persistent components: con-
sumption growth and volatility. Both aﬀect future utility and for that reason interact with
recursive preferences to generate additional entropy in the pricing kernel.

   The model is based on the bivariate consumption growth process
                                                       1/2
                              log gt = log g + γ(B)vt−1 wgt                            (24)
                                 vt = v + ν(B)wvt ,                                    (25)

where wgt and wvt are N (0, 1) series that are independent of each other and over time. The
volatility process allows vt to be negative in some states. We can keep it positive by using
a square-root process instead, but with some loss in the transparency of the solution. See
Appendix A.7.




                                            14
   We take the same approach to the solution as in the previous example. The pricing
kernel is
                                                          [                               ]
    log mt+1 = log β + (ρ − 1) log g − (α − ρ)(α/2)γ(b1 )2 v + (α/2)2 γ(b1 )2 b21 ν(b1 )2
                                                       1/2                           1/2
                      + [(ρ − 1)γ0 + (α − ρ)γ(b1 )]vt wgt+1 + (ρ − 1)[γ(B)/B]+ vt−1 wgt
                      + (α − ρ)(α/2)γ(b1 )2 [b1 ν(b1 )wvt+1 − ν(B)wvt ].                          (26)

See Appendix A.6. The new features concern volatility. Although innovations in consump-
tion growth and volatility are independent, their roles interact in the pricing kernel. The
coeﬃcient of the volatility innovation wvt+1 depends on the dynamics of volatility [repre-
sented by ν(b1 )], the dynamics of consumption growth [γ(b1 )], and recursive preferences
[(α − ρ)]. This interaction between the two components shows up in many of its properties.

  Stochastic volatility gives the pricing kernel a diﬀerent form from the Vasicek model.
We might express it as

                      log mt = log m + ag (B)(vt−1 /v)1/2 wgt + av (B)wvt

with
                                 {
                                     [(ρ − 1)γ0 + (α − ρ)γ(b1 )]v 1/2 j = 0
                       agj   =
                                     (ρ − 1)γj v 1/2                  j≥1
                                 {
                                     (α − ρ)(α/2)γ(b1 )2 b1 ν(b1 )    j=0
                       avj   =
                                     −(α − ρ)(α/2)γ(b1 )2 νj−1        j ≥ 1.

The ﬁrst is the same as the previous example, but second is new. That gives us an additional
term in entropy:

       ELt (mt+1 ) = [(ρ − 1)γ0 + (α − ρ)γ(b1 )]2 /2 + (α − ρ)2 (α/2)2 γ(b1 )4 [b1 ν(b1 )]2 /2.

The second term is the contribution of stochastic volatility. Multiperiod entropy and time
dependence are reported in Appendix A.8.

    We see the results in Table 2. As in the previous example, the structure and parameter
values are adapted from Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron (2009). The structure is the ARMA(1,1)
process for log gt (γj+1 = φg γj for j ≥ 1) and an AR(1) process for vt (νj+1 = φv νj for
j ≥ 0). The result, reported in column (3), is a substantial increase in entropy. Most of
the increase comes from the volatility term, but its magnitude depends (as we’ve seen) on
consumption dynamics. There is also an increase in (positive) time dependence.

    It’s not evident in these numbers, but the two components generate qualitatively dif-
ferent time dependence. In the calculations they’re intertwined, but you can get a sense
from the moving average coeﬃcients pictured in Figure 6. The consumption coeﬃcients
in the top panel all have the same sign and therefore generate positive time dependence.



                                                  15
The volatility coeﬃcients in the bottom panel switch signs and therefore generate neg-
ative time dependence. Note, too, that the volatility coeﬃcients are zero in the addi-
tive case (α − ρ = 0). Both components have small ratios: θg = ag1 /ag0 = 0.0018 and
θv = av1 /av0 = ν0 /[b1 ν(b1 )] = −0.0077. The positive time dependence reported for this
model indicates that the consumption component is more important to time dependence
with these parameter values.


4.4   Discussion

The combination of recursive preferences and consumption dynamics is capable of generating
a huge increase in entropy relative to additive power utility. In this respect the approach is
a clear success. However, the persistence in consumption growth that underlies this success
also generates strong positive time dependence with standard parameter values. Even with
some uncertainty about the slope of the real yield curve, time dependence is too large.

    Since recursive preferences rely on dynamics to aﬀect the pricing kernel, the tension
between entropy and time dependence is an inherent feature of the approach. However,
the magnitudes are not. It’s not hard to imagine alternative parameter values that could
reduce time dependence without reducing entropy unduly. One approach is to reduce the
size of the persistent component of consumption growth. Column (4) of Table 2 shows how
this might work: with a smaller persistent component in consumption growth (smaller γ1 ),
time dependence falls below our estimated upper bound. The associated decline in entropy
can be reversed, if desired, by increasing risk aversion 1 − α. See equation (26). Another
approach is to place more weight on the volatility term, which (on its own) generates
negative time dependence. Gallmeyer, Holliﬁeld, Palomino, and Zin (2007) provide an
example. Yet another approach is to specify direct interaction between consumption and
volatility dynamics, as in Backus, Routledge, and Zin (2008, Section 3) and Hansen and
Scheinkman (2009, Section 3.3). The model is suﬃciently complex that it’s hard to know in
advance which of these alternatives will work best, but we think they show enough promise
to merit further exploration.



5     Pricing kernels with habit formation

Our second class of models introduces dynamics into the pricing kernel directly through
preferences. This mechanism has a long history, with applications ranging from microe-
conomic studies of consumption behavior (Deaton, 1993) to business cycles (Lettau and
Uhlig, 2000, and Smets and Wouters, 2003). The asset pricing literature includes notable
contributions by Abel (1992), Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Chan and Kogan (2002),
Constantinides (1990), Heaton (1993, 1995), and Sundaresan (1989). We consider three
examples here based on diﬀerent functional forms.


                                             16
   All of our examples start with utility functions that include a state variable xt , which
we refer to as the “habit.” A recursive formulation is
                             Ut = (1 − β)f (ct , xt ) + βEt Ut+1 .                          (27)
Typically xt is tied to past consumption in some way. The examples we study have “exter-
nal” habits: the agent ignores any impact of her consumption choices on future values of
xt . They diﬀer in the functional form of f (ct , xt ) and in the law of motion for xt .


5.1   Entropy and time dependence with a ratio habit

With so-called ratio habits, preferences follow (27) with f (ct , xt ) = (ct /xt )ρ /ρ and ρ ≤ 1.
Examples include Abel (1992) and Chan and Kogan (2002). The pricing kernel is
                            mt+1 = β (ct+1 /ct )ρ−1 (xt+1 /xt )−ρ .                         (28)
As with recursive models, we add an extra term to the additive power utility pricing kernel.

    Our ﬁrst result follows from the habit being predetermined: xt+1 is known at date t. A
direct consequence is that the habit has no impact on conditional entropy:
                                                   (     )
                                                     ρ−1
                                 Lt (mt+1 ) = Lt gt+1      .

There is no entropy contribution beyond additive power utility.

    We can be more speciﬁc if we impose additional structure on the processes for consump-
tion growth and the habit. We use our reliable loglinear moving averages, the consumption
growth process (16) and the habit
                               log xt+1 = log x + χ(B) log ct .                             (29)
Note the timing in the second equation: the habit at date t + 1 depends on consumption at
dates t and before. The log pricing kernel is then
           log mt+1 = log β + (ρ − 1) log gt+1 − ρχ(B) log gt
                      = log β + (ρ − 1) log g + [(ρ − 1) − ρχ(B)B]γ(B)v 1/2 wt+1 .
Its dynamics combine those of consumption growth [γ(B)] and the habit [χ(B)]. Chan and
Kogan (2002) use an AR(1) habit, with χj+1 = φx χj for j ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ φx < 1. Abel’s
(1990) one-period habit corresponds to φx = 0. They diﬀer in one other respect. Chan and
Kogan set χ0 = 1 − φx so that the coeﬃcients sum to one. Abel allows χ0 to vary, allowing
attenuation or exaggeration of the habit — or even durability if we allow χ0 < 0.

    The impact of the habit lies in the pricing kernel’s dynamics. We can see this most
simply when consumption growth is iid: γ(B) = γ0 = 1 (that is, γj = 0 for j ≥ 1). Then
all the dynamics come from the habit and the pricing kernel is
            log mt+1 = log β + (ρ − 1) log g + (ρ − 1)v 1/2 wt+1 − ρχ(B)v 1/2 wt .

                                               17
This corresponds to the Vasicek model with
                                   {
                                      (ρ − 1)v 1/2 j = 0
                             aj =
                                      −ρχj−1 v 1/2 j ≥ 1.

Then θ = a1 /a0 = ρχ0 /(ρ − 1). Apparently 1 − ρ must be large to generate enough entropy,
just as with additive power utility, and χ0 must be small to keep time dependence modest.

    We see the result in Figure 7. The initial term in the moving average is unchanged
relative to additive power utility, but the others change from zero to negative. Entropy
is, of course, unchanged, but time dependence is negative; see Table 3. We set φx = 0.75
here, which is close to Chan and Kogan’s (2002, Table 1) choice converted to a monthly
time interval, but it makes little diﬀerence to any of these properties. Time dependence is
governed, in large part, by the choice of χ0 . If χ0 = 1 − φx , so that the χj s sum to one, time
dependence is −0.0025 at n = 60, corresponding to a mean yield spread of 3.1% per year at
a maturity of 60 months. See column (2). Time dependence declines if we choose smaller
values, and if we use χ0 < 0 (“durability”) it changes sign. To summarize: a ratio habit
has no impact on entropy, but it introduces a second source of time dependence beyond the
dynamics in the consumption growth process.


5.2   Entropy and time dependence with a diﬀerence habit

A second functional form has signiﬁcantly diﬀerent properties. So-called diﬀerence habits
are based on f (ct , xt ) = (ct − xt )ρ /ρ and (again) a law of motion for the habit xt that ties
it to past consumption. Examples include Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Constantinides
(1990), Heaton (1993, 1995), and Sundaresan (1989).

   Campbell and Cochrane (1999) deﬁne the “surplus consumption ratio” st = (ct −xt )/ct =
1 − xt /ct , which takes on values between zero and one. The pricing kernel becomes
                                (            )
                                  ct+1 − xt+1 ρ−1        ρ−1
                    mt+1 = β                       = βgt+1   (st+1 /st )ρ−1 .
                                    c t − xt
As in our other examples, we gain an extra term relative to additive power utility.

    The challenge lies in transforming this into something tractable. One approach is to use
a loglinear approximation. Deﬁne zt = log xt − log ct so that st = 1 − ezt . If zt is stationary
with mean z = log x − log c, then a linear approximation of log st around z is

         log st = constant − [(1 − s)/s]zt = constant − [(1 − s)/s] log(xt /ct ).

Here s = 1 − x/c = 1 − ez is the surplus ratio corresponding to z. The pricing kernel
becomes

        log mt+1 = log β + (ρ − 1)(1/s) log gt+1 − (ρ − 1)[(1 − s)/s] log(xt+1 /xt ).

                                               18
Campbell (1999, Section 5.1) has a similar analysis. This pricing kernel diﬀers in a couple
ways from the ratio habit case, equation (28). The ﬁrst diﬀerence is the coeﬃcient of log
consumption growth, which now includes a magniﬁcation factor (1/s). If the habit is zero,
then s = 1 and there’s no change. But if s < 1, the habit increases the sensitivity of
marginal utility to changes in consumption. In this respect the habit works like an increase
in |ρ − 1|. The second diﬀerence is the impact of the habit. The coeﬃcient of log(xt+1 /xt )
changes from −ρ in the ratio case to (1 − ρ)(1 − s)/s.

   Using the same moving average representations for consumption growth (16) and the
habit (29), the pricing kernel becomes

    log mt+1 = log β + (ρ − 1) log g + (ρ − 1)(1/s)[1 − (1 − s)χ(B)B]γ(B)v 1/2 wt+1 .

As with ratio habits, the pricing kernel reﬂects a combination of consumption and habit
dynamics. We get a sense of the impact from a numerical example. Column (3) of Table
3 uses s = 1/2, but is otherwise the same as the ratio habit example reported in column
(2), including iid consumption growth. Entropy rises from 0.0026 to 0.0104 through the
magniﬁcation eﬀect noted above. Time dependence also increases sharply. Looking at
the two components, we see that entropy and time dependence are governed by diﬀerent
features of the habit: entropy is driven by the average habit (through s = 1 − x/c), while
time dependence is governed by the volatility (the magnitude of the χj s).

    The loglinear approximation highlights a familiar tension between entropy and time
dependence: to generate enough of the former we end up with too much of the latter. To
resolve this tension, Campbell and Cochrane (1999) suggest the nonlinear surplus process

      log st+1 − log st = (φs − 1)(log st − log s) + λ(log st )v 1/2 wt+1
                                 (                     )1/2
                             −1/2 (1 − ρ)(1 − φs ) − b
          1 + λ(log st ) = v                                (1 − 2[log st − log s])1/2 .
                                        (1 − ρ)2

The pricing kernel is

            log mt+1 = log β + (ρ − 1) log gt+1 + (ρ − 1) log(st+1 /st )
                        = log β − (ρ − 1) log g + (ρ − 1)(φs − 1)(log st − log s)
                           + (ρ − 1) [1 + λ(log st )] v 1/2 wt+1 .

As in the previous model, dynamics in the pricing kernel follow from those of the habit,
in this case through the surplus. The diﬀerence here is that the conditional variance also
depends on the habit.

   The properties of the pricing kernel follow immediately. Conditional entropy is

                 Lt (mt+1 ) = (ρ − 1)2 [1 + λ(log st )]2
                             = [(1 − ρ)(1 − φs ) − b/2] + b(log st − log s).


                                               19
Entropy is therefore
                         ELt (mt+1 ) = [(1 − ρ)(1 − φs ) − b/2].
Campbell and Cochrane (1999) use b = 0, so entropy is governed by the curvature parameter
ρ and the autoregressive parameter φs of the surplus. With their suggested values of ρ = −1
and φs = 0.9885 = 0.871/12 , entropy is 0.0231, far more than we get with additive power
utility and ρ = −9. See columns (1) and (4) of Table 3.


5.3   Discussion

The impact of habits depends, clearly, on their form. With ratio habits, the sole impact is
on time dependence: there is no additional contribution to entropy. With diﬀerence habits,
there is an impact on both entropy and time dependence. In both cases, time dependence
is larger in absolute value than the bound we estimated earlier.

   The Campbell-Cochrane model reduces time dependence by giving the state variable
oﬀsetting eﬀects on the conditional mean and variance of the pricing kernel. In its original
form, time dependence is zero by construction. In later applications by Verdelhan (2010)
and Wachter (2006), the model is parameterized to generate realistic bond yields, hence
time dependence. The interaction between the mean and variance is a useful device that
we think is worth exploring in other models, including those with recursive preferences.


6     Pricing kernels with jumps and disasters

The examples so far are based on normal innovations, yet the evidence is overwhelming that
monthly log returns on common assets are not normal. See Table 1, for example. If that’s
true of the high-return asset, then the log pricing kernel must be nonnormal as well. We
therefore consider a third class of models, in which departures from normality contribute
to entropy and time dependence.

    The standard mechanism in ﬁnance for generating nonnormal innovations is to introduce
a “jump” component. The word jump is used here to mean an innovation with a distribution
other than normal, but the connection to jump processes should be clear shortly. Prominent
examples of jumps in the macro-ﬁnance literature include Barro (2006), Barro, Nakamura,
Steinsson, and Ursua (2009), Bekaert and Engstrom (2010), Benzoni, Collin-Dufresne, and
Goldstein (2011), Branger, Rodrigues, and Schlag (2011), Drechsler and Yaron (2011), Er-
aker and Shaliastovich (2008), Gabaix (2010), Garcia, Luger, and Renault (2003), Longstaﬀ
and Piazzesi (2004), and Wachter (2008).

    We illustrate the potential impact of jumps on entropy and time dependence with a series
of examples. We start by adding jumps to iid environments with additive power utility, then
go on to explore the interaction of persistent jump risk and recursive preferences.

                                            20
6.1   Entropy and time dependence with iid jump risk

Our starting point is a jump component in log consumption growth. Let log consumption
growth be iid, the sum of a normal component wgt and a jump component zgt :
                                     log gt = wgt + zgt .                              (30)
The normal component has arbitrary mean and variance: wgt ∼ N (µ, v). The jump com-
ponent is a Poisson mixture of normals, a speciﬁcation that has been widely used in the
option pricing literature. Its central ingredient is a Poisson random variable j (the number
of jumps) that takes on nonnegative integer values with probabilities p(j) = e−h hj /j!. The
parameter h ≥ 0 (the “jump intensity”) is the mean of j. Each jump triggers a draw from
a normal distribution with mean θ and variance δ 2 . Conditional on the number of jumps j,
the component is normal:
                          zgt |j ∼ N (jθ, jδ 2 ) for j = 0, 1, 2, . . . .              (31)
If h is small, the jump component is well approximated by a Bernoulli mixture of normals:
there is at most one jump per period and it occurs with probability h. If h is large there
can be a signiﬁcant probability of multiple jumps.

   With additive power utility, the pricing kernel is
                           log mt = log β + (ρ − 1)(wgt + zt ).
Its entropy is
                                      {              2 2
                                                                           }
           Lt (mt+1 ) = (ρ − 1)2 v/2 + [e(ρ−1)θ+(ρ−1) δ /2 − 1] − (ρ − 1)θ) h.

The ﬁrst term represents the normal component, the second the jump component. Time
dependence is, of course, zero, because the pricing kernel is iid.

   Even with additive power utility, the impact of jumps rises sharply with 1 − ρ. The
expansion (3) shows how high-order cumulants contribute to entropy. With power utility,
the cumulants of log mt+1 are closely tied to those of log consumption growth:
                          κj (log mt+1 ) = (ρ − 1)j κj (log gt+1 ).
In words, the jth cumulant of the pricing kernel is the same cumulant of log consumption
growth multiplied by (ρ − 1)j , which can be large for ρ < 0 and j > 1. As a result, a
small jump component in consumption growth can make a large contribution to the pricing
kernel.

    We report numerical examples in Table 4. In each one, we hold the mean and variance of
log consumption growth constant and equal to the same values we’ve used in other examples.
With this structure, they are
                                 E(log gt ) = µ + hθ
                              Var (log gt ) = v + h(θ2 + δ 2 ).

                                                21
In column (1), there is no jump component: we’re simply reproducing column (1) of Table
3 with lower risk aversion. We introduce a jump component in column (2). The parameter
values are taken from Backus, Chernov, and Martin (2011, Section III) and are similar to
those suggested by Barro, Nakamura, Steinsson, and Ursua (2009). We see that entropy
rises sharply. The point is a general one: increasing the probability of adverse outcomes
relative to the normal distribution increases entropy, even when we hold constant the mean
and variance of log consumption growth.


6.2   Entropy and time dependence with persistent jump risk

We can get further magniﬁcation of entropy if we make jumps persistent and apply recursive
preferences. The following example is similar to Wachter’s (2008).

   There are a number of ways to introduce dynamics into this model. We use one here:
we make the jump intensity ht stochastic. Let consumption growth be

                                      log gt = wgt + zgt
                                          ht = h + η(B)wht ,

where (wgt , zgt ) are shocks of the same form as the previous section and wht is an inde-
pendent iid N (0, 1) series. The only change is in the dynamics of jump risk ht , which are
controlled by η(B). If η(B) = 0, ht is constant and we are back to the model of the previous
subsection. Otherwise η(B) governs the persistence of jump risk.

   With this process and recursive preferences, the pricing kernel is
                                                                                         2 /2
log mt+1 = log β + (ρ − 1) log g − (α − ρ)(α/2)(v + η02 ) − (α − ρ)[(eαθ+(αδ)                   − 1)/α]h
               + (α − 1)(v   1/2
                                   wgt+1 + zgt+1 )
                                       2 /2
               + (α − ρ)[(eαθ+(αδ)            − 1)/α][b1 η(b1 )wht+1 − η(B)wht ].

See Appendix A.6. Note the similarity of the last term to that of equation (26). Persistent
jump risk and stochastic volatility are diﬀerent mechanisms, but they have a similar impact
on the pricing kernel with recursive preferences. Neither appears in the pricing kernel with
additive power utility (α − ρ = 0).

   From the pricing kernel we see that conditional entropy is
                                        {              2 2
                                                                        }
         Lt (mt+1 ) = (α − 1)2 v/2 + [e(α−1)θ+(α−1) δ /2 − 1] − (α − 1)θ ht
                                                      2 /2
                          + (α − ρ)2 [(eαθ+(αδ)              − 1)/α]2 [b1 η(b1 )]2 /2.

Multiperiod entropy and time dependence are reported in Appendix A.8. For entropy
(mean conditional entropy), we simply replace ht with its mean h. Relative to the previous


                                                     22
example, we have one additional term — the last one — which reﬂects a combination of
recursive preferences [(α − ρ)] and dynamics in the intensity of jump risk [η(b1 )].

    We report the features of a numerical example in column (3) of Table 4. Here the jump
intensity is AR(1): ηj+1 = φh ηj for j ≥ 0. We adapt parameter values for (φh , η0 ) from
Wachter (2008); see Appendix A.9. The results are striking. Entropy rises above 0.5 even
with risk aversion of 1−α = 5. We think these jump parameters are somewhat extreme, but
they make the point that jumps and disasters can increase entropy enormously. Moreover,
they do it without adding much to time dependence. As we saw with stochastic volatility,
and for the same reason, there is negative time dependence, but the magnitude is close to
zero.


6.3   Discussion

Jumps and disasters can generate enormous amounts of entropy without generating much
in the way of time dependence. It’s not hard to imagine that jumps could play a useful
role, then, in accounting not only for entropy and time dependence, but for the skewness
and excess kurtosis evident in asset returns.

    These examples barely scratch the surface, as our earlier list of related work makes clear.
In the class of models with recursive preferences, we can add dynamics to both components
of consumption growth, stochastic volatility, and jump intensity, and jumps can be added to
volatility as well as consumption growth. Jumps can also be added to models with habits,
as Bekaert and Engstrom (2010) show. With such a wide range of possibilities, it will take
some time to sort out which ones are most useful.



7     Final thoughts

We’ve shown that an asset pricing model, represented here by its pricing kernel, must have
two properties to be consistent with the evidence on asset returns. The ﬁrst is entropy, a
measure of the pricing kernel’s dispersion. Entropy must be at least as large as the largest
mean excess return, which is likely well above the equity premium. The second property is
time dependence, a measure of the pricing kernel’s dynamics. Time dependence must be
small enough to account for the relatively small premiums we observe on long bonds.

   The challenge is to accomplish both at once: to generate enough entropy but not too
much time dependence. Representative agent models with recursive preferences and habits
use dynamics to increase entropy, but as a result they often increase time dependence as
well. Figure 8 is a summary of how a number of representative agent models do along
these two dimensions. The top panel reports entropy, which should be above the estimated
lower bound marked by the dotted line. The bottom panel reports time dependence, which

                                              23
should lie between the bounds also noted by dotted lines. All of these numbers depend
on parameter values and are therefore subject to change, but they provide targets for the
future evolution of these models. We’ve suggested a number of directions this evolution
might take.

A.1    Premiums in forward rates and bond returns

We connect term premiums reﬂected in bond yields, returns, and forward rates. We start
with the latter; the others follow from their deﬁnitions.

Let qtn be the price at date t of an n-period zero-coupon bond. Yields y and forward rates
f are deﬁned from prices by
                         − log qtn = nytn = ft0 + ft1 + · · · + ftn−1 .
The deﬁnition of forward rates implies ftn = log(qtn /qtn+1 ). One-period returns are rt+1
                                                                                       n   =
 n−1 n                            1      1    0
qt+1 /qt . The short rate is log rt+1 = yt = ft .

We deﬁne (forward) term premiums tp by
                                       ftn = Et ft+n
                                                 0
                                                     + tp nt .
(Aﬁcionados will see the expectations hypothesis lurking here.) We deﬁne bond premiums
from (log) excess returns:
                                 bp nt = Et (log rt+1
                                                  n
                                                      − log rt+1
                                                             1
                                                                 ).
The question is how the two are related.

The answer follows from the deﬁnitions. The excess return on an (n + 1)-period bond is
                        n
                   log rt+1 − log rt+1
                                   1
                                       = (ft1 − ft+1
                                                 0
                                                     ) + ... + (ftn − ft+1
                                                                       n−1
                                                                           ).
The typical term is
                      ftj − ft+1
                             j−1        0
                                 = (Et ft+j − Et+1 ft+j
                                                    0
                                                        ) + tp jt − tp t+1
                                                                       j−1
                                                                           .
That is, you get innovations in forward rates and changes in term premiums. Since the
former have (conditional) mean zero by construction, only the latter show up in bond risk
premiums:
      bp n+1
         t   = Et (tp 1t+1 − tp 0t ) + Et (tp 2t+1 − tp 1t ) + ... + Et (tp nt+1 − tp n−1
                                                                                      t   )
               = Et (tp 1t+1 − tp 1t ) + Et (tp 2t+1 − tp 2t ) + ... + Et (tp t+1
                                                                              n−1
                                                                                  − tp n−1
                                                                                       t   ) + tp nt .
In short, bond premiums are functions of term premiums. In stationary ergodic settings,
the unconditional means have a more simple form: E(bp n+1 ) = E(tp n ).

Yield premiums ∑ also follow from term premiums. Note that yields are averages of forward
        n
rates: yt = n −1   n    j−1
                   j=1 ft   . The yield spread is therefore

                                                ∑[
                                                n−1                          ]
                          ytn − yt1 = n−1                  0
                                                      Et (ft+j − ft0 ) + tpjt .
                                                j=0


                                                    25
A natural deﬁnition of the yield premium is the last term,

                                                   ∑
                                                   n−1
                                    yp nt = n−1          tp jt ,
                                                   j=0

a simple average
              ∑n−1of term premiums. In stationary settings, the mean has the same form:
     n
E(yp ) = n −1            j
                 j=0 E(tp ).

Many models have the property that long terms premiums are constant:

                                      lim tp nt = tp∞ .
                                      n→∞

If the limit exists, bond premiums and yield premiums converge to the same value.


A.2    Entropy and Hansen-Jagannathan bounds

The entropy and Hansen-Jagannathan bounds play similar roles, but the bounds and the
maximum returns they imply are diﬀerent. We describe them both, show how they dif-
fer, and illustrate their diﬀerences further with an extension to multiple periods and an
application to lognormal returns.

Bounds and returns. The HJ bound deﬁnes a high-return asset as one whose return rt+1
maximizes the Sharpe ratio: given a pricing kernel mt+1 , its excess return xt+1 = rt+1 −
 1
rt+1 maximizes SR t = Et (xt+1 )/Var t (xt+1 )1/2 subject to the pricing relation (1). The
maximization leads to the bound,

               SR t = Et (xt+1 )/Var t (xt+1 )1/2 ≤ Var t (mt+1 )1/2 /Et mt+1 ,

and the return that hits the bound,

                                                                   Var t (xt+1 )1/2
                  xt+1 = Et (xt+1 ) + [Et (mt+1 ) − mt+1 ] ·
                                                                   Var t (mt+1 )1/2
                                 1
                  rt+1 = xt+1 + rt+1 .

There is one degree of indeterminacy in xt+1 : if xt+1 is a solution, then so is λxt+1 for λ > 0
(the Sharpe ratio is invariant to leverage). If we use the normalization Var t (xt+1 ) = 1, the
return becomes

                                1 + Var t (mt+1 )1/2 Et (mt+1 ) − mt+1
                     rt+1 =                         +                  ,
                                    Et (mt+1 )        Var t (mt+1 )1/2

which connects it directly to the pricing kernel. The ﬁrst term is a constant: the mean
excess return. The second shows that the return is a decreasing linear function of the
pricing kernel.

                                              26
Bryan Routledge suggested a similar approach to the entropy bound. The bound deﬁnes a
high-return asset as one whose return rt+1 maximizes Et (log rt+1 − log rt+1
                                                                         1 ) subject to the

pricing relation (1). The maximization leads to the return

                    rt+1 = −1/mt+1         ⇔        log rt+1 = − log mt+1 .

Its mean log excess return Et (log rt+1 − log rt+1
                                               1 ) hits the entropy bound (6).


It’s clear the returns that attain the HJ and entropy bounds are diﬀerent: the former is
linear in the pricing kernel, the latter loglinear. They represent solutions to two diﬀerent
problems.

Entropy and maximum Sharpe ratios over diﬀerent time horizons. We ﬁnd it helpful in
comparing the two bounds to express each in terms of the (conditional) cumulant-generating
function of the log pricing kernel. The approach was suggested by Ian Martin and is
summarized in Backus, Chernov, and Martin (2011, Appendix A.2). Suppose log mt+1 has
conditional cumulant-generating function and associated power series expansion
                                     (            )   ∞
                                                      ∑
                      kt (s) = log Et es log mt+1   =   κjt sj /j!.
                                                              j=1

Entropy is then
                                                             ∞
                                                             ∑
                         Lt (mt+1 ) = kt (1) − κ1t =               κjt /j!.
                                                             j=2

In the lognormal case, only the variance is nonzero: Lt (mt+1 ) = κ2t /2. The maximum
Sharpe ratio follows from the mean and variance of mt+1 , which depends on the cumulants
of log mt+1 of all order:

                   Et mt+1 = ekt (1)
               Var t (mt+1 ) = Et (m2t+1 ) − (Et mt+1 )2 = ekt (2) − e2kt (1) .

The maximum squared Sharpe ratio is therefore

                       Var t (mt+1 )/Et (mt+1 )2 = ekt (2)−2kt (1) − 1.

The exponent has the expansion
                                                ∞
                                                ∑
                          kt (2) − 2kt (1) =           κjt (2j − 2)/j!,
                                                j=1

a complicated combination of cumulants. In the lognormal case, cumulants above order two
are zero and kt (2) − 2kt (1) = κ2t .

We can get a sense of how entropy and the Sharpe ratio vary with the time horizon by
looking at the iid case. We drop the subscript t from k (there’s no conditioning) and add a

                                               27
superscript n denoting the time horizon. In the iid case, the n-period cumulant-generating
function is n times the one-period function:

                                            k n (s) = nk 1 (s).

The same is true of cumulants. As a result, entropy is proportional to n:
                                               [          ]
                             L(mt,t+n ) = n k 1 (1) − κ1 .

This is just the zero time dependence result we saw earlier for the iid case. The time horizon
n is an integer in our environment, but if the distribution is inﬁnitely divisible we can extend
it to any positive real number.

The maximum Sharpe ratio also varies with the time horizon. We can adapt our earlier
result:
                                                      n (2)−2k n (1)                1 (2)−2k 1 (1)]
          Var (mt,t+n )/E(mt,t+n )2 = ek                               − 1 = en[k                     − 1.

For small time intervals n, this is approximately
                                 1 (2)−2k 1 (1)]
                          en[k                     − 1 ≈ n[k 1 (2) − 2k 1 (1)],

which is also proportional to n. In general, however, the squared Sharpe ratio increases
exponentially with n.

Excess returns and Sharpe ratios in lognormal settings. It’s common to report the mean,
standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio for data and models. We show how this works if
returns are lognormal.
                                                          j                1 + κj , κj ). Our
Suppose asset j’s return is conditionally lognormal: log rt+1 |t ∼ N (log rt+1  1t 2t
analysis focuses on the mean log excess return:
                                           j
                                  Et (log rt+1 − log rt+1
                                                      1
                                                          ) = κj1t .
                                                                                    j
That’s it. Most asset pricing research focuses on the simple excess return: xt+1 = rt+1 −rt+1
                                                                                          1 .

Here we see that the Sharpe ratio reﬂects both moments of the log return. The mean and
variance of the excess return are
                                              ( j j              )
                                          1
                          Et (xt+1 ) = rt+1     eκ1t +κ2t /2 − 1
                                         (        j    j
                                                             )2 ( j      )
                       Var t (xt+1 ) =      1
                                           rt+1 eκ1t +κ2t /2     eκ2t − 1 .

The conditional Sharpe ratio is therefore
                                                                        j   j
                                   Et (xt+1 )                       eκ1t +κ2t /2 − 1
                   SR t =                         =                       ( j        )1/2 .
                                 Var t (xt+1 )1/2               j    j
                                                              eκ1t +κ2t /2 eκ2t − 1

                                                        28
Evidently there are two ways to generate a large Sharpe ratio. The ﬁrst is to have a large
mean log return: a large value of κj1t . The second is to have a small variance: as κj2t
approaches zero, so does the denominator. If we go beyond lognormal, other cumulants
enter, too.

Comparisons of Sharpe ratios thus reﬂect both the mean and variance of the log return —
and possibly higher-order cumulants as well. Binsbergen, Brandt, and Koijen (2010) and
Duﬀee (2010) are interesting examples. They show that Sharpe ratios for dividends and
bonds, respectively, decline with maturity. In the former, this reﬂects a decline in the mean,
in the latter, an increase in the variance.


A.3    Lag polynomials

We use notation and results from Hansen and Sargent (1980, Section 2) and Sargent (1987,
Chapter XI), who supply references to the related mathematical literature. Our primary
building block is the inﬁnite one-sided moving average,
                                        ∞
                                        ∑
                              xt =            aj wt−j = a(B)wt ,
                                        j=0

where {wt } is an iid sequence with zero mean and unit variance. This deﬁnes implicitly the
lag polynomial
                                                     ∞
                                                     ∑
                                     a(B) =                aj B j .
                                                     j=0
                                        ∑
The result is a stationary process if         j   a2j < ∞ (we say the sequence of aj s is square
summable).

In this form, prediction is simple. If the information set at date t includes current and past
values of w, forecasts of future x are
                            ∞
                            ∑                        ∞
                                                     ∑
            Et xt+k = Et          aj wt+k−j =              aj wt+k−j = [a(B)/B k ]+ wt
                            j=0                      j=k

for k ≥ 0. We simply chop oﬀ the terms that involve future values of w. The subscript
“+” applied to the ﬁnal expression is compact notation for the same thing: it means ignore
negative powers of B.

We use the ARMA(1,1) repeatedly:
                                   φ(B)xt = θ(B)v 1/2 wt
with φ(B) = 1 − φ1 B and θ(B) = 1 − θ1 B. Special cases include the AR(1) (set θ1 =
0) and the MA(1) (set φ1 = 0). The inﬁnite moving average representation is xt =
[φ(B)/θ(B)]wt = a(B)wt , whose coeﬃcients include a0 = 1, a1 = φ − θ, and aj =
(φ − θ)φj−1 . We typically choose φ and a1 , leaving θ implicit.

A.4    Bond prices, yields, and returns in the Vasicek model

We report bond prices, entropy, and related objects for the Vasicek model of Section 3. If
the pricing kernel is (11), then (6) implies
                                         ∑
                                         n                  ∞
                                                            ∑
                   log qtn = n log m +         A2j−1 /2 +     (An+j − Aj )wt−j ,
                                         j=1                j=0
              ∑n
where An = j=0 aj . See Backus and Zin (1994, Section 3). Forward rates, yields, and
returns follow from prices (see Appendix A.1):

                   ftn = − log m − A2n /2 − [a(B)/B n ]+ wt
                                           ∑
                                           n                      ∞
                                                                  ∑
                   ytn = − log m − n−1           A2j−1 /2 − n−1         (An+j − Aj )wt−j
                                           j=1                    j=0
                  n
             log rt+1 = − log m − A2n−1 /2 + (An − A0 )wt+1 − [a(B)/B]+ wt .
                1
The short rate rt+1 = 1/qt1 is
                    1
               log rt+1 = yt1 = ft0 = −(log m + A20 /2) − [a(B)/B]+ wt .

Mean excess returns and yield spreads are
                                                      (       )
                             n
                      E(log rt+1 − log rt+1
                                        1
                                            ) =   A20 − A2n−1 /2
                                                      ∑n
                                 E(ytn − yt1 ) = n−1     (A20 − A2j−1 )/2.
                                                          j=1

Multiperiod entropy is
                                                                          ∑
                                                                          n
               Lt (mt,t+n ) = log Et mt,t+n − Et log mt,t+n =                    A2j−1 /2.
                                                                          j=1

Time dependence is therefore
                                                                        ∑
                                                                        n
           T (n) = n−1 ELt (mt,t+n ) − ELt (mt+1 ) = n−1                      (A2j−1 − A20 )/2.
                                                                        j=1

The (unconditional) expectation is unnecessary in this case: conditional entropy is constant.


A.5    The marginal rate of substitution with recursive preferences

Consider a stationary markovian environment based on a state variable st at date t. Denote
transition probabilities by p(st+1 |st ). In this setting, the pricing kernel in a representative

                                                 30
agent model is the marginal rate of substitution between (say) consumption in state st
[c(st ), or ct for short] and consumption in state st+1 [c(st+1 ), or ct+1 for short].

Here’s how that works with the recursive preferences described in Section 4. With this
notation and a ﬁnite set of states, the certainty equivalent (18) might be expressed less
compactly as
                                                                 1/α
                                       ∑
                      µt (Ut+1 ) =        p(st+1 |st )U (st+1 )α  ,
                                           st+1

where U (st+1 ) is continuation utility. With this in hand, we diﬀerentiate (17) and (18):

                              ∂Ut /∂ct = Ut1−ρ (1 − β)ctρ−1
                        ∂Ut /∂µt (Ut+1 ) = Ut1−ρ βµt (Ut+1 )ρ−1
                ∂µt (Ut+1 )/∂U (st+1 ) = µt (Ut+1 )1−α p(st+1 |st )U (st+1 )α−1 .

The marginal rate of substitution between consumption at date t and consumption in state
st+1 is therefore
       ∂Ut /∂c(st+1 )      [∂Ut /∂µt (Ut+1 )][∂µt (Ut+1 )/∂U (st+1 )][∂U (st+1 )/∂c(st+1 )]
                         =
         ∂Ut /∂ct                                       ∂Ut /∂ct
                                          (          )ρ−1 (            )
                                            c(st+1 )        U (st+1 ) α−ρ
                         = p(st+1 |st ) β                                 .
                                               ct           µt (Ut+1 )

Equation (22) is the same with the probability left out and the state left implicit.


A.6    The pricing kernel with recursive preferences

We derive the pricing kernel for a representative agent model with recursive preferences,
consumption growth dynamics, stochastic volatility, and jumps with time-varying intensity.
The models in Sections 4 and 6 are special cases.

We posit a consumption growth process with
                                                        1/2
                              log gt = log g + γ(B)vt−1 wgt + zgt
                                 vt = v + ν(B)wvt
                                 ht = h + η(B)wht .

Here {wgt , wvt , wht } are N (0, 1) and independent of each other and over time. zgt is a jump
component. Conditional on the number of jumps j, zgt is normal: zgt |j ∼ N (jθ, jδ 2 ). The
probability of j ≥ 0 jumps at date t is e−ht−1 hjt−1 /j!. This covers most of the models in
the literature, but we can generalize further by (for example) adding dynamics to the jump
component, jumps to volatility and intensity, or interdependence among the three processes.

                                                  31
Given a value of b1 , we solve the model by using the “Bellman equation” (20) to characterize
the value function and substituting the result into the marginal rate of substitution cum
pricing kernel (22). Our use of value functions mirrors Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2008) and
Hansen and Scheinkman (2009). Our use of lag polynomials mirrors Hansen and Sargent
(1980) and Sargent (1987, Section XI.19).

We use two results about certainty equivalents, evaluations of the power certainty equivalent
function (18). The ﬁrst one applies to normal risks. If wt+1 |t ∼ N (κ1t , κ2t ), then the
certainty equivalent of eawt+1 is µt (eawt+1 ) = (α/2)a2 κ2t . The second applies to Poisson-
normal mixtures like the jump component zgt+1 . The analogous certainty equivalent result
                                2
is µt (eazt+1 ) = ht (eaαθ+(aαδ) /2 − 1)/α.

We ﬁnd the value function by guess and verify:


   • Guess. We guess a value function of the form
                                                     1/2
                    log ut = log u + pg (B)vt−1 wgt + pv (B)wvt + ph (B)wht

     with parameters (u, pg , pv , ph ) to be determined.

   • Compute. We need the certainty equivalent µt (gt+1 ut+1 ) for (20). Given our guess,
     log(gt+1 ut+1 ) is
                                                                     1/2
            log(gt+1 ut+1 ) = log g + log u + [γ(B) + pg (B)]vt wgt+1 + zgt+1
                                + pv (B)wvt+1 + ph (B)wht+1
                                                                                 1/2
                            = log(gu) + [γ(B) + pg (B) − (γ0 + pg0 )]vt wgt+1
                                + [pv (B) − pv0 ]wvt+1 + [ph (B) − ph0 ]wht+1
                                                    1/2
                                + (γ0 + pg0 )vt wgt+1 + zgt+1 + pv0 wvt+1 + ph0 wht+1 .

     Clever subtraction here of the initial coeﬃcients in the lag polynomials eliminates the
     t + 1 terms and leaves the resulting expressions in a convenient form. The last line
     consists of innovations, the others of (conditional) constants. The certainty equivalent
     treats them diﬀerently:

     We skipped the constants v and h in the ﬁrst equation, because we’re going to include
     them in vt and ht below.
     We solve the equations one at a time. The second equation leads to forward-looking
     geometric sums like those in Hansen and Sargent (1980, Section 2) and Sargent (1987,
     Section XI.19). Following their lead, we set L = b1 to get γ0 + pg0 = γ(b1 ). The
     other coeﬃcients of pg (B) are of no concern to us: they don’t show up in the pricing
     kernel. The third equation has a similar structure. Setting B = b1 gives us pv0 =
                                                                                           2
     (α/2)γ(b1 )2 b1 ν(b1 ). In the last equation, setting B = b1 gives us ph0 = [(eαθ+(αδ) /2 −
     1)/α]b1 η(b1 ). Finally, the ﬁrst equation implies
                                            {        [                        ]}
                     log u = (1 − b1 )−1 b0 + b1 log g + (α/2)(p2v0 + p2h0 ) .

     We can substitute for pv0 and ph0 with some loss of simplicity.


Now that we know the value function, we construct the pricing kernel from (22). One
component is
                                               1/2
log(gt+1 ut+1 ) − log µt (gt+1 ut+1 ) = γ(b1 )vt wgt+1 + zgt+1 + pv0 wvt+1 + ph0 wht+1
                                                                                            2 /2
                                        − (α/2)[γ(b1 )2 vt + (p2v0 + p2h0 )] − [(eαθ+(αδ)          − 1)/α]ht ,

a combination of innovations to future utility (the ﬁrst line) and adjustments for risk (the
second). The pricing kernel then becomes

     log mt+1 = log β + (ρ − 1) log g − (α − ρ)(α/2)(p2v0 + p2h0 ) + (α − 1)zgt+1
                                                     1/2                               1/2
                    + [(ρ − 1)γ0 + (α − ρ)γ(b1 )]vt wgt+1 + (ρ − 1)[γ(B)/B]+ vt−1 wgt
                    + (α − ρ)[pv0 wvt+1 − (α/2)γ(b1 )2 vt ]
                                                           2 /2
                    + (α − ρ){ph0 wht+1 − [(eαθ+(αδ)              − 1)/α]ht }.

The examples in Sections 4 and 6 follow from setting various combinations of γ(B), ν(B),
and η(B) equal to zero and rearranging terms.

A.7    Recursive models based on square root processes

We like the simplicity and transparency of linear processes; expressions like ν(b1 ) summarize
clearly and cleanly the impact of volatility dynamics. A less appealing feature is that they
allow the conditional variance vt and intensity ht to be negative. Here we describe and
solve an analogous model based on square-root processes, discrete-time analogs of well-
known continuous-time processes. The analysis parallels Appendix A.6.

Consider the consumption process
                                                       1/2
                        log gt = log g + γ(B)vt−1 wgt + zgt
                                                                         1/2
                            vt = (1 − φv )v + φv vt−1 + σv vt−1 wvt
                                                                         1/2
                            ht = (1 − φh )h + φh ht−1 + σh ht−1 wht .

The innovations (wgt , zgt , wvt , wht ) are described in Appendix A.6. With the exception of
the processes for vt and ht , the model is the same one we saw earlier.

We start with the value function:


   • Guess. We guess a value function of the form
                                                             1/2
                          log ut = log u + pg (B)vt−1 wgt + pv vt + ph ht

      with parameters to be determined.

   • Compute. Since log(gt+1 ut+1 ) is
                                                             1/2
      log(gt+1 ut+1 ) = log(gu) + [γ(B) + pg (B)]vt wgt+1 + zgt+1 + pv vt+1 + ph ht+1
                       = log(gu) + pv (1 − φv )v + ph (1 − φh )h + pv φv vt + ph φh ht
                                                                   1/2
                           + [γ(B) + pg (B) − (γ0 + pg0 )]vt wgt+1
                                            1/2                                 1/2                1/2
                           + (γ0 + pg0 )vt wgt+1 + zgt+1 + pv σv vt wvt+1 + ph σh ht wht+1 ,

      its certainty equivalent is

          log µt (gt+1 ut+1 ) = log(gu) + pv (1 − φv )v + ph (1 − φh )h + pv φv vt + ph φh ht
                                                                               1/2
                                    + [γ(B) + pg (B) − (γ0 + pg0 )]vt wgt+1
                                                                                2 /2
                                    + (α/2)(γ0 + pg0 )2 vt + [(eαθ+(αδ)                − 1)/α]ht
                                                   2                            2
                                    + (α/2)(pv σv ) vt + (α/2)(ph σh ) ht .




                                                  34
• Verify. We substitute the certainty equivalent into (20) and collect similar terms:

        constant :        log u = b0 + b1 [log(gu) + pv (1 − φv )v + ph (1 − φh )h]
                                          [                                  ]
           1/2                                γ(B) + pg (B) − (γ0 + pg0 )
          vt−1 wgt   :    pg (B) = b1
                                                          B
                vt :      pv = b1 [pv φv + (α/2)(γ0 + pg0 )2 + (α/2)(pv σv )2 ]
                                                          2 /2
               ht :       ph = b1 [ph φh + (eαθ+(αδ)             − 1)/α + (α/2)(ph σh )2 ].

  The second equation is the same one we saw in Appendix A.6 and has the same
  solution: γ0 + pg0 = γ(b1 ).
  The third and fourth equations are new. Their quadratic structure is diﬀerent from
  anything we’ve seen so far, but familiar to anyone who has worked with square-root
  processes. The quadratic terms arise because risk to future utility depends on ht and
  vt through their innovations. We solve them using value function iterations: starting
  with zero, we substitute a value into the right side and generate a new value on the
  left. If this converges, we have the solution as the limit of a ﬁnite-horizon problem.
  A more formal approach is to solve the quadratic equations directly and select the
  appropriate root. The third equation implies

                     b1 (α/2)(pv σv )2 − (1 − b1 φv )pv + b1 (α/2)γ(b1 )2 = 0.

  It has two real roots if

                              (1 − b1 φv )2 − (b1 ασv )2 γ(b1 )2 ≥ 0.

  (If not, there’s no solution of the speciﬁed form.) This requires that α and σv not be
  too large in absolute value. Descartes’ rule of signs tells us that both roots have the
  same sign as α. The quadratic formula gives us their values:
                                           [                                   ]1/2
                             (1 − b1 φv ) ± (1 − b1 φv )2 − (b1 ασv )2 γ(b1 )2
                 pv =                                                               .
                                                   b1 ασv2

  Now consider the stability of our value function iterations,

                         pv ← b1 [pv φv + (α/2)γ(b1 )2 + (α/2)(pv σv )2 ].

  The slope of the right-hand side at pv is

                                        b1 φv + b1 ασv2 pv .

  This is positive since αpv > 0 and less than one (locally stable) if

                                   pv < (1 − b1 φv )/(b1 ασv2 ).


                                                35
       The smaller root is therefore the only one that is locally stable. Hansen and Scheinkman
       (2009, Appendix A) make the same argument.
       Similar logic applies to ph . The two roots are
                                       [                                    2
                                                                                    ]1/2
                         (1 − b1 φh ) ± (1 − b1 φh )2 − 2(b1 σh )2 (eαθ+(αδ) /2 − 1)
                 ph =                                                                    .
                                                     b1 ασh2
       Again, the discriminant must be positive. If it is, stability leads us to choose the
       smaller root.
       Finally, the ﬁrst equation implies

                log u = (1 − b1 )−1 {b0 + b1 [log g + pv (1 − φv )v + ph (1 − φh )h], } .

       where pv and ph are understood to be functions of primitive parameters.

Given these value function coeﬃcients, the pricing kernel is

   log mt+1 = log β + (ρ − 1) log g + (α − 1)zgt+1
                                                      1/2                              1/2
                    + [(ρ − 1)γ0 + (α − ρ)γ(b1 )]vt wgt+1 + (ρ − 1)[γ(B)/B]+ vt−1 wgt
                              {                                                }
                                     1/2
                    + (α − ρ) pv σv vt wvt+1 − (α/2)[γ(b1 )2 + (pv σv )2 ]2 vt
                              {                           2
                                                                                        }
                                      1/2
                    + (α − ρ) ph σh ht wht+1 − [(eαθ+(αδ) /2 − 1)/α + (α/2)(ph σh )2 ]ht .

There’s a marked resemblance to the pricing kernel in Appendix A.6, but they’re not, of
course, identical.


A.8     Time dependence with recursive models

We derive time dependence for the model described in Appendix A.6. The results are used
on Sections 4 and 6. The pricing kernel has the form

      log mt+1 = log m + ag (B)(vt /v)1/2 wgt+1 + av (B)wvt+1 + az zgt+1 + ah (B)wht+1
            vt = v + ν(B)wvt
            ht = h + η(B)wht

with {wgt , wvt , zgt , wht } deﬁned above. This diﬀers from the Vasicek model in the roles of
vt in scaling wgt and of the intensity ∑n ht in the jump component zgt .∑For future reference,
we deﬁne the partial sums Axn = j=0 axj for x = g, v, h and Hn = nj=0 ηxj ,

We derive multiperiod entropy from bond prices as described in (8). Suppose bond prices
have the form
                 n
            log qt+1 = γ0n + γgn (B)(vt /v)1/2 wgt+1 + γvn (B)wvt+1 + γhn (B)wht+1 .

                                                 36
(If we had dynamics in zgt , that would be here, too. Be thankful for small mercies.) Then
the pricing relation (6) tells us
                                     log qtn+1 = log Et (mt+1 qt+1
                                                               n
                                                                   ).
The log of the term in brackets is
                n

zgt and the intensity process.


A.9    Parameter values for recursive models

Bansal-Yaron models. Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron (2009, Table I) report parameters for a
monthly model, so we can take them as is. The only change is to approximate their two-
component model of log consumption growth with a univariate model. We use the univariate
model with the same autocovariance function, which is an ARMA(1,1) in this case.

Their model consists of two equations,

                              log gt = log g + xt−1 + σg wgt
                                  xt = φxt−1 + σx wxt ,

with |φ| < 1 and (wg , wx ) independent iid series with zero mean and unit variance. The
autocovariance function is

                             Var (log gt ) = σg2 + σx2 /(1 − φ2 )
                    Cov (log gt , log gt−k ) = φk−1 σx2 /(1 − φ2 ),      k ≥ 1,

which has the form of an ARMA(1,1).

Our model can be expressed as an inﬁnite moving average with coeﬃcients γj satisfying
γj+1 = φγj = φj γ1 for j ≥ 1. The kth autocovariance is
                                                         ∞
                                                         ∑
                            Cov (log gt , log gt−k ) =         γj γj+k
                                                         j=0

for any k ≥ 0. Therefore

                       Var (log gt ) = γ02 + γ12 /(1 − φ2 )
                                             [                       ]
              Cov (log gt , log gt−k ) = φk−1 γ0 γ1 + φγ12 /(1 − φ2 )         k ≥ 1.

Evidently φ plays the same role in each model. We then choose (γ0 , γ1 ) to match the
variance and ﬁrst autocovariance in the ﬁrst model. This involves a quadratic equation in
the ratio γ1 /γ0 . We choose the root associated with an invertible moving average coeﬃcient
for reasons outlined in Sargent (1987, Section XI.15).

Jump models. We adapt the parameters governing the dynamics of the intensity process ht
from Wachter (2008, Table 1). Most of that consists of converting continuous-time objects
to discrete time with a monthly time interval that we represent by τ = 1/12. We use the
same mean value h we used in our iid example: h = 0.01τ . The remaining parameters are

                                              38
connected to hers as follows (our parameters on the left, her parameters and numbers on
the right):

                          φh = e−κτ = e−0.08/12 = 0.9934
                           η0 = 0.0114 · τ 1/2 = 0.0033.

This gives our process the same autocorrelation and variance as hers.

Finding b1 . We’ve described approximate solutions to recursive models given a value of
the approximating constant b1 . See equations (20, 21) and the surrounding discussion. We
compute b1 this way:


  0. Initialize. Set b1 = β.

  1. Solve. Compute the solution to the model, including log µ, the mean value of log µt .

  2. Verify. Substitute log µ into equation (21) and compute a new approximation for b1 .

  3. Check. If the new value of b1 is close to the previous one, stop. Otherwise, return to
     step 1.

Notes. The bars depict moving average coeﬃcients aj of the pricing kernel for two versions
of the Vasicek model (Section 3). For each j, the ﬁrst bar corresponds to the model with
parameters chosen to produce a positive mean yield spread, the second with parameters that
produce a negative yield spread of comparable size. The initial term has been truncated in
both cases to make the others visible.

Notes. Like Figure 1, the four panels describe two versions of the Vasicek model (Section 3).
In each panel, the solid line corresponds to the model with a positive mean yield spread and
the dashed line to one with a negative yield spread. The upper left panel reports the moving
average coeﬃcients we saw earlier. The lower left panel gives us a closer look at the∑jsame
coeﬃcients starting with a1 . The upper right panel reports the partial sums Aj = i=0 ai
that show up in expressions for bond yields, entropy, and time dependence. The lower right
panel reports the corresponding mean yield spreads.

Notes. The lines represent entropy per period and time dependence for three versions of
the Vasicek model based, respectively, on positive, zero, and negative mean yield spreads.
The trio of lines at the top depict entropy per period over diﬀerent time horizons. The
top (dashed) line is derived from the Vasicek model with a negative yield spread, which
corresponds to increasing entropy per period and positive time dependence. The bottom
line is derived from the same model with a negative yield spread, which corresponds to
decreasing entropy per period and negative time dependence. The center line is horizontal;
it implies zero yield spreads and time dependence. The dotted line in the center is an
estimated lower bound for entropy. The lines at the bottom of the ﬁgure are the same
three from the top of the ﬁgure, shifted down to represent time dependence, the diﬀerence
between entropy per period and one-period entropy. The dotted lines around them are
estimates of maximum and minimum time dependence.

Notes. The ﬁgure depicts the moving average coeﬃcients of the pricing kernel for the
Bansal-Yaron model with consumption dynamics and constant volatility (Section 4.2). For
each j, the ﬁrst bar corresponds to moving average coeﬃcients with power utility, the second
with recursive utility (the Bansal-Yaron model). Power utility, in this case, is based on the
same value of ρ as recursive preferences with α set equal to ρ to eliminate the recursive
terms in the pricing kernel. We have reversed the sign to correspond to the convention used
for the Vasicek model (positive initial coeﬃcient). The initial term has been truncated to
make the others visible.

Notes. The lines represent entropy and time dependence for the Bansal-Yaron model with
consumption dynamics and constant volatility (Section 4.2). The solid line at the top is
entropy. The dotted line below it is an estimated lower bound. The upward-sloping line
below that is the model’s time dependence as a function of the time horizon. The last
dotted line is an estimated upper bound on time dependence.

Notes. The ﬁgure depicts the moving average coeﬃcients of the pricing kernel for the Bansal-
Yaron model with consumption dynamics and stochastic volatility (Section 4.3). For each
j, the ﬁrst bar corresponds to the moving average coeﬃcient with power utility, the second
with recursive utility (the Bansal-Yaron model). As in Figure 4, power utility is based on the
same value of ρ as recursive preferences, with α set equal to ρ. We have reversed the signs to
correspond to the convention used for the Vasicek model (positive initial coeﬃcient). The
top panel reports the consumption growth coeﬃcients agj , the bottom panel the volatility
coeﬃcients avj . In the bottom panel, the coeﬃcients are all zero in the power utility case.
In both panels, the initial terms for recursive preferences have been truncated to make the
others visible.
