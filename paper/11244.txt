Deflation and Monetary Policy in Taiwan

                                           ABSTRACT

From 1999 to 2003, Taiwan faced a deflationary situation. The reasons for this deflation can be

attributed to both domestic and global factors. Domestic changes including local political unrest,

tensions with China, outbound investment to China, a weakened financial system, and a deteriorating

government financial situation, provided the backdrop for the economic slowdown and

corresponding deflation. A number of global factors, especially the bursting of the Internet and IT

bubbles in late 2000 and the rise of China’s economy, also heavily influenced both global and

Taiwanese prices. This paper adopts a simplified aggregate demand and aggregate supply model to

derive a deterministic equation of the GDP deflator (PGDP), and then applies quarterly data covering

the period from 1982 to 2003 to estimate the PGDP equation using 2SLS. The empirical results are

used to identify the sources of PGDP deflation in Taiwan. In addition, the phenomenon of price

divergence appears since 2002 where the WPI increased and the CPI decreased. The causes of the

WPI-CPI divergence are also investigated in this paper.

     I.    Foreword

     Ever since the Great Depression of the 1930s drew to a close, inflation has been

one of major headaches for financial and economic decision-makers.        Inflation and

the unemployment rate have been the two major elements that make up the misery

index, while deflation has never seriously been considered a threat.   However, by the

end of the 1990s, Japan, China, and Hong Kong had exhibited a phenomenon of price

decreases for many years running, and the rate of price increases in both European

and American countries had also started to slow down.          The issue of deflation

therefore gradually drew the attention of economists and policy-makers.            The

November 2002 issue of The Economist even went so far as to suggest that deflation

had become a serious threat to the global economy.


     In Taiwan, the GDP deflator has decreased in four out of five years from 1999 to

2003, the exception being 2001. The CPI also declined in each of the years from 2001

to 2003.    In April 2003, Rogoff, an expert associated with the International Monetary

Fund, published a research report in which Taiwan, together with Japan, Hong Kong,

and Germany, were ranked as high-risk countries for deflation.          The core CPI,

published by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the

Executive Yuan in Taiwan , exhibited negative growth in each quarter in 2003.

These findings have made deflation a cause for concern among both scholars and the

media.     Although the Central Bank of China in Taiwan has never admitted that

Taiwan is suffering from a deflation problem, it has tried very hard to promote

domestic economic activity and avoid price decreases.


     Several international research institutions have engaged in research on deflation;

see, for instance Ahearne, et al. (2002) and Rogoff (2003). The Bank of Japan (2001)

also convened a symposium on the issue - “The Role of Monetary Policy under Low

                                           3
Inflation: Deflation Shocks and Policy Responses” - in 2000, where participating

scholars emphasized the importance of monetary policy in guarding against and

dealing with deflation.1


      In Taiwan, however, there have been no government reports on the domestic

deflation issue, probably because the government has denied that the problem exists.

Similarly, very few studies have been performed by domestic scholars.                         Research

reports compiled by the Department of Economic Research of the Central Bank of

China (2002) and the Council for Economic Planning and Development of the

Executive Yuan (2003) have merely tried to explain the causes of and responsive

strategies to deflation in the light of the experiences of other countries.                Wu (2003),

for instance, not only analyzed the reasons why the global price growth had slowed

since 1997, but he also discussed the causes of low prices in Taiwan.                   Huang (2003)

probed long-term, medium-term, and short-term causes that led to the price decreases

in Taiwan and provided policy recommendations.                       However, although Wu and

Huang talked about the causes of Taiwan’s deflation, they simply presented narrative

explanations or arguments, without engaging in any in-depth or detailed analysis.


      In the early part of the year 2004, the CPI in Taiwan reversed its downward trend

and started to rise.     The government and various research institutions in Taiwan also

predicted that the CPI would rise in 2004.                Although the problem of deflation in

Taiwan appears to no longer exist, there are several questions that are worth looking


1
  The theme of the seminar held by the Bank of Japan (2001) was “Monetary Policy under a Low
Inflation Rate,” in which participants mostly emphasized the importance of monetary policy during a
period of deflation. For example, Cargill thought that central banks generally focused more on
policies to control the monetary environment during periods of inflation, while neglecting the
seriousness of the problem of deflation, therefore seldom utilizing monetary policy tools to prevent the
deflation phenomenon. This is considered to be one of the main reasons for the Great Depression of
the 1930s. Cargill thought that Sweden differed from the U.S. in that it laid emphasis on the price level,
paying close attention to deflation. As for Japan, he offered the same suggestion, calling for emphasis
on the importance of monetary policy during a period of deflation. Goodfriend also thought that
monetary policy was the fundamental reason for deflation and economic stagnation.

into.    How serious has the deflation problem in Taiwan really been in the last few

years?     What are the fundamental reasons for the deflation?    How has the Central

Bank in Taiwan responded to deflation?          How effective have the Central Bank’s

policies been?     This paper aims to answer these questions.


        Since deflation is usually accompanied by recession, Section II of this paper

briefly introduces the changes in the political and economic environment in Taiwan

that have taken place in recent years, thereby providing the background for Taiwan’s

unsatisfactory economic performance since 1999.             Section III explains two

phenomena associated with macro-price changes. One is deflation, and the other is

price divergence.      Price divergence refers to the phenomenon that the three

macro-price indices, i.e. the CPI, WPI and GDP deflator (PGDP), have been moving

in different directions.    In this section, major global factors that have affected

Taiwan’s prices are emphasized, and the causes of the WPI-CPI divergence are also

investigated. Section IV sets up a simplified AD-AS model that is used to estimate

the deterministic equation for Taiwan’s PGDP, and uses the empirical results to

explain why the PGDP has fallen since 1999. Section V explains how Taiwan’s

Central Bank operates its monetary and exchange-rate policies, and then discusses its

policy responses to deflation, while also carefully reviewing their effectiveness.   The

final section presents the conclusions.




                                            5
II.   The Political and Economic Environment in Recent Years

      Taiwan’s economic growth used to be regarded by foreign scholars and

decision-makers as a “miracle” or taken as a “model” for developing countries to

study or follow.   Due to its sound economic fundamentals, quick policy responses,

and other reasons as mentioned in Shea and Shih (1999), Taiwan was also relatively

immune from the attack of the East Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998, performing

better in terms of its economic growth rate, unemployment rate, currency depreciation

and falling stock prices than its East Asian neighbors.


      As Table 1 shows, however, Taiwan’s economic performance since 1999 has

never returned to the illustrious growth of the past three to four decades.          The

economic growth rate has yet to again exceed 6%, and even recorded its first negative

growth rate of -2.18% in 2001 in Taiwan’s post-war history. The unemployment rate

has also climbed steadily and remained at a level of around 5% in 2003.          Although

the stock price index and the total stock trading volume recovered a little in 2000,

they have both decreased in other years. The New Taiwan dollar (hereafter the NT

dollar) has also remained weak relative to the U.S. dollar during this period.


      There have been several factors that have served to bring about Taiwan’s

unsatisfactory economic performance since 1999.           The poor performance in 2001

can be partly explained by a gloomy world economy caused by the bursting of the

Internet and IT bubbles in late 2000 and the 911 terrorist attacks in 2001. The SARS

epidemic also hampered Taiwan’s economic growth in 2003.            In addition to these

two well-known factors, the deterioration in the political and economic environment

in Taiwan is also a fundamental reason.


      Since the early 1990s, the ruling power in Taiwan has gradually shifted from

                                           6
those who migrated from mainland China to Taiwan in the late 1940s together with

the KMT (Kuomintang) government, to the so-called “native Taiwanese.”           During

the process of this power transition, an ongoing confrontation between the two camps

has never been resolved.     Although a significant proportion of the people in Taiwan

would like to maintain Taiwan’s status quo, there is major division among the people

on the issue of whether Taiwan should pursue independence from China or be unified

with China at some point in the future. Constant friction between the two camps as

well as disputes between them in major elections, which Taiwan has held almost

annually in recent years, have caused Taiwan to degenerate into a society that lacks

any consensus or harmonization.      The switch in the ruling party from the KMT to the

DPP (Democratic Progressive Party) for the first time in 2000 has only further

complicated the situation.    KMT and DPP legislators have since then fought tooth

and nail almost irrationally on any issue in the Legislative Yuan (the law-making body

in Taiwan). The result is a semi-paralyzed government without much determination

or executive power.     This phenomenon of political unrest is certainly a negative

factor in relation to private investment.


     The rise of China’s economy has also affected Taiwan’s own economy in many

ways.   China’s cheap labor and land have provided Taiwan’s fading labor-intensive

industries with an opportunity to revitalize themselves.   A big China market has also

been attractive to capital- and technology-intensive product manufacturers.

Therefore, huge numbers of business people flooded into China to invest in the 1990s.

This massive investment in China gave rise to concerns over whether Taiwan’s

economy would be “hollowed out.”        This hollowing-out concern plus the bad feeling

regarding China on its political stance of constantly repressing Taiwan in international

affairs finally led former President Teng-Hui Lee to adopt a “no hurry, be patient”


                                            7
policy to guide economic relations with China.    However, due to the huge potential

profits from investing in China and the advantage of sharing the same language and

culture enjoyed by Taiwan businessmen in competing with investors from other

countries, this “no hurry, be patient” policy did not effectively counter the huge-flow

of westward-bound investment from Taiwan to China.


     After the opposition DPP candidate won the presidential election in 2000, the

DPP’s stance of leaning toward Taiwan’s independence from China has enhanced

China’s hostility toward Taiwan. No official dialogue between the two sides of the

Taiwan Strait has ever been resumed.      China has even strengthened its threat of

military reprisals against Taiwan. A large number of the DPP’s loyal supporters also

oppose any closer economic ties with China. Tension with China of this sort has not

only put an end to the potential role that Taiwan can play as a medium or bridge for

foreign investors entering the China market, but it has also discouraged private and

direct foreign investment in Taiwan.

       The financial sector in Taiwan has also encountered a number of problems.

Allowing new private banks to be set up in 1991 suddenly increased the number of

domestic commercial banks from 17 in 1991 to 33 in 1993.                                              Some credit

cooperatives and investment and trust companies were also allowed to be converted

into commercial banks in subsequent years.                       Therefore, the total number of domestic

banks, including commercial banks and medium-business banks, increased from 25 in

1991 to 41 in 1993 and to 52 in 1999 – more than double the original number.                                      The

resulting fierce competition among banks led to credit expansion and prosperous

stock and real estate markets in the mid-1990s.



                                                          10
     In the years that followed, although Taiwan remained relatively insulated from

the East Asian financial crisis, the contagion effects of the crisis still caused Taiwan’s

stock and real estate prices to fall and the non-performing loans ratio of its financial

institutions to rise in 1998.   Furthermore, between the end of 1998 and early-1999,

several listed companies and business groups, which had been found guilty of

misconduct in fund management (such as engaging in cross investments in the stocks

of group members, being highly leveraged, borrowing short to invest long, being

involved in stock-price supporting activities, or over-investing in the slackening

housing industry), sank into heavy financial trouble. These so-called “land-mine”

companies or business groups not only adversely affected the financial condition of

the domestic banks, but also accelerated the downturn in stock prices.


     Fierce competition among banks together with the accidents caused by these

“land-mine” companies steadily lowered the return on assets (ROA) and the return on

equity (ROE) of domestic banks, and raised the non-performing loans ratios of

financial institutions during the 1998-2002 period, as Table 1 indicates.            The

willingness and ability of financial institutions to grant loans to the business sector,

especially those invested in China, therefore shrank during this same period.


     All of the above-mentioned factors including political unrest, tensions with

China, out-bound investments attracted by China, and a weakened financial sector,

had a detrimental impact on private and foreign investment in Taiwan.       As shown in

Table 1, the growth of fixed investment on the part of private enterprises slowed down

or even turned negative, while direct investment abroad grew significantly after 1999.


     When faced with a deflationary situation, a government is usually expected to

adopt an expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate the economy.             Unfortunately,

Taiwan’s government has been constrained by its deteriorating financial condition,

                                           11
such that it has not been able to afford to expand public expenditure.   Under China’s

threat of military action, Taiwan has had no room to cut its national defense

expenditure. Moreover, political parties have been competing for votes by writing

checks for welfare programs, cutting tax rates, and by providing tax holidays or tax

exemptions to please the voters. As a result, the tax burden in Taiwan, as Table 1

shows, has fallen year after year to reach a level of 12.2% in 2003, one of the lowest

in the world. The outstanding central government debts as a percentage of GNP

have also been increasing very rapidly from 14.5% in 1999 to 31.3% in 2003.


     Due to such financial constraints, Taiwan’s public expenditure including

government consumption, government investment, and public-enterprise investment

in fact fell during 1999-2003, bringing a negative contribution to economic growth in

this period, as Table 2 shows.     We can also see from this table that the private

sector’s fixed investment in addition contributed little or even negatively to economic

growth, except in the year 2000. Another conclusion we can draw from Table 2 is

that the major driving force behind economic growth on the expenditure side during

the period 1999-2003 was net exports instead of domestic demand.

III. Macro-price Changes in Taiwan

1. Deflation as a New but Short-term Concern

       In April 2003, Taiwan was listed by the IMF as a country that faced a high risk of

deflation, along with Japan, Hong Kong, and Germany.           The IMF calculated the

deflation risk index for 35 countries, and classified the results into four categories as

high-, medium-, low-, and very low-risk countries.     Among the countries categorized

as being high-risk, Japan scored the highest, followed by Hong Kong, Taiwan, and

Germany.2

       Figure 1 depicts the growth rate of Taiwan’s GDP deflator (hereafter PGDP)

from 1961 to 2003.         Except for 1965 when its value was negative (-0.61 %), the

                                            13
PGDP annual growth rates before 1998 were positive. During this period of the

PGDP’s growth, the annual growth rate seldom exceeded 5 percent, except for the two

oil crisis years.    However, there has been an obvious change since 1999.                 That is,

PGDP growth turned negative in most of the subsequent years.                   The annual PGDP

growth rate was -1.42 percent in 1999, -1.73 percent in 2000, 0.57 percent in 2001,

-1.01 percent in 2002, and -2.13 percent in 2003.           The CPI also exhibited a negative

growth rate for three consecutive years in 2001-2003, as Table 1 indicates.               The IMF

and scholars in Taiwan thus worried that Taiwan might have started to experience

deflation.3


     Since 2003, however, the global as well as domestic economic situation has

improved.     Starting with the second half of the year 2003, the global prices of raw

materials like steel, cement, petroleum, coal, wheat, soybeans, butter, and paper pulp

have been surging.       During the first quarter of 2004, the CPI in Taiwan increased by

0.51 percent as compared with the same quarter in 2003.              During that same time, the

core CPI rose by 0.12 percent and the WPI increased by 2.37 percent.                            The

government and various research institutions in Taiwan have each forecast that both

the CPI and WPI will exhibit positive growth rates in 2004. The period of deflation

is therefore generally believed to be over.


2. Global Factors Affecting Taiwan Prices

     Taiwan is a highly open economy.             Since the 1970s, the ratios of exports and

imports to GDP have almost always remained above 40 percent, sometimes even

exceeding 50 percent. The macro economy of Taiwan has thus been deeply affected

by the global economic situation and prices.           For example, during the periods of the

3
  Deflation is defined as a phenomenon where general price levels continue to drop. To facilitate the
analysis, the International Monetary Fund defines deflation as occurring when annual price growth is
negative for two consecutive years. Please see IMF (1999), p. 106.

                                                 14
two oil crises, Taiwan encountered the problem of so-called “imported inflation”.

Macro-price changes in Taiwan in recent years have not only been caused by domestic

factors, but have also been closely related to two factors that have affected global

prices — the bursting of the Internet bubble in 2000 and the rise of China’s economy.


    Excessively    optimistic   expectations   on   the    future   of   the     Internet,

communications, and the IT industries resulted in over-investment and caused stock

prices to soar in the late-1990s. After the economic bubble burst at the end of 2000,

the huge excess capacities of these industries led to their prices dropping. The

bursting of the bubble also caused stock prices to sink and wealth to shrink.

Furthermore, the global economic situation worsened and unemployment rose.            All

of these factors caused world consumption to fall.        In addition, excess capacity

contributed to a pessimistic outlook, so that willingness to invest decreased.

Therefore, the bursting of the Internet and IT bubbles brought about a weakening in

world consumption and investment, which further caused global prices to fall.


    Ever since China accelerated its transition from a controlled economy to a

market economy in 1992, and reinforced its trade and investment relations with the

rest of the world, it has had a significant impact on the global economy.      The rise of

China’s economy has affected global and Taiwanese prices in several ways.


    China has a huge pool of cheap labor. Labor-intensive products produced in

China and exported to the world market have forced the global prices of those

products, mostly final consumer goods, to fall. On the other hand, the rise of China

has caused the prices of China’s major imports, mostly raw materials, agricultural

products, and capital- or technology-intensive goods (regarding which China has a

comparative disadvantage) to rise. China’s rapid economic development has also

raised the purchasing power and hence private consumption of the Chinese people,

                                          15
which has further increased the demand for and the global prices of raw materials and

agricultural products. To prepare for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing and the

2010 Shanghai World Exposition, China has begun large-scale public construction

projects, which have given rise to even higher increases in the global prices of raw

materials such as minerals, cement, and petroleum.4


     In sum, due to the rise of China’s economy, the global prices of China’s exports

(most are manufactured as final consumer goods) are decreasing, while the prices of

China’s imports (mainly upstream raw materials, intermediate, and agricultural

products, and machinery and equipment) are rising.              However, because China enjoys

a huge trade surplus, the price decreases have outweighed the increases.                 Therefore,

global prices are on average falling, which represents deflation.


     China’s renminbi is pegged to the U.S. dollar.             While its balance of payments

has recorded a surplus for years and the U.S. dollar has been depreciating, China has

still not allowed the renminbi to appreciate.         The undervaluation of the renminbi has

not only reinforced China’s export competitiveness, but has also enhanced the

pressure of global deflation.        In the last two years, world leaders and economists

have often charged that China’s cheap exports have interrupted the global price

structure. China’s “so-called” manipulation of the renminbi exchange rate (which is

in fact fixed, just like that of the HK dollar) has become a target of criticism and

discussion.



4
  China consumed approximately 50 percent of the world’s cement, 36 percent of its steel products,
and 30 percent of its coal in 2003. In 2003, China’s demand for steel products amounted to about
38,000,000 tons. In the first quarter of 2004, China imported 10,080,000 tons of steel products worth
US$5.72 billion. The quantity of steel products imported increased by 17.5 percent compared with
the first quarter of 2003, with the total value going up by 28.4 percent. In 2003, China imported
91,120,000 tons of crude oil (representing annual growth of 30 percent). In the first quarter of 2004,
China imported 30,140,000 tons of crude oil worth US$7.15 billion. The volume of crude oil imports
increased by 35.7 percent compared with the first quarter of 2003 and its total value by 41.2 percent.
This shows that unit prices for steel products and crude oil have surged.

3.     Divergence of PGDP, CPI, and WPI

       In recent years, the macro-price indices in Taiwan have exhibited a divergence,

appearing that the PGDP, CPI, and WPI have been moving in different directions.5

As Figure 2 indicates, from 1999 to 2000, the PGDP declined, but the WPI and CPI

rose slightly. In addition, from 2002 to 2003, both the PGDP and CPI declined,

leading to a concern about deflation.                The WPI, however, rose — an obvious price

divergence.

       In fact, price divergence happens all the time in Taiwan.                     As can be seen from

Table 3 and Figure 3, since 1982, price divergence has occurred many times, of which

the most obvious occurred in 1985-1987, 1992, 2000, and 2003.                          For example, from

1985 to 1992, the CPI and PGDP went up, while the WPI went down.

  When there is price divergence, which price index is a proper indicator for inflation or deflation
becomes the issue.

  4.       Causes of WPI-CPI Divergence

           This subsection intends to explain the possible factors that caused a divergence

  between the WPI and CPI during the period extending from the fourth quarter of 2002

  to the third quarter of 2003.                                  During this period, the CPI slowly declined, while the

  WPI rose.


           What the WPI measures is the factory price or wholesale price of three categories


                                                                                       18
of products: domestically-produced and domestically-sold (DPDS) products, imported

goods, and exported goods.      It is a weighted average of the above three categories of

price indices.      Let WPId, PM, and PX represent the price index of DPDS products,

the import price index, and the export price index, respectively.           These three

components enjoy roughly equal weights in the current calculation of the WPI in

Taiwan.


     As Figure 4 shows, the WPId in Taiwan fell during 1998 and 1999, began to rise

slightly in 2000, to be followed by a further slight decline in 2001.    Since then, the

WPId has been rising. The reason why the WPId fell in 2001 was the recession in

Taiwan.    A lack of effective domestic demand caused the WPId to slide.           Since

2003, the economy has slightly recovered. Domestic demand and the WPId are

therefore rising.


     In the case of import prices (PM), because agricultural and industrial raw

materials constitute the largest portion of Taiwan’s imports, followed by capital goods

and consumer goods, PM is mainly affected by the global prices of agricultural and

industrial raw materials as well as capital goods.    It is also influenced by the global

prices of consumer goods, the NT dollar exchange rate, and customs duties.


     Since the 1980s, the effective customs duty rate has decreased, resulting in

decreasing import prices.       Since 2001, however, the NT dollar has depreciated,

pushing up import prices.       Strong Chinese demand for raw materials and capital

goods has caused the global prices of that category of goods to soar, thus raising

Taiwan’s import prices and hence the WPI since the fourth quarter of 2002.


     As for export prices (PX), Taiwan’s exports are mainly composed of industrial

products, the bulk of which are information industry and electrical machinery or


                                            19
electronics products. The former has been affected by the bursting of the Internet

bubble, and the latter by competition from China’s exports in recent years.   The PX

has thus dropped since the second half of 2002.


    Figure 4 summarizes the trend in the WPI and its components since 1998.

During the period from the fourth quarter of 2002 to the third quarter of 2003, the

WPI rose.   Among its components, the wholesale price index for DPDS products

(WPId) rose as well as the import price index (PM), while the export price index (PX)

declined. Therefore, it is evident that the rise in the WPI was mainly caused by a

rise in the prices of DPDS products and imported goods.

     CPI trends have differed from those of the WPI.           From the fourth quarter of

2002 to the third quarter of 2003, the WPI surged, while the CPI fell.          The CPI

measures the retail prices of consumer goods and services. Consumer goods can be

further divided into local consumer goods and imported consumer goods.         Let PGDP

be a proxy measure of the prices of local consumer goods, and PMc and Ps the prices

of imported consumer goods and services, respectively.          The CPI is then roughly a

weighted average of PGDP, PMc, and Ps.             The changes in CPI, PGDP, PMC, and Ps

are presented in Figure 5.   This figure shows that the CPI’s decrease since 2001 was

closely related to the fall in PGDP and Ps.

     Because the fall in the price of services (Ps) is a major factor causing the CPI to

drop, we study the reasons for the decrease in Ps.   The production costs and prices of

services are mainly determined by the wage (W), rent (R), and the interest rate (r).

Figures 6 and 7 indicate that Ps moves closely with rent R and the interest rate r.

The wage has also been relatively stable since 2001.


     Falling rents were mainly caused by factors such as weak domestic demand, the

outward migration of companies and white-collar laborers, and an oversupply of

houses and office buildings.   The decline in the interest rate was due to the central

banks of many countries adopting a low-interest-rate policy to stimulate their

economies during this period, a path that Taiwan also followed. Stable wages were

the result of competition from Chinese labor and an increase in domestic

unemployment.

IV: Analysis of Deflation Based on the GDP Deflator

1.   Theoretical Model of PGDP Determination

     The GDP Deflator (PGDP) measures the price of final domestic products.

According to the aggregate-demand and aggregate-supply (AD-AS) model, any

factors that may cause the AD curve to move to the right (left) will lead PGDP to go

up (down), while it may cause the AS curve to shift to the right (left), leading PGDP

to go down (up).


     The aggregate demand function AD which is derived from the IS-LM analysis

can be presented as follows:
                       -       +    +    +     +   +
     (1)   Y＝AD (PGDP; GEXP, MS, Pf, Yf, EXR,…).


     In this equation, Y is real GDP; GEXP is government real expenditures,

including government consumption expenditures, government investment, and public

enterprise investment; MS is money-supply volume; Pf and Yf represent foreign

prices and the global economic situation, respectively; and EXR is the exchange rate

measuring the value of the U.S. dollar in terms of the NT dollar.   On the right-hand

side of the equation, a positive or negative symbol above each explanatory variable

represents the direction of the impact of that variable on Y. To simplify the analysis,

the AD equation omits certain explanatory variables that cannot be precisely measured

in the empirical study, such as expectations regarding the future economic situation,

or real wealth, etc.


     A general equation of aggregate-supply AS can be presented as follows:
                       +   -   ++
     (2)   Y＝AS (PGDP; W, K, T).


                                          26
       In this equation, W is the nominal wage rate; K is the capital stock; and T is the

    technology level.      Because it is difficult to measure the capital stock K and

    technology level T, and W, K, and T may jointly affect aggregate supply through unit

    output labor cost LC, the aggregate-supply function can be rewritten as
                            +       -
       (3)   Y＝AS* (PGDP; LC).6


       From equations 1 and 3, the PGDP equation can be derived as
                             +          +   +       ++     +
       (4) PGDP＝f (GEXP, MS, EXR, Pf, Yf, LC,…).


       Because increases in the first five explanatory variables on the right-hand side all

cause the AD curve to shift to the right, while a rise in LC causes the AS curve to shift

to the left, six explanatory variables have a positive impact on PGDP.


2.     Empirical Analyses

       The sources of the relevant variables used to conduct an empirical estimation of

    equation 4 are summarized in Table 4.             Because the United States and China are

    Taiwan’s most important export markets, this study adopts the real value of imports

    of the United States (Yfus) and China (Yfc) as representative variables for the global

    economic situation (Yf) that affects Taiwan’s PGDP.                    The data period adopted

    extends from the first quarter of 1982 to the second quarter of 2003.




6
  In theory, it is not difficult to infer that the impact of the wage rate W on unit output labor cost LC is
positive, and the impact of the capital stock K and the technology level T on LC is negative.
Furthermore, because LC affects aggregate supply negatively, Equation 3 implies that the impact of W
on Y is negative, and the impact of K and T on Y is positive, which is consistent with Equation 2.

       In this empirical study, all economic variables are used in logarithmic form.

Since there is much evidence that many macro-variables are non-stationary, this study

first uses Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests to examine the existence of unit roots before

conducting a regression analysis. As the results summarized in Table 5 show, there

exists a unit root for all the variables in logarithmic form, and the first differences of

these variables do not possess unit roots.           In other words, these variables should be

differenced once to obtain stationarity.

  Since the data on China’s import price index are not obtainable, this paper adopts the CPI as a
substitute variable.

       Our PGDP equation is derived from a simplified AD-AS model. Some of the

explanatory variables in the equation, such as MS, LC and EXR, should be

endogenous          variables       in     a    complete        macro-system.           To     circumvent   the

simultaneous-equation bias problem, a two-stage least squares (2SLS) technique is

adopted to estimate the PGDP equation. The last two-period values of the endogenous

variables MS, LC, and EXR are included as instrumental variables in the 2SLS

estimation.8        The results are reported in Table 6.                From Table 6, we can deduce that

variables LGEXP, LMS, LEXR, LYfus, LYfc and LLC all exert a significantly

positive impact on PGDP, while the respective impacts of LPf is are positive, though

not significant.        Regarding the signs of the regression coefficients, they all conform

to the theory.

    We also adopt the OLS technique to verify our model. The results are consistent with those of the

      The 2SLS results therefore show that, for domestic factors, government

expenditures, unit output labor cost, money supply, and the NT exchange rate all have

a significantly positive impact on Taiwan’s PGDP.       It is clear that fiscal, monetary,

and exchange rate policies do matter in affecting PGDP.


     With respect to global factors, China’s economic situation (applying China’s total

real import value) and the U.S. economic situation (applying the total real value of

U.S. imports) have a significantly positive impact on Taiwan’s PGDP, while foreign

prices (adopting global export prices) tend to have a positive impact, although it is not

significant.   It is worth noting that the coefficient of China’s import value is

significant, thus showing the importance of the China factor.


     Based on the regression results, we can identify the sources of PGDP deflation in

Taiwan.    Since 1999, PGDP has been declining except in 2001.         This phenomenon

of a declining PGDP has been caused by several factors.      Figure 8 shows the changes

in the three most significant explanatory variables (GEXP, LC, EXR), together with

that of world export prices Pf. As explained in Section II, mainly due to a finance

constraint, government expenditures decreased during this period.           Furthermore,

improvements in production technology caused unit output labor costs to go down

except in 2001. The bursting of the Internet and IT bubbles and the rise of China’s

economy also depressed world export prices before 2003.            Furthermore, the NT

dollar appreciated relative to the U.S. dollar in 1999 and 2000.     All of these factors

contributed to PGDP’s decline.


     In addition to the explanatory variables incorporated in the model, other factors,

such as the shrinkage of wealth due to the falling stock and real estate prices, political

instability, and increased tensions with China, should also have had a negative impact

on Taiwan’s GDP and PGDP. This study, however, does not include these factors in

the empirical analysis for reasons of simplicity and a lack of appropriate data.

V.    The Central Bank’s Policy Responses to Deflation

      Although the Central Bank in Taiwan (formally the Central Bank of China,

hereafter the CBC) has never admitted that Taiwan has encountered the problem of

deflation, the CBC implemented some measures to stimulate aggregate demand for

Taiwan’s products, in order to promote the economic growth rate as well as counter

the problem of deflation.9        The deterioration in the government’s financial situation

as explained in Section II restricted the government’s ability to adopt an expansionary

fiscal policy to promote the economy.               The CBC’s monetary and exchange rate

policies therefore became the major policy instruments for the government to rely on.


     1.      The Formation of Monetary Policy


      According to the Central Bank Act, the CBC has the obligation to maintain price

as well as exchange rate stability and to assist in economic development.                 To achieve

these final goals, the CBC chooses monetary-aggregate targeting as the basic

framework of its monetary policy, instead of inflation, exchange-rate, or interest-rate

targeting.     Since 1992, the monetary aggregate M2 has been chosen as the

intermediate target of monetary policy to achieve the final goals.


      Before the end of each year, the CBC (often after having consulted with scholars

and experts) sets and publicly announces the target zone of the M2 growth rate for the

subsequent year based on the government’s target figures of the economic growth rate

and inflation rate, as well as other factors influencing the demand for money such as

the opportunity cost of holding money and the diversification of financial assets.

Using a zone, rather than a specific number, as the M2 growth target, the CBC is

endowed with the flexibility to maintain the stability of interest rates, the exchange

9
  When deflation became a public concern in Taiwan in 2002 and 2003, the CBC several times tried to
downplay the issue by pointing out either that the core CPI was still rising or that the falling CPI was
just a temporary phenomenon.

                                                  33
rate, and other major financial indicators in the year.


     The actual M2 growth rate is very carefully observed each month by the CBC.

In order to effectively control M2, the CBC adopts reserve money as the operational

target.    At the beginning of each month, the CBC has a monetary estimation and

forecasting meeting to determine the target value of reserve money for that month.

A reference target for the inter-bank overnight call-loan rate is also derived in the

meeting.     The CBC then applies a variety of operational instruments, including

required    reserves,   discounts   and   accommodations,     open-market    operations,

re-deposits from financial institutions, selective credit management, and moral

suasion, to fine-tune the daily figures of reserve money and the inter-bank overnight

call-loan rate.


     Among these operational instruments, open-market operations are the most

frequently-used instruments.     Re-deposits from financial instruments, selective credit

management, and adjusting the discount and accommodation rates are sometimes

adopted.     The required reserve ratios are adjusted only occasionally for special cases

as a strong monetary policy measure.      For open-market operations, the CBC before

1992 relied on the issuance of savings bonds, treasury bills, and certificates of deposit

(CDs) as tools to manage the liquidity situation in the financial market.      However,

the issuance of savings bonds and treasury bills was terminated in 1992 and 1998,

respectively. In recent years, the CBC has either issued or redeemed CDs almost

every day to affect the liquidity and inter-bank overnight call-loan rate. Since 1999,

the CBC has depended heavily on the issuance of CDs and on receiving re-deposits

from financial institutions in order to sterilize the impact of the accumulation of

foreign exchange reserves on reserve money, such that the CBC’s outstanding CDs

and re-deposits from financial institutions have increased very rapidly.             The

outstanding CDs had even reached NT$2.99 trillion, equivalent to 185% of total


                                            34
reserve money; and re-deposits from financial institutions amounted to NT$2.06

trillion, or 127% of reserve money, as of the end of 2003.10


     2.    Exchange Rate Policy


      The authorities in Taiwan shifted from a fixed exchange rate system to a floating

exchange rate system in July 1978.              The purpose behind introducing a floating

exchange rate was to make Taiwan’s economy less vulnerable to external disturbances.

However, in a highly open economy like Taiwan, the exchange rate is a key factor

affecting its trade balance, economic growth, and domestic price level.                          The

exchange rate is therefore frequently regarded as an important policy instrument to

promote economic growth or stabilize prices. According to the Central Bank Act,

the CBC also has the obligation to stabilize the external value of the NT dollar, i.e. the

exchange rate.      Hence, since the adoption of a floating exchange rate in 1978, the

CBC has frequently intervened in the foreign exchange market in order to affect the

level of the exchange rate or its fluctuations. The final purpose of the CBC is either to

promote exports and economic growth, to stabilize domestic prices, or to stabilize the

exchange rate.      In other words, what is adopted by the CBC is in fact a managed

floating exchange rate.


      The general impression and feeling derived by scholars and experts in Taiwan

from the CBC’s foreign exchange operations may be summed up as follows.                        First,

the CBC has usually adopted a strategy of repressing the NT dollar, aiming to

promote exports. Therefore, the NT dollar has been characterized as being “easy to

depreciate, difficult to appreciate.” Second, when domestic prices face any serious


10
   Re-deposits from financial institutions constitute a very powerful and effective operational
instrument for the CBC to adjust reserve money. The CBC is entitled to receive or return re-deposits
from the postal savings system, three specialized agricultural banks, and other approved banks when
the CBC concludes that the domestic financial situation requires it to do so. To increase (decrease)
reserve money, the CBC can simply return (receive) re-deposits to (from) the financial instiutions.

                                                 35
inflation problem, the CBC is then more willing to allow the NT dollar to appreciate.

Third, when major events such as political unrest, a military threat from China, and

the East Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998 occurred, so that the NT dollar faced

serious pressure to depreciate, the CBC was obliged to defend the exchange rate.


     Since the CBC has kept information on foreign exchange intervention a secret,

the impact of CBC’s intervention on the exchange rate is difficult to estimate.    In a

recent study on the NT dollar exchange rate, Yang and Shea (2005) set up an optimal

intervention model to introduce three variables, representing three purposes of CBC

intervention, into the determination equation of the NT dollar exchange rate, together

with the standard factors affecting the exchange rate, such as the relative price level,

interest-rate gap, and export-competing countries’ exchange rates.       The empirical

estimation results of this paper show that each of the three intervention-purpose

variables played a significant role in the determination of the NT dollar exchange rate.

The model incorporating the intervention-purpose variables performed far better, in

terms of both explanatory power and forecasting power, than the model that excluded

the intervention-purpose variables.      These results clearly indicate that CBC’s

intervention is really a key factor affecting the NT dollar exchange rate, and that

promoting economic growth, stabilizing domestic prices, and stabilizing the exchange

rate are truly the main concerns of the CBC in exchange rate management.


   3.     Counter-Deflation Policies


     By coping with the weakening demand for money caused by the slowdown of

economic growth and the increase of substituting financial assets, the CBC gradually

adjusted downward the target zone of its M2 growth rate during the period from 1999

and 2003, as shown in Figure 9.    This figure also shows that the actual growth rate of

M2 fell most of the time into the target zone, which indicates that the CBC’s


                                          36
management of money supply was, generally speaking, satisfactory during this

period.

     The expansionary monetary policy adopted by the CBC to stimulate domestic

demand was revealed by the policy measures, which were intended to loosen the

monetary environment and to guide the market interest rate in a downward direction.

Between December 2000 and the end of 2003, the CBC lowered both the discount rate

and the rate on accommodations on 15 occasions, as indicated by Table 7.                                              In

2001-2003, the required reserve ratios of the NT dollar deposits and foreign currency

deposits were reduced on one and three occasions, respectively.                                          As a result, the

market interest rates as represented by the inter-bank overnight call-loan rate, 1-year

time deposit rate, and the 31-90 day CP rate in the secondary market all moved

downward in 2001-2003 as Figure 10 shows.

                                                                                                                  Sep-2003

     As for its exchange rate policy, the CBC has been used to keeping the NT dollar

undervalued in ordinary times in order to stimulate Taiwan’s exports and economic

growth, as explained above.                     When faced with a slowdown in economic growth in

the period 2000-2003, the CBC was naturally more eager to intervene in the foreign

exchange market than in any ordinary period by purchasing foreign exchange in the

market to maintain an undervalued NT dollar or to prevent it from appreciating.

Deflation in this period further strengthened the justification for the CBC’s foreign

exchange intervention.                     Without its intervention, the currency’s appreciation would

have caused domestic prices to go down, thereby worsening the deflation problem.

Therefore, the CBC’s foreign exchange intervention during this period was regarded

as a good strategy for “killing two birds with one stone.” That is, an undervalued

NT dollar was believed to be beneficial both in promoting economic growth and in


                                                                 39
combating deflation.


      The CBC intervened heavily in the foreign exchange market to slow down the

appreciation of the NT dollar during the period 2000-2003 when Taiwan enjoyed a

huge balance-of-payments surplus.             The result was a rapid piling up of foreign

exchange reserves and a relatively stable NT dollar exchange rate. The foreign

exchange reserves held by the CBC almost doubled from US$106.7 billion at the end

of the year 2000 to US$206.6 billion at the end of 2003.                  The NT$/US$ exchange

rate even fell from 32.992 to 33.978, a depreciation of 2.90% relative to the U.S.

dollar, during the same period11.


      The by-product of foreign-exchange purchasing by the CBC was a pumping out

of reserve money into the financial market.            To control the growth of M2 within the

target zone, the CBC was obligated to issue CDs and to receive re-deposits from

financial institutions so as to sterilize the impact of foreign exchange intervention on

reserve money.       The CBC’s outstanding CDs hence rapidly increased from NT$562

billion at the end of the year 2000 to NT$2,992 billion at the end of 2003, and

re-deposits from financial institutions nearly doubled from NT$1,148 billion to

NT$2,056 billion over the same three-year period.


      Despite these efforts, the CBC’s effectiveness in curbing deflation and

stimulating economic growth might have been limited for several reasons.                         First,

political unrest and tensions with China had not been eased, and these were major

factors weakening private consumption and domestic investment in Taiwan.                      Second,

in view of its high degree of openness, Taiwan’s economic performance was closely

11
   During the same period from the end of the year 2000 to the end of 2003, the appreciation rates of
the currencies of Taiwan’s major export-competing countries relative to the U.S. dollar were as follows:

      Japan             South Korea           Hong Kong            Singapore             Malaysia
      7.01%               6.04%                 0.51%                1.76%                  0


                                                  40
linked with that of the global economy.   Taiwan could hardly curb deflation based on

her own efforts.     Third, due to the restrictions imposed by a deteriorating

government financial situation, an expansionary fiscal policy could not be

implemented.    By depending on the CBC’s policies alone, the Taiwan economy

could not have improved very much.        However, we may state that CBC’s efforts

might have at least shielded the Taiwan economy from a more serious recession and

deflation in 2000-2003.

VI.    Conclusion

      Taiwan is a small open economy that is characterized by an export-oriented path

of development.     Domestic investment also serves to stimulate the growth of the

economy.    In recent years, following the rising tide of local political unrest, tensions

across the Taiwan Strait, tremendous outward investment to mainland China, and a

global recession, Taiwan has also fallen into the trap of deflation.


      There have been some major changes in the political and economic environment

in Taiwan in recent years.    These changes – including political unrest, tensions with

China, outbound investment to China, a weakened financial system, and a

deteriorating government financial situation – have provided the backdrop for an

economic slowdown and deflation in Taiwan.          Some global factors, especially the

bursting of the Internet and IT bubbles in late 2000 and the rise of China’s economy,

have heavily influenced both global and Taiwanese prices.


      This paper adopts a simplified aggregate demand and aggregate supply (AD-AS)

model, and applies quarterly data for the period from 1982 to 2003 to estimate the

deterministic equation of the GDP deflator using 2SLS.            The empirical results

comply with the theoretical model.      The aggregate-demand factors, both domestic

and foreign, and the aggregate-supply factor represented by the unit output labor cost

mostly have a significant impact on deflation.


      Based on the regression results, the sources of the decline in the GDP deflator

since 1999 are identified.   During this period, government expenditures are observed

to have decreased. In addition, the development of production technology that has

caused the unit output labor cost to fall, the collapse of the bubble economy, the influx

of cheap products from China into the world market, and the NT dollar’s appreciation

                                            42
have all contributed to a lower PGDP.


     In order to fight deflation, the Central Bank adopted several measures to reduce

the extent of price decreases.       It lowered the discount rate and the rate on

accommodations on many occasions, and occasionally reduced the required reserve

ratio to guide the market interest rates in a downward direction.      The Central Bank

also intervened in the foreign exchange market to maintain an undervalued NT dollar,

so as to promote exports and combat deflation at the same time.


     Although the Central Bank tried to help solve the deflation problem, its monetary

policy could not serve as the only remedy.       Various factors still needed to be added

to strengthen the recession situation. Therefore, the expansionary effects of a loose

monetary environment do not seem to be significant. Fortunately, since 2004, the

Taiwan economy is no longer under the threat of deflation.


     During this period of deflation, the price configuration has incurred a change,

where the PGDP has gone down and the CPI has slightly decreased, but the WPI has

gone up.   In fact, this kind of price divergence phenomenon has not only appeared

during the period of deflation, but has appeared repeatedly on several occasions

according to historical data over the years.


     In analyzing the reasons why the WPI and CPI trends have diverged since 2002,

we find that the WPI increase is mainly due to the huge Chinese demand for raw

materials. This has caused the prices of global raw materials and Taiwan’s imports

to rise, which has further caused the WPI to rise.    Another reason is that the domestic

economy has been recovering since 2003.         As for the CPI decrease, this has resulted

from a decrease in the prices of services and PGDP.          A decrease in the prices of

services is related to the decline in rents and the interest rate.    A rise in domestic


                                           43
unemployment and competition from China’s cheap labor has also kept domestic

wages steady.


     This study has used regression analysis to analyze the decline in the PGDP.

However, there are many domestic and foreign factors that affect prices.     This study

is incomplete in that it has left out certain variables, such as wealth, expectations of

the future economic situation, industry outflows, and the impact of political factors.

Further studies could focus on overcoming these shortcomings.
