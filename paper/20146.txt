                                             ABSTRACT

We compare behavior in experiments measuring distributional preferences during the “Great Recession”
to behavior in identical experiments conducted during the preceding economic boom. Subjects are
drawn from a diverse pool of students whose socioeconomic composition is largely held constant by
the university, mitigating concerns about differential selection across macroeconomic conditions. Subjects
exposed to the recession are more selfish and more willing to sacrifice equality to enhance efficiency.
Reproducing recessionary conditions inside the laboratory by confronting subjects with losses has
the same impact on distributional preferences, bolstering the interpretation that economic circumstances,
rather than other factors, are driving our results.

1    Introduction
In their analysis of America’s approach to fighting poverty, Alesina and
Glaeser (2004) observe that the United States first adopted significant re-
distributive policies during the Great Depression, and that the political dis-
course at the time took on a more “European” equality-focused tenor. By
contrast, the recent “Great Recession” has been credited with the rise of both
the Tea Party and the Occupy Wall Street movements, which might suggest
that economic contraction may polarize opinions about redistribution rather
than shifting them in a specific direction.
     Whether these social and political developments are the result of a causal
relationship between macroeconomic shocks and individual support for re-
distribution is an open question, but one that is quite difficult to answer
empirically. Exogenous variation in exposure to economic contraction is
rare and limited in scope, and we cannot conduct large-scale controlled ex-
periments on the US economy. Moreover, many other societal shifts may be
coincident with macroeconomic changes, making it difficult to disentangle
the effects of different factors which govern the willingness to make tradeoffs
between both own and others’ income and between equality and efficiency.
     In this paper, we explore this question by comparing experimentally-
measured distributional preferences under the vastly different economic con-
ditions that prevailed before and during the sharp downturn sparked by the
2008 financial crisis. Our experiments employ the generalized dictator game
first utilized by Andreoni and Miller (2002), and further developed by Fis-
man, Kariv and Markovits (2007), where each subject faces a large and rich
menu of budget sets representing the feasible monetary payoffs to self (the
subject) and an anonymous other subject. Varying the relative prices of
redistributing payoffs between self and other enables us to distinguish in-
dexical selfishness (the relative weight on the payoff for self ) from equality-
efficiency tradeoffs (the concern for increasing total payoffs versus reducing
differences in payoffs), and to examine how these distributional preferences
differ for subjects that participate in the experiment before and after the
onset of the financial crisis.
     To further test whether the recession is likely to have caused the observed
changes in distributional preferences, we simulate economic contraction in-
side the laboratory by confronting subjects with a variant of our modified
dictator game where the budget sets were such that either self or other,
or both, necessarily received a negative payoff relative to their initial en-




                                       2
dowment.1 Our design thus also allows us to compare the changes in dis-
tributional preferences that occurred during the real-world recession to the
effects of an experimental treatment that simulates recessionary conditions
in the laboratory.
    We consider a total of three environments, corresponding to the inter-
action between the experimental treatment and real-world economic condi-
tions:

    • The Gain Boom (GB) environment borrows data from the two-person
      dictator experiment of Fisman et al. (2007), in which the decision
      problems are presented using a graphical interface that allows for the
      collection of a rich individual-level data set. The data were collected
      in 2004, prior to the financial crisis.

    • The Gain Recession (GR) environment was identical to GB envi-
      ronment except for minor design modifications; however, these experi-
      ments were conducted in 2011, when the US economy remained mired
      in the economic downturn that set in during 2008.

    • The Loss Recession (LR) environment was identical to the GR en-
      vironment except that within the experiment either self or other —
      or both — necessarily experienced a loss relative to their endowment.
      These experiments were conducted in 2010 and 2011, in economic con-
      ditions similar, sometimes identical, to those of the GR environment.

    There are four elements to our approach that, we argue, allow us to
credibly relate macroeconomic conditions to individual behavior:
    First, all experiments were conducted at the Experimental Social Science
Laboratory (Xlab) at UC Berkeley. A key benefit of using the Xlab subject
pool is that it is drawn primarily from a large and diverse student body,
the socioeconomic composition of which is held relatively constant by the
admissions office.
    Second, we combine administrative and survey data on postgraduate
activities to show that the economic prospects of UC Berkeley students
were directly affected by the recession. We demonstrate that students faced
higher student-loan debts and weakened job prospects during and after the
recession than in the preceding years.
   1
     This treatment generalizes the framework of List (2007) and Bardsley (2008), expos-
ing both self and other to losses and better reflecting the conditions of scarcity that
were occurring outside the laboratory. List (2007) and Bardsley (2008) show that the
specification of the choice set leads to drastic changes in behavior.


                                           3
     Third, we combine demographic and economic data from student ad-
missions and financial aid with a broad range of survey responses about
the experience of undergraduates at UC Berkeley. Using these data, we
demonstrate that, despite the recession’s impact on students’ financial cir-
cumstances and job prospects, the makeup of the student body, students’
overall social and academic experiences, opinions about student life, and per-
ceptions of campus climate fluctuated very little over the period we study.
     Fourth, the final piece of our analysis involves the Loss treatment that
simulates recessionary conditions in the laboratory. As we describe below,
we find that the impact of this experimental treatment is directionally the
same as that of the real-world recession. This bolsters the view that eco-
nomic conditions, rather than other concurrent social or political changes,
are likely behind the shifts in distributional preferences we observe in reces-
sion versus boom years.
     Following Andreoni and Miller (2002) and Fisman et al. (2007), we es-
timate constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function over the
payouts to self and other, which makes it possible to distinguish indexi-
cal selfishness from equality-efficiency tradeoffs in a particularly convenient
form. The rich data generated by the design allow us to analyze behavior
at the level of the individual subject.
     Our main findings are as follows: subjects in the LR and GR envi-
ronments, who participated in the experiment during the downturn, place
greater emphasis on efficiency versus equality relative to those in the GB
environment, who took part in the experiment during the preceding eco-
nomic boom. Additionally, subjects in the recession environments, LR and
GR, display greater levels of indexical selfishness relative to the subjects in
the GB environment.
     Comparing behavior between the GR and LR environments, we find
that the experimental Loss treatment also increases both selfishness and
efficiency-orientation (though its impact is relatively modest). Thus, over-
all we find that both real-world and lab-simulated recessionary conditions
are associated with comparable shifts in distributional preferences toward
greater selfishness and efficiency focus. These results are robust to the in-
clusion of session-level demographic and socioeconomic controls.
     Ex ante, one might expect that recessionary conditions could either in-
crease or decrease the willingness to sacrifice equality to enhance efficiency.
During a recession, concerns about providing a social safety net might lead
to an increased desire to rein in inequality and guarantee a minimum level
of income for all, even at the expense of total output. Alternatively, con-
ditions of scarcity may make the prospect of leaving money on the table

                                      4
particularly unattractive, leading to an increased focus on efficiency. Our
results suggest that this latter concern dominates. As Saez and Stantcheva
(2013) point out, optimal taxation depends on the distributional preferences
of taxpayers. Our results highlight the potentially complex interrelationship
between the business cycle and the distributional preferences of voters.
    To the best of our knowledge, there is only a small body of work on the
impact of economic conditions on distributional preferences. Using surveys
fielded between 2007 and 2011, Margalit (2013) studies how respondents’ at-
titudes toward redistributive policies change in response to economic shocks:
a drop in household income, a (subjective) decrease in employment security,
and the actual loss of a job all increase support for government welfare
programs. By contrast, Kuziemko (in progress) finds lower support for gov-
ernment redistribution during recessions, based on responses to the General
Social Survey. By studying the willingness to make real tradeoffs between
equality and efficiency in a controlled environment, our experimental de-
sign partially addresses the problems of interpretation that hamper such
survey-based research.2
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the
structure of the decision experiments and the interactions between exper-
imental treatments and external economic conditions. Section 3 describes
the subject pool and addresses a number of concerns regarding identifica-
tion. Section 4 provides the empirical analysis and results, and Section 5
concludes by discussing the results and relating them to the broader litera-
ture. The paper also includes online data and technical appendices for the
interested reader.3


2       Experimental Design
We presented subjects with a sequence of modified dictator games, developed
by Andreoni and Miller (2002), that vary the relative prices of allocating
tokens to self (the subject) and other (an anonymous other subject, chosen
at random from the group of subjects in the experiment). Throughout, we
denote persons self and other by s and o, respectively, and the associated
    2
     Our paper is also related to the subfield of development economics that examines how
individual preferences are affected by exposure to violence civil and conflict. For example,
Voors, Nillesen, Verwimp, Bulte, Lensink and Van Soest (2012) examine the impact of
Burundis conflict on distributional, risk, and time preferences, and Callen, Isaqzadeh, Long
and Sprenger (2014) investigate the consequences of violence for economic risk preferences
in Afghanistan.

monetary payoffs by πs and πo . Each experimental session consisted of
50 independent decision problems; each problem was presented as a choice
from a two-dimensional budget set, using the graphical interface employed
by Fisman et al. (2007). Choices were made by using the computer mouse
or the keyboard arrows to move the pointer on the computer screen to the
desired allocation in the budget set and then clicking or hitting the enter
key.
    The experimental interface makes it possible to present each subject with
many choices in the course of a single experiment, yielding a rich individual-
level dataset. We may therefore analyze behavior at the level of the in-
dividual subject, without the need to pool data or assume that subjects
are homogenous. Full instructions, including screen shots, are available at
Online Appendix I.4
    As discussed in the introduction, we consider three environments, corre-
sponding to the interaction between the experimental treatment and real-
world economic conditions:

    • The Gain Boom (GB) environment borrows data from Fisman et
      al. (2007), collected in the fall of 2004, amidst the economic boom
      that preceded the Great Recession. In this environment, the axes
      were scaled from 0 to 100 tokens, and in each decision problem the
      computer selected a budget set randomly from the set of budget lines
      that intersect with at least one of the axes at 50 or more tokens.

    • The Gain Recession (GR) environment was nearly identical to the
      GB environment; however, these experiments were conducted in the
      fall of 2011, amidst the economic malaise that followed the financial cri-
      sis. Additionally, choices were restricted to allocations on the budget
      constraint. Since most subjects in the GB treatment had no violations
      of budget balancedness, we made this minor modification to make the
      computer program easier to use.5
    4
      One concern with our research design is that presenting choices graphically may some-
how bias behavior. Aside from the graphical presentation of choice problems, the Gain
treatment is identical to Andreoni and Miller (2002), so the results are directly compa-
rable. Although we test a much wider range of budget sets than can be tested using
the pencil-and-paper questionnaire method of Andreoni and Miller (2002), the behaviors
elicited graphically are consistent with those elicited non-graphically.
    5
      In the GB environment, choices were not restricted to allocations on the budget con-
straint, but very few subjects violated budget balancedness by choosing strictly interior
allocations. If allow for a five token margin to account for small mistakes resulting from
the slight imprecision of subjects’ handling of the mouse, 64 subjects (84.2 percent) had



                                            6
   • The Loss Recession (LR) environment includes experiments that
     were conducted in the falls of 2010 and 2011, during conditions of
     economic stagnation. The experimental design was identical to the GR
     environment except that subjects each received an initial endowment
     of 100 tokens, and the axes were scaled from -100 to 100 tokens. In
     each decision problem, the computer selected a budget line randomly
     from the set of budget lines that intersected with at least one of the
     axes at 0 or more tokens.

     Panel A of Figure 1 illustrates the types of budget lines used in the Loss
treatment after the payoffs to self and other, πs and πo , are rescaled by the
initial endowment of (100, 100). Note that making either self or other better
off relative to the initial endowment necessarily creates inequality, while self
and other must both be made worse off relative to the endowment in order
to produce equality. The Loss treatment generalizes the framework of List
(2007) and Bardsley (2008), in which the set of feasible monetary payoff
choices of person self is always a line with a slope of −1 that goes through
the endowment, which is the neutral reference point of neither taking nor
giving.
     For comparative purposes, Panel B of Figure 1 presents a graphical de-
piction of the choice sets employed in List (2007). Relative to List (2007),
we can think of the budget lines in our experiment changing in two steps.
First, since we did not restrict the price ratio to 1, pivot the budget line
around the endowment to the randomly-chosen price ratio. Then, shift the
pivoted line inward so the endowment is no longer in the feasible set. The
pivot gives a “substitution” effect and the shift inward gives an “income”
effect.

                                  [Figure 1 here]

    In all experiments, payoffs were determined as follows: at the end of the
experimental session, the program randomly selected one decision round
to determine final payouts. Each round had an equal probability of being
chosen. Each subject then received the tokens that he allocated to πs , and
the subject with whom he was matched received the tokens that he allocated
no violations. Of those, 38 subjects (50 percent) left no more than one token unspent
in any decision problem. The few subjects who did violate budget balancedness also had
many revealed preference violations even among the subset of their choices that were
on the budget constraint. We discuss the consistency of subjects’ choices with revealed
preference conditions in greater detail below.



                                          7
to πo .6 In the LR environment, total earnings in each decision problem were
equal the number of tokens earned in that period, which could be negative
in the Loss treatment, plus the initial endowment of 100 tokens.


3     Subject Pool Composition
A potential concern with our research design is that differential selection
across the Boom and Recession economic conditions, or factors other than
the recession, may be driving our results. To this end, we combine detailed
administrative and survey data and show that students’ economic prospects,
in the form of job offers, employment rates, and salaries at graduation, were
significantly worse in 2010 and 2011 than in 2004. At the same time, all other
aspects of the Berkeley student population’s socioeconomic circumstance,
social life, and academic experiences were essentially unchanged.7 When we
focus on the data available on subjects in our sample, we similarly find no
shift in background attributes. We argue that these results, especially when
combined with our findings on subject behavior in the Loss treatment,
support the view that economic conditions likely account for the shift in
distributional preferences observed in our data.

3.1    Socioeconomic and Demographic Composition
All experiments were conducted at the Xlab at UC Berkeley. The Xlab
draws its subjects from a large and diverse group of UC Berkeley students
and administrative staff; but most participants in Xlab experiments are
undergraduate students. To explore how the sample of participants may
have shifted across years, we test whether the observable characteristics
of Berkeley students overall, or those who participated in our experiments
specifically, differ across the Boom and Recession conditions.
   6
     As in Andreoni and Miller (2002), every subject received two groups of tokens, one
based on his own decision to allocate tokens and one based on the decision of another
random subject to allocate tokens. The computer program ensured that the same two
subjects were not paired twice as self -other and other-self — that is, for any pair of
subjects n and m, if n passed tokens to m, then n did not also receive tokens from m.
   7
     We utilize datasets from UC Berkeley’s Office of Planning and Analysis, Financial
Aid and Scholarships Office, Career Center, Cal Answers (Student Data Warehouse), and
the University of California Undergraduate Experience Survey (UCUES), a system-wide
survey on the experiences of undergraduate students at the University of California.




                                          8
3.1.1    UC Berkeley Student Body
Online Appendix II provides a graphical presentation of the make-up of UC
Berkeley student body during 2004–2011. Students’ self-reported family
incomes fluctuated only a small amount: adjusted for inflation, the fraction
of students whose families earn less than $80,000 a year increased from 52.3
percent in 2004 to 53.0 percent in 2010, while those whose families earn
$80,000–$150,000 decreased from 29.1 percent to 26.8 percent (see Online
Appendix II, Panel A). In addition, the fraction of UC Berkeley students
receiving Federal Pell Grants increased from 33.3 in 2004 percent to 35.6
percent in 2011 (see Online Appendix II, Panel B).8
    With regard to ethnic diversity, the fraction of under-represented minor-
ity students (African Americans, Chicanos/Latinos, and Native Americans)
also shows only a small change, increasing from 14.8 percent to 16.2 percent
over the period (see Online Appendix II, Panel C). Finally, the distribu-
tion of self-reported social classes when growing up has remained virtually
unchanged year to year (Online Appendix II, Panel D).
    Overall, these data show that UC Berkeley students come from di-
verse socioeconomic backgrounds. Nevertheless, the distributions of student
backgrounds have remained virtually unchanged, despite the unprecedented
budget shortfall that resulted from the recession. While the recession has
touched many Americans and possibly impacted their decisions to attend
college, the composition of UC Berkeley undergraduates is less vulnerable to
fluctuation, possibly due to the care with which the socioeconomic makeup
is managed by the admissions office.

3.1.2    Experimental Subjects
Though the overall composition of the student body changed little over
the period when we conducted our experimental sessions, any substantial
changes in the composition of our subject pool could also potentially con-
found our main findings. The Xlab participant pool always contains large
numbers of subjects. Although the subject pool population consists almost
entirely of undergraduate students, within this population it is quite diverse,
with subjects from a wide array of majors and disparate socioeconomic back-
grounds. We explore the composition of our subject pool in Table 1, where
   8
     The Federal Pell Grant program provides awards of up to $5,550 per academic year
for financially eligible undergraduate students (family incomes generally less than $45,000
a year). Students with household incomes of less than $80,000 pay no tuition under UC’s
Blue and Gold Program. The Middle Class Access Plan sets a 15 percent cap on parental
contributions for families with gross income from $80,000 to $140,000 annually.


                                            9
we present characteristics of subjects that participated in sessions during
the Boom and Recession economic conditions.9 For comparison, we also
present the same characteristics for the full undergraduate student popula-
tion at UC Berkeley.
    For most attributes, there is no significant difference in the sample com-
position between the two conditions. The two exceptions are that Boom
subjects have slightly higher grade point averages (3.41 versus 3.27, p-value
= 0.06) and higher rates of enrolment as economics and business majors (0.26
versus 0.11, p-value = 0.03). Though marginally significant, the change in
grade point average is quite small in magnitude. The decline in the percent-
age of subjects majoring in economics or business, on the other hand, is quite
large. However, given that prior work finds a positive association between
studying economics and selfishness and also between studying economics
and efficiency orientation, this likely creates a bias against our results.10

                                     [Table 1 here]

3.2    The Impact of the Recession on UC Berkeley Students’
       Economic Prospects
Though UC Berkeley is one of the best universities in the United States, its
students were by no means immune to the effects of the Great Recession.
Every year the UC Berkeley Career Center conducts a survey of the post-
graduate activities of Bachelor’s degree recipients. The data show that in
more recent years, students faced greater financial challenges after gradu-
ation, with job offers declining and real salary growth stagnating after the
onset of the financial crisis. As indicated in Figure 2, the number of job offers
received by graduation declined across all majors, with an overall campus
average of 2.1 in 2004-2007 versus 1.8 in 2008-2011. Similarly, as indicated
in Figure 3, the initial postgraduate employment rate declined across all
majors, with an overall campus average of 50.6 percent in 2004-2007 versus
41.6 percent in 2008-2011. Finally, as we observe in Figure 4, real salary
growth declined post-2008 for graduating students in most majors, with the
average growth rate across all fields falling from 2.0 percent to 0.6 percent.11
   9
     Due to privacy concerns, we are able to obtain only session-level averages of subject
attributes, so we cannot control for individual attributes in our regressions.

Kariv and Markovits (2009).
  11
     These patterns echo the findings of Oreopoulos et al. (2012) on the career effects of
graduating from college during a recession. In particular, they find that recessions lead to
higher unemployment and lower wages, resulting in substantial reductions in the financial

                                   [Figure 4 here]

3.3    Other Shifts in UC Berkeley Student Life
There were clearly many changes that impacted the lives of Berkeley stu-
dents between 2004 and 2011 outside of the recession. A number of political
events have deeply affected American society, including the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan, the election of Barack Obama, and the passage of signif-
icant social legislation on healthcare and gay marriage. The very nature
of social interaction has also changed through the increased use of social
networking platforms and the ever greater sophistication of smart phones.
It is obviously impossible to disentangle the effects of different factors on
distributional preferences or to identify causal relationships in a dispositive
way. At the same time, we observe surprisingly few changes in students’
attitudes and campus experiences, as might have been predicted if (non-
economic) societal shifts were responsible for the changes in distributional
preferences that we observe.
    We explore changes in campus conditions and attitudes using the UCUES
data. The UCUES collects a broad range of data about the experience of un-
dergraduate students at the University of California. It provides information
about student behaviors and attitudes and many different aspects of cam-
pus life.12 Despite the sharp economic downturn, the data from the UCUES
show that students’ overall experience, their opinions on student life, and
their perceptions of campus climate fluctuated very little from 2004 to 2011,
the period when we conducted our experimental sessions. Despite UC Berke-

and academic experiences have remained unchanged during 2004-2011 (see

returns to college education. The data of Oreopoulos, von Wachter and Heisz (2012) cover
the majority of Canadian college students from 1976 to 1995, and individual income tax
records and payroll information from 1982 to 1999. The data also include a great deal of
individual-level demographic and economic information. Canada experienced two major
recessions in the period under study, in the early 1980s and 1990s.

     The UCUES collects background information not available through other student
data sources. None of the national surveys of undergraduates such as the National Survey
of Student Engagement (NSSE) offers the same coverage of student population as the
UCUES. For more information, see http://studentsurvey.universityofcalifornia.edu/.

Thus, while we cannot rule out the possibility that factors other than the
recession account for the differences in subjects’ behaviors across economic
conditions, there is no evidence that the subject pool has shifted in other
observable ways across our experimental sessions.


4        Analysis and Results
Our main outcome variable is the average fraction of tokens allocated to self
— the mean of πs /(πs + πo ) averaged at the subject level across all decision
problems. As in List (2007) and Bardsley (2008), in the Loss treatment, πs
and πo are equal to the number of experimental tokens earned (positive or
negative) plus the initial endowment, so neither self nor other can receive
a negative net payoff.
    Table 2 summarizes the experimental sessions within each treatment.
Session-level averages are tightly clustered within each environment, and
we do not observe session effects: πs /(πs + πo ) averaged 0.772–0.810 in
the GB environment, 0.872–0.877 in the GR environment, and 0.898–0.927
in the LR environment. This lack of variation within each environment
suggests that variation across sessions is not being driven by variation in
the observable characteristics of subjects, which vary substantially across
sessions within each environment, or by campus-wide shocks that happen to
coincide with particular sessions.13
                                    [Table 2 here]
    In the remainder of this section, we first discuss the revealed preference
tests we use to determine whether individual choices in our experiment are
consistent with utility maximization. We then report results relating to
our reduced form measure of overall altruism, the average fraction of tokens
allocated to self πs /(πs +πo ). Finally, we discuss the impact of recessionary
conditions on individual utility parameters — indexical selfishness and the
willingness to trade off equality and efficiency — which we estimate using
constant elasticity of substitution demand functions at the individual level.

4.1      Revealed Preference
The most basic question to ask about individual choice data is whether it
is consistent with utility maximization. Classical revealed preference the-
ory provides a direct test: choices in a finite collection of budget sets are
    13
    We explore this point further in our main analysis by including session-level controls
in our regressions specifications.


                                           12
consistent with maximizing a well-behaved (piecewise linear, continuous,
increasing, and concave) utility function if and only if they satisfy the Gen-
eralized Axiom of Revealed Preference (GARP). Hence, in order to assess
whether our data are consistent with utility-maximizing behavior, we only
need to check whether our data satisfy GARP. Because our subjects make
choices in a wide range of budget sets, our data provide a stringent test of
utility maximization.14
    Since GARP offers an exact test (either the data satisfy GARP or they do
not), we assess how nearly individual choice behavior complies with GARP
by using Afriat’s (1972) Critical Cost Efficiency Index (CCEI), which mea-
sures the fraction by which each budget constraint must be shifted in order
to remove all violations of GARP. By definition, the CCEI is between zero
and one: indices closer to one mean the data are closer to perfect consistency
with GARP and hence to perfect consistency with utility maximization.
    In our experiments, mean CCEIs across all subjects are 0.899, 0.944,
and 0.938 in the GB, GR and LR environments, respectively. Of our 289
subjects, 128 subject (44.3 percent) were perfectly consistent, 225 (77.9 per-
cent) had CCEI scores above 0.9, and 258 subjects (89.3 percent) had values
above 0.8. We interpret these numbers as confirmation that subject choices
are generally consistent with utility maximization.15 Throughout the re-
mainder of the paper, we present results for all subjects and for those with
CCEI scores above 0.8 and 0.9 in parallel.

4.2    Data Overview
We begin with a graphical overview of our results. Figure 5 reports, for
each environment, the cumulative density function of the average value of
πs /(πs + πo ), calculated at the subject level. Most noticeably, the distribu-
tion for the GB environment is skewed sharply to the left, indicating greater
overall altruism during a boom relative to the recessionary GR and LR en-
  14
     GARP is a generalization of various other revealed preference tests, and is tied to
utility representation through a theorem first proved by Afriat (1967). Varian (1982, 1983)
replaced the condition Afriat (1967) called cyclical consistency with GARP. We refer the
interested reader to Fisman et al. (2007) for precise details on the power of our tests for
consistency with GARP.
  15
     The fact that choices nearly satisfy GARP implies that subjects had to exhibit stable
patterns of choices over the course of the experiment and that the methodology more
broadly is easily understood by experimental subjects. In addition, the high consistency
scores suggest that incentives were strong enough to maintain subjects’ engagement —
otherwise, one might expect them to lapse into ‘low effort’ quasi-random allocations that
would generate many violations.



                                            13
vironments. Further, the distributions for the GR and LR environments
have sharp jumps at one, indicating a large number of purely selfish and
near-selfish subjects, whereas there is no such discontinuity in the GB en-
vironment. Finally, the distribution for the GR environment is everywhere
slightly above the distribution for the LR environment, implying an incre-
mental — albeit modest — impact of the laboratory Loss treatment on
altruism.

                                     [Figure 5 here]

    Complementing the graphical presentation in Figure 5, Table 3 reports
summary statistics and percentile values for πs /(πs + πo ) in each environ-
ment, taking averages at the individual level. We present the results for all
subjects, as well as for the subsamples of subjects with CCEI scores above
0.80 and 0.90. The patterns are very similar across different CCEI cutoff
thresholds, indicating that the effect of recessionary conditions is not driven
by inconsistent subjects.16 The percentile distributions reported in Table
3 further emphasize that the distribution of πs /(πs + πo ) is skewed to the
left for subjects in the GB environment, indicating greater overall altruism.
Over all prices, the subjects in the GB environment allocated 79.3 percent
of the tokens to self ; this is very similar to typical mean allocations of about
80 percent in the standard split-the-pie dictator games, reported in Camerer
(2003). The GR environment presents a striking contrast, with 87.4 percent
of the tokens allocated to self , while the LR environment causes a further
increase to 90.8 percent. 17

                                     [Table 3 here]

    We next turn to regression analyses that examine the patterns of al-
truism in the data more systematically. We define indicators for both the
Recession economic condition and the Loss experimental treatment. The
dependent variable is the average fraction of tokens allocated to self — the
  16
      The fraction of near-selfish and purely selfish subjects is slightly higher for all en-
vironments in the subsamples of subjects with higher CCEI scores, reflecting the fact
that selfish subjects — who always allocate all tokens to self — will never have GARP
violations.
   17
      Engel (2011) presents a meta-study of 129 dictator games conducted between 1992
and 2009. The mean allocations in these studies are of about 72 percent, but the analysis
is not directly comparable because it includes a diverse set of experimental treatments.
Engel (2011) does not report the relationship between real-world economic conditions and
behaviors in the laboratory.

mean of πs /(πs + πo ) averaged at the subject level across all decision prob-
lems. We report the results of Tobit specifications, which allow for censoring
of the dependent variable at zero and one. Panel A of Table 4 presents the
results of the individual-level econometric analysis. In columns (1)–(3), we
present the full-sample estimates. In columns (4)–(6) and (7)–(9), we re-
peat the estimation reported in columns (1)–(3) restricting the sample to
subjects with CCEI scores above 0.80 and 0.90, respectively.

                                   [Table 4 here]

    Columns (1) and (2) indicate that both Recession and Loss are highly
correlated with altruism when employed separately as regressors. When
both are included together in column (3), we observe that both are associ-
ated with lower altruism, though most of the effect is through Recession.
The coefficients’ magnitudes in column (3) are slightly higher than those
suggested by the mean differences in Table 3 above, owing to the censoring
adjustment in the Tobit specification. In the subsamples of subjects with
CCEI scores above 0.8 and 0.9 reported in columns (4)–(9), the point esti-
mates and significance levels are similar, though somewhat higher than for
the full sample.
    In Panel B, we replicate the analysis including session-level demographic
and economic controls. Because we did not collect these data from individ-
ual subjects in 2004, we cannot include individual-level controls.18 However,
we were given access to session-level demographic information, and we in-
clude controls for the percent of subjects in each session who are California
residents, the percent Caucasian, and the percent Asian-American (African
Americans and Hispanics are the omitted category). In addition, we were
provided with the zip code of each student subject’s permanent address,
and we are able to use these data to calculate the median income in 2000 in
the zip code of each subject’s permanent residence. We include the average
zip code median income as an additional session-level control. As Panel B
of Table 4 demonstrates, including these controls has almost no impact on
estimated coefficients or significance levels, suggesting that our results are
unlikely to be driven by changes in the demographic composition of either
the UC Berkeley student body or the Xlab subject pool.
  18
    Matching individual-level characteristics to decisions within the experiment would
require us to seek informed consent (by mail) from the subjects who participated in the
2004 sessions, who have long since graduated.

4.3     Indexical Selfishness and Equality-Efficiency Tradeoffs
4.3.1    CES Specification
The revealed preference analysis above shows that choice behavior for most
subjects in each of the three environments can be rationalized, in the sense
of maximizing a well-behaved utility function. We assume that the altruistic
utility function us (πs , πo ) is a member of the constant elasticity of substitu-
tion (CES) family commonly employed in demand analysis. If choices satisfy
GARP, Afriat’s (1967) theorem tells us that there exists an increasing, con-
tinuous and concave utility function that rationalizes the data. Additionally,
in the case of two goods, consistency with GARP and budget balancedness
implies that the demand function is homogeneous of degree zero. Separa-
bility and homotheticity then entail that the underlying utility function will
have the CES form. The CES utility function has been used by Andreoni and
Miller (2002), Fisman et al. (2007), and Cox, Friedman and Sadiraj (2008),
among others.19 The primary benefit of the CES formulation is that it
makes it possible to distinguish indexical selfishness from equality-efficiency
tradeoffs in a particularly convenient manner.
    We therefore write:

                    us (πs , πo ) = [α(πs )ρ + (1 − α)(πo )ρ ]1/ρ .

The α parameter measures the indexical weight on payoffs to self versus
other, whereas the ρ parameter measures the willingness to trade off equality
and efficiency in response to price changes. Note that if ρ > 0 (ρ < 0) a
decrease in the relative price of allocating tokens to self , ps /po , lowers
(raises) the expenditure share of the tokens allocated to self ps πs (prices are
normalized so that ps πs +po πo = 1). Thus, any ρ > 0 indicates distributional
preferences weighted towards increasing total payoffs, whereas any ρ < 0
indicates distributional preferences weighted towards reducing differences in
payoffs.
    The CES functional form also spans a range of well-behaved utility func-
tions, approaching a perfect substitutes utility function as ρ → 1 and the
Leontief form as ρ → −∞. As ρ → 0, the CES form approaches log utility,
which implies that the expenditures on tokens allocated to self and other,
ps πs and po πo , are equal to fractions α and 1 − α, respectively. Before pre-
senting the estimation, it is important to understand the implications of the
  19
     See Levine (1998), Charness and Rabin (2002), Bolton and Ockenfels (2006), Cappe-
len, Hole, Sorensen and Tungodden (2007), and Bellemare, Kröger and van Soest (2008)
for alternative formulations of other-regarding utility functions.


                                          16
CES parameters for individual behavior. Figure 6 illustrates the relationship
between the log-price ratio, ln (ps /po ), and the optimal πs /(πs + πo ) for dif-
ferent values of α and ρ. An increase in the equality-efficiency parameter ρ
makes the πs /(πs + πo ) curve steeper and an increase in the indexical selfish-
ness parameter α shifts the curve upwards. These differences are important
in understanding how the CES specification fits the data in the econometric
analysis presented in the next section.

                                [Figure 6 here]

   The CES expenditure function is given by
                                              g
                              ps πs =
                                        (ps /po )r + g
where
                  r = ρ/ (ρ − 1) and g = [α/(1 − α)]1/(1−ρ) .
This generates the following individual-level econometric specification for
each subject n:
                                          gn
                    pis,n πs,n
                           i
                               = i                    + in
                                (ps,n /pio,n )rn + gn
where i = 1, ..., 50 and in is assumed to be distributed normally with mean
zero and variance σn2 . Note again that we normalize prices at each observa-
tion and estimate demand in terms of expenditure shares, which are bounded
between zero and one, with an i.i.d. error term. We generate estimates of
ĝn and r̂n using non-linear Tobit maximum likelihood, and use this to infer
the values of the underlying CES parameters α̂n and ρ̂n .
    Before proceeding to estimate the parameters, we emphasize again that
our estimations are done for each subject n separately, generating individual-
level estimates ĝn and r̂n . We also note that when the parameter measuring
indexical selfishness α̂n is large, the parameter measuring equality-efficiency
tradeoffs ρ̂n cannot be separately identified. This will complicate our inter-
pretation of any differences in the distributions of ρ̂n across treatments, a
point we will return to shortly.

4.3.2   CES Results
Figure 7 presents a scatterplot of the estimated α̂n and ρ̂n parameters; the
individual-level parameter estimates are included in Online Appendix III.
The figure shows that there is substantial heterogeneity in both indexical
selfishness and preferences toward equality-efficiency tradeoffs. In addition,

                                         17
many subjects have both high α̂-values and positive ρ̂-values. These subjects
are usually selfish, but sacrifice their own payoffs when the relative price,
ps /po , is sufficiently high, and they are able to increase the total payoff to
self and other substantially.

                                    [Figure 7 here]

    Figure 8 presents the distributions of the individual-level α̂n estimates in
the three environments. The patterns closely parallel those of πs /(πs + πo )
shown in Figure 5. Turning to the distributions of the estimated ρ̂n pa-
rameters in Figure 9, we find that the distributions for both recessionary
environments, GR and LR, are skewed to the right relative to the distri-
bution for the GB environment. This indicates that subjects exposed to
recessionary conditions lean much more toward an efficiency conception of
distributional preferences, with a further shift toward efficiency in the Loss
treatment. We further note that the ordering of the three distributions is
fairly consistent throughout, though at lower percentiles the distribution
for the GR environment is much closer to that of the GB environment,
while it is very close to the distribution for the LR environment at higher
percentiles.20

                                    [Figure 8 here]
                                    [Figure 9 here]

    Table 5 summarizes the distributions of the parameter estimates for each
environment. To economize on space, we present only the results for the full
sample. The distributions are similar for the subsamples of subjects with
CCEI scores above 0.80 and 0.90. The left panel of Table 5 summarizes the
estimates of α̂n , which parameterizes indexical selfishness. As anticipated,
the CES formulation generates very similar results on the correlates of self-
ishness as our analysis of the average value of πs /(πs + πo ) shown in Table
3.
    The other panels of Table 5 present the estimates of ρ̂n , which parameter-
izes attitudes toward equality-efficiency tradeoffs. Since the ρ̂n parameters
of selfish subjects cannot be identified, we screen out near-selfish and selfish
subjects using two different thresholds of the average value of πs /(πs + πo ),
  20
     For subjects with uniformly selfish allocations, ρ̂n cannot be identified. We therefore
screen out purely selfish and near-selfish subjects with average πs /(πs + πo ) ≥ 0.99. We
generate virtually identical results with other thresholds for screening on selfishness.




                                            18
0.95 and 0.99.21 The distributions of ρ̂n in all environments are skewed to-
ward preferences for increasing total payoffs (0 < ρ̂n ≤ 1) rather than reduc-
ing differences in payoffs (ρ̂n < 0). Nevertheless, the distribution is skewed
more to the right for the recession environments, GR and LR, particularly
at higher percentiles. Additionally, the distribution for the LR environment
is generally skewed right relative to the GR environment. Finally, the me-
dian of ρ̂n is higher for both recession environments, GR and LR, relative to
the GB environment; given the skewed distribution of ρ̂n , the mean values
are relatively uninformative. For the two recession environments, the Loss
treatment produces a lower median than the Gain treatment.

                                      [Table 5 here]

     We now turn to an econometric analysis of the differences in both in-
dexical selfishness and equality-efficiency tradeoffs across environments. Ta-
ble 6 presents the results of Tobit regressions with the individual-level α̂n
estimates as the dependent variable and Recession and Loss included as
covariates. Columns (1)–(3) present the results for all subjects, and columns
(4)–(6) and (7)–(9) present the results for subjects with CCEI scores above
0.80 and 0.90, respectively. Our findings closely parallel those of Table 4,
which had the average value of πs /(πs + πo ) as the outcome variable: the
Recession condition produces a large and significant increase in indexical
selfishness, with a modest further increase resulting from the Loss treat-
ment.22 These effects increase slightly when subjects with low CCEI scores
are screened out of the sample.

                                      [Table 6 here]

   Finally, Table 7 presents a range of regression results on the effects of
the external Recession condition and the laboratory Loss treatment on
equality-efficiency tradeoffs, using the individual-level ρ̂n estimates as the
   21
      We note that interpreting the differences in ρ̂n is complicated by the very fact that the
fraction of selfish subjects for whom ρ̂n cannot be identified differs across environment.
The observed differences in ρ̂n across treatments could occur if the recession had a direct
impact on ρ̂n . Alternatively, the differences could result if subjects with low ρ̂n -values
were particularly susceptible to selfishness in the GR and LR environments, and hence
were selected out of the sample.
   22
      Results including session-level controls available upon request. When we look at the
full sample results controlling for session-level demographics, our α̂n point estimates are
slightly higher, though significant only at the 10 percent level. Our ρ̂n estimates are
essentially unchanged by the inclusion of these controls.



                                              19
dependent variable. Since several subjects have very low ρ̂n values, its dis-
tribution is highly skewed. We therefore employ quantile regressions that
are less sensitive to extreme values. Further, given the patterns in Table 5
above, which suggest that the effects of the Recession condition and the
Loss treatment may be quite different at higher percentiles in the ρ̂n distri-
bution, we present quantile regressions for the 25th , 50th and 75th percentiles.
In all results that follow, we omit subjects whose average πs /(πs + πo ) is
higher than 0.99, since their efficiency-equity tradeoff parameter ρ̂n cannot
credibly be estimated.

                                 [Table 7 here]

    Panel A of Table 7 shows the results of our median regressions. As
discussed above, higher values of ρ̂n indicate a greater focus on efficiency at
the expense of equality in payoffs. The full sample results in columns (1)–(3)
suggest a modest increase in efficiency-orientation for both the Recession
condition and the Loss treatment. However, the extent to which this may
be attributed to real-world economic conditions versus the laboratory Loss
treatment is sensitive to the exclusion of subjects with lower CCEI scores, as
indicated by the inconsistent patterns across columns (4)–(9). Nonetheless,
when both Recession and Loss are included, we can reject the hypothesis
that the combined effect is zero with greater than 99 percent confidence for
the full sample and also for the subsamples with CCEI scores above 0.80
and 0.90 (p-values 0.003, 0.003, and 0.004, respectively).
    Finally, the middle and bottom panels of Table 6 present quantile regres-
sions for the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. For the 25th percentile,
Loss is consistently positive and significant in most specifications, whereas
Recession is generally negative when both covariates are included, though
never significant at conventional levels. For the 75th percentile, we find that
Recession has a positive effect on efficiency orientation. These patterns
are consistent with the graphical evidence presented in Figure 9: though
the distributions of estimated ρ̂n parameters from the GR and LR environ-
ments are weakly to the right of the GB environment distribution across the
range of ρ̂n values, the LR distribution diverges from the GB distribution
at a lower value of ρ̂n than the GR distribution.
    One concern is that results might be driven in part by selection since
the Recession condition is significantly associated with increases in α̂n ,
and ρ̂n cannot be estimated for subjects who always allocate themselves all
of the tokens. However, our results are driven in part by an increase in
the prevalence of subjects with estimated ρ̂n parameters very close to one.


                                       20
Out of the 61 subjects in the GB environment for whom we were able to
estimate ρ̂n , only one had an estimated ρ̂n above 0.95. In contrast, 7 of 44
(15.9 percent of) estimated ρ̂n parameters in the GR environment and 13
of 71 (18.3 percent of) estimated ρ̂n parameters in the LR environment are
above 0.95. This striking increase in the frequency of subjects with a very
high concern for efficiency is hard to reconcile with selection concerns, which
in this case involve a relatively large number of subjects who are screened
out of the two recessionary environments.


5    Conclusion
Many complex social and economic behaviors invoke distributional prefer-
ences. In this paper, we study the relationship between macroeconomic cir-
cumstances and distributional preferences, an important consideration for
understanding, for example, political support for taxation and redistribu-
tion over the business cycle. We conducted experiments measuring distribu-
tional preferences during the “Great Recession” and during the preceding
economic boom. We find that subjects exposed to the economic downturn
place greater emphasis on efficiency and display greater levels of indexical
selfishness. The experimental Loss treatment which simulates recessionary
conditions within the laboratory amplifies these effects, bolstering our view
that these shifts in distributional preferences may be attributed to the onset
of the Great Recession.
     Our study also contributes to the debate over the role of experimental
research in understanding individual preferences, as discussed in Levitt and
List (2007), Falk and Heckman (2009), Camerer (forthcoming). As Levitt
and List (2007) point out, whether there is a correlation between the real
world and behavior in the laboratory is a critical concern for experimental
studies, particularly those measuring distributional preferences. Our results
speak to this discussion by showing that exposure to recessionary conditions
may directly impact individual distributional preferences. This correlation
between behavior in laboratory experiments and circumstances in the real
world suggests that such experiments capture something essential about the
way individuals make decisions across a range of settings.
