Do Leaders Affect Government Spending Priorities?

NBER Working Paper No. 15368
September 2009
JEL No. D72,D78

                                             ABSTRACT

Since a key function of competitive elections is to allow voters to express their policy preferences,
one might take it for granted that when leadership changes, policy change follows. Using a dataset
we created on the composition of central government expenditures in a panel of 71 democracies over
1972-2003, we test whether changes in leadership induce significant changes in spending composition,
as well as looking at the effect of other political and economic variables. We find that the replacement
of a leader tends to have no significant effect on expenditure composition in the short-run. This remains
true after controlling for a host of political and economic variables. However, over the medium-term
leadership changes are associated with larger changes in expenditure composition, mostly in developed
countries. We also find that in established democracies, election years are associated with larger changes
in expenditure composition while new democracies, which were found by Brender and Drazen (2005)
to raise their overall level of expenditures in election years, tend not to have such changes.

1. Introduction
     A central function of competitive elections is to allow voters to express their policy
preferences. One might therefore expect that when elections result in leadership changes,
policy change follows. But, does it? And if so, how quickly?
     In this paper we examine this question by looking at how the composition of government
spending responds to political variables such as changes in leadership or elections. There are
many other aspects of policy, and we make no claim that our results easily generalize to other
measures of policy. But expenditure composition is clearly an important aspect of government
policy – candidates and parties differentiate themselves by how they would prioritize
expenditures if elected, and many campaign issues are related to expenditure composition.
Hence, it is worthwhile examining expenditure composition in and of itself, to see whether
elections and leadership changes matter at all for expenditure allocation. Moreover, changes in
the composition of government spending may well be representative of policy change in
general.
     Whether leadership changes result in changes in the composition of government
expenditure is an empirical question that cannot be determined by theory alone. (See section 3
below.) Though anecdotal evidence may be used to support a position in one direction or the
other, it is no substitute for formal empirical evidence. However, as we discuss below, the
evidence on this question is scarce and mixed. As far as we know, it only covers OECD
countries.
     The question of whether leadership change results in changes in the composition of
expenditure really has two parts: do elected leaders want to change the composition of
spending, as they state in their campaigns?; and, can they do so if they in fact want to? We do
not distinguish between the two here, but simply ask whether in fact leadership changes induce
changes in the composition of spending. To study the effect of this and other political variables
on expenditure composition, we compiled data for a panel of 71 democracies over 1972‐2003
and constructed an index of changes in the composition of central government expenditures
based on these data. We find several economic and political variables that are associated with
expenditure changes but that the replacement of a leader has no statistically significant effect
                                                1
on expenditure composition in the first two years relative to a leader not having been replaced.
In contrast, leadership changes do result in greater composition change over a four‐year
period, predominantly in developed countries. We further find that in established democracies
(but not in new democracies) election years are associated with larger changes in expenditure
composition than other years. This may be seen as the flip side of our earlier results (Brender
and Drazen, 2005, 2008) that election‐year changes in the level of expenditures and of deficits
characterize new democracies but not established democracies, where they are generally
punished.
      The plan of the paper is as follows. In the next section we consider existing empirical
studies of the relation between ideology and expenditure composition, related to our interest
in the effect of leadership change on changes in budget composition. In section 3 we argue that
economic theory gives no clear answer as to whether changes in leadership will result in
changes in expenditure composition, so that the question is an empirical one. In section 4 we
set out our empirical methodology, followed by our empirical results on the effect of leader
characteristics on expenditure composition in the short‐run in section 5. In section 6, we look at
longer‐run relationships, where we do find an effect of leadership change on changes in
expenditure composition. Section 7 considers election‐year effects, where we see that in
established democracies, but not in new ones, election years are associated with larger changes
in expenditure composition than non‐election years. In the final section we summarize our
findings and present conclusions. An appendix provides detailed information about the
derivation of our variables.


2. Existing Empirical Studies
2.1 Leadership changes
      What is the evidence on the relation between changes in leadership and subsequent
changes in expenditure composition?1 The literature that exists has largely focused on a related

1
 We mean expenditure composition across detailed rather than broad categories. Persson and Tabellini (2004)
consider the effect of electoral rules and forms of government on the ratio of central government social security
and welfare compared to other government outlays. In section 5.3 below we report on the effect of government
and electoral rules on how detailed composition of government spending changes over time.
                                                       2
question, the relation between ideology and expenditure composition. Budge and Hofferbert
(1990) examine the relation between U.S. party programs and federal government
expenditures, where they argue that a party is bound (both morally and by fears of retribution
at the next election) to carry through the program on which it has been elected (p. 111). Using
an analysis of what the party emphasizes in its platform to construct a numerical measure of a
party's policy in a given area,2 they conclude that there is significant evidence that parties do
enact policies on which they are elected. King, et al. (1993) argue however that their strong
results arise from a failure to correct for autocorrelation and exhibit Granger‐Newbold spurious
correlation. Once a correction is made, King, et al. argue that the Budge‐Hofferbert data do not
support their assertions of a strong relation between platforms and policy outcomes, and that
the lack of relation reflects the fact that American parties are more diffuse, porous, and less
programmatic than those in most other countries (p. 744). The bottom line for the U.S. is that
budgets' allocations almost always change incrementally (p.747).
      Tsebelis and Chang (2004) argue that in a sample of 19 OECD countries3 over 1973‐95,
changes in government composition do affect budget composition. They consider the average
budget distance over 9 categories with a similar measure to ours below4 and relate it to
measures of the ideological distance between parties in the government as well as the
alternation of ideological position from one government to the next. They find that the change
in the budget composition is related negatively to the ideological distance between parties in
the current government and positively to the ideological differences between the current
government and the previous year's governments. As they put it, the budgetary structure tends
to lock itself into the existing pattern in political systems with ideologically distant veto players;
in contrast, the budgetary structure tends to be more flexible in political systems with
ideologically similar veto players. (p. 470)

parties' platform related to each expenditure category.

          Bräuninger (2005) considers the ratio of social security expenditure to the aggregate
expenditure on social security and economic affairs. He finds that higher weight on social
welfare spending in a party's policy manifestos does lead to a significant increase in social
security spending. A change in the position of the median legislator has an effect in the correct
direction, but is less significant statistically. A change in the ideological composition of the
legislature towards more left‐wing parties had no statistically significant effect on social
spending.
          All these papers consider the relation between aspects of a government's ideology and
the composition of expenditure, which is clearly related to the issues we are considering.
However, none of them looks specifically at a change in leadership per se and how it affects the
composition of spending. Additionally, these papers do not examine changes in expenditure
composition in the medium‐term.
          The paper that is probably most closely related to ours is Jones and Olken (2005), who
consider how deaths of leaders while in office are associated with economic performance and
government policy. They find that such plausibly exogenous leadership transitions matter for
growth of real GDP per capita in a country and are strongest in non‐democracies, where they
argue that there are fewer constraints on a leader's power. More relevant for our question,
they also look at changes in the growth rate of government expenditure following a leadership
change. The results they present show no significant effect of a leader's death on expenditure
growth (though they mention that alternative tests do show an effect). They conclude that
there is no strong evidence of fiscal policy effects. Our results may be seen as pushing this
further, since we consider not only replacement due to death, but also replacement in
elections, where it is more likely to find policy changes – and we still find no short‐term effect.
2.2 Election‐year effects
          There has been a significant amount of work on the effect of elections on aggregate fiscal
variables (political budget cycles) at the national level. In Brender and Drazen (2005), where
much of the literature is summarized, we found that the existence of a political deficit cycle

                                                                         4
identified in many studies is driven by the experience of new democracies5: the strong political
budget cycle in these countries accounts for the finding of a budget cycle in larger samples that
include these countries and disappears when these countries are removed from larger samples.
That is, increased deficits and expenditures in election years are a phenomenon of new
democracies and are not statistically significant in developed countries or established
democracies as a group. The findings in Brender and Drazen (2008) suggest why this may be the
case – election‐year deficits or increases in overall expenditure significantly decrease the
probability of reelection in established democracies and developed countries as a group, but
have no statistically significant effect in developing countries or new democracies in either
direction. Hence, election‐year deficits and expenditure increases may not be observed in
established democracies because they are not an effective election‐year tool.
      Election‐year effects on the composition of spending have been investigated primarily at
the sub‐national level (see Drazen and Eslava [2009] for a summary and empirical study of
Colombia), with a number of papers finding that in specific countries at the sub‐national level,
investment or infrastructure spending rises in election years relative to other categories of
spending.6 Drazen and Eslava (2009) find further that this composition shift increases an
incumbent's reelection probabilities. To the best of our knowledge there is no large panel study
of election‐year effects on the composition of government expenditure at the central
government level.

  These are countries that became democracies after 1960 (when our sample in that paper started) with the
country being classified as a new democracy in the years up to (and including) the fourth election after the
transition to democracy.

  Kneebone and McKenzie (2001) find no evidence of a political cycle in aggregate spending for Canadian
provinces, but do find a cycle in what they call visible expenditures, mostly investment expenditures such as
construction of roads and structures. For Mexico, Gonzalez (2002) finds similarly that investment expenditure
expands prior to elections, while some other categories of spending, such as current transfers, contract. Brender
(2003) finds that voters in local elections in Israel reward high expenditure in development projects ‐ controlling
for the size of the deficit ‐ in the year previous to an election. Similarly, Khemani (2004) finds that Indian states
spend more on public investment before scheduled elections than in other times, while they contract current
spending, leaving the overall balance unchanged. Drazen and Eslava (2009) find a similar increase in infrastructure
spending in Colombian municipal elections in election years, but no increase in aggregate spending.

3. The Effect of Leadership in Theory
     The choices of optimizing agents should reflect their preferences. The same should apply
to government leaders (as, e.g., is central to the predictions of citizen‐candidate models of
Osborne and Slivinski [1996] and Besley and Coate [1997]). Hence, basic theory would lead one
to expect that a change in the policy preferences of a policymaker would be reflected in
changes in the actual composition of expenditures. Accordingly, a change in the political party
controlling the executive or legislative branch of government would be thought to lead to a
change in the composition of spending. Even without a change in party, new leaders come in
with their own spending priorities and would likely change the composition of spending.
     However, there are several, not mutually exclusive, reasons why leadership change might
not lead to rapid policy change. First, policy changes take time. Much government expenditure
is mandated by law (such as entitlements) or by past government decisions and can be changed
only gradually. Lags in the budget approval process which imply that expenditure composition –
or at least its broad outlines – in the early part of a new leader's term are determined before he
or she takes office.7 Even when there are no legal constraints in changing policy, new
officeholders may face a learning curve in how to achieve their aims. This suggests that
leadership changes would induce changes in expenditure composition, but with a lag, a
possibility we investigate empirically.
     Second, the need to get elected means that leaders may need to commit, at least partially,
to policies that reflect median‐voter preferences, so that differences in enacted policies may be
smaller than underlying ideological differences between leaders may suggest. The basic
Downsian model of purely office‐motivated candidates who can commit to policy platforms
implies that under certain conditions the policy platforms of both candidates in a two‐
candidate race will converge to the policy preferred by the median voter. Though the
predictions of the simple Downsian model are considered often unrealistic, other models may
also yield analogous results. (For example, the citizen‐candidate model implies that if there is a


7
  Tsebelis and Chang (2004) focus on short‐term changes because they argue that in OECD countries new
governments can change the expenditure composition, as there are numerous ways in many of these countries to
alter the existing budget.
                                                     6
policy that is a Condorcet winner, the candidate who would implement this policy is the one
elected.) The main point is that if policy preferences of the electorate are fairly stable over
time, the policy enacted by elected leaders will be similarly stable, though the leader's identity
may change.
     Third, an elected leader is not a unitary policymaker. In making policy, she must work with
other political actors – legislators, special interest groups, and the existing bureaucracy – whose
identities and interests do not necessarily change when a new leader is elected (Bräuninger,
2002). The composition of the legislature often shows relatively little change from election to
election. The bureaucracy below the top rungs shows similar inertia. And, new leaders must
bargain with entrenched special interests lobbying for the same issues they did with the
previous political leadership, where being new on the job may imply relatively low bargaining
power. (See Drazen and Limão [2008] where bargaining power with special interest groups may
vary over policymakers.) Hence, to the extent that some powerful political actors remain in
place when leaders are changed, policy may appear to have significant inertia.
     Conceptually, one may argue that there is a price to pay to change expenditure
composition (which may be close to infinite on some issues at some points) which must be
weighed against the gain. More precisely, the questions of whether a new leader wants to
change expenditure and whether she is able to effect a change can be subsumed in the
question: When does the benefit to the leader of changing expenditures exceed the cost she
faces to do so? These costs may be quite high for a new leader except in special circumstances
(such as Franklin Roosevelt's First “Hundred Days” after taking office in 1933). Leaders gain
experience over time in how to achieve what they want. Moreover, as in the general theory of
investment, rapid change may be especially costly, giving another reason why change may be
observed only after some time in office.
     The value of holding office is one very tangible benefit to incumbents. Several models
(Rogoff, 1990, Drazen and Eslava, 2008, 2009) consider how incumbents may try to increase
their probability of reelection by changing the composition of expenditure. This would be
consistent with the desire to target some groups of voters before elections without increasing
overall spending or deficits. These models assume that the incumbent running for reelection
                                                7
has complete control over fiscal policy, while the above discussion suggests changing policy
may be difficult or costly.
     Significant change in election years may reflect several factors. Experience may reduce the
cost of effecting change, while the electoral motive may imply a large perceived payoff.
Moreover, shifting expenditures may be less visible than deficits and may also be perceived by
voters as more sustainable, implying a lower political cost. In any country and period the
direction of change may be different, depending on the perception of current needs and voter
distribution (e.g., who is the median voter and what dimensions are priority in each particular
case); this is why we look at a general index of change, which is independent of direction.
     The bottom line is that theory makes no unambiguous prediction about how much
expenditure composition will change, if it changes at all, when a new leader takes office. This is
true even if the new leader prefers an expenditure composition different than the status quo.
Hence, the effect of leadership changes on expenditure composition becomes an empirical
question.


4. Description of Methodology
4.1 Basic Sample
     Our sample consists of 71 democracies (as described in Appendix I) over the period 1972‐
2003 for which we have data on the breakdown of central government expenditure. One
reason that expenditure composition is not more studied is no doubt the problem of data
availability, where detailed breakdown of expenditure into more than a few categories requires
substantial work if one is to consider a broad set of countries over a long period. Hence, our
first methodological step was simply creating such a data set.
     In constructing our indices of composition, we used two different breakdowns of
expenditures, one using 9 categories of expenditures, the other using 12 categories, as detailed
in the appendix. The 12‐category breakdown has the advantage of allowing a more refined
examination of changes but it comes with a cost of reducing the sample size. The effect of the
availability of data for the various categories on the sample size is reported in Table 1. As we
move from a one‐year to a four‐year window (see the next paragraph) the number of available
                                                8
observations falls, with developed countries and established democracies forming a greater
proportion of the sample relative to less‐developed countries and new democracies. (These are
related, as most new democracies are less‐developed countries). This has implications also for
other categories – for example, most countries with a Presidential system are less developed.
4.2 Construction of Index
        Our index is constructed as follows. Let i= country; j= expenditure category; t= date. We
therefore have a vector of expenditure shares ej,i,t in country i at t for j different categories of
expenditure (where ej,i,t is between 0 and 100 so that  jj 1J e j , i , t  100 ). An index of the change

in composition of expenditure in country i between year t and year t‐1 is then

                  jj 1J e j , i , t  e j , i , t 1
I i , t 1 
                                   2
        The data may also be used to construct an index of change over a period longer than one
year by replacing ej,i,t‐1 with the change over the n previous years, that is, with ej,i,t‐s , so that the
index becomes:

                   jj 1J e j , i , t  e j , i , t s
I i , t n  
                                    2
        which includes the previous equation when n=1. This index goes from 0 (in the case of no
change in the share of expenditure in any category) to 100 (in the case of one category going
from none to the entire expenditure in year t relative to the earlier year or years and another
going from all to none). The index measures the change from any category to another, taking
no stand on the direction of the change.8 The means and standard deviations of the index for
different country categories and horizons are shown in Table A‐3 in the data appendix.

  Unlike the Euclidean index used by Tsebelis and Chang (2004), this measure does not give a larger weight to
larger changes in the shares of specific categories. See footnote 4.

4.3 Measuring Political Effects
Leadership changes
       Changes in the leadership of a country are examined using data from World Political
Leaders 1945‐2008 and from World Statesmen. In countries with a presidential system we focus
on changes of presidency; in parliamentary ones on the prime minister (see the data appendix
for details). For each country in each year we check whether the head of state at the end of the
fiscal year is the same as at the beginning of the year and distinguish between whether the
leader was replaced in an election year or not. (In countries with a presidential system, we look
at presidential elections; in parliamentary systems we look at parliamentary elections.) The
distribution of our sample according to these criteria is reported in Table 2. In our largest
sample – of expenditure composition changes over one year and using 9 expenditure
categories – we have 254 observations in which the leader was replaced. Of those the leader
was replaced in an elections year in 152 cases. When we move to observations for which we
have data on the 12 expenditure categories the number of leader replacements falls (along

1
  Relating to a change in the base year, e.g., in the 2 years category we report whether there had been a
leadership change in t-2.
2
  EY stands for election year.


     We also examine whether leadership changes were associated with a change in the
leader's political alignment. Using data predominantly from the World Bank's DPI we classify all
the leaders to four categories: Left, Center, Right and Undefined (see data appendix). We then
look at whether the new leaders share the alignment of their predecessors or not. We find that
in about 60 percent of all cases there is no change in alignment and that sharp changes (from
left to right and from right to left) are of similar magnitude to each other. However, among the
cases where the leader was replaced in an election year the proportion of changes in alignment
is more than 50 percent.
Political Strength
     A leader's political strength may have a substantial effect on his ability to carry out the
changes he desires. Leaders who step into office enjoying strong popular support and a
convenient parliamentary majority may be more able to carry out their desired and promised
changes in spending priorities and to tackle entrenched interests. We distinguish between two
forces: (1) the effect of political strength itself on changes in expenditure composition, (2) the

                                                      11
interaction between political strength and leadership changes ‐‐ that is whether new leaders
who enjoy strong support change expenditure composition more than ones with weaker
support. To account for the political strength in presidential systems we examine the share of
votes received by the president in the last elections; in parliamentary systems we examine the
share of seats in parliament held by the leader's party.9
4.4 Regressions
      To test for the effect of leadership changes ‐‐ both alone and in conjunction with other
political variables ‐‐on changes in government expenditure composition we run a panel
regression with country fixed effects:
      I i , t n    bs z s , t  cxt   t
                   s

      where z t is a vector of control variables‐‐overall expenditure growth, GDP per capita, GDP

growth, government size (relative to GDP), inflation, percent of population over 65; political
characteristics of the country – which are discussed in greater detail in section 4.5 – and the
initial shares of specific expenditure categories, as discussed below. xt is the leadership change
measure we consider. Because the regressions for periods that extend beyond one year include
overlapping observations, we use robust standard errors corrected both for serial correlation
and moving average using the Newey‐West procedure. 10
      Means and standard deviations of all the variables are reported in Table 3. The mean
change in expenditure composition is 4.5% (5.1%) per year for 9 (12) expenditure categories.
This rises by a factor of 1.7 (rather than four) as we move to a four‐year window, suggesting
that some changes are reversed over the longer horizon. Note further that the means of GDP
per capita, average inflation and population over 65 decrease at the four‐ relative to the one‐
and two‐year windows, reflecting the greater proportion of developed countries in the longer
windows. In contrast, votes (for presidential systems), and leader’s party strength (for
parliamentary systems) do not change significantly as we move from a one‐ to a four‐year

9
   To allow for an intuitive interpretation of the coefficients both variables are standardized by subtracting their
mean from each observation and dividing the score by their standard deviation.
10
    Estimation of the equations for a sample that avoided the overlap of observations (at the cost of substantially
reducing the sample size) did not affect qualitatively any of our main results. These results are not reported here
for brevity.

composition are not driven by these variables.

         The dependent variable in all our regressions is the index of the change in expenditure
composition between the current year and the n previous years (n=1,2,3,4) as given in the
index above. For example, Cat9_1 is the change in the expenditure composition index between
the current year and the previous year using the 9 basic expenditure categories given above,
while Cat12_2 is the change in the expenditure composition index between the current year
and two years ago using 12 expenditure categories.
4.5 Controls
         We first set out the economic and political control variables. More details and data
sources may be found in the data appendix.

                                                                13
4.5.1 Economic variables
Overall expenditure growth
     The ability of political actors to agree to change the composition of expenditure, that is,
how the pie is sliced, may depend on whether or not the pie is growing. On the one hand faster
growth of the pie may keep everyone happy and prevent the need to reallocate resources; on
the other hand, expenditure growth may allow redirecting resources to the leader's preferred
uses while keeping other types of spending unaffected in absolute terms. To account for that,
we include overall expenditure growth in the equations. However, there is also a possibility that
expenditure growth may be caused by the desire of a leader to change expenditure
composition while avoiding conflicts. We therefore repeat our estimation without this variable
to verify that its inclusion does not mask an underlying pressure to change the expenditure
composition.
Level and change in per-capita GDP
     Changes in the composition of expenditures may be affected by both the level of
development and the rate of economic growth. Poorer countries may be more constrained in
what government spending finances, while higher income allows more choices and hence
greater flexibility in expenditure composition. The income elasticity of demand may differ
across categories of expenditure (see, for example, Sanz and Valázquez, 2002) or, following
Baumol's (1967) famous argument, that differential technological progress in production of
goods versus services will lead to greater expenditure on the latter over time.
Inflation
     The price of different components of government spending may rise differentially when
there is overall inflation, so that composition percentages calculated from nominal magnitudes
would vary with inflation even if real magnitudes remained unchanged. Price elasticities may
also differ across government expenditure groups leading to changes in real magnitudes.
Because the effect of inflation may not be linear ‐‐ in part because high inflation countries
develop mechanisms to mitigate its real effects ‐‐ we include in our equation both the inflation
rate and the squared rate of inflation.



                                               14
Wars
      Wars may have a large and significant effect on the composition of expenditures as they
impose significant defense costs in a short period. To account for that effect we used the
COSIMO database from the Heidelberg Institute of International Conflict Research to identify
events of military conflicts (see data appendix for details). While our data include quite a few
observations that are defined as war years this variable had no effect on expenditure
composition due to the use of the country fixed effects.11
Percent of population over 65
      Since a large fraction of government expenditure in many countries goes to various forms
of old‐age assistance, one might expect that having a large share of elderly population would
create a strong lobby that will prevent changes in the composition of government expenditure.
We find no significant effects of this variable (and therefore do not report the effects in the
tables). The reason appears to be that there is little variation in this variable over time in
individual countries while differences between countries are largely captured by the country
fixed effects.
4.5.2 Political variables
      In addition to change in government leadership, elections, and government strength, a
number of other political variables may also influence changes in the composition of
government expenditure.
Electoral systems
      The extent of change in composition of government expenditure may differ in
majoritarian versus proportional electoral systems. The first is often associated with fewer
parties and majority governments, the second with more parties and coalition governments. A
simple proportional system can be thought of as having a single district, as opposed to many
geographically‐determined districts in a majoritarian system. Numerous papers12 argue
theoretically that a proportional system tilts the composition of public spending towards
programs benefiting large groups in the population, such as public goods or universalistic


11
  When we do not use fixed effects estimation, this coefficient is positive and statistically significant. Note also
that the standard error is very high, so that there may be an effect, but we can't capture significance.
                                                        15
welfare programs. Persson and Tabellini (2004) argue that much larger district size (often
national districts) in proportional systems give parties strong incentives to seek support from
broad coalitions in the population. In contrast, in majoritarian elections conducted in smaller
districts, politicians target smaller, but pivotal, geographical constituencies. They find that
countries with majoritarian elections have smaller welfare programs than those with
proportional elections. These factors that affect the composition may also be associated with
different tendencies to change it, e.g., if the pivotal constituencies change more frequently
than the tastes of the public at large. To account for potential differences stemming from the
electoral system we use the classifications provided in the World Bank's DPI.
Government structure
         Analogous to the research on electoral systems, there has been research on the effect on
government expenditure of having a presidential versus a parliamentary system of
government, though it has primarily been concerned with its effect on the size, rather than on
the composition of government expenditure. Persson and Tabellini (2004) argue that
presidential regimes induce smaller governments than parliamentary democracies. To account
for this possible effect we follow their methodology and use the definitions of the POLITY IV
dataset to determine the country's system of government.
Government size
         The size of the government sector itself relative to the economy may also affect the extent
of changes in the composition of government expenditures. A small government, providing
minimal necessary functions may have little scope for changing the composition of its spending,
while a larger one may have more room for maneuver.
New democracies
         Given this difference in fiscal policy between new and established democracies found in
our earlier papers, one may ask whether there are differences in changes in government
budget composition along this dimension. Such changes would be consistent with the desire to
significantly change the structure of the economy (as in the formerly socialist economies) or



12
     Persson and Tabellini (1999), Lizzeri and Persico (2001), and Milesi‐Ferretti, Perotti, and Rostagno (2002).
                                                            16
more generally to make large or make other. The composition effect that we examine here is
not an election‐year effect, but a secular characteristic.
Ideological Orientation
     Several papers, as discussed in section 2, look at the connection between a government's
ideological orientation or the policy priorities found in a party's platform and the actual
composition of spending. We begin with an even more basic question of whether ideological
orientation per se affects the propensity for expenditure change.


5. The Effect of Replacing a Leader on Expenditure Composition
      To test whether and when leaders affect the composition of expenditures, we begin with
the central question of whether a change in leadership results in a change in expenditure
composition. We start by considering short–term effects of a leader being replaced per se and
then look at the effect when a leader is replaced in an election year as opposed to being
replaced by other political (democratic) or exogenous mechanisms (such as death of the
incumbent leader).
5.1 Short‐term effects – basic lack of effect
     In Table 4 we provide a simple examination of whether a change in government
leadership actually leads to change in the composition of expenditures. We find that in the
short‐run it does not (relative to the case of the same leader being in power). This is true
regardless of whether we control for expenditure growth or not and whether we look at 9 or 12
expenditure categories. To the extent that we find any effects of leaders being replaced, it is
that there is a smaller change in expenditure composition when the leader is replaced in an
election year, although this effect is often insignificantly different from 0. Moreover, the
absence of a positive effect persists two years after a change in leadership, suggesting that the
result is not explained simply by a problem with one year being a too short period for changes
to be affected.

      One potential explanation is that the absence of an effect is due to entitlement spending.
In the U.S., for example, mandatory spending (synonymous in the budget with “direct
spending”) generally includes all spending that is made pursuant to laws other than
appropriations laws, so that its fundamental characteristic is the lack of annual discretion to
establish spending levels (unless the law is changed). Entitlement spending (a subset of
mandatory spending), such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid in the U.S. and
analogous programs in other countries, comprises half of the budget or more in many
countries. In some countries strong defense or agricultural lobbies, teachers unions, etc. may
also limit the ability to reallocate budget resources.
      Entitlement spending which cannot easily be changed is not, however, the explanation for
our results on the lack of a leadership effect. First, consider the basic arithmetic argument. If a
category of spending is fixed by law over a horizon of n years, it is fixed whether or not a leader
is replaced. Hence, it would not explain the absence of an effect in years after a leader is
replaced relative to years of no leader replacement.13 Second, we also calculated the
composition and the changes in the index excluding social protection and health, two sectors in
which entitlement spending is dominant and in which, it is generally argued, legislation to
reduce such spending is difficult to enact. The results were not qualitatively different from the
reported specification, making clear that our results are not driven by fixity of entitlement
spending.14
      Another argument is that leadership changes do not matter much for “normal” changes in
expenditure composition but they do raise the probability of eventual large changes. To
account for this possibility we estimated logit equations in which the dependent variable was
the probability of a change in expenditure composition that was at least one standard deviation
above the country‐specific average change (we also repeated it for similar changes above the
sample average). The estimation (results available upon request) did not identify any significant
effect over the one or two‐year periods.


13
  Unless all categories are fixed, in which case leadership changes indeed can have no effect on the composition.
14
  We also control below for the share of several expenditure categories which are sometimes claimed to be more
difficult to change.

5.2 The contribution of economic factors
      One may ask whether the lack of a positive effect of leadership changes on expenditure
composition is mitigated when we control for the economic and political factors mentioned
above. In Table 5 we show that this is not the case. First, consider the economic variables in the
first block. Higher overall expenditure growth leads to more change in the composition of
expenditure, while higher per‐capita GDP growth lowers it although this effect is not
statistically significant at the "noisier" Cat9_1 series). These effects are similar in magnitude, so
that changes in the composition of government expenditure increase only when overall
expenditure grows faster than GDP. We also find that the level of GDP per‐capita is not
associated with more change in expenditure composition. We see a highly significant positive
effect of inflation, consistent with the argument about differential rates of inflation when the
original expenditure data is in nominal terms.15 The negative coefficient on squared inflation
indicates the effect is concave. All these effects, however, (except the level of GDP) are small
quantitatively for plausible values of the variables. That is, economic variables explain relatively
little of expenditure change.
     In the second block, we examine the effect of the initial share of various expenditure
categories, which reveal some interesting results. Higher defense spending in developed
countries is associated, if anything, with larger subsequent changes, rather than lower changes
(as suggested by the claim that large defense budgets in some developed countries lead to
inertia in the budget). There is some evidence that higher defense spending in less‐developed
countries is associated with smaller changes in expenditure composition. Higher spending on
social protection leads to lower subsequent changes, but the effect is significant only at the
one‐year horizon. Higher education spending in less‐developed countries has a significant and
large negative effect on subsequent expenditure change. We found no evidence (not reported
in table) that spending on agriculture (mostly subsidies) affects subsequent expenditure
composition change.



15
  We also found (coefficients not shown) that once one controls for inflation, changes in the exchange rate do not
have an additional effect.

5.3 Political factors
         The third block of Table 5 reports on political covariates. Several results stand out. First,
government size (relative to GDP) has a significant positive effect on the extent of change in
expenditure composition, suggesting that larger overall expenditure gives the government
more freedom in changing composition. We can only venture some guesses on why this might
be the case. Small governments may be concentrated on more basic, central functions, giving
them less flexibility to change composition. This doesn’t necessarily imply that large
governments are engaged in activities that are “superfluous” or easily left to the private sector.
They may be providing a range of public goods, where the emphasis on which to provide more
of reflects changing circumstances or voter preferences. We leave this as a question deserving
further study.
         Second, new democracies tend to change their expenditure composition substantially
more than established ones. The effect of being a new democracy on the tendency to change
the composition of expenditures is quite substantial quantitatively, amounting to more than 40
percent of the average change in composition (as reported in Table 3). This effect is different in
new democracies that have a majoritarian electoral system which tend to have smaller changes
in expenditure composition compared to other countries (not just to other new democracies),
though this is a very small group of countries.16
         Third, turning to the political structure, we find no statistically significant difference
between majoritarian and proportional systems in the amount of expenditure composition
change. However, we do find a significant effect of having a presidential system rather than a
parliamentary one. Even though one might have expected that presidents may have more
ability to reallocate expenditures if they so desire, we find the contrary result: presidential
systems are characterized by smaller changes in expenditure composition. We should note that
our results may complement those of Persson and Tabellini discussed above. Their work
considers the relation between electoral system and spending composition (over broad
categories), while ours considers the change in expenditure composition. Hence different


16
     This group includes only 10‐15 percent of our sample of new democracies, listed in Table A‐4.
                                                          22
systems may be associated not only with different expenditure compositions but also with
different degrees of composition changes over time. Pace
      In Table 6 we add variables measuring the political strength and orientation of a leader, as
well as interacting strength variables with leadership change to see if new leaders who are
politically stronger act differently than weaker ones.17 We find that political strength per se
(measured in terms of standard deviations from the sample mean) doesn’t matter for the
extant of changes in expenditure composition.18 As for the political orientation of the leader,
we see that having a leader from a right or center party at the beginning of the period
(regardless of whether or not he was replaced) tends to increase expenditure composition
changes over a two‐year period. We have no a priori explanation for this result. It may reflect
differences in the cohesiveness of left versus right or center parties, or differences in party
ability to prioritize.
      When political strength is interacted with change of leader, we find an intriguing result. In
presidential systems, strong new leaders change expenditure composition by less than weak
ones (where strength is measured by vote share in the election). This seems contrary to the
intuition that presidents who come in with “electoral mandates” are able to effect more
change. In Table 7 we divide the sample into developed and less developed countries and see
indeed that this result is driven by less‐developed countries where the bulk of presidential
systems are.19 If anything, a strong new leader in a less‐developed country is associated with
less expenditure change in the year or two after election relative to a weak one.




17
   These interactions are calculated by multiplying the binary variables for replaced leader by the political strength
variables ‐ Votes_pres and Party_parl ‐ described in section 4.2.
18
   These variables are correlated with the country fixed effects; when we remove the fixed effects political strength
has a statistically significant positive effect on the tendency to change the composition of expenditures in both
presidential and parliamentary systems. Nevertheless, even in such specifications the interactions of political
strength with replaced leader have a negative sign (although not always statistically significant).
19
    The developed countries are those that were OECD members throughout the sample period. The only
developed countries with a presidential system are the US, and Greece and Portugal in the late 1970s and early
1980s.

     Here too, we can only speculate on the reason for this result. Expenditure change reflects
not only changed ideology, but also distributive politics. In many countries, supporters of the
new leader want to share in the spoils of office. A strong leader with wide support may be
better able to resist these pressures, whereas a weaker one may need to use government
largesse to strengthen his position. The association of weakness and more composition change
shows up elsewhere in our results as well. We can’t make definitive statements, but this is
clearly an issue deserving further research.
     The division of the sample into developed and less‐developed countries reveals some
other interesting results as well. The government size effect we saw before becomes stronger
in developed countries, while disappearing entirely in less‐developed ones. As already
mentioned, this seems an interesting point for further study. Inflation loses significance in
developed countries, which we attribute primarily to the much lower rates of inflation in these
countries implying lower inflation differentials across categories.
       We performed several other tests of political effects, as described in the various boxes
in Table 8. First, does the effect of a new leader on expenditure composition change depend on
whether he is replacing a leader with a different political ideology? In the first regression, we
limit the definition of “replaced leader” to cases of an elected leader whose party alignment
differs from his predecessor. The results indicate this does not matter; the coefficient on
expenditure change if the new leader has a different political alignment is actually negative,
though not statistically significant, The second and third lines are interaction effects of the
leader with a different political alignment with measures of political strength. Once again, to
the extent that there is any effect, it is negative.
     In the second box, we specify the direction of the change, also to no effect. We also
consider cases where the largest coalition party changes (which generally overlaps with a
change in leader, but is not identical); the coefficients still indicate no significant short‐run
effect on change in composition. In short, our earlier lack of an effect of change in leaders did
not arise because leadership change did not indicate ideology change.

 P values are in the parantheses. The equations also included controls for cases where there was an additional leadership change in t-1
or in t, and the economic, expenditure composition and political variables that appear in Table 5. The regressions in the first box also
include the share of votes received by the president in a presidential system and the largest party's share of seats in parliament in a
parliamentary system. *,** and *** indicate statistical significance at the 1,5 and 10 percent level, respectively.

  A binary variable that receives the value 1 if the leader was replaced in elections (with a leader of a different alignment in the first box) in
the base year.
2
  An interaction between the share of votes received by the president in a presidential system (the largest party's share of seats in
parliament in a parliamentary system) and the variable "replaced leader with different alignment".
3
  A binary variable with a value of 1 in a presidential system when the president's party is the largest party in government and in
parliament.



        These results would appear to contrast with that of Tsebelis and Chang (2004), who found
(see above) that budget composition does change relative to the previous year's government if
the ideological composition of the government changes (independent of whether or not there
was a change in leader herself), provided the ideological distance between parties in the
government is not too great. The difference in results may reflect their use of a much smaller
sample or their looking at ideological difference between governments in successive years
rather than changes in leadership. These are not the same. That is, one could have a change in

                                                                       27
the ideological composition of the governing coalition under the same leader; conversely, there
could be a change in leadership without a change in the government's ideology.
       In the third box, we consider the effect of the number of parties in the coalition.
Conventional wisdom is that the larger the coalition, the less able it is to undertake policy
change. (See, for example, Roubini and Sachs [1989].) The first line indicates that when we
control for this variable, the results on a new leader are unchanged from before. The coefficient
on the number of parties is positive (although not significant), indicating that, if anything, the
larger the coalition, the more expenditure composition changes, which seems in contrast to
what is often argued. One interpretation is along the lines of the ability of leaders to resist
demands for spending presented above. The larger the coalition, the more the budget must be
changed to keep the coalition together, and this effect offsets the lower ability to reach
decisions. This is another issue to study that is raised by these results. We also find that there is
no significant difference in the effect of the number of parties in the coalition on the tendency
of newly elected leaders to change the composition compared to continuing ones.
       In the last box we check whether presidents whose parties are the largest in the
government and in parliament are more likely to change the composition of expenditure. We
find that such power in parliament has a positive (although statistically significant only at the
two‐year horizon) effect on such changes, but it is not different between new and continuing
leaders; when we interact the replaced leader variable with this parliamentary effect we find
that new presidents who enjoy such a support are not different than continuing ones.
5.4 Is it Data Quality?
     Another response to the lack of a leadership effect is that it may simply reflect poor
quality data in such a broad sample. On the assumption that data quality may be higher in
developed countries, there should then be an effect in developed countries. Table 7 shows that
this is not the case – the absence of a positive effect of leadership changes on expenditure
composition is common to both country categories. In Table 9 we present results on the effect




                                                 28
of leadership changes in two more restricted sets of developed economies.20 In the left‐hand
box, we report results for the sample of 19 countries that Tsebelis and Chang (2004) used for
their study; in the right‐hand box we present results when Belgium, Italy, Portugal, and Spain
are excluded from this group (the first two because of arguments by some that there is budget
manipulation; the latter two because they were “New Democracies” over part of the sample
period). In both cases we find basically the same results previously reported – there is no
positive effect of leadership change on changes in expenditure composition over one‐ or two‐
year windows (in fact we find a negative effect in the one‐year samples). In short, our results
are not driven by poor data quality in developing countries.

is, significant expenditure changes may be taking place within our broader categories which
cannot be detected. We cannot tell, but this line of argument seems unconvincing to us. Parties
and candidates claim to differ on large issues such as defense versus social spending which
should show up in our measures if elections are fought and won over issues like this.
5.5 Spurious (lack of) causation?
        Yet another possibility is that leaders raise expenditures as a mechanism to facilitate
composition changes, so that the significant positive effect of growth of expenditures on
composition change is masking the effect of a change of leader effect on change in expenditure
composition. That is, there is a multicollinearity problem when expenditure growth is included
in the expenditure composition regressions. In Table 10 we show that our main results are not
sensitive to the inclusion of expenditure growth as a control.

2
  An interaction between the share of votes received by the president in a presidential system (the largest party's share of seats in
parliament in a parliamentary system) and the variable "replaced leader".

        To summarize, we find no evidence that a change in government leader results in a larger
change in the composition of government expenditure in the first two years after the change

                                                                      30
relative to no change in leaders. If anything, a change in leaders is associated with less change.
How can one explain this lack of effect?
6. Longer‐run Effects
     To address this question, we examine whether leadership changes are reflected in
composition changes over a longer horizon, a four‐year period (which corresponds to a term of
office in many countries).
     In Table 11 we examine simple regressions of changes in expenditure composition on
leadership changes, both for all leadership changes and for those associated with elections. To
do this we measure the change in expenditure composition over a 4‐year period and check
whether the leader was replaced in the base year (we include controls for the possibility that
there had been a successive leadership change during the period). We find that over this
period, leadership changes are indeed associated with larger changes in expenditure
composition. This effect is statistically significant only at the more detailed 12 classification of
12 expenditure categories and remains so regardless of whether we control for expenditure
growth or not.

         This result remains even with the inclusion of the economic and political controls we used
in the earlier regressions, as can be seen in Table 12. We also find that the economic variables
that we found as affecting expenditure composition change in Table 5 retain their impact at the
four‐year frame and that the effect of defense spending in developed countries in the base
period becomes larger. We also find that the level of GDP per‐capita now has a positive and
significant effect. In Table 13 we find that for the subset of developed countries the effect is
somewhat stronger and with larger statistical significance. Though statistically significant, the
magnitudes are not large – in the sample as a whole a change of about 0.7 percent attributable
to a leadership change relative to 9% change over a four‐year period (see Table 3). It is larger in
the developed countries, 1% relative to 6% mean change (see Table A‐3).

     Therefore, a part of the answer to why changes in the composition of government
expenditure in the first two years after a change in government leader are no larger than when
there is no change in leaders – and, if anything, change less– is: “It takes time.” Changes in
expenditure composition take more time to implement than campaign promises may suggest.
This may be due to a learning process after taking office, legislative procedures, and
bureaucratic lags. And, it may depend on the motivation to make changes, as the election year
results in the next section suggest.


7. Election‐year Effects
     The ability of (experienced) leaders to change expenditure composition can be seen in the
results on changes in spending composition in election years. In Table 14 we add an election
year dummy to our earlier one‐year regressions. There is still no direct effect of replaced
leader, as before. We find however that election years in established democracies are
associated with larger changes in expenditure composition than in non‐election years, the
difference being both statistically significant and large in magnitude (on the order of ¾ of a
                                                      34
percent, where the mean change reported in Table 3 was about 4.5%). When we interact
election year with new democracy, we find a negative coefficient , although in most cases not
statistically significant, implying that in new democracies, expenditure composition is not
changed more in election years – and possibly even less ‐ than in other years. In other words,
the higher change in expenditure composition associated with election years is a phenomenon
of established democracies.

                                                                        35
     In Table 15 we examine the robustness of our findings with respect to the election year
effect, accounting for various political factors that may be associated with it. In the first box we
show that the president's party being the largest in parliament does not affect composition
changes in election years. In the second and third boxes, respectively, we find that the election
year effect does not depend on the governmental system (presidential versus parliamentary),
nor on the electoral system (majoritarian versus proportional). Finally, in the fourth box we
examine whether the initial political strength of the incumbent is associated with the
magnitude of change in composition during election years; we find no evidence for such an
effect in parliamentary systems, while in presidential ones we find some evidence that
politically strong leaders tend to change the composition in election years less than weaker
ones. Nevertheless, in all these specifications the main results stand: leaders in established
democracies tend to change the composition of expenditures in election years more than in
other years, while those in new democracies do not.
     Given our earlier work, we find this not at all surprising. In Brender and Drazen (2005) we
found that new democracies, but not established ones, raise their overall level of expenditures
significantly in election years. As discussed earlier in the paper, the absence of an election‐year
increase in total expenditures in election years in established democracies in general is
probably related to the fact that voters punish such increases at the polls, as found in Brender
and Drazen (2008). In contrast, we found no evidence that election‐year increases in total
expenditures or deficits significantly affect reelection probabilities in new democracies. Since
increasing overall expenditures or deficits is not an effective tool to gain votes in established
democracies (in fact, it reduces the probability of re‐election), leaders may rely on changes in
the composition of spending to help election efforts. This result is consistent with models of
incumbents using the spending composition (Drazen and Eslava, 2009) or targeting special
interest groups (Drazen and Eslava, 2008) to gain votes without changing the deficit.

8. Conclusions
           Our basic conclusion is that leaders can change the composition of government
expenditure, but that change takes time. This no doubt reflects the combination of several

                                                                                  37
factors: there is a learning process after taking office, including learning how to navigate the
budget process; there are special interests who continue to push for the same programs under
new leaders; and there are legislative or bureaucratic roadblocks that make change difficult.
Perhaps this is not surprising – there is a learning curve for any activity, politics included. And,
the competing interests that characterize politics make it extremely difficult to effect large
changes in policy.
      What may be perhaps more surprising is how long it appears to take for leaders to
significantly change the composition of government expenditure, three to four years in our
data, and, what seems like the relatively small change attributable to a change in leadership –
less than one percent in the four years after the change, relative to an overall composition
change of eight to nine percent on average over four years. Or, perhaps not, since major policy
shifts or structural changes generally take many years to implement effectively. From a longer
historical perspective, four years may not seem long.
      The length of time it takes and the magnitude of change has a clear implication for many
countries, especially parliamentary democracies where governments may fall before the end of
their full term: when government turnover is rapid, it is more likely to find that leaders have
little effect on expenditure composition, rather than to observe chaotic changes. Even if the
average tenure of governments is not very short, for example, two to three years, change in
leaders may have little effect over time. The case of Israel is illustrative. Between 1996 and
2008 Israel had five election campaigns, four of which resulted in a leadership change. During
that twelve‐year period the 9 categories expenditure composition index changed by 6.7 percent
– much less than the average 9% four‐year change in the entire sample.21 The common wisdom
in Israel is that each government is coming in with its new reform agenda but by the time an
action plan is ready the government is replaced so the status quo prevails.
      Our results cannot distinguish whether the relatively small and delayed effect of leaders
on the composition of public expenditures is because they do not want to change it more and
more quickly or because they cannot. We note however that where incentives may be

21
   The average of Cat9_4 in Israel during this period was 2.6% compared to 8% for the sample as a whole and 5.8%
in the developed countries.
                                                       38
especially large, for example in election years, leaders do tend to change the composition more
than in other years.
     As we noted in the introduction, expenditure composition is only one measure of
government policy and we cannot address whether our results on the effect of leaders hold
true for other measures of policy. It is well worth exploring, but that requires construction of a
different dataset and a different paper. Our results suggest to us that the “null hypothesis” for
the study of other broad policy measures is that leadership change has no significant effect on
policy change in the near‐term.
     And, as we further noted in the introduction, expenditure composition is an important
aspect of policy in itself and changes in composition may indicate the direction of policy change
in general. We hope that our results are another step in the difficult question of how leaders
matter for economic policy, as well as the question of how electoral incentives shape policy
choices.

Data Appendix
      Our sample consists of democracies for which data on expenditure composition were available.
The data used in this study were collected from several sources covering economic, fiscal and political
variables. We also used information on institutional characteristics of countries, the timing of elections
and data related to the party association and career circumstances of country leaders. The data sources
we used are listed in Table A‐1.


The Sample

      Central government expenditure data were collected from the GFS (Government Finance
Statistics). They are available for the years 1972‐2003 but for many countries the covered period is
shorter. We restrict our sample to the period for which GFS data are available, even though election
years and election results data are available for a longer period.

      We limit our sample to democracies by including only the years in which the country has a non‐
negative score in the POLITY IV level of democracy index22. That index is calculated as the sum of the
scores of each country in each year on two scales: the degree of democracy (a 0 to 10 scale) and the
degree of autocracy (a 0 to ‐10 scale).

      The information on leaders and changes in national leadership were collected from World Political
Leaders 1945‐2008 (http://www.terra.es/personal2/monolith/00index2.htm) and World Statesmen
(http://www.worldstatesmen.org/). Leader identification is based on the Presidential variable,
described below. In presidential systems the leader is the president and in parliamentary systems the
leader is the prime‐minister.

      Information on election dates was collected from the Institute for Democracy and Electoral
Assistance (IDEA) dataset23 "Voter Turnout Since 1945" and supplemented by data from the ERA
(Election Results Archive) (http://cdp.binghamton.edu/era/) and the CIA's "World Factbook".24 In
Presidential systems, we used only presidential elections and in Parliamentary systems only

parliamentary ones. The identification of the political system was according to whether the chief
executive responsible for economic policy is elected directly by the public (Presidential) or by parliament
(Parliamentary), as in Persson and Tabellini (2002). For example, France is defined as parliamentary
since the government and the prime‐minister – elected by the legislature ‐ are dominant in determining
economic policy, rather than the president. These definitions are based on the variable SYSTEM in the
DPI dataset25.

Fiscal Years

         In countries in which the fiscal years are not the calendar years, we adjusted all the data to fit the
fiscal years. For example, in Canada the fiscal year starts on April 1st and ends at March 31st the
following year. Hence, elections in March 2009 would be in the 2008 fiscal year. Data about fiscal years
are from the GFS books, supplemented by IFS data when information is missing in the GFS.


Expenditure Composition Data

         Expenditure composition data for Consolidated Central Government were used where available
and Budgetary Central Government otherwise. Data for the years 1990‐2003 were taken from the GFS
CD and data for the years 1972‐1989 were taken from the GFS Historical Data CD. These were
supplemented by GFS yearbooks.

        GFSM 2001 accounting was applied retroactively to GFS data from 1990 and on. The expenditure
data on the GFS CD, namely the GFS data from 1990 and on, are reported by the IMF according to GFSM
2001 accounting. As a result the definitions of the GFS CD differ from the GFS Historical Data CD for
several of the expenditure categories we use. In order to calculate the changes in expenditure
composition between data points reported according to the same accounting system, we used
expenditure data from the GFS yearbooks for the years 1990‐199326. These data, reported according to
the same definitions as the historical GFS, were used to calculate the changes in compositions for the
years 1990‐1993 (which are calculated relative to 1986‐1989). In contrast, when calculating the changes
in the following years – relative to 1990‐1993 – we used the GFS CD.

     We used the volumes from the years 1995‐1997.

                                                         43
        Many of the countries in our sample switched from Cash to Accrual reporting in the GFS between
the years 1995‐2002. In this switch, several countries also changed some of their reporting definitions,
creating analytical inconsistencies. To base the calculation of the changes in expenditure composition
between data points on the same accounting system, we used expenditure data from the GFS
yearbooks for the years 1995‐200227 for the countries that switched systems and did not maintain
reporting of consistently defined series. These data were used to calculate the changes in compositions
for the years in which the switches occurred and the three subsequent years. In cases where such
bridging data were unavailable, we excluded the observation.

        Expenditures are reported in 12 categories: General Public Services (_82A..HZG), Defense
(_82B..HZG), Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting (_82HB..HZG), Fuel and Energy (_82HD..HZG),
Mining, Manufacturing and Construction (_82HC..HZG), Other Economic Services [Economic Services
(_82H..HZG) ‐ Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, Fuel and Energy, Mining, Manufacturing and
Construction], Housing and Community Amenities (_82F..HZG), Health (_82D..HZG), Recreation, Culture
and Religion (_82G..HZG), Education (_82C..HZG), Social Protection (_82E..HZG) and Other [Subtracting
the sum of the above 11 categories from Total Expenditure (_82..HZG)].

        For most countries all 12 categories were available; however for some countries 3 categories of
Economic Services [Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting; Fuel and Energy; Mining, Manufacturing
and Construction] were not available. For those countries we used 9 expenditure categories: General
Public Services (_82A..HZG), Defense (_82B..HZG), Economic Services (_82H..HZG), Housing and
Community Amenities (_82F..HZG), Health (_82D..HZG), Recreation, Culture and Religion (_82G..HZG),
Education (_82C..HZG), Social Protection (_82E..HZG) and Other [Subtracting the sum of the above 8
categories from Total Expenditure (_82..HZG)].

        We built the variable "Change in Expenditure Composition" by first dividing expenditures in each
of the 12(9) categories by Total Expenditure to get percentages. We then took the absolute value of the
change in percentages between the variable in the current observation and the same variable 1,2,3 or 4
years before (for Cat12(9)_1,2,3 or 4 respectively), summed up the absolute values over all 12(9)
categories and divided by 2 (in order to prevent double counting of expenditure changes).

     We used the volumes for the years 1998‐2006
                                                    44
     EXP_i0 is the value of Expenditure on category i in the current observation and EXP_i‐x is the value
of Expenditure on category i x years before.

     TXP0 is the value of Total Expenditure in the current observation and TXP‐x is the amount of Total
Expenditure x years before.


                      12
     Cat12_x =     (EXP_i
                   i 1
                                0   / TXP0 ) - (EXP_i - x / TXP- x ) / 2 * 100


                  9
     Cat9_x =     (EXP_i
                 i 1
                            0   / TXP0 ) - (EXP_i - x / TXP- x ) / 2 * 100


     For example, if Cat9_1 equals 3, this means that three percent of expenditure shifted between
categories between this year and the previous year.


     If an observation lacked data in any of the above 12(9) categories in the current or previous years
it was dropped from the dataset. The observation was also dropped if there was a break in the series
between the current observation and the observation 2, 3 or 4 years before (for Cat12(9)_1,2,3 or 4
respectively).

     To avoid a dominant effect of extreme observations (outliers) on the results, in the final dataset
we included only observations in which Cat12(9)_X fell within the following range:

      Cat9_1<25            Cat9_2<27           Cat9_4<30         Cat12_1<28 Cat12_2<33   Cat12_4<30

     For developed countries we implemented a stricter restriction of Cat9_1 & Cat12_1<18 which is
about 6 times the sample average (Table A‐3).


     A list of the country years which are included in each sample in the dataset is provided in
http://econweb.umd.edu/~drazen/. The number of observations dropped due to the constraint on the
change in expenditure composition is reported in Table A‐2 and the list of observations dropped is also
reported in http://econweb.umd.edu/~drazen/.

Replaced Leader

     Rep_lead – A binary variable receiving the value 1 if the leader on the last day of the fiscal year is
different from the leader in the previous observation, and the value 0 if the leader is unchanged. The
calculations are based on the leader definition above.

     Ey_rep_lead – A binary variable receiving the value 1 if the current observation is an election year
and the leader on the last day of the fiscal year in the current observation is different from the leader in
the previous observation.


Political alignment

     The political alignment variables for each country in each year are based mainly on the variable
EXECRLC in the DPI dataset. We adjusted the data from calendar to fiscal years where necessary,
because DPI data are as of January 1st each year while ours are as of the last day of the fiscal year. We
supplemented the data with information from Worldstatesmen.org and "World Political Leaders 1945‐
2008", using coding of parties in the DPI to add political alignment for years before 1975. The political
alignments we used are: L‐Left, R‐Right, C‐Center and U‐Unaffiliated.

     The political alignment variables are written in the general form "XY"

     CHIEF_XY – A binary variable receiving the value 1 if the current leader's political alignment is X or
Y. Where we examine only one specific alignment X or Y is dropped.

     X_to_all – A binary variable receiving the value 1 if the previous leader's political alignment was X
and the current leader has a different political alignment.

     Ch_align ‐ a binary variable receiving the value 1 if the current leader's political alignment is
different from that of the previous leader.


Political Strength Variables

     The political strength variables for each country in each election year are mainly based on DPI
data. These variables (1GOVSEAT, PERCENT1, PERCENTL in DPI) are available for the period 1975‐2004.
For the other years: 1972‐1975, we used data from IDEA and completed missing information from ERA.

                                                    46
        PARTY_STR ‐ the percent of seats in the parliament held by the leader's party on the last day of
the fiscal year in the current observation. It receives the value 0 in a presidential system (in cases where
data are from IDEA it is the proportion of the public's votes received by the party). It was standardized in
each sample by subtracting its average in that sample and then dividing by its standard deviation in that
sample.

        VOTE ‐ the percent of votes for the current president in the first round of the most recent
elections, the current leader being the leader on the last day of the fiscal year in the current
observation; receives the value 0 in a parliamentary system. It was standardized in each sample by
subtracting its average in that sample and then dividing by its standard deviation in that sample.


Economic variables

Economic growth

        The economic growth calculation is based on: GDPPC‐ real per‐capita GDP for each country in each
year, which is taken from the "World Development Indicators" (WDI) dataset of the World Bank.

        Using GDPPC we calculate: GDPPC_gr in the following way:

        GDPPC0 is the value of GDPPC in the current observation and GDPPC ‐X is the value of GDPPC X
years before:


                          GDPPC 0      
         GDPPC_gr_X =             1 * 100 ; which is the total GDPPC growth in percentage points
                          GDPPC -X     
    over the last X years.
        To avoid a dominant effect of extreme observations (outliers) on the results, in the final dataset
we included only observations in which GDPPC_gr_X fell within the following range:

        15>GDPPC_gr_1>‐15 (1=1% growth)                   20>GDPPC_gr_2>‐20 (1=1% growth)

        30>GDPPC_gr_3>‐20 (1=1% growth)                   40>GDPPC_gr_4>‐15 (1=1% growth)


        The number of observations dropped in each sample due to this restriction is reported in Table A‐2
and the list of observations dropped is reported in http://econweb.umd.edu/~drazen/.

                                                    47
Inflation

        INF is the average year‐on‐year CPI percentage change for each country in each year, which is
taken from the IFS database (series code _64..XZF).


        Using INF we calculated INF_avg_1,2,3,4 and INF_avg_1,2,3,4sq, in the following way:


        INF0 is the value of INF in the current observation and INF‐i is the value of INF i years before:


                             0
                                     INFi  
          INF_avg_X =  X  1  100   1 ; which is the average inflation rate over the last X years.
                          i 1- X         
                        
                                                     2
                           0  INF  
          INF_avg_Xsq =  X   1     i
                                             1 ; which is the square of the average inflation rate over
                          i 1-X   100  
                                               
    the last X years.
        In the final dataset we excluded observations in which INF_avg_X was in the following range:

        20<INF_avg_1 (1=100% inflation)             2<INF_avg_4 (1=100% inflation)

        The number of observations dropped in each sample due to this restriction is reported in Table A‐2
and the list of observations dropped is reported in http://econweb.umd.edu/~drazen/.

Expenditure growth

        The real expenditure growth calculation is based on Total Expenditure from the GFS and INF from
the IFS.

        TXP0 is the value of Total Expenditure in the current observation and TXP‐i is the value of Total
Expenditure i years before:


                                                                     0
                                                                               INFi  
        We calculate EXP_gr_X as follows = (TXP0 /TXP-X )/           1  100    1   *100 ; which is the
                                                                 i 1-X             
growth in total expenditure over the last X years divided by the total inflation over the last X years.




                                                         48
     EXP_gr_X is therefore expressed in percentage points – if EXP_gr_2 equals 3 this means there has
been 3 percent real growth in the total expenditure over the last 2 years.


New vs. Established Democracies

     New_Democracy – A binary variable, for each country in each year, receiving the value 1 for the
period until the 4th election after a country with a negative polity value in the POLITY IV dataset shifted
to non‐negative values, not counting the elections in the transition year. Otherwise, the country is
defined as an Established Democracy and the variable receives a value of 0.

     Established – A binary variable, for each country in each year, receiving the value 1 if the country
is defined as an Established Democracy in that year.


Developed vs. Less Developed Countries

     Developed – A binary variable, for each country, receiving the value 1 for OECD economies that
were members of the organization during the entire sample period.

     Less_Developed – A binary variable, for each country, receiving the value 1 for all the countries
that are not defined as developed.


Proportional vs. Majoritarian Electoral Rules

     The DPI provides information, in each country and in each year, whether candidates for presidency
or parliament are elected based on the total share of votes received by their party or on the majority of
votes in each voting zone (e.g., district). In the former case the electoral system is defined in the DPI as
Proportional representation (PR in the DPI) and in the latter as Majoritarian representation.

     Prop – A binary variable, for each country in each year, receiving the value 1 in a country with a
Proportional electoral system, and 0 otherwise.

     Maj – A binary variable, for each country in each year, receiving the value 1 in a country with a
Majoritarian electoral system, and 0 otherwise.




                                                    49
Presidential vs. Parliamentary Constitutional Rules

      Based on the constitutional rules defined above we calculated the following variables:

      Pres ‐ A binary variable, for each country in each year, receiving the value 1 in a country with a
Presidential system, and 0 otherwise.

      Parl ‐ A binary variable, for each country in each year, receiving the value 1 in a country with a
Parliamentary system, and 0 otherwise.


Population over the age of 65

      The percentage of the population over age 65 for each country in each year is taken from the WDI
dataset of the World Bank.


War

      The War variable is based on The Heidelberg Institute of International Conflict Research's COSIMO
database (http://www.hiik.de/en/kosimo/index.html). It is a binary variable receiving the value 1 if this
country in this year has a conflict with an "Intensity of Conflict" rating of 4=War in the database.


Government size

      The Government Size for each country in each year is constructed by dividing Total Expenditure
from IFS (series GF_countrynumber_cB_BA_2) by GDP from the IFS.


Number of Parties in Government

      The DPI provides information, in each country and in each year, about the 3 largest parties in
government and opposition and provides aggregate information regarding all other parties in
government and opposition.

      Number of Parties in Government – 1, plus 1 if the DPI lists the existence of a 2nd largest
Government Party, plus 1 if the DPI lists the existence of a 3rd largest Government Party, plus the
number of parties listed in the DPI under House‐Other Govt. Parties.

                                                     50
Presidential Control

      The DPI provides information, in each country and in each year, as to the party affiliation of the
chief executive, the names of the 3 largest parties in government and in opposition and the number of
seats in parliament each party holds.

      Pres_Control – A binary variable, for each country in each year, receiving the value 1 in a country
with a Presidential system in which the president's party is the largest party in government and in
parliament and 0 otherwise.
