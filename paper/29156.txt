The Revealed Preferences for School Reopening: Evidence from Public-School Disenrollment

                                          ABSTRACT

Before the 2020-21 school year, educators, policymakers, and parents confronted the stark and
uncertain trade-offs implied by the health, educational, and economic consequences of offering
instruction remotely, in person, or through a hybrid of the two. Most public schools in the U.S.
chose remote-only instruction and enrollment fell dramatically (i.e., a loss of roughly 1.1 million
K-12 students). We examine the impact of these choices on public-school enrollment using
unique panel data that combine district-level enrollment trajectories with information on their
instructional modes. We find offering remote-only instead of in-person instruction reduced
enrollment by 1.1 percentage points (i.e., a 42 percent increase in disenrollment from -2.6 to -3.7
percent). The disenrollment effects of remote instruction are concentrated in kindergarten and, to
a lesser extent, elementary schools. We do not find consistent evidence that remote instruction
influenced middle or high-school enrollment or that hybrid instruction had an impact.

         In the summer of 2020, educators and parents in the U.S. faced an exceptionally difficult choice with
regard to how they should deliver instruction for the 2020-21 school year (i.e., remote, in-person, or a hybrid
of the two). The number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases had risen to record heights in July of 2020 and
an even more substantial "second wave" of infections was (as it turned out, correctly) anticipated for the
coming winter. In addition, at that time, the timeline for availability and the effectiveness of the currently
available vaccines were highly uncertain. These factors motivated grave concerns about the health risks of
bringing students, teachers, and staff together for a conventional academic year of in-person instruction.1
However, the potentially serious consequences of not doing so were also widely discussed (e.g., Oster, 2020).
In particular, for many parents, having children spend more or all of the 2020-21 school year at home would
seriously amplify the disruption to their labor-force engagement and exacerbate household stress by denying
child-care and other supports. Furthermore, there was wide concern that the absence of full-time, in-person
instruction would dramatically harm both the intellectual development and the social and emotional well-
being of children while conveying only modest health benefits to younger children who appeared less
susceptible to COVID-19.
         Faced with these difficult trade-offs, most states chose not to make a universal decision about
reopening public K-12 schools and instead left the decision to local school districts, who largely chose to offer
remote instruction (Kurtz, 2020). Specifically, in the fall of 2020, 57 percent of students in district public
schools experienced remote-only instruction with 24 percent in in-person instruction and 19 percent in a
hybrid model (Henderson, Peterson, West, 2021).2 Surveys also suggest that these instructional choices largely
tracked both parents' and teachers' preferences (Collins and Nuamah, 2020; Will, 2020). A contemporaneous
report from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (2020) struck a contrarian note
and emphasized the importance of in-person instruction for younger students. Specifically, the report
concluded, on the basis of competing health and educational risks, that schools "should prioritize reopening
with an emphasis on providing full-time, in-person instruction in grades K­5." However, the reopening modes
chosen by U.S. public schools exhibited relatively little variation by grade. For example, 48 percent K-2
students were in remote-only models while 37 percent were in-person (Henderson, Peterson, and West, 2021).
         The short and longer-term economic and educational consequences of these school-reopening
decisions (and the COVID-19 pandemic, more generally) is an important question and will be carefully studied
as diverse sources of relevant data become available. However, one important leading indicator reflects the


1 Subsequent research (e.g., Bravata et al., 2021; Courtemanche et al., 2021, Goldhaber et al., 2021; Harris et al., 2021) has provided
mixed evidence on the role of in-person schools in COVID-19 transmission.
2 By way of contrast, only 18 percent of private-school students reported they were fully remote at this time.
                                                                                                                 2


enrollment decisions made by parents for the 2020-21 school year. Public-school enrollment at the K-12 level,
which typically increases by a fraction of a percentage point annually, fell by two percent in the fall of 2020, a
striking one-year loss of roughly 1.1 million students. These declines were larger in elementary and middle-
school grades and particularly dramatic in kindergarten, which is not required in most states.
        This study examines the impact of the school-reopening decisions made by public-school districts
(i.e., remote only, in person, or a hybrid) on their enrollment levels, drawing on unique data sources that track
district enrollment trajectories by grade level as well as the instructional mode chosen by districts for the 2020-
21 school year. Theoretically, the effects of these policy variables on enrollment decisions are uncertain. For
example, some parents may have been comparatively likely to keep their child enrolled in a district that offered
only remote (or hybrid) schooling if they viewed it as a way to safeguard the health of their children and their
families (i.e., by reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection and household transmission implied by in-person
schooling). Furthermore, district decisions to offer alternatives to traditional instruction could have reinforced
this sort of response by creating a salient signal of the risks associated with face-to-face instruction (i.e., an
inferred recommendation).
        Alternatively, the child-care burdens created when school districts did not offer in-person instruction
may have encouraged some public-school parents to disenroll their children. This factor could be considerably
more relevant in households with younger children to the extent that younger children both require more
intensive care and attention and are also less likely to contract or transmit COVID-19. Another potential
mechanism involves perceptions of school quality. Parents of public-school students may have viewed virtual
and hybrid schooling options as inferior (again, particularly for younger children) and, as a result, disenrolled
their children when face-to-face instruction was not offered. Finally, in the spirit of the "Peltzman Effect"
(Peltzman, 1975), parents may have responded to the externally imposed risk reduction implied by a switch
to hybrid and remote-only instruction with risk-compensating behaviors (i.e., disenrolling and seeking in-
person instruction for their children).
        Understanding the impact of these district choices on the disenrollment phenomenon is highly
relevant for several reasons. First, enrollment changes in response to the instructional mode chosen by school
districts provide direct evidence on the revealed instructional preferences of parents across different grade
levels and within the context of their local communities. However, the enrollment effects of instructional
modes can also provide insight into the varied educational consequences of these difficult policy choices. Such
findings are relevant both for understanding the consequences of the exceptional 2020-21 school year and for
informing the instructional challenges schools face in the coming school year as schools navigate a context of
uneven vaccinations and the growing prevalence of COVID-19 variants.
                                                                                                                          3


        For example, the expectation that many, if not most, of the students who have left public schools will
not return soon (or ever) has serious fiscal consequences for school districts. Because most of the departing
students appear to be younger, these financial consequences are also likely to be long-lived. The grade-specific
effects of school-reopening policies can also provide indirect evidence on their implications for teaching and
learning. Disenrollment from public schools implies that students have switched schools (e.g., to private
schools or home-schooling), intend to skip or delay kindergarten, and dropped out or become truant.3 The
negative consequences of dropping out of school are well established (e.g., Card, 1999). Similarly, the available
research suggests that switching schools (i.e., in particular, "reactive" moves) has negative consequences for
student outcomes (e.g., Welsh, 2017). Additionally, students who skipped kindergarten may bring unique
learning challenges to first grade (i.e., their first year of formal schooling). However, if a substantial number
of students "redshirt" into kindergarten this fall rather than attending first grade, it would imply an unusually
large cohort with resulting consequences for the classroom context (i.e., older peers, large class sizes). In the
next two sections, we describe the data and research designs we use to examine the enrollment effects of the
instructional choices districts made for the 2020-21 school year before turning to the results and conclusions.


                                                         I. Data
        Our analysis relies on three broad types of data. First, using both state and federal sources, we
constructed enrollment data by school district for each of the six school years from 2015-16 through 2020-
21. The federal reporting requirements ask states to identify their enrollment counts on or close to October
1, a convention that is used in state-sourced data as well. For the first five years, these enrollment data are
based on the federal source ­ the Common Core of Data (CCD) from the National Center for Education
Statistics (NCES) ­ and state sources. Because the CCD has not yet reported the district-by-grade enrollment
data for the 2020-21 school year, we rely on leading data that we collected directly from state-level departments
of education (i.e., through web searches and staff contacts) nationally as part of the Stanford School
Enrollment Project at Big Local News. Specifically, the key outcome measures are total district enrollment
(i.e., K-12 and ungraded students, excluding pre-kindergarten and adult students) as well as enrollment by
grade level (i.e., kindergarten, grades 1-5, grades 6-8, and grades 9-12). This sample only includes traditional
public-school districts and excludes administrative units and standalone charter-school networks. However,
we note that these data include enrollment in charter schools authorized by traditional school districts.


3A decomposition of the enrollment decline in Massachusetts (Dee and Murphy, forthcoming) suggests that more than 10 percent
may be due to dropping out and truancy. This reflects the residual decline that cannot be explained by pre-kindergarten and
kindergarten disenrollment, transfers to private schools or home-schooling, out-of-state mobility, and demographic change.
                                                                                                                4


        In the data appendix, we describe these data in more detail. The appendix also discusses three
overlapping quality-control assessments and the corresponding edits we implemented to ensure the accuracy
and comparability of these data. First, we constructed year-on-year percent changes in enrollment for every
school district in our sample and examined individual districts where the absolute value of these changes met
or exceeded a threshold of 10 percent. Second, we collected state-sourced district enrollment data for the
2019-20 school year and compared these data to their federally sourced counterparts (Figure A1). Third, we
compared state-sourced enrollment data for the 2020-21 school year to a recent, preliminary NCES release of
2020-21 data, which only reported PK - 12 totals at the district level. For most of the districts in our sample,
these checks suggested both the reliability of within-district enrollment changes over time and a tight
correspondence between data based on federal and state sources. However, this analysis also surfaced systemic
differences in reporting conventions across these sources for school districts in fourteen states as well as
several instances of misreporting in specific district-year observations. We describe these issues and the
corresponding edits in the appendix.
        Our second key data source identifies district-level opening plans. Specifically, we rely on tracking data
collected by Burbio (https://cai.burbio.com/school-opening-tracker/). Burbio monitors the instructional
mode status in nearly 1,200 school districts (i.e., including the nation's largest 200 districts) by auditing data
from "school district websites, Facebook pages, local news stories and other publicly available information."
They characterize districts by "the most in-person option available to the general student population" (i.e., in-
person, remote-only, or a hybrid). However, these data also capture the differentiated adoption of grade-specific
instructional modes within districts as well (e.g., in-person at the elementary level but remote-only at the high
school level). Through an agreement with Burbio, we have acquired their raw district-level audit data on
instructional mode at different points in time and by school level. We compared the Burbio data to other
independent sources on school-reopening polices and found it to be accurate (e.g., identifying districts that
received waivers from state policies). Burbio surveyed districts twice prior to the October 2020 enrollment
census (i.e., August 24th and September 8th). Our variable construction reflects the fact that district opening
plans changed over time and that we are interested in the district choice most relevant to parents' fall
enrollment decision. Therefore, we measure district opening plans using the audit on or directly preceding the
school year start date recorded by Burbio. For districts that began instruction prior to August 24th (n = 264)
we use the August survey.
        Because our core analysis relies on the school-opening data collected by Burbio, their sampling strategy
merits particular attention. The first stratum consists of the 232 most highly populated counties, which
represent approximately 28 percent of all public-school enrollment in the nation. Within the counties in this
                                                                                                                   5


stratum, they sampled school districts that represented about 90 percent of county enrollment (e.g., often the
only school district in the county). The second stratum consists of another 228 highly populated counties,
which account for 47 percent of all public-school students. Generally, Burbio audited 3 to 10 school districts
in each of these counties. The final stratum consists of all other counties, which account for roughly 25 percent
of the student population. Within this third stratum, Burbio audited a total of 130 school districts. This
sampling strategy implies that the Burbio districts cover 47 percent of the public-school enrollment in the
U.S. (i.e., roughly 35,000 schools in all 50 states). Our analytic sample includes, in turn, just over three quarters
of the Burbio districts (i.e., those in states where 2020-21 enrollment data are available, n=875), which serve
35 percent of all public-school students. We discuss below how this sample compares to school districts
nationally as well as how our analysis explores the generalizability of the findings based on this sample.
        Our third set of key data focuses on variables that varied over both location and time and may be
relevant to district reopening plans and to parents' decisions about public-school enrollment. To account for
COVID-19 prevalence we use a county-level rolling 7-day average of identified cases per 100,000 population
from The New York Times Covid-19 data repository (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). In our
preferred specification, we use the value at the district start date. We also include state-level variables
describing non-school policy responses to Covid-19 compiled in the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response
Tracker (OxCGRT) by the Blavatnik School of Government (https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker). These
measures track state decisions with respect to stay-at-home orders, maximum gathering size, restrictions on
public transportation and internal movement, workplace closures and other restrictions and recommendations
that could influence school instructional mode and parent perception of local COVID-19 risk. As with the
infection rate covariate, we estimate results using the policies in place at the school year start date.
        Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the key variables based on these three sources defined for
our analytical sample of 875 districts observed over each of six school years (n=5,250). We note that the
enrollment data in our sample largely parallel national trends (i.e., slightly positive annual growth before
declining roughly 3 percent in 2020-21). In our sample, we find that half of the districts chose remote-only
instruction while the fractions choosing in-person and hybrid models were 27 percent and 23 percent,
respectively. Most of these districts were also in states where at some workplaces were closed and public
events cancelled while 39 percent had recommended restrictions on public transit. We relied on other time-
invariant data to characterize the districts in our sample and to examine potentially heterogeneous responses
to school-reopening choices. Specifically, we identified the share of children in poverty within each district
using data from the Census Bureau's Small-Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program defined
for our baseline year, 2015-16. We also identified the racial/ethnic composition of each district's students at
                                                                                                                 6


baseline using CCD data. Finally, we used federal Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates
(EDGE) data to classify district locales (i.e., urban, suburban, town/rural). Relative to the nation, the districts
in our sample are more likely to be in urban or suburban settings (Table A1). They also serve lower
concentrations of white students and slightly higher concentrations of students in poverty (Table A1). In
ancillary analyses, we examine how our results vary across subsets of the analytical sample defined by these
traits.


                                                      II. Methods
          Our first approach to examining the determinants of the natural log of enrollment in district d in year
t (i.e., !"# ) relies on a conventional "difference in differences" (DD) specification that conditions on both
district-specific and year-specific fixed effects (i.e., $" , &# ):
                            !"# = $" + &# + )* (," × ./01# ) + )3 (4" × ./01# ) + 56"# + 7"#                    (1)
We allow remote-only (i.e., ," ) and hybrid (i.e., 4" ) to have distinct effects relative to in-person instruction.
However, we also test the null hypothesis that remote-only and hybrid instructional models have the same
effects (i.e.,49 :)* = )3 ). In some specifications, we compare remote-only instruction to all others (i.e., )3 =
0). The variable, 6"# , captures other candidate determinants varying within districts over time (e.g., COVID-
19 case rates and pandemic-related policies). The standard errors allow for clustering at the district level. We
also explore the parallel-trends assumption implicit in the DD specification through estimating event-study
specifications of the following form:
                                                       B                B
                                                            ?                D
                               !"# = $" + &# + <           => ," @#A> + <   => 4" @#A>
                                                       >C3              >C3

                                       +)* (," × ./01# ) + )3 (4" × ./01# ) + 56"# + 7"#                        (2)
In this specification, the binary indicator, @#A> , equals 1 for school years E years before t. The coefficients of
                 ? D
interest (i.e., => , => ) identify how enrollment in districts that chose remote-only and hybrid instruction varied
in the years before that policy choice (i.e., fall 2015 through fall 2018) relative to a reference year (i.e., fall
2019) and districts that chose in-person instruction for fall 2020. We examine the statistical significance of
                                    ?    ?    ?    ?               D    D    D    D
these policy leads by testing 4F : =B = =G = =H = =3 = 0 and 4F : =B = =G = =H = =3 = 0.
          For the enrollment outcomes we study, we see clear evidence that the parallel-trends assumption is
sometimes violated. In particular, school districts that chose remote-only instruction for the 2020-21 school
year tended to be larger, urban districts, which had distinctive comparative trends towards decreasing
enrollment that preceded the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 1, Table A2). Failing to account for this prior
                                                                                                                 7


trend could imply a negative bias in the estimated effect of remote-only instruction on enrollment. To address
the implied internal-validity threat, we present estimates that control for prior, group-specific trends. In the
program-evaluation literature, particularly in the fields of health and education, this approach is commonly
understood as a "comparative interrupted time series" (CITS) design (Cook, Campbell, and Shadish, 2002;
Jacob et al., 2016). By way of contrast, the DD approach effectively relies on the comparison group's change
from its baseline mean as the relevant counterfactual. However, the CITS approach instead uses the
comparison group's change from its baseline trend. Specifically, a basic CITS specification for our context
takes the following form:
            !"# = $* I" + $3 4" + &* !JKL# + &3 (I" × !JKL# ) + &H (4" × !JKL# ) + &G ./01# +
                              )* (I" × ./01# ) + )3 (4" × ./01# ) + 56"# + 7"#                                  (3)
where !JKL# is a linear trend. We also estimate a version of this specification that, like a DD design,
conditions on both district and year fixed effects as well as linear trends unique to each group:
                            !"# = $" + &# + &3 (," × !JKL# ) + &H (4" × !JKL# ) +
                                      )* (," × ./01# ) + )3 (4" × ./01# ) + 56"# + 7"#                          (4)
The coefficients of interest (i.e., )* , )3 ) identify the 2020-21 enrollment change unique to districts that chose
an alternative to in-person instruction and conditional on prior trends unique to each group. Fry and Hatfield
(2021) note that the difference between such a DD design with group trends and a generalized CITS
specification is "semantic" in that "both construct the same counterfactual outcomes for the treated group."
        One potential limitation of the specifications in equations (3) and (4) is the maintained assumption
that the prior trends unique to remote-only and hybrid districts are indeed linear. We explore the validity and
empirical relevance of this assumption in five ways. One is to consider visual evidence of the enrollment
trends by district type both to assess the linearity of the prior, group-specific trends and the credibility of the
impact estimates we report. Second, we also discuss the results of specifications that allow for a quadratic
term in the group-specific trends. Third, as a falsification exercise, we discuss the estimated effects of a
district's chosen instructional mode on kindergarten enrollment across states where kindergarten was and was
not mandatory. In the absence of specification error, we would expect the impact of district instructional
mode on kindergarten to be attenuated in states where kindergarten was mandatory.
        Fourth, we also explore the robustness of our findings by implementing the "honest" DD sensitivity
analysis recently introduced by Rambachan and Roth (2020). Specifically, we calculate 95% confidence
intervals for our key impact estimates under varying assumptions of the value, M (i.e., the largest allowable
change in the slope of an underlying linear trend between two consecutive periods). Our preferred estimates
                                                                                                                              8


(i.e., equation 4) impose the assumption that M = 0 (i.e., a constant linear trend). However, these sensitivity
analyses allow us to assess how wrong this assumption could be while still allowing us to reject the null
hypothesis (i.e., the "breakdown" value of M). Fifth, while our results generally suggest that inferences based
on equation (4) are valid, we also present complementary results based on a less restrictive "generalized
synthetic control" (GSC) approach that accommodates violations of the parallel-trends assumption (Xu, 2017;
Liu et al., 2020). The GSC estimates are based on an interactive fixed effects specification that models time-
varying confounds as latent factors and form a counterfactual for each treated district in the treatment period.
The GSC-based estimate of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) is the average of the difference
between the observed outcome and its counterfactual estimate for all the treated observations.

                                                        III. Results
         Figure 1 illustrates average K-12 district enrollment by year and fall 2019 reopening status (i.e., in-
person, hybrid, or remote-only). In order to assess these comparative changes more clearly, these data are
indexed so that enrollment for fall 2015 equals 100. These conditional means show that fall-2019 enrollment
fell dramatically across all three types of districts. However, they also indicate distinct (and quite linear) trends
across these district types prior to the focal 2019-20 school year. In particular, between fall 2015 and fall 2019,
the enrollment gap between in-person and remote-only districts grew by 2.07 percent (i.e., an annual
differential trend of 0.52 percent). Between fall 2019 and 2020, enrollment in in-person and remote-only
districts fell by 1.99 and 3.32 percent, respectively. Combining these data suggests that, enrollment in remote-
only districts fell by 0.81 percent relative to in-person districts, after adjusting for their comparative trends. In
contrast, districts that chose hybrid instruction show a more modest prior trend and a fall-2019 decline in
enrollment of 2.7 percent.
         In Table 2, we present the key results of regressions that estimate these effects parametrically (i.e.,
equations (1), (3), and (4)). A basic DD specification suggests that remote-only instruction reduced enrollment
by a statistically significant 2.4 percent relative to in-person instruction while hybrid instruction had small and
statistically insignificant effects. However, the pre-existing trend towards lower enrollment in remote-only
districts (i.e., more urban districts that were losing enrollment prior to the pandemic) implies that a DD
estimator overstates the impact of this policy choice.4 The remaining results in Table 2 are consistent with
that DD bias. That is, spare CITS specifications and DD specifications that condition on remote-only and
hybrid linear trends (i.e., columns 2 through 5) indicate that the estimated impact of adopting remote-only


4Event-study estimates based on equation (2) are presented in Table A2, column (1). The hypothesis of common year effects in the
"pre" period is rejected for remote-only but not for hybrid instruction.
                                                                                                                            9


instruction is smaller but statistically significant (i.e., implying a 0.79 to 1.1 percent additional reduction in
enrollment). These results also indicate that the pre-existing remote-only trend (i.e., enrollment decreases by
0.52 percent per year relative to in-person districts) is statistically significant. However, neither of the variables
related to hybrid instruction are statistically significant. And F-tests consistently reject the hypothesis that
remote-only and hybrid instruction had similar enrollment effects.
         The estimated effects of remote-only instruction are slightly larger in specifications that include the
district-year controls (i.e., columns 4 and 5). The cancellation of public events, in particular, implied a
statistically significant increase in district enrollment (i.e., 1.5 percent) and is positively correlated with the
adoption of remote-only instruction. We also explored the heterogeneity in these estimated effects by baseline
district traits. We find that the effects of remote-only instruction do not vary across districts serving lower
and higher concentrations of students in poverty (Table A3). However, we do find that the disenrollment
effects of remote-only instruction are larger in districts serving more rural communities, higher concentrations
of Hispanic students, and lower concentrations of Black students.
         We explore the robustness of these results based on linear group trends in three additional ways. First,
we find that adding quadratic group trends results in a similar estimate (Table A4). Second, we conducted the
sensitivity analysis recommended by Rambachan and Roth (2020). This sensitivity analysis (Figure A2)
indicates that the enrollment trend unique to remote-only districts would have to deviate from linearity by M
> 0.004 in order to no longer reject the null hypothesis. This "breakdown" value is about 150 percent of the
largest slope change observed in the pretreatment period. It is also equivalent to 67 percent of the upper limit
on a one-sided 95% confidence interval for the largest slope change. Third, we find that generalized synthetic
control (GSC) estimates also suggest the negative and statistically significant impact of remote-only instruction
on enrollment with noticeably larger estimates for total enrollment (Table A5). Event-study estimates based
on the GSC results (Figure A3) suggest this procedure performs well in addressing time-varying confounds,
an inference supported by an equivalence test (Liu et al. 2020).
         We turn next to the enrollment results by grade level. The comparative trend data in Figure 2 suggest
that the enrollment declines attributable to remote-only instruction are concentrated in kindergarten and, to
a lesser extent, elementary-school grades. The trends in kindergarten and elementary-school enrollment also
suggest the existence of quite linear comparative trends by reopening status prior to fall 2020.5 Table 3 presents
the key results from corresponding regressions that control for these linear trends and other time-varying
covariates (i.e., equation (4)). These results suggest that remote-only instruction led to particularly large

5 Event-study estimates in Table A2 (columns 2 through 5) underscore the magnitude and statistical significance of these prior
trends, particularly for remote-only districts.
                                                                                                                                 10


enrollment reductions in lower grades and that these effects diminished monotonically in higher grade levels.6
Specifically, these estimates suggest that remote-only instruction reduced kindergarten enrollment by 3 to 4
percent and elementary-school enrollment by 1 percent while having smaller and statistically imprecise effects
at the middle and high-school levels. These results also suggest that hybrid instruction did not have statistically
significant effects with the exception of a small, positive estimate for high-school enrollment, a finding that
does not appear consistent with either the visual evidence (Figure 2) or the event-study estimates (Table A2).
         We explore the robustness of these grade-specific results in several ways. First, we assess the credibility
of the substantial kindergarten effect of remote-only instruction by estimating these effects separately for
districts in states where kindergarten was mandatory and where it was not. We find that the remote-only
instruction had a smaller and statistically insignificant enrollment effect in states where kindergarten is
mandatory (i.e., a 3.9 percent decrease, p-value = 0.125). In contrast, in states where kindergarten is optional,
remote-only instruction reduced enrollment by 4.6 percent (p-value = 0.0001). This treatment heterogeneity
is consistent with the hypothesis that the estimated effect of remote-only instruction on kindergarten
enrollment is genuine. We also find that the kindergarten result is robust to conditioning on quadratic group-
specific trends (Table A4). The elementary-school enrollment effect of remote-only instruction is sensitive to
conditioning on quadratic trends. However, this appears to be due to an increase in imprecision rather than a
substantial decrease in the point estimate. For example, the point estimate from Table A4 (i.e., -0.87 percent)
would be statistically significant with the corresponding standard error from Table 3.
         The Rambachan-Roth (2020) sensitivity analysis also suggests the robustness of the kindergarten result
(Figure A2). Specifically, the deviation from trend linearity required to "breakdown" this result (i.e., M of
roughly 0.0275 or larger) is nearly three times as large as the largest deviation from linearity observed in the
pre-treatment period (and roughly equivalent to the 95% upper confidence limit on this deviation). However,
for higher grade levels (i.e., elementary, middle, and high-school), this analysis does suggest more sensitivity
to the presumed linearity of the group trends. Specifically, the results in Figure A2 indicate that rejection of
the null hypothesis will no longer hold if deviations from linearity resemble the maximum deviations observed
in the pre-treatment period. Generalized synthetic control (GSC) estimates (Table A5) provide
complementary evidence on the robustness of these grade-specific estimates in Table 3. The GSC estimates
also suggest a robust impact of remote-only instruction on kindergarten enrollment. These estimates also
suggest that remote-only instruction led to smaller enrollment declines at higher grade levels, though some of

6 We also estimated these effects in models using enrollment by each grade. We plot these estimates and their confidence intervals
in Figure A4. Interestingly, these results suggest that remote-only instruction led to a statistically significant decline in grade-9
enrollment but not in other high-school grades. This heterogeneity is consistent with the hypothesis that parents were particularly
willing to switch their child's school in response to remote-only instruction if they were already undertaking a school transition.
                                                                                                                   11


these inferences are sensitive to the inclusion of district-year controls (Table A5). The corresponding GSC-
based event-study figures (Figure A5) and equivalence tests suggest that this estimation procedure performs
well (Liu et al., 2020).


                                                 IV. Conclusions
        During the first full school-year after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, enrollment in U.S. public
schools fell dramatically (i.e., a decline of 1.1 million students or 2 percent of prior K-12 enrollment). This
enrollment decline is an important leading indicator of the educational impact of the pandemic. In particular,
the existence and magnitude of this enrollment decline implies a myriad of potential consequences for schools
and students. These include the likely fiscal strain on public schools of declining enrollment as well as the
diverse developmental implications for students related to the underlying behaviors driving enrollment
declines such as kindergarten skipping and redshirting, school switching, truancy, and dropping out. Arguably,
the major policy lever relevant to these enrollment decisions was (and continues to be) the instructional mode
states and districts choose for their schools (i.e., in-person, remote-only, or a hybrid). In the fall of 2020,
policymakers confronted an exceptionally difficult choice about how to reopen schools; one that required
them to balance the public-health risks to their students and communities with the educational and economic
harm of remote instruction.
        In this study, we rely on several unique data sources to construct quasi-experimental evidence on how
their fall 2020 reopening decisions influenced the disenrollment phenomenon. Our results suggest that the
decision to offer remote-only instruction last fall contributed meaningfully to disenrollment from public
schools. Specifically, our estimates suggest that offering remote-only instruction increased disenrollment by
42 percent (i.e., a change from 2.6 to 3.7 percent) relative to in-person instruction while hybrid instruction
had small and statistically insignificant effects. To frame these effect sizes against the national decline in public-
school enrollment, we note that public schools previously enrolled roughly 49 million students and that
roughly 57 percent of students faced remote-only instruction as of November 2020 (Henderson, Peterson,
and West, 2021). The additional enrollment decline in remote-only districts (i.e., 1.1 percentage points) implies
that public schools lost roughly 300,000 K-12 students as a result of these decisions (i.e., 49 million  0.57 
0.011). This implies that the widespread adoption of remote-only instruction explains roughly a quarter of the
disenrollment from public schools. Notably, we also find evidence that the effects of remote-only instruction
on the decline in public-school enrollment were particularly concentrated in kindergarten and elementary-
school grades.
                                                                                                              12


        Overall, these results suggest that significant numbers of parents, particularly parents of younger
children, did not want their children to participate in remote instruction. Notably, this pattern of revealed
preferences corresponds strongly with the conclusions of a National Academies of Science, Engineering, and
Medicine (2020) panel that recommended full-time, in-person instruction for students in grades K-5. Beyond
revealing these parental preferences, these results have at least two broad implications for understanding the
consequences of school-reopening decisions. First, these results suggest that the decision to offer remote-only
instruction will have negative fiscal consequences for school districts if disenrolled students do not return. In
particular, because the disenrolled students are disproportionately younger, this effect may be long-lasting.
Uncertainty about the instructional model local public schools will offer in the near future (e.g., in response
to the growing prevalence of COVID-19 variants) may also contribute to sustained disenrollment.
        Second, these results provide early evidence on the educational challenges created by these reopening
decisions (and the pandemic, more generally). For example, the sharp drop in kindergarten enrollment
suggests schools (i.e., particularly those that offered remote-only instruction) will face the challenge of
educating rising first graders who are in their first experience of formal schooling. However, to the extent that
a substantial number of students instead "redshirts" into kindergarten classes this fall, schools may face the
staffing and pedagogical challenge of managing an unusually large, mixed-age cohort. In the absence of
responsive staffing, these COVID-19 redshirters and their peers could experience unusually large class sizes
throughout their schooling. The enrollment declines we document suggest that offering remote-only
instruction could also have contributed to truancy, particularly among elementary-school students (i.e., to the
extent, these students are not homeschooled or attending private schools). However, the absence of evidence
that remote-only instruction reduced high-school enrollment suggests it did not contribute meaningfully to
dropout behavior.
        Clearly, there is still much to learn about the educational experiences of students who disenrolled
during the 2020-21 school year (as well as those who remained in their schools) and that will be possible as
richer data (e.g., longitudinal student-level data) become available (Oster, 2021). In that regard, we note that
community and family contexts also appear to play an important role in moderating the enrollment impact of
remote-only instruction. For example, the evidence that the disenrollment effects of remote-only instruction
were larger in more rural communities and in districts serving higher concentrations of Hispanic students
raises questions about the sources of this heterogeneity (e.g., differential access to high-speed Internet and
relevant devices). Interestingly, the disenrollment effect of remote instruction in districts serving higher
concentrations of Black students was nearly twice as large as in districts serving lower concentrations of Black
students, a finding consistent with the survey evidence that Black parents disproportionately supported remote
                                                                                                             13


learning (Harris, 2020). The drivers and policy implications of these varied contextual factors merit further
scrutiny. Regardless, these results provide clear and leading evidence that offering remote-only rather than in-
person instruction was a highly consequential choice for schools and students.

                                          DATA APPENDIX

    I.       Sample construction
The construction of our analytical sample of school districts begins with the nearly 1,200 school
districts for which Burbio tracked school-enrollment modes. We excluded from the Burbio sample
and our analysis nine observations representing charter-school networks and several entities that
functioned as unconventional, administrative districts (e.g., a multi-county unit managing magnet
schools, others managing vocational schools). As noted in the text, this sample of school districts
draws from all 50 states, overrepresents larger school districts, and represents nearly half of all public-
school students in the U.S. We matched these district data to federal and state data on district
enrollment for the 2015-16 through 2020-21 school years. For the focal 2020-21 school year, we relied
exclusively on state-sourced data collected through the Stanford School Enrollment Project as federal
data are not yet available. Specifically, these 2020-21 data were available for 34 states. Our resulting
sample of 875 traditional school districts covers 35% of all 2019-20 K-12 public-school enrollment in
the U.S. (Table A1).

As noted in the text, we conducted three overlapping quality-control assessments of these enrollment
data. One was to construct year-on-year percent changes in enrollment for every school district in our
sample and to examine individual districts where the absolute value of these changes met or exceeded
an arbitrary threshold (i.e., 10 percent). Second, we compared the state-sourced enrollment data for
the 2020-21 school year to a recent and preliminary federal release of 2020-21 data, which only
reported PK-12 totals at the district level. Third, we also constructed state-sourced data for the 2019-
20 school year and compared these data to the CCD counts and examined individual districts where
the absolute value of this gap exceeded 3% at any grade-level, or overall. We found that these counts
were identical for 79% of grade-district observations in the 21 states where a longitudinal enrollment
profile was constructed using both CCD and state sources. Furthermore, 98% of these observations
exhibited a gap in student counts of less than one percent of the federally sourced value (see Figure
A1). However, these checks also surfaced several issues with state and federal reporting conventions
as well as some misreporting that guided further investigation and edits to the data.

Specifically, in 14 states (i.e., CA, CT, HI, ID, IN, MO, NJ, NM, NY, OH, OK, PA, UT and WA), we
found evidence of fairly systemic misalignment between state and federally sourced enrollment counts
for at least some districts. Our investigation indicated that the reasons for this incongruity varied by
state. For example, in some cases, federal sources were inconsistent in identifying charter-school
enrollment that was under the aegis of a traditional school district. In some states, these sources also
differed in how they categorized the grade of special-education students, 4-year olds in the first year
of a 2-year kindergarten, and students receiving services from alternative education programs or
private vendors. To ensure the comparability of within-district enrollment changes over time, we relied
exclusively on state-sourced data for the sampled districts in 12 of these states. State-sourced 2015-16
data were not available for OK; therefore, we combined a single year of federally sourced data with
state data for 2016-17 through 2020-21. The federal enrollment data for OK during this period relied
on reporting standards consistent with state data (e.g., we vetted this by comparing federal and state-
sourced OK data for 2016-17). In New Mexico, the disparity between federal and state counts was
due to the inclusion of some private-school students in the state-sourced district-level data. So, we
used school-level 2020-21 enrollment data from the state to remove private-school students and vetted
these results using the preliminary federal release of PK-12 enrollment data for 2020-21. We ultimately
combine 2015-16 through 2019-20 federal data with the single year of edited state data for New
Mexico.
The remaining edits guided by our quality-control checks and the resulting investigations focused on
district-specific reporting issues. Specifically, in addition to the three checks described above, we also
identified and investigated every district in our sample that started to report enrollment in grades they
did not previously serve, as well as districts that reported totals that did not correspond to their NCES-
defined grade spans. We found two districts, Norwich School District (CT) and Oroville City
Elementary (CA) that reported sporadic non-zero counts in high school grades, but district websites
stated they only served K-8 students and, in the case of Norwich, adult education students. We exclude
grade 9 through grade 12 totals for these districts in all years. Relatedly, we note three districts in
California (Redding Elementary, Chula Vista Elementary and Jefferson Elementary) that report small
numbers of high school students in all years but are assigned "NA" status in the Burbio audit for
grades 9-12 and, for Chula Vista Elementary, grades 6-8. We exclude totals from the grade levels
without a defined fall 2020 instructional mode in all years. Similarly, grade 6 totals from a further two
districts, Hope Elementary and Del Mar Elementary (both CA), are dropped due to "NA" middle
school Burbio values for those districts.

We also identified three school districts where there appear to be data-entry errors in the federal files.
Both state and federal sources indicate that Bensalem Township School District (PA) had 4
kindergarten students in 2015-16. However, they typically report over 400 kindergarten students.
Therefore, we imputed this value using the grade-1 enrollment for 2016-17. Similarly, the federal data
for Rochester School District (WA) dramatically understates for 2018-19 enrollment for grades 2, 5,
and 8. We replaced these values with state-sourced data which are consistent with the longitudinal
profile of the district. Additionally, the 2020-2021 state-sourced file for Pennsylvania enrollment
reported 0 grade 3 students in Penns Valley School District (PA), when both federal and state data
reported approximately 100 students for that grade in prior years. This value was replaced with the
state-sourced student total for grade 2 in 2019-2020.

We also found that, for two school districts in New Jersey during the 2015-16 school (Branchburg
Township and Commercial Township), the federal data reports positive enrollment in grades not
served by the district. We exclude the enrollment counts for these grades. We also found that state
but not federal sources for Pendleton School District (OR) reported small counts of students in
alternative schools within district totals. We used school-level data from 2020-21 to manually remove
these students from our totals.

Additionally, we observed a change in how enrollment in New York City totals were reported by grade
in fall 2020. In prior years, New York City reported approximately 20,000 ungraded students per year.
For 2020-21 the ungraded counted was under 500 students. As we cannot verify how these students
who would previously have been classified as "ungraded" were distributed into the grade-level totals,
we dropped New York City grade-level enrollment counts from our dataset but do retain the K-12
all-New York City total in our analytical sample.

We also note limited cases of student count suppression that exist in our enrollment data. First, there
are five districts where the 2020-21 state reports suppressed the low-enrollment count for a single
grade: Hitchcock ISD (TX), Mission CISD (TX), Ajo Unified School District (AZ), Littlefield Unified
School District (AZ), Harrison County School District (MS). In all of these cases, we also find that
our results are robust to excluding these 5 districts. In our analysis, we impute these values using the
2019-20 data for the prior grade with the exception of Mission CISD (TX). For that district we opt
not to impute the value from the prior year (944 students) as the suppressed value is top-coded at 940
students. In this case, we retain the top-coded value. Additionally, for about half of sample districts in
Ohio, fewer than 10 ungraded students were reported in each year. Because of these low counts, the
exact value is masked. We impute a total of 4.5 for these observations. These imputations become
part of the total K-12 enrollment variable, which is based on aggregating K through 12 and ungraded
enrollment. However, our results are robust to dropping these districts where some data are masked.

To ensure that no conflation between suppressed, missing and zero totals had occurred, we
investigated all zero counts within a district's federally defined grade-span excepting pre-kindergarten
and adult education. NCES directory information indicates that El Dorado Union High serves grade
8, but it reported totals of 0 across all years for this grade level so those grade-level observations are
dropped from the sample. There is also one school district in the state of Washington (Skykomish
School District) which has zero enrollment in some grades and years. We impute 0.5 enrollment for
those observations so that the log transform is defined and condition on a dummy variable that
identifies imputed observations. Finally, multiple years of kindergarten (i.e., 4-year-old-K and 5-year-
old-K) were reported in PA and WI. We classify only the 5-year-old cohort as kindergartners. We
observe six years of enrollment data for all grades served within every district in our sample, so every
district-grade-year panel is balanced

We also identified three districts with dramatic changes in school composition between the 2015-16
and 2020-21 school years: New Orleans Public Schools (LA), Maricopa Unified (CA) and Buckeye
Union Elementary (CA). The governance of New Orleans schools changed in 2018, while the
California districts became sites for rapidly growing charter schools in recent years. All three districts
were dropped from our sample. We also exclude one district from Florida (Polk County) where federal
and state data are not comparable, but a clear solution using school-level data could not be identified.

We further note that California, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Oklahoma did not directly report
grade-specific counts at the district level, so we aggregated school-level totals by district to construct
our outcome measures. In addition to the above quality checks, we spot-checked districts in these
states using state data portals to confirm the aggregation yielded accurate totals.

After these corrections to the data, we repeated our outlier analysis to check for further issues and
found none. Some districts retained in our sample did experience year-to-year enrollment changes
greater than 10 percent, but when these changes appeared to be genuine (e.g., following a natural
disaster) we made no adjustments.

    II.      COVID-19 Policy Data
Based on the policy variation observed in our sample, we dichotomized three categorical OxCGRT
COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical intervention variables to use as district-year controls. First,
"workclose" takes on a value of 1 when states "require closing (or work from home) for some sectors
or categories of workers" and 0 when states merely recommend this. No other work closure policies
were observed in our sample. Similarly, no states in our sample had "no measures" with respect to
public events at the outset of the 2020-21 school year, so "nopublicevents" is 1 when canceling public
events if required, and 0 if canceling is only recommend. Finally, we combine required and recommend
closures (which may include substantial volume reduction) of public transit in defining the
"closetransit" policy variable. The value of "closetransit" is 0 when no measures related to public
transit are in place.

middle school grades (n = 5,184) and 826 serve grades 9-12 (n = 4,956). The dependent variable is the
natural log of enrollment. The reference category is relative to fall 2019, one year prior to post. All models
include district fixed effects (FE) and year FE and district-year covariates. The district-year covariates
include four pandemic-related variables: county-level COVID-19 case rate per person, workplace
closures, public event cancellations, and public-transit restrictions (see Table 1 and text for details).

Notes: These estimates are based on data from 875 school districts observed over each of six years (i.e., fall 2015 through fall 2020, n = 5,250).
The dependent variable is the natural log of enrollment. All models include district fixed effects (FE), year FE, and district-year covariates. The
district-year covariates include found pandemic-related variables: county-level COVID-19 case rate per person, workplace closures, public event
cancellations, and public-transit restrictions (see Table 1 and text for details). The share of students who are Black, Hispanic or in poverty is
measured at the fall 2015 baseline (see text for additional details). Data on urbancity are from Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates
from NCES. Poverty data are from the Small-Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program by the U.S. Census Bureau. Race/ethnicity
data are from the NCES' CCD. Information on state kindergarten policies is from the Education Commission of States (ECS). Standard errors

Notes: Coefficients estimated for Remote Only X Post are estimated with 428 districts (n = 2,568) for kindergarten through
grade 5 enrollment, 440 districts for grades 6-8 (n = 2,640), 414 districts for grades 9-12 (n = 2,484) and 437 districts (n =
2,550) for K-12 enrollment. The district-year covariates include found pandemic-related variables: county-level COVID-19
case rate per person, workplace closures, public event cancellations, and public-transit restrictions (see Table 1 and text for
details). Standard errors are computed using 1,000 block bootstraps clustered at the district level.
