                                         ABSTRACT

There has been little rigorous evaluation of immigration barriers intended to improve domestic
terms of employment by shrinking the workforce. We study one such barrier, a policy change that
excluded almost half a million Mexican bracero seasonal agricultural workers from the United
States. Using novel data to measure state-level exposure to the policy, we reject the wage effect
of bracero exclusion predicted by theory in the absence of induced technical change. We fail to
reject the hypothesis that exclusion did not affect U.S. agricultural wages or employment.
Important mechanisms include adoption of less labor-intensive technologies and shifts in crop
mix.

A large literature evaluates how active labor market policy affects workers’ wages and employ-
ment (LaLonde 2016; Crépon and van den Berg 2016). One class of these interventions is little-
studied relative to its policy importance: specific immigration policy interventions designed to
raise domestic wages and employment by reducing the total size of the workforce. Recent the-
oretical contributions suggest that labor scarcity can have ex ante ambiguous effects on wages
under endogenous technological advance that alters labor’s marginal product. This can result in
a flat or even upward-sloping labor demand curve—under models of directed technical change
(Acemoğlu 2002, 2007; Acemoğlu and Autor 2011) or models where production technologies of
differing input intensities co-exist in equilibrium (Beaudry and Green 2003, 2005; Caselli and
Coleman 2006; Beaudry et al. 2010; Manuelli and Seshadri 2014). But the applicability of these
models in practice remains an open empirical question (Acemoğlu 2010, 1071), and the limited
rigorous evidence to date does not directly evaluate changes in workforce policy (Lewis 2011;
Hornbeck and Naidu 2014; Hanlon 2015).


In this paper we evaluate the labor market effects of a large active labor market policy exper-
iment in the United States, a change in immigration barriers excluding roughly half a million
seasonally-employed Mexican farm workers from the labor force. This was the December 31,
1964 abrogation of the manual laborer (‘bracero’) agreements between the United States and
Mexico. Bracero exclusion was conceived and executed as a federal policy measure to improve
wages and employment for domestic farm workers. We build a simple model to clarify assump-
tions about the production function that would or would not lead this policy change to meet its
goals as active labor market policy. We gather novel, primary archival data on the geographic
locations of bracero workers, allowing us to construct the first complete database of state-level
exposure to nationwide bracero exclusion. This allows us to test the model’s prediction that the
economy adjusts to bracero exclusion by technological advance in subsectors where that is pos-
sible, and by Rybczynski adjustment otherwise—in either case without substantial labor-market
effects.


The contribution of this work is to test a model of endogenous technical change stimulated by a
very large reduction in labor supply with a natural quasi-experiment, and to evaluate the impact
of a type of active labor market policy that is rarely directly evaluated. The literature testing
models of endogenous technical change, going back to Hayami and Ruttan (1970), lacks a policy


                                               1
experiment of deliberate labor supply reduction. And much of the literature using natural quasi-
experiments to evaluate the labor-market effects of immigration evaluates the effects of changes
in the ‘push’ of political refugees overseas, rather than changes in the ‘pull’ of immigration regu-
lation.1 But ‘refugee push’ and ‘policy pull’ effects could differ, given that refugees enter the labor
market differently from other migrants (e.g. Cortes 2004), and the large majority of migrants are
not refugees. Very recently the immigration literature has turned to evaluating labor-market ef-
fects of real-world changes to immigration policy restrictions (e.g. Beerli and Peri 2015; Kennan
2017), but evidence remains scant, and the bracero program in particular remains little-studied
(Kosack 2016).2 This is in part because immigration policies—like licensing restrictions in trade
policy—are inherently difficult to quantify (Beine et al. 2015). Historical quasi-experiments are
a largely untapped resource, both to establish short-run causal identification and to explore the
speed of adjustment over time (Lewis 2013, 177, 182).


We find that bracero exclusion had little measurable effect on the labor market for domestic
farm workers. Pre- and post-exclusion farm wages and farm employment were similar in states
highly exposed to exclusion—which lost roughly one third of hired seasonal labor—and in states
with no exposure. Bracero workers were not substantially replaced in the years immediately
following exclusion with domestic workers, unauthorized Mexican workers, or authorized non-
Mexican foreign workers. We find instead that employers adjusted to exclusion, as predicted
by our model of endogenous technical change, with large changes in technology adoption and
crop production. We reject the semielasticity of wages to labor scarcity implied by the model
in the absence of endogenous technical change, and offer direct evidence of induced technical
change. These findings suggest that new theories of technological change can inform the design
and evaluation of active labor market policy.


Below in Section 1 we describe the exclusion of bracero workers and prior research on its eco-

   1 Studies  exploiting overseas refugee ‘push’ for identification include most influential studies of the labor-market
effects of immigration based on natural experiments: Card (1990); Hunt (1992); Carrington and de Lima (1996); Fried-
berg (2001); Angrist and Kugler (2003); Gandal et al. (2004); Glitz (2012); Braun and Omar Mahmoud (2014); Borjas
and Doran (2015); Foged and Peri (2016).
    2 Studies that have evaluated the effect of immigration on firms’ technological choices do not evaluate the impact of
a specific policy decision to admit or exclude migrants (e.g. González and Ortega 2011; Lafortune et al. 2015). A small
strand of literature evaluates the effect of changes in immigration policy on migration, finding that visa requirements
tend to markedly reduce bilateral mobility, but does not test the effects of these changes on labor-market conditions
or technological change in the migrant-destination country (Ortega and Peri 2013; Freier 2014; Bertoli and Fernández-
Huertas 2015; Lawson and Roychoudhury 2016).

nomic effects. Section 2 then presents a stylized model of the labor-market effects of active
labor supply reduction policy under endogenous technical advance. We also consider alterna-
tive modeling approaches which yield similar results. Section 3 describes our novel archival data.
Sections 4 and 5 present empirical tests of the model, and Section 6 concludes.



1     The exclusion of bracero workers

The exclusion of bracero workers from the United States was one of the largest-ever active labor-
market policies of workforce reduction designed to improve domestic terms of employment
within the targeted sector. Here we review the history of the intervention and the literature
that has sought to evaluate its effects.


1.1     The bracero agreements


The United States and Mexico made a set of three bilateral agreements to regulate Mexico-U.S.
flows of temporary low-skill labor, spanning almost the entire period from 1942 through 1964.3
At first this bracero program supplied Mexican labor to a mix of manual jobs in U.S. agriculture,
railroads, mining, and construction, raising remittance receipts and human capital investment in
Mexico (Kosack 2016). After World War 2 the program evolved to focus almost entirely on agri-
culture, and grew to supply almost half a million seasonal workers each year to U.S. farms, with
contracts typically lasting between six weeks and six months (Salandini 1973, 158). The Kennedy
administration began the process of bracero exclusion in March 1962, by making braceros “far less
attractive” to farmers by greatly raising the required wage rate (Craig 1971, 180). The Johnson
administration completed bracero exclusion at the end of 1964 by fully terminating the final iter-
ation of these agreements. To date, the program “has been widely criticized and not thoroughly
studied” (Durand 2007, 25).


The bracero agreements are sometimes portrayed as a government policy to ‘import’ labor to
offset shortages originating in the absence of U.S. workers during World War Two (e.g. Scruggs
1963) and the Korean War (e.g. Morgan 2004, 127). They are more correctly described as a re-
    3 Thetwo countries created much smaller bilateral labor agreements, also sometimes called bracero agreements,
in 1910 and during 1919–1921.


                                                       3
laxation of restrictions on private employers’ contracting with Mexican workers, given that the
principal lever of government policy in regulating migration—as in regulating trade—is the de-
gree of restriction on private firms.4 Long before the bracero agreements, there was large-scale
private-sector Mexican labor supply to the U.S. Southwest and Great Plains states, from the late
19th century through the 1920s (Clark 1908; Gamio 1930; Smith 1981; Durand et al. 2000). In Ari-
zona, Kansas, and New Mexico, the Mexican-born fraction of the labor force was much higher
in 1930—in peacetime—than it would be again until after 1990 (Borjas and Katz 2007, 19). In 1929
began 13 years of tight restrictions including mass deportations that reduced the Mexican-born
fraction of the U.S. by a third.5 The bracero agreements temporarily eased these restrictions,
from the 1940s until bracero exclusion after 1964. The beginning of the bracero program did not
create U.S. demand for Mexican labor or Mexican supply of that labor, but the termination of the
program did tightly restrict supply, as the 1929–1942 restrictions had previously done.


1.2     Bracero exclusion as active labor market policy


The principal policy goal of excluding braceros starting in 1965 was to improve labor-market
conditions for U.S. farm workers by reducing the size of the workforce. “The main reason given
for the discontinuation of the program at the time was the assertion that the Bracero Program de-
pressed the wages of native-born Americans in the agricultural industry” (Borjas and Katz 2007,
16). The year before Congress voted to exclude braceros, president John F. Kennedy stated, “The
adverse effect of the Mexican farm labor program as it has operated in recent years on the wage
and employment conditions of domestic workers is clear and cumulative in its impact” (Vialet
and McClure 1980, 52). This was seen as a straightforward consequence of economic principles:
a University of California at Berkeley sociologist testified to Congress that, in voting to extend
the program, it had “passed a law which repeals the law of supply and demand”, tantamount to
“repealing the law of gravity” (Anderson 1961, 361).
   4 The bracero agreements did not subsidize U.S. employers’ hiring of Mexican workers, as employers paid for the
wages, housing, and transportation of those workers.
   5 Most Mexican departures during the 1930s arose from an organized deportation campaign begun by President
Herbert Hoover—the first important de facto restriction of labor mobility across the border—though roughly 40 per-
cent of emigrants departed voluntarily as jobs dried up (Taylor 1934, pp. 23–25; Gratton and Merchant 2013, 957–959).
Before 1929 there was very little restriction on labor mobility: “As late as 1928, [the Border Patrol] had only 747 men
to police the vast international boundaries (Canadian and Mexican) under its jurisdiction. Nor did members of the
organization ever consider the apprehension of would-be illegal Mexican immigrants to be their primary function
until the very end of the decade: most of their efforts went towards the enforcement of customs regulations and
prohibition laws” (Cardoso 1980, 84).


                                                          4
The main evidence base for these claims at the time was the finding of a commission created by
U.S. Secretary of Labor James P. Mitchell in 1959.6 President Kennedy (1962, 639) was referring
to this study when he declared in October 1961, while reluctantly signing the law extending
the program for two more years, “Studies of the operation of the Mexican labor program have
clearly established that it is adversely affecting the wages, working conditions, and employment
opportunities of our own agricultural workers.” The purpose of the commission was to inde-
pendently and definitively assess whether or not the presence of braceros had adversely affected
labor market conditions for U.S. workers. The commission concluded that it had, but not through
an investigation that would be considered credible and transparent by economists or other social
scientists today. Its analysis focused on anecdotes regarding the difficulty of measuring the ‘pre-
vailing wage’ that braceros were required to receive, and the failure of some employers to pay
braceros the prevailing wage (Garrett et al. 1959). But this was not direct evidence of changes to
U.S. workers’ terms of employment. The commission did not use the systematic farm wage data
that had been available from the Department of Agriculture for many years, nor the systematic
data on unemployment available from the Bureau of the Census since 1957.7


In retrospect, the 1959 commission was not qualified to provide a disinterested, quantitative
evaluation of the economic impact of this policy. The senior commissioner and only member
with research training was Rufus von KleinSmid, who had co-founded an influential society of
eugenicists that advocated blocking Mexican immigration due to their view that Mexicans con-
stituted a genetically inferior race.8 This fact has gone unremarked in discussions of the 1959
   6 The centrality of this commission’s findings in the anti-bracero arguments of the Administration and Congress is
apparent in e.g. Williams (1962, 29). The commission’s report also spurred an influential House Subcommittee report
on the condition of farm workers in 1960, but that report did not assess the effect of bracero workers on domestic
workers.
   7 Direct evidence of the effects on U.S. workers was considered only in a brief passage: “Between 1953 and 1958, the
hourly farm wage rate in the U.S. increased 14 percent, according to the Department of Agriculture. An examination of
wage surveys made by state agencies in areas using Mexican nationals showed that the average rate paid to domestic
workers in these areas either remained unchanged or decreased in three-fifths of the cases” (Garrett et al. 1959, 294).
But it is difficult to assess this claim, as the authors did not display the data underlying the quoted sentence. They
did not specify which area(s) of which state(s) they referred to, how many were examined, how they defined “using
Mexican nationals”, or the degree to which the areas they examined were representative of areas with braceros. The
Current Population Survey was expanded in 1956 to 330 primary sampling units with 35,000 households, allowing
monthly state-level unemployment rates to be published starting in 1957.
   8 Von KleinSmid was a lifelong advocate of eugenics (von KleinSmid 1913). He was 84 when the commission’s work
was published. At age 53, as a senior professor at the University of Southern California, he had become a charter
member of the eugenicist Human Betterment Foundation, with his name printed on its letterhead. He continued as a
leading participant for at least a decade (Gosney 1937). The officers and trustees of the Human Betterment Foundation
advocated restricting Mexican immigration, as well as the sterilization of some Mexican-Americans, on the grounds
that they believed science had proven Mexicans to constitute a genetically inferior race (Holmes 1929; Kuhl 2002,


                                                          5
commission’s findings, which typically describe the commission members as “impartial consul-
tants” (Salandini 1973, 165).9 The commission’s work has nevertheless been highly influential:
it caused the formation of a Senate subcommittee to investigate migrant farm workers (Nor-
ris 2009, 148), was frequently cited by influential advocates of bracero exclusion (e.g. Galarza
1964, 199), and was considered authoritative long afterward by government analysts (Vialet and
McClure 1980, 58).


A successor of Mitchell’s as Secretary of Labor, Willard Wirtz, spent years personally advocating
for bracero exclusion (Hawley 1966). Wirtz declared in 1964 his goal that large-scale use of any
foreign workers in agriculture be “hopefully eliminated” (Secretary of Labor 1966, H-4). After
the termination of the program, he issued a report stating that the exclusion had caused an
improvement in the “terms and conditions of employment” for U.S. workers (Secretary of Labor
1966, 3, 11). The evidence offered to support this claim was the fact that farm wages across the
nation rose during 1965 (p. 19). Secretary Wirtz likewise stated that “[t]ens of thousands of jobs
were created for American workers” (p. 3), offering as evidence the fact that domestic seasonal
farm employment rose between 1964 and 1965 in California, Michigan, and Texas (p. 10). There
was no attempt to discern whether these trends preceded bracero exclusion, or happened to
a different extent in states unaffected by the exclusion. Similarly, a report of the U.S. Senate
(1966, 17) concluded that bracero exclusion had raised wages because agricultural wages rose
between 1964 and 1965 in California, Arizona, and Texas—without comparing those increases to
similar wage increases documented by the same report in dozens of states unaffected by bracero
exclusion. Similar claims have persisted for decades: in 2004 Congressional hearings considering
the creation of new temporary employment visas, both Democrats and Republicans asserted
that the bracero agreements had reduced wages and employment for U.S. workers (U.S. House
of Representatives 2004, 125, 130).


57; Stern 2005; Stern 2015, 164). The work of von KleinSmid and his colleagues on ‘racial’ purification in California
was specifically cited by the National Socialist regime of Adolf Hitler as providing an “essential basis” for German
compulsory sterilization laws in the 1930s (Kuhl 2002, 43).
    9 Beyond his eugenecist activism, Von KleinSmid was not an economist but a psychologist, born in 1875 and trained
at a time when modern quantitative methods did not exist. He thus could not have possessed the tools to empirically
evaluate the impact of a labor market policy. The other three members of the commission had no training in research
methods: George Higgins was a labor activist and monsignor known as “the labor priest’s priest” (Sullivan 2001);
Edward Thye was a graduate of a vocational community college and a former dairy farmer and bureaucrat at state-
level farm agencies before becoming a career politican; and Glenn Garrett ran the Good Neighbor Commission in
Texas. All four commission members were handpicked by a Secretary of Labor who had sought for years to restrict
and terminate the bracero program (Vialet and McClure 1980, 45, 51).


                                                         6
1.3   Prior research findings on bracero exclusion


The policy debate on bracero exclusion proceeded and ended without any rigorous or disinter-
ested evidence. “Anti-braceroists produced statistics . . . that increased employment of Mexicans
had adversely affected the wages and working conditions of natives,” wrote Craig (1971, 144).
“Those supporting [the law] presented equally elaborate data indicating clearly that the bracero
had, if anything, proved beneficial to the wages and working conditions of domestics.” Years
later, two studies in the economics literature sought to measure objectively and empirically the
labor-market impacts of terminating the bracero agreements. But due to data and methods limi-
tations, neither offers clear evidence for or against such impacts.


In the first of these studies, Jones and Rice (1980) measure farm wage and farm employment
trends in four U.S. states 1954–1977, before and after the end of the bracero program, and do not
detect any effects of the program’s termination. But the authors do not have access to data on
the number of Mexican workers in each state. They are thus unable to measure the intensity of
exposure to the program, or establish a control group of states with little or no exposure to the
program.


In the second, Morgan and Gardner (1982) likewise seek to measure the effects of bracero exclu-
sion on farm wages. They attempt this using a state-year panel for seven bracero-intensive states
during 1953–1978. In regressions with state-average farm wages as the dependent variable, they
find that a dummy for the years of the bracero program (1953–1964) has a negative and statis-
tically significant coefficient. But it is difficult to give this coefficient any interpretation, given
that 1) average farm wages across the country rose greatly during the period of time they an-
alyze, and 2) the regressions do not include any time dummies or time trends. Thus a dummy
variable for the early years of that period would have a negative coefficient even in states with
no exposure to the program. But they do not analyze states with few or no braceros, so they, like
Jones and Rice, are unable to establish a credible counterfactual.


Despite this limited and problematic evidence on the labor-market effects of bracero exclusion,
a long strand of literature has interpreted those effects as well-established. During the program,
economists like Hadley (1956, 355) used anecdotes to claim that the presence of braceros reduced


                                                  7
domestic wages. “The availability of [bracero] workers,” wrote Briggs (1980) long after the pro-
gram ended, “significantly depressed existing wage levels in some regions,” citing a calibrated
simulation of what the wage effect of bracero exclusion in two crops might have been during
the program, but not an empirical measurement of the wage effect of actual bracero exclusion
(Wise 1974). In arguing against a renewed US-Mexico temporary worker agreement in the 1990s,
Martin (1998, 892) claimed that bracero exclusion caused farm wages to rise by 30 to 50 percent,
without a source for this estimate. Grove (1996, 320), citing the problematic results of Morgan
and Gardner, claimed that “employment of braceros reduced seasonal farm wages and domestic
employment.” Martin and Teitelbaum (2001, 194) claim, “The rise in farm workers’ wages fol-
lowing the bracero program’s termination also showed how much it had depressed wages”—but
do not compare this rise in wages to wage trends prior to bracero exclusion, or to wage trends
in places unaffected by bracero exclusion. A literature review by Levine (2006, 5) concludes that
the bracero agreements caused “a decrease in domestic farm worker employment, and a decrease
in farm wages,” but without critical analysis of the evidence base.10 Social scientists outside of
economics have made numerous similar claims.11


But a minor literature has dissented from this view. Just before bracero exclusion, Mamer (1961,

  10 In reviewing the evidence to draw her conclusion for the purposes of informing Congress in 2006 about the labor
market effects of temporary work visas, Levine cites only the simulation of Wise (1974) and the regressions of Morgan
and Gardner (1982) that did not account for the upward time-trend in wages nationwide, but omits the contradictory
findings of Jones and Rice (1980).
   11 Some historians and legal scholars have made the same claim, but without systematic quantitative evidence. First,
in an influential book that helped secure bracero exclusion, historian Ernesto Galarza (1964, 199-218) claimed that the
effect of braceros on domestic workers’ wages and employment was “severe”. To support this claim he offered several
pages of anecdotes about braceros being paid relatively low wages for certain crops in certain counties of California
for work that in other years had been performed by domestic workers, but does not offer evidence on the wages
earned by domestic workers for the work they performed instead. Second, law professor Austin Morris (1966, 1940)
wrote, “It was charged that . . . Bracero-users never seriously tried to attract domestic labor, and that wages were kept
down, and even lowered. . . . That little effort was made, either by administrative insistence or grower cooperation,
to recruit local workers is evidenced by the fact that as the number of entrants was cut down toward the end of the
program (from a high of 459,850 in 1956 to about 200,000 in 1964, and only 20,000 in 1965), their places were taken
by domestic workers. If domestic workers could be recruited in 1965, as they were, then clearly they could have been
recruited in 1956.” He thus described it as“false, exaggerated, and baseless” to suggest that braceros had not displaced
large numbers of domestic workers (p. 1943). But Morris—though he was writing two years after bracero exclusion
and could have measured its observed effects—offers no evidence that hundreds of thousands of domestic workers did
in fact enter seasonal farmwork to replace braceros as claimed. Third, Bickerton (2000, 910) decries the “low wages
that resulted from the importation of foreign workers” under the agreements. To support this claim Bickerton cites
a passage where Calavita (1992, 65 passim) discusses some bracero employers’ violations of their wage contracts; but
this does not constitute direct evidence of adverse effects on the wages of other workers. Fourth, Mitchell (2012,
396) suggests that due to the exclusion of bracero workers from California, “[w]ages to domestic workers went up 23
percent”, but does not offer evidence that this trend was any different in places unaffected by bracero exclusion, or
that a similar trend was not occurring in California prior to bracero exclusion.


                                                           8
1205–1206) noted the absence of any systematic quantitative evidence for substantial labor-
market effects of the program. And after exclusion was carried out, some economists predicted
that rapid technological adjustment would negate its intended effects. Jones and Christian (1965,
528) predicted that any wage effects of bracero exclusion would be “almost completely nullified
by an accompanying intensification of mechanization”. William E. Martin (1966, 1137), later
president of the Western Agricultural Economics Association, wrote that due to sudden substi-
tution of capital for Mexican workers, “excluding foreign labor will not have any lasting benefi-
cial effects on the domestic farm labor force.” However, these predictions—that bracero exclusion
would fail as active labor market policy, and why it would fail—have never been systematically
tested. More recently, Alston and Ferrie (1999, 112) observe that many growers perceived hiring
braceros not as a way to pay lower wages for equal productivity, but as a way to achieve higher
productivity and workforce reliability—in spite of the fact that “the total cost of bracero labor
exceeded that of domestic farm workers and most likely the cost of illegal Mexican workers.”



2     A model of workforce reduction and technical advance

Here we seek to clarify testable implications of the above, skeptical view of bracero exclusion.
To do this, we construct a simple model to explore how technological and production adjust-
ment could shape the labor-market effects of an active policy of workforce reduction. Following
Acemoğlu (2010) we refer to a technical advance as either the creation of a new production
technology or the adoption of an existing technology.


2.1   Crop production in an open economy with alternative technologies


Let there be several locations, indexed by i (hereafter suppressed), each of which can produce
a single crop (relaxed below). The crop can be sold to the world market (at price p ≡ 1) and
is produced using capital (K), labor (L), land (τ ) and materials (M). The endowments of land is
fixed at T , and capital and materials are supplied elastically. The endowment of labor is initially
given by L, but we will consider below what happens when it is reduced. Land and labor markets
are competitive. Farmers rent land (from landowners) at rate rT , hire workers at wage w, and
purchase materials at price m. Landowners receive payment rT > 0 per acre if they do not rent

Land and materials are in another nest, for simplicity, T ≡ min{τ , M }. This allows us to mostly
abstract from materials, though their costs will factor into the decision of how much land to
use (in (2), below). We also assume, consistent with the evidence in Herrendorf et al. (2015) that

For some crop locations, the crop can alternatively be produced using an “advanced” or auto-
mated technology, where crop production YA is given by

Because it is more land intensive, the advanced technology is more productive only at low levels
of labor per unit of land. The advanced technology does not dominate the traditional technology
in the sense of producing more from given inputs. The optimal choice of technology depends on
highly localized conditions of land price and capital price.14 Indeed, farmers may use a combina-
tion of technologies in a competitive equilibrium. Let [ϕ ` , ϕu ] be the range of L/T over which this
occurs. That is, there exists an allocation of land (T0 ,TA with T0 +TA = T ) and labor (L 0 , L A with
L 0 + L A = L) to each technology such that the marginal products of land and labor are the same
in each technology—the cone of diversification. At the upper end, only the older technology is
used, and at the lower end only the advanced technology is used. The cone of diversification is
defined by the solution [ϕ ` , ϕu ] to

Why are wages invariant to factor supply inside the cone? It is because factor proportions are
fixed within each technology.15 Regardless of factor supply, if the economy’s labor/land ratio
is inside the cone, i.e., if L/T ∈ [ϕ ` , ϕu ], then the advanced technology will be employed at
labor/land ratio ϕ ` and the old technology will be employed at labor/land ratio ϕu . In both cases,
the marginal product of labor is given by ŵ, the market wage. To prove this, one needs only to
show that there is an allocation of land and labor to each technology at these factor proportions
that clears both markets. There is. Define TA and L A , respectively, as the land and labor allocated
to the advanced, and T0 and L 0 as the land and labor allocated to the old technology. The share
                                                                                                    TA       ϕu −L/T
of land allocated to advanced and old technologies is given, respectively, by                            =    ϕu −ϕ `   and
                                                                                                    T
T0        L/T −ϕ `
      =   ϕu −ϕ ` .   Notice that if L/T ∈ [ϕ ` , ϕu ], these are both between zero and one and they add up
T
to one. Finally, using the fixed factor ratios in each technology, L A = ϕ `TA and L 0 = ϕuT0 , clears
the labor market:
                                                                                   !
                                      TA      T0          ϕu − L/T       L/T − ϕ `
                                                
                      LA + L0 = T ϕ `    + ϕu      = T ϕ`           + ϕu             = L.

Therefore, wages are constant within the cone of diversification. Figure 1 summarizes the model,
juxtaposing the traditional production function (1) and the advanced production function (3). It
shows that the existence of a cone of diversification is not dependent on functional form as-

     15 This “factor price insensitivity” result is the same as in the traditional two-sector small, open economy interpre-
tation of this model. See Leamer (1995).


                                                              12
sumptions made here. The appendix, for example, shows results with capital and labor in the
inner nest instead, making the advanced technology explicitly more capital intensive. It would
also be possible to model the advanced technology as more skill-intensive, similar to Beaudry
et al. (2010).16 Indeed, any pair of production functions with output expansion paths that cross,
like in Figure 1, will have a cone of diversification.


The cone of diversification is also not a rare state. Across a range of industries from brewing
to railroads, major innovations were used alongside traditional technologies for several decades
(Mansfield 1961). It is also typical of major innovations in agriculture; for example, horses existed
alongside tractors and power-tillers in U.S. agriculture for half a century (Manuelli and Seshadri
2014).


2.2      Workforce reduction policy


We can now explore the impact of a policy change that excludes a portion of the labor force. Let
labor consist of bracero workers B and non-bracero workers N , such that L ≡ B + N . (Later we
will revisit the assumption that these workers are perfect substitutes.) Without loss of generality,
if the alternative technology exists, assume (B + N )/T > ϕ ` ; that is, at least one farm uses the
traditional technology. When bracero workers are excluded, the relative change in labor supply
is %∆ L/T = N /T(B+N
           
                    −(B+N )/T
                        )/T   = − BL . We explore the wage response to bracero exclusion (1)
without the adjustment of capital, technology, or output (2) with the adjustment of capital, but
not technology or output, and (3) with the adjustment of capital, technology, and output.


Without adjustment of capital, technology, or output. Using the traditional technology, the wage
is given by

  16 Harper  (1967) argued that mechanized harvest of tomatoes was not really less labor intensive, but instead less
low-skill labor intensive, replacing low- with high-skill labor (e.g. the harvester operator).

                           ∂(B/L)    ∂ ln(L/T )      s L + sT µ s L + sT σ

where sT , s L , s K are the income shares of land (plus materials), labor, and capital, respectively.17
Using the parameter estimates of Herrendorf et al. (2015) for postwar U.S. agriculture, the semielas-
ticity (7) would be large, approximately 0.4.18 In a typical high-bracero state with B/L = 0.3, farm
wages rise by approximately 12 percent after exclusion.


With adjustment of capital, but not technology or output. Most of the above response arises from
the assumption that farms cannot purchase capital. If we allow capital to adjust, but not tech-
nology, equation (7) reduces to

                                             ∂ ln w     sT 1
                                                    ≈          > 0.                                                   (8)
                                             ∂(B/L) s L + sT σ

Under the same parameter assumptions, the magnitude of the semielasticity (8) is approximately
0.1, or one quarter as large as without capital adjustment. In a typical high-bracero state farm
wages rise by approximately 3 percent after exclusion.


With adjustment of capital, technology, and output. Now suppose that technology can adjust
to bracero exclusion. Assume that both the traditional and advanced technologies are in use
((B + N )/T ∈ [ϕ ` , ϕu ]) and remain in use after exclusion (N /T ∈ [ϕ ` , ϕu ]), or the crop is already
at or below the shutdown margin ((B + N )/T 6 ϕ).      ¯ The model then predicts three effects of

exclusion. First, wages do not rise:
                                                     ∂ ln w
                                                            = 0,                                                      (9)
                                                     ∂(B/L)
thus the wage remains fixed at w ≡ ŵ before and after exclusion. Second, the output share of
the automatic harvest technology (or of less labor-intensive crops) rises in pre-exclusion Bracero

  18 That is, with µ, σ ≡ 1.6, s K ≡ 0.54, sT ≡ 0.07, and s L ≡ 0.39. Herrendorf et al. (2015) specify the production
function differently, imposing that capital and land are perfect substitutes. They estimate the elasticity of substitution
between labor and this land-capital aggregate to be 1.6. They also estimate this aggregate’s share of output at 0.61;
separately, they report that land’s share of output is around 0.07. A meta-analysis by Espey and Thilmany (2000) finds
that the median wage elasticity of labor demand for hired farm workers across all published studies is −0.5, which
would imply even larger wage impacts, though more recent elasticity estimates tend to be larger in magnitude and
be more in line with the magnitude of wage impacts predicted by Herrendorf et al. (2015)’s estimates.

share:
                                                  ∂ ln(YA /Y )
                                                               > 0.                                                 (10)
                                                    ∂(B/L)
Third, the output of the traditional technology, or of labor-intensive crops without an alternative
technology, falls:
                                                      ∂Y0
                                                            < 0.                                                    (11)
                                                     ∂(B/L)
Intuitively, bracero exclusion does not affect wages within the diversification cone because any
fall in the labor-land ratio only raises the fraction of farmers using the advanced technology,
without changing the land/labor ratio that is employed in each technology and therefore with-
out changing the marginal product of labor. Firms adopt the technology that emphasizes the
factor whose relative supply has risen, without any necessary change in the price of the factor
whose relative supply has fallen, as in Acemoğlu (1998).19 For crops that lack a feasible advanced
technology (L/T  ϕu ), output falls and wages rise, but only up to a point where the higher
wages make it profitable to decrease production of that crop by switching land use—to an al-
ternative crop, fallow land, or non-farm use. Notice that this model is isomorphic to a 2 x 2
small, open economy model in which adjustments to exclusion occurs through shifting produc-
tion towards less labor-intensive crops. In practice, both types of adjustments can occur, and
both reduce potential wage impacts.20


In Figure 1, Bracero exclusion represents a leftward movement, which leaves the wage fixed
at ŵ within the diversification cone [ϕ ` , ϕu ]. For a crop that lacks advanced technology for
production, the wage can rise, but stops at w > ŵ where L/T reaches the shutdown margin ϕ.  ¯



2.3      Extensions


Domestic labor supply. Suppose non-bracero workers are drawn from a population P and supply
labor to farms as ln NP = ε ln w, with ε > 0. If                 ∂ ln w
                                                                 ∂(B/L)   = 0, then excluded bracero workers
                                                                                                   ∂ ln w
will not be replaced with domestic (non-bracero) workers. Alternatively if                         ∂(B/L)   > 0, then
   19 Indeed, a broad set of directed technical change (e.g., Acemoğlu 2007) and choice-of-technique (e.g., Beaudry
and Green 2003, 2005; Caselli and Coleman 2006) models allow for flat or (in the former case) even upward sloping
factor demand curves (post-technology adjustment). The present model attempts to capture key features of farm
production.
   20 Lafortune et al. (2015) find that in the early twentieth century, farms adjusted to immigration-driven labor supply
shocks both by adjusting technology and crop mix. They provide suggestive evidence that the latter was important
only on land that was well-suited to multiple kinds of crops.


                                                           15
domestic workers will flow into the farm sector, further reducing the magnitude of the wage
response.21 However, estimates of the domestic labor supply elasticity to the farm sector tend
to be small (Devadoss and Luckstead 2008; Clemens 2017). Devadoss and Luckstead (2008) find
that the simulated wage impacts of adding workers are nearly identical over a reasonable range
of estimated supply elasticities.


Worker specialization. Now suppose there are two kinds of farm jobs, skilled (S) and unskilled (U ),
                       ρ −1         ρ −1  ρ
and redefine L ≡ α LU ρ +(1−α L )S ρ ρ −1 . The expression for how average wages respond to a
                 

differential change in L/T remains as above, so to determine the impact of the bracero exclusion
on average wages in this setup, we need only to update our expression for how it affects L/T .
                                            sU                   sS
Log-differentiating, d ln(L/T ) =           sL d   ln(U /T ) +   sL d   ln(S/T ), where sU is the unskilled share of
output and s S ≡ s L − sU . So regardless of whether the braceros are skilled or unskilled, we can
continue to expect d ln(L/T ) < 0, and thus weakly positive average wage impacts, as before.


The magnitudes may change, however. Consider briefly the specific case in which all braceros
                                                                                 sU                   sU
(and some non-braceros) are unskilled, so that d ln(L/T ) =                      sL d   ln(U /T ) =   sL   B/(B + NU ), where
NU is the non-bracero unskilled workforce. Also define N S to be the skilled non-braceros work-
                                                        sU        B+NU

systematically smaller than was described above (and if                     sL    >     B+N    , it will be larger).


Furthermore, regardless of skill mix, the change in average wages is not necessarily the same as
the change in wages for non-bracero workers. That is instead given by

or if we are in one of the cases where the average wage impact is near zero. Furthermore, this
would lead to smaller magnitude increase (or even a decrease) in employment responses to the
exclusion of braceros (using the model of labor supply above).



3    Archival data on braceros, farm employment, and farm wages

A dataset to test the above model did not exist when we began this investigation. No secondary
source reported bracero employment by U.S. state for a substantial number of states, even though
this information was collected and disseminated at the time in widely available government
publications. Collection of these data required in-person visits to study primary print sources
at government archives around Washington, DC and at presidential archives in Abilene, Kansas
and Independence, Missouri. We also assembled primary data for a novel database of hired
agricultural worker wages by state-quarter. Here we describe these new data sources and the
regression models we use.


Data on seasonal hired farm workers (foreign and domestic) are monthly stocks of hired workers
on farms by state from 1943 to 1973. State coverage is complete after 1953, the period relevant
to the empirics below, but there are gaps before that. The information published in government
sources over this time period was originally gathered through a monthly farm survey conducted
by the Department of Labor’s state-level employment service offices using the ES-223 form. The
survey was conducted in areas estimated to employ over 500 migrant and/or seasonal farm work-
ers during the enumeration period, typically completed by 20,000–25,000 farmers each month
by mail (USDA 1958, 4). The form defined seasonal hired workers as those hired to work on a
farm for fewer than 150 consecutive days. Domestic workers encompass three separate, mutu-
ally exclusive groups: local (those living within commuting distance); intrastate (those whose
permanent residence is elsewhere in the state but who are temporarily residing in the area of
employment for the purpose of farm work); and interstate (those whose permanent residence
is in a state different from the area of farm employment). It is important to note that the form
defined foreign workers as those “who have legally entered the continental United States but
who normally reside in a foreign country,” specifically indicating that "illegal entrants are not to



                                                17
be included" (DOL 1955). Data therefore exclude unauthorized farm workers.


Survey results were reported in the unpublished U.S. Department of Labor series ‘In-Season
Farm Labor Reports’ for collation at the national level (USDA 1986, 17). Due to changes in
bureaucratic organization and responsibilities over this time period, the final publication outlet
for these data varies. Worker numbers for 1943–1947 and 1954–1973 were compiled from six
different Department of Agriculture and Department of Labor publications held in four archival
locations. Data was not compiled on a national level for 1948–1953; state-level information for
this time period for 15 states was sourced from twelve archival locations and library systems.
The Online Appendix reports further detail.


The same survey collected information on farm wage rates on a quarterly basis. Each survey
respondent was asked to report average wage rates for hired farm labor in his/her locality on
the date of enumeration. Farm wages were reported in the Department of Agriculture publication
Farm Labor, available online through Cornell University’s Mann Library. We utilize two different
wage measures with varying coverage. The first, the hourly composite wage rate, is a weighted
average of reported per-hour rates calculated by the Department of Agriculture. These data are
available from 1948–1970 with full geographic coverage. As a robustness check, we also use
the daily wage without board, which covers more years but omits three states in most years
(California, Oregon, and Washington). We report our findings using both wage measures.24


We are unable to directly observe the degree of sampling error or respondent bias in these farm
surveys. But there is little evidence that these were large. First, the Departments of Agriculture
and Labor constructed the samples to be representative of farms in each state. Contemporary
criticism of the surveys centered on inconsistent definitions of hired ‘workers’ and treatment of
family labor (Johnson and Nottenburg 1951)—neither of which are an important concern with
bracero workers—and did not mention concerns with sampling. Second, the same farms reported
both the numbers of hired workers on their own farms and wages “in your locality”. If there were

  24 Farmers were asked about the going rate for hired farm labor in their locality.
                                                                                Thus if bracero workers were paid
less than domestic workers, we would predict a purely compositional effect on the average wage in a locality due
to removing braceros, separate from the equilibrium-price effect. Because no contemporary observers claimed that
braceros were paid more than domestic workers, and many claimed the opposite (e.g. Galarza 1956), we thus interpret
the wage effects we measure—comprising both compositional and price-equilibrium effects—as upper bounds on the
pure price-equilibrium effect.

discord between their survey reports of hired Mexican workers and reports from other sources,
this would suggest that the sampled farms inadequately covered areas with Mexican workers
and could miss any effects on wages those workers might have. But national totals of Mexican
workers as reported in the farm surveys accord well with independent reports of bracero volumes
departing Mexico, suggesting that the farm surveys exhibit good coverage of the establishments
and geographic areas that employed Mexican seasonal labor.25 Third, some of the most obvi-
ous forms of possible respondent bias would tend to make the subsequent analysis overstate the
effects of braceros on labor market conditions. For example, if employers systematically under-
stated the number of Mexican workers they hired, this would tend to bias upward any estimated
wage impact of those workers.26 Alternatively, if employers systematically reported agricultural
wages as those paid only to non-Mexican workers, this would only make the wage reports more
useful for the purpose of estimating the effect of Mexican workers on domestic workers.



4       Results: Labor market adjustment

The model in Section 2 predicts that even a large negative shock to the foreign labor supply
in agriculture could have minimal effects on the domestic labor market, provided that capital,
technology, and/or output can adjust. We begin by testing the predicted effects of bracero exclu-
sion on labor market adjustment in this section, and proceed to test other adjustment margins
in the following section. We use two regression specifications to estimate the effects of bracero
exclusion on various economic outcomes. The first, quasi-experimental specification uses the
natural experiment of bracero exclusion to estimate the effects of exclusion. As a robustness
check, the second specification describes the observational relationship between bracero stocks
and outcomes during the program.




    25 The
         data sources are compared in the Online Appendix.
    26 For
        instance, if 10,000 workers caused wages to fall by one percent, but the presence of only 5,000 was reported
on the surveys, the wage decline per Mexican worker would be estimated as double its true value. In the Online
Appendix we present independent corroborating data from the Mexican government suggesting that U.S. farmers did
not greatly understate their employment of braceros in the U.S. Department of Agriculture surveys.

4.1     Quasi-experimental tests


For each labor-market outcome, the first specification evaluates the effect of bracero exclusion as
a quasi-experiment. Treatment is the degree of exposure to exclusion, defined as the fraction of
seasonal agricultural labor in the state constituted by braceros at the program’s height in the mid-
1950s. We use the differences-in-differences with continuous treatment specification, following
Card (1992) and Acemoğlu et al. (2004), of

                                                                      1955

error term, α and β are vectors of coefficients to be estimated, and γ is the coefficient of inter-
est. Assuming that trends in the outcome would have been similar in the states most affected by
exclusion to trends in unaffected states had exclusion not occurred, the estimate γ̂ captures the
effect of exclusion. We compute Liang-Zeger (1986) standard errors, clustered by state.28


Wages: Figure 2 illustrates the core result of the paper, informally testing the zero wage-effect
condition (9). The upper part, Figure 2a, shows the natural experiment of bracero exclusion. It
shows the fraction of hired seasonal farm labor that is Mexican, averaged across states, within
three groups of states. The group with high exposure to exclusion (black line) is the six states
where braceros made up more than 20 percent of all seasonal agricultural labor in 1955: Arkansas,
Arizona, California, New Mexico, South Dakota, and Texas. The group with low exposure to
exclusion (gray line) is the states that had some braceros in 1955, but less than 20 percent of
seasonal agricultural labor. The group with no exposure to exclusion (dashed line) is the states
that had zero braceros in 1955.


   27 In annual regressions these are year fixed effects. In quarterly (monthly) regressions they are, in different speci-
fications, either year and quarter (year and month) fixed effects or quarter-by-year (month-by-year) fixed effects.
   28 The Online Appendix presents a reanalysis of the results to follow with the ‘treatment’ year assumed to be 1962,
when the first major restrictions on hiring braceros began, rather than 1965. The results are substantively unchanged.


                                                           20
The lower part, Figure 2b, shows farm wage trends in the same three groups of states.29 It shows
that pre- and post-exclusion trends in real farm wages are similar in high-exposure states and
low-exposure states. It also shows that wages in both of those groups rose more slowly after
bracero exclusion than wages in states with no exposure to exclusion. This pattern confirms
systematically what was remarked on anecdotally by economists—albeit in contrast to the pre-
vailing narrative—at the time of exclusion: Varden Fuller (1967, 288) wrote of California two
years afterward, “Higher wage rates are believed to have been both a consequence of the depar-
ture of the Braceros and the means by which a greater supply of domestic workers was obtained.
Surprisingly, however, in 1965 and 1966 California farm wages rose at virtually the same rate as
in the nation at large.”


Table 1 shows a linear parametric version of the same result, without classification of states into
arbitrary groups, using the differences-in-differences with continuous treatment specification in
equation (13). The first two columns use the hourly wage by state-quarter as the outcome; the
second two columns use the daily wage without board.30 Within each pair, the second regression
narrows the window of analysis to five years before and after the termination of the program. All
regressions include state and full quarter-by-year fixed effects, and standard errors are clustered
by state. The state fixed effects absorb the influence of time-invariant differences between states,
such as differences in arable land T in equation (6) or differences in the size of the overall state
farm workforce at the time of exclusion. The difference-in-difference is negative—as predicted
by equation (12) if braceros are relatively less-skilled than domestic workers—but statistically
indistinguishable from zero in all cases.


The last three rows of Table 1 test the wage semielasticity prediction of the model. In all columns
                                                                                ∂lnw
we reject at the 1 percent level the predicted wage semielasticity              ∂(B/L)   of 0.4 without adjust-
ment of capital, technology, or output, in equation (7). We likewise reject the predicted wage
semielasticity of 0.1 with adjustment of capital but without adjustment of technology or output,
in equation (8), at the one percent level for the hourly wage and at the five percent level for the
daily wage. The results are therefore compatible with rapid adjustment of capital, technology,
and output in equation (9). These conclusions are substantially unaffected by controlling for

  29 Hourly   wage, constant 1965 US$ deflated with Consumer Price Index.
  30 The hourly wage has full state coverage but fewer years (1948–1971); the daily wage has more years (1942–1975)
but is missing three states (CA, OR, WA) for most years (1951–1962 and 1965–1975).

pre-existing state-specific linear time trends in wages, using the specification of Wolfers (2006)
(presented in the Appendix).


All differences-in-differences analysis rests on the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption
(SUTVA, Rubin 1977). This could be violated in the present case if wages in states without
braceros were affected by bracero exclusion from other states. Suppose for example that the
presence of braceros kept wages low in Arkansas, but the mere threat of bringing in braceros
allowed employers to likewise keep wages low in Vermont, without any braceros present. Ex-
clusion from Arkansas and other states could then in principle affect wages in Vermont. The
evidence does not support this possibility to the extent that such a threat would be more credi-
ble in states with small numbers of braceros than in states that never had any braceros: no matter
which of these two types of states are chosen as the control group, the difference-in-difference
estimate is materially unchanged (Figure 2b). SUTVA could also be violated if bracero exclusion
caused large numbers of domestic workers to move between states; we will see below that this
did not occur.


Employment: We now repeat the above analysis with employment of domestic seasonal farm
workers as the outcome. Figure 3a illustrates the core result. The left panel shows the average
bracero stock in the three groups of states over time. Bracero exclusion removed tens of thou-
sands of farm workers from the average high-exposure state. The right panel shows the average
number of domestic seasonal farm workers in the same groups of states. The gap between high-
and low-exposure states is approximately constant before and after exclusion. The gap between
high- and no-exposure states narrows during the program and remains approximately constant
after exclusion—the opposite of what would be expected if bracero exclusion had crowded more
domestic labor into farm work. There appears to be a slight upward deviation from trend in
the high-exposure states during 1964–1966, but a similar bump occurs in zero-exposure states.
In short, there is no clear sign that the exclusion of Mexican workers in the left panel caused
employment of domestic workers in the right panel.


Figure 3b decomposes the domestic workforce in Figure 3a into local, intrastate migrant, and
interstate migrant farm workers. In all three groups, post-exclusion trends are similar to pre-
exclusion trends. There was a modest, transitory upsurge in the employment of local workers


                                               22
in high-exposure states during 1964–1966, but this was accompanied by a similar surge in zero-
exposure states.


This null result is confirmed by the corresponding parametric differences-in-differences analysis
with continuous treatment, from equation (13), in Table 2. The unit of observation is state-
month. The first two columns use all available data, with the outcome as either total domestic
seasonal farm employment or its natural logarithm. The second two columns again restrict
the window of analysis to just five years before and after the termination of the program. The
coefficient estimates are negative but statistically indistinguishable from zero. The fifth and sixth
columns restrict the sample to states with nonzero exposure to bracero exclusion (states that had
some braceros in 1955), given that pre-exclusion trends among these states are more similar than
pre-exclusion trends in the zero-exposure states (Figure 3a). The coefficient estimates remain
negative and statistically insignificant, suggesting that the result is not driven by heterogeneous
pre-trends. Furthermore, the coefficient estimates shift but all remain statistically insignificant
when the specification is adjusted to control for pre-existing state-specific linear time trends in
domestic hired seasonal farm employment (presented in the Appendix). Table 3 then repeats
this analysis for each type of domestic worker separately; the difference-in-difference estimate
is negative and statistically indistinguishable from zero in all cases.31


This finding corroborates contemporary statements of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Eco-
nomic Research Service, which wrote two years after exclusion, “Neither the growers nor the
State Employment Service were able to recruit a labor force which would take over the jobs for-
merly performed by the braceros” (Metzler et al. 1967, 5). This result came despite many years of
state and federal efforts to actively recruit domestic farm workers, both prior to bracero exclusion
and immediately afterward (U.S. Senate 1966; Metzler et al. 1967).




  31 Inmonths where the source documents were published but no domestic worker stock is reported for a state-
month, the analysis in Tables 2 and 3 assumes domestic worker stocks to be zero. In subsection A5.4 we present
the results under alternative assumptions: truncating missing values from the dataset in the linear specification, or
assuming missing values to be zero and including them in the dataset in the nonlinear specification (using the inverse
hyperbolic sine transformation rather than the logarithm). The results are qualitatively invariant to these alternative
assumptions.

4.2   Observational robustness checks


To probe the robustness of these results we present alternative, standard specifications that re-
quire fewer assumptions but do not utilize the natural quasi-experiment. For example, we might
be concerned that the above tests are misspecified because they do not capture important rela-
tionships between bracero stocks and domestic labor-market outcomes prior to exclusion, both
linear and nonlinear. The second type of regression specification evaluates the relationship be-
tween the outcome and increases or decreases in the stock of braceros during the program, with
state and time fixed-effects:


                           yst = α0 Is + β 0 It + δ ln Lmex
                                                        st + ζ X st + ε st ,                     (14)


where X st is a time-variant state characteristic that in some regressions is the stock of non-
Mexican hired seasonal workers, ln Lst − Lmex
                                                
                                            st . State fixed-effects capture any time-invariant

state characteristics including initial bracero stocks, initial size of the domestic labor force, and
initial crop specialization. The time fixed-effects capture any nationwide changes in the outcome
during the period. We run both the linear specification in equation (14) and the corresponding
semiparametric fixed-effects specification to allow for nonlinearities in the conditional relation-
ship between bracero stocks and the outcome (Baltagi and Li 2002; Libois and Verardi 2013). In
the fixed-effects regressions, too, we generally compute Liang-Zeger standard errors clustered
by state to account for serially-correlated errors, but in some robustness checks we assume a
first-order autoregressive structure of the error term.


Wages: Table 4 runs the fixed-effects specification (14) to test the observational relationship
between real farm wages and bracero stocks under program exposure (that is, in state-quarters
with nonzero bracero stocks). The outcome in the first two columns is the real hourly composite
wage. While the state fixed effect captures the effect all time-invariant omitted confounders on
the wage, including the initial size of the farm sector and farm workforce, we could be concerned
that the size of the farm workforce does vary substantially over time; for example, state-month
specific demand shocks (such as weather shocks) could generate correlation between Mexican
worker shocks and wages, but we would expect such demand shocks to be at least partially
reflected by demand for non-Mexican labor. Thus the second column controls for the size of



                                                  24
the non-Mexican seasonal labor force in each state-month. The third and fourth columns repeat
these tests with the real daily wage without board as the outcome. Rather than cluster standard
errors by state, the fifth and sixth columns impose the assumption of first-order autoregressive
errors within states.


Bracero stocks are positively correlated with farm wages throughout, again as predicted by equa-
tion (12) if braceros are typically less-skilled than domestic workers. But this correlation is statis-
tically indistinguishable from zero in the most flexible specifications—columns 2 and 4—which
allow for a time-varying overall farm workforce and an arbitrary structure of autocorrelated
errors. The evidence thus fails to reject prediction (9) of no relationship between wages and
declining bracero stocks.


We might be concerned that this linear fixed-effects specification conceals nonlinearities, such
as if negative wage effects only set in at high concentrations of braceros.32 Figure 4 shows the
Baltagi-Li semiparametric fixed-effects version of the parametric regression in Table 4, column
1. There is no evidence of marked nonlinearities in the relationship.


Employment: The fixed-effects regression of equation (14) takes log domestic seasonal farm em-
ployment as the outcome. Table 5 shows this regression in column 1. The remaining columns
break down the three types of domestic seasonal employment as outcomes. None of the coeffi-
cient estimates are negative, and all are statistically distinguishable from zero. Controlling for
state and month-by-year fixed effects, there is no evidence of a rise in domestic employment con-
current with declines in bracero employment in state-months with nonzero bracero employment.
If anything, these results suggest a fall in domestic farm employment concurrent with falls in
bracero stocks during the program, which is compatible with some degree of complementarity
between Mexican and domestic labor as in equation (12). Figure 5 shows the semiparametric
fixed-effects version of the regression in column 1 of Table 5, which shows no significant ten-
dency for domestic employment to rise with falling bracero stocks even at very high bracero
stocks.

ers are highly nonlinear, only setting in at the highest inflow rates.

4.3    Illegal migration and other labor-market explanations


Before proceeding, we consider whether the above results are likely to arise from various adjust-
ments within the labor market. The first is the possibility that when the program was terminated,
braceros simply became unauthorized workers, or were replaced by unauthorized workers. Prima
facie this appears unlikely to explain the lack of measurable increases in domestic wages or em-
ployment caused by exclusion, given that during the program—when employers could access
Mexican labor without hiring on the black market—there is no negative relationship between
bracero stocks and lower domestic wages or employment (Tables 4 and 5). We nevertheless con-
sider more direct evidence below.


Very few Mexican workers overstayed their bracero visas when the program was terminated.
This is evident in the statistics of the Mexican government, which conducted all recruitment
under the agreements and tracked each bracero’s exit from Mexico and reentry into Mexico
(González 1974, 141, Cuadro 39). In 1963, for example, 189,528 braceros left Mexico and 188,512
returned the same year (a discrepancy of 1,106, or 0.54 percent). In 1964, the last year of the pro-
gram, 179,298 braceros left Mexico and 179,535 returned (a discrepancy of 237, or 0.13 percent).
If it were the case that Mexican workers on the black market substituted for braceros in 1965,
this would require a very large and immediate jump in new unlawful entries.


There is no evidence of such a jump. Figure 6 compares the total number of bracero visas given
each year to the number of Mexican nationals apprehended by the U.S. Border Patrol. Apprehen-
sions barely rose in the several years that followed bracero exclusion. There is no evidence of any
stand-down in enforcement effort in the years just before or after 1965 that would allow minimal
apprehensions to coincide with massive new illegal flows; Border Patrol staffing did not fall but
in fact rose modestly during this period (North and Houstoun 1976, 53). Bibliometric analysis of
contemporary newspaper content independently confirms that illegal migration remained very
low for several years after bracero exclusion (Massey and Pren 2012, 10).33



   33 The analysis of Massey and Pren (2012, 10) counts in major newspaper content “the number of times undocu-
mented, illegal, or unauthorized migrants or aliens were paired with Mexico or Mexicans and with the words crisis,
flood, or invasion each year from 1965 through 2009”. They find that these mentions closely track trends in Border
Patrol apprehensions after 1965, remaining very low until sharply rising in the early 1970s.


                                                       26
Other alternative explanations are likewise unsupported by the data: 1) Excluded braceros were
not replaced by lawful but non-Mexican foreign workers: stocks of Jamaican, Bahamian, and
other non-Mexican foreign seasonal agricultural workers barely rose after bracero exclusion.34
2) It is unlikely that the labor-market effects of bracero exclusion were offest by reduced labor
demand due to the loss of local expenditures from bracero earnings, the effect posited by Altonji
and Card (1991) and tested by Hong and McLaren (2015), since braceros tended to live in isolated
work-camps and spend only a small fraction of their earnings in the United States. 3) There is
no evidence that substantial numbers of domestic seasonal farm workers moved between states
to offset the loss of bracero labor supply, the effect considered by Card and DiNardo (2000) and
Hatton and Tani (2005), given the lack of response by domestic interstate migrants in Tables 3
and 5. This accords with the recent finding of Cadena and Kovak (2016) that domestic work-
ers are far less mobile across U.S. states than Mexican workers. 4) Finally, it is unlikely that
policy-generated wage rigidities are responsible for the lack of wage effects in Tables 1 and 4.
Hired farm workers were exempt from the federal minimum wage until years after bracero ex-
clusion (Gardner 1972).35 And even if there had been a binding minimum wage before and after
exclusion, this would leave unexplained the lack of effects on employment.



5      Results: Technology and production adjustment

The above results suggest that bracero exclusion signally failed as an active labor market policy
intended to cause increases in domestic wages and employment in farm work. Why? At the time
of exclusion, as noted above, some economists predicted that its labor-market effects would be
nullified by capital-labor substitution and technological adjustment (Jones and Christian 1965,
528; Martin 1966, 1137). These predictions equate to the model’s predictions in equations (9)–
(11), and we can now test them.


Mechanization technology was available for some of the most important crops produced with
bracero labor, but not for others. Table 6 shows the principal crops where bracero labor was em-
    34 Data
          presented in the Online Appendix.
    35 The
         federal minimum wage for farm workers was only effective after 1967, and only covered about one third
of hired domestic farm labor as it exempted all but the largest one percent of U.S. farms. Prior to this only five
continential U.S. states had a state-level minimum for farm workers: California, Michigan, New Jersey, North Dakota,
and Wisconsin (Koziara 1967). An immaterial exception to the lack of a federal minimum was sugar-beet workers,
whose wage was regulated by a crop-specific minimum during the early postwar years (BLS 1946, 197).


                                                        27
ployed. Advanced mechanization technology was available for adoption to produce tomatoes,
cotton, and sugar beets. No comparable mechanization technology was then available for pro-
duction of asparagus, strawberries, lettuce, celery, cucumbers, citrus, or melons (Sanders 1965;
Harper 1967). Equation (10) therefore predicts that bracero exclusion would accelerate mecha-
nization in the production of tomatoes, cotton, and sugar beets. In these crops, the decline in
production will be offset commensurately with the easy of switching to the advanced technol-
ogy. And for the other crops, in the absence of substantial wage effects, equation (11) predicts
that there will be a fall in production at the shutdown margin ϕ¯ accompanied by capital-labor
substitution under the traditional technology, perhaps accompanied by switching to other, non-
mechanized production techniques. In order to be capable of offsetting effects in the seasonal
market for labor, adjustment at these other margins must occur rapidly.


5.1   Tomato mechanization


At the time of bracero exclusion, no single activity employed more braceros than tomato har-
vesting. Harvesting machines had been available since the late 1950s, machines that roughly
doubled harvest productivity per worker (Harper 1967, 12), but adoption was low for the first
several years (Vandermeer 1986, 22). This placed tomato production within the technological
diversification cone at the time of exclusion.


Figure 7a shows that bracero exclusion was followed immediately by a dramatic adoption of
this existing technology, as predicted by equation (10). It compares bracero stocks in California,
where most tomatoes were produced, to the fraction of California tomato production using a me-
chanical harvester. This corroborates qualitative studies claiming that exclusion caused sudden
adoption of the harvester (Martin 1966, 1144; Martín 2001, 313). California is an appropriate state
of focus because this mechanization episode mechanization covers the most important bracero
crop nationwide, in the most important bracero state nationwide, as well as being the most impor-
tant state for tomato production. To our knowledge, tomato mechanization time series data exist
for only one other state, Ohio, which was essentially unaffected by bracero exclusion. An impor-
tant falsification exercise is thus to contrast mechanization in Ohio with California. Figure 7b
does this. There was no leap in tomato harvest mechanization in Ohio that was comparable in
timing or magnitude to the leap in California.


                                                 28
5.2      Cotton mechanization


Another crop with coexisting traditional and advanced technologies was cotton. Commercial-
scale mechanical picking of cotton had been technically feasible since the 1920s. It took two
decades to become practically feasible for a substantial number of farmers, after the development
of technologies complementary to mechanical picking—including cotton plant varieties with
taller and more uniformly opening bolls, chemical for weed control to reduce trash in machine-
picked cotton, and gins apt for machine-picked cotton (Fite 1980, 191–5). These were in place
by the late 1940s and harvesting of upland cotton entered the cone of diversification, with eight
percent mechanical harvesting by 1950, rising to 78 percent by 1964 (USDA 1974, 218).


The literature broadly agrees that the presence of braceros slowed harvest mechanization (Grove
1996) and bracero exclusion accelerated mechanization (Vialet and McClure 1980, 46; Morgan and
Gardner 1982, 399; Heinicke and Grove 2008, 288). McBride (1963) details how Labor Secretary
James Mitchell’s regulatory actions to restrict bracero usage caused cotton farmers to universally
adopt mechanical harvesters in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas.


We observe the effect of bracero exclusion on cotton mechanization in Table 7. The table shows
difference-in-difference regressions (13) in the first column, with state-year cotton harvest mech-
anization as the outcome, and shows in columns 3 and 4 the corresponding fixed-effects regres-
sions (14). The first panel of Figure 8 shows the fixed-effects result graphically. The difference-
in-difference effect of exclusion is positive, and bracero stocks are negatively correlated with
adoption during the program. We note that mechanical harvesting was only part of the techno-
logical change induced by bracero exclusion. Other labor-saving changes included pre-harvest
technologies such as greater use of herbicides, flame cultivators, and rotary hoes (Martin 1966,
1144).


5.3      Sugar beet mechanization


At the time of bracero exclusion, the mechanization transition in sugar beet production was
not in harvesting—where mechanization had been near universal since the early 1950s—but in
field preparation and maintenance. Sugar beet cultivation requires blocking and thinning (the


                                                29
removal of some plants so that the eventually-harvested plants can thrive) as well as weeding,
activities traditionally employing intensive field labor. Mechanization of these tasks had been
technically feasible for two decades (Mervine and Barmington 1943), but its spread was slow
until the concomitant spread of seed varieties that avoided irregular growth and clumping of
plants that reduced the efficiency of such machines. At the time of exclusion about 40 percent
of U.S. farms had adopted mechanized thinning and weeding (Rogers and Cohen 1963, 11, 22,
Table 3), placing the crop near the middle of the diversification cone.


The literature broadly agrees that bracero exclusion created a large new incentive for mecha-
nization (Rasmussen 1967, 35; USDA 1971, 16). The president of the American Society of Sugar
Beet Technologists made this plain just before exclusion:

       “In agriculture, complete mechanization from planting through harvest has been
       demonstrated and is practiced in limited areas. The demand for faster progress is
       being thrust upon us, however, by the imminent loss of a great proportion of the
       available hand labor through expiration of Public Law 78, commonly referred to
       as the Bracero Program. . . . Those who have depended upon availability of Mexican
       Nationals for thinning and weeding operations must look elsewhere to get this work
       accomplished. . . . Work to bring about the desired full mechanization must be pushed
       with all speed and in an all-out cooperative effort” (Rorabaugh 1964, 2–3).


We also observe the effect of bracero exclusion on sugar beet mechanization in Table 7. Column
2 shows the difference-in-difference results for state-year adoption of mechanized thinning and
weeding in sugar beet production. These are less reliable than the analogous figures for cotton,
because data are available for a more limited window of time.36 Columns 5 and 6 show the
corresponding fixed-effects regressions, shown graphically in the second panel of Figure 8. Just
as for cotton, the difference-in-difference is positive and bracero stocks are negatively correlated
with adoption.


5.4    Production adjustment


Equations (10) and (11) predict that bracero exclusion will cause a decline in production for all
crops, a decline that is smaller in magnitude as there are lower barriers to technical advance. The

  36 The only state-year data of which we are aware for sugar beet thinning/weeding mechanization cover the period
1960–65, thus including only one post-exclusion year.


                                                        30
model thus predicts only a small adjustment of production in tomatoes and cotton. It predicts
a more substantial adjustment of production in sugar beets, where the spread of mechanization
was limited by the spread of complementary technologies. And it predicts a large adjustment of
production in crops where no feasible mechanization technology existed, so that capital-labor
substitution must proceed under the traditional technology. Here we test and find support for
all of these.


Crop production data are much more complete than surviving state-year data on mechanization.
(Above, tomato mechanization data are available for only two states, sugar beet mechanization
data for only four timepoints.) We thus test the model’s predictions on production adjustment
with the more flexible event-study specification (Jacobson et al. 1993):

                                                                       1955
                        yst = α0 Is + β 0 It ,1964 + γ 0 · It ,1964 · `s      + εst ,        (15)


similar to equation (13) but where It ,1964 is a vector of year dummies that omits the base-group
1964, and γ is a vector of parameters to be estimated (γ 1964 ≡ 0). The outcome yst is a state-
and crop-specific index of physical production (e.g. pounds), scaled so that the index for each
crop in each state equals 100 in 1964. Graphing the coefficient estimates γ̂t against time shows
how time-trends in crop production differed with the degree of state-level exposure to bracero
exclusion.


Figure 9 shows the event-study coefficients from regression (15) for nine of the most important
bracero crops. At the top of the figure, we see bracero exclusion followed by relative declines
in tomato and cotton production that are modest and short-lived, as the model predicts. Here,
frictions on technical advance existed—for example, the new machines were inapt for delicate,
fresh-market tomatoes comprising about one fifth of production (Harper 1967, 11)—but were
minor. For sugar beets, where adoption of the advanced technology faced greater frictions, the
relative decline after exclusion is larger and longer.


Of the remaining six crops, where capital-labor substitution could only proceed under the tradi-
tional technology, we observe large and lasting relative declines in production in and after 1965
in five: asparagus, fresh strawberries, lettuce, celery, and pickling cucumbers. Contemporary
experts stated qualitatively that exclusion had caused important declines in production of all of

                                                   31
these crops (Martin 1966, 1141; Hirsch 1966, 2; Secretary of Labor 1966, 16–18). The exception
is citrus, where relative production fell after 1962. Certainly bracero exclusion caused limited
changes in production techniques for these six crops as well, even if cultivation processes could
not be mechanized. For example, bracero exclusion caused lettuce growers to adopt less-selective
cutting methods and more mechanized techniques for packing the harvest into shipping-boxes
(DOL 1966, 17). Such adjustments appear insufficient to avoid production declines in exposed
states relative to unexposed states. Collectively, these results provide empirical support for tech-
nical and production adjustment as important mechanisms for the lack of labor-market effects
as predicted by equation (9), though they do not rule out other explanations.



6    Conclusion

The exclusion of Mexican bracero workers was one of the largest-ever policy experiments to
improve the labor market for domestic workers in a targeted sector by reducing the size of the
workforce. Five years after bracero exclusion, leading agricultural economist William E. Martin
uncharitably assessed the advocates of exclusion in a little-read book chapter. Those who had
believed exclusion would help domestic farm workers “were obviously. . . extremely naïve”, he
wrote, and the hoped-for effects in the labor market never arrived because “capital was substi-
tuted for labor on the farm and increased effort was exerted by the agricultural engineers in
providing the farmers these capital alternatives” (Wildermuth and Martin 1969, 203). Exclusion
advocates had mocked Martin’s view as one that “repeals the law of supply and demand” (Ander-
son 1961, 361). The present study assembles the data to test Martin’s claim for the first time. All
of the data we use were available to contemporaries but were never, to our knowledge, compiled
or analyzed.


The theory and evidence we discuss here contradicts a long literature claiming, largely with-
out quantitative evidence, that bracero exclusion succeeded as active labor market policy. We
find that bracero exclusion failed to raise wages or substantially raise employment for domestic
workers in the sector. The theory of endogenous technical change suggests a mechanism for this
null result: employers adjusted to foreign-worker exclusion by changing production techniques
where that was possible, and changing production levels where it was not, with little change to



                                                32
the terms on which they demanded domestic labor.


The theory is supported by the relationship between novel archival data on state-level bracero
stocks and data on domestic wages and employment, technological change in agriculture, and
crop-specific production adjustment. We can reject the wage semielasticity to workforce reduc-
tion that is implied by a model without endogenous technical change, and we corroborate this
with direct evidence of technical change causally linked to exclusion. This is the first evidence
on endogenous technical change by labor scarcity arising from a natural policy experiment to
deliberately reduce the labor supply. Promising paths for future research are to seek other nat-
ural experimental settings in which labor scarcity might cause endogenous technical change, as
urged by Acemoğlu (2010, 1071), and to apply emerging theory and rigorous evaluation methods
to other episodes of large changes in real-world immigration restrictions, as urged by Peri (2016,
25).

Average across states, by season, of each outcome. Each year is split into two seasons: the first half of each year is the early season
(February to July), the second half of each year is the late season (August to November). The outcomes are (a) peak Mexican fraction
of hired seasonal farm workers during any month in the season, and (b) average real hourly wage in the two quarters that comprise
that season. Real wage adjusted by national Consumer Price Index. Vertical dotted lines show the beginning of government efforts

‘Treatment’ is the degree of exposure to exclusion. Observations are state-quarters. Standard errors clustered by state in parentheses.
` 1955 is average fraction of Mexicans among the state’s total hired seasonal workers across the months of 1955. Wages in constant
1965 US$ deflated by CPI. Hourly wage has full state coverage but fewer years (1948–1971); daily wage has more years (1942–1975)
but missing three states (CA, OR, WA). Farm worker stocks missing in original sources for 1955 in Rhode Island and New Hampshire.

                      harvesting—but these employed primarily non-Mexican hired seasonal workers.

Observations are state-years. For cotton, mechanization fraction is the fraction of production harvested by machine (USDA 1974,
218). For sugar beets, mechanization fraction is fraction of production thinned and/or weeded by machine (Rogers and Cohen 1963,
22, Table 3). Diffs-in-diffs regressions include state-years with zero braceros; fixed-effects regressions use logged regressor and thus
omit state-years with zero braceros. ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01

  Left axis shows the total number of braceros working in state in the peak month of each year (almost always October). ‘Mech-
  anization’ means that tomatoes were harvested with the Blackwelder tomato harvester, reported by Vandermeer (1986). Ver-
  tical dotted lines show the beginning of major government efforts toward bracero exclusion (March 1962) and near-complete
  exclusion at the termination of the program (December 1964). There were 74 and 64 braceros in Ohio in the peak month 1956
  and 1957, respectively, zero in all other years.

Observations are state-years, and vertical axis shows event-study regression coefficients from equation (15). For each crop, the
dependent variable is a production index normalized so that each state’s physical production of the crop in 1964 is 100. Vertical
dotted lines show the beginning of major government efforts toward bracero exclusion (March 1962) and near-complete exclusion
at the termination of the program (December 1964). The graphs for cucumbers and citrus are truncated at ±200 in order to preserve
the same vertical range across all graphs for comparability.

A1      Data sources
A1.1     State-level stocks of Mexican and non-Mexican farm workers
This section describes our construction of a novel database of monthly stocks of seasonal agricultural
workers in the 48 continental United States, 1943–1973. It offers full monthly coverage of all 48 states
from April 1953 to July 1973, with three minor gaps (July 1953, October 1953, and January–March 1970).
This is the period that is relevant for the analysis in the present paper. The database also covers the
earlier period of 1943–1953, but with some important gaps: state coverage is complete from June 1943 to
December 1947 (except April 1944), but for the period January 1948 to March 1953, only four states have
complete coverage, while another 11 states have partial coverage. Details follow below.
April 1953–June 1973, the relevant period for the present paper: Agricultural worker data from April 1953
to July 1973 was compiled as follows. Data for each month is typically reported in the month following
(e.g. April 1953 worker statistics reported in May 1953 publication issue). The dates in this section refer to
the month of employment, not the month of publication. Farm employment data are typically published
in a clearly labeled appendix to each issue; the title of the relevant table varies slightly but is typically
“Estimated employment and origin of seasonally hired workers in agriculture and food processing by
State and selected agricultural reporting areas.” Though data are reported at a sub-state level for some
locations, we collect aggregate state information only. These reports were published seasonally, typically
excluding winter months when minimal farm work occurred.37 Data for July 1953, October 1953, and
January–March 1970 were missing from all locations.

June 1943–December 1947: Hired seasonal farm worker statistics by state for June 1943 to December 1947
are reported in the United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service’s
monthly Farm Labor publication, made available online through Cornell University’s Mann Library. Each
issue features a table of “foreign workers employed in or available for agricultural work by country of
origin and state of employment.” The date of reference for these tables varies; for those dated at the begin-
ning of a month, we assume the workers reported were present in the month prior. For example, figures
for workers present in April 1944 were taken from the May 1944 issue of Farm Labor. The publication
reports all major groups of foreign workers present: typically Mexican, Bahamian, and Jamaican. The
April 1944 issue reports only Bahamian and total numbers; there is no separate category for Mexican
workers. Data for April 1945 is missing.
January 1948–March 1953: To our knowledge there is no primary- or secondary-source national compi-
lation of state-level hired seasonal farm worker data for January 1948 to March 1953. We initially sought
such a compilation in six archival locations.38 U.S. National Archives staff supported the hypothesis that
due to bureaucratic reorganization during this time period—responsibility for this data collection shifted
from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Labor—no such collation either existed or was
made public. Since the ES-223 form was implemented by local employment service offices, we found it
plausible that if any such data existed, it might be on a state level. We were able to track down at least
partial data for fifteen states for this time period from twelve university libraries and archival locations.
We were able to fill the gap entirely for four states: Arizona, California, Michigan, and Virginia. Data
for individual states was sourced as follows (we exclude other available publication volumes that did not
provide sufficiently granular information for inclusion in the database):

    • Arizona (1948–1953): 1948: Post-Season Farm Labor Report for 1948, table on p. 7 (Arizona State
      University); 1949: Post-Season Farm Labor Report for 1949, domestic numbers from table on p.
      14 and bracero numbers from text on p. 20 (Arizona State University); 1950–1953: Agricultural
      Employment in Arizona 1950–1964, table on p. 10 (Wirtz Labor Library).

      from Wirtz Labor Library).

Measures of Mexican contract workers, local (domestic, nonmigratory) workers, intrastate migrants, and
interstate migrants were consistent across the full time period. Information on other foreign workers was
inconsistently collated in different publications. Jamaican and Bahamian workers were identified as such
from 1943–1947; combined under the umbrella “British West Indies” from 1946 to 1954 and 1959 to 1973;
and aggregated as “British West Indies and others” from 1953–1958. A similar trend holds for Canadians,
identified as a single group from 1943 to 1954 and 1966 to 1972 and aggregated into “Canadians and others”
from 1959–1964. “Other foreign” workers are reported from 1944–1954 and 1964–1966. Data on Puerto
Rican workers are reported for the full time period.

A1.2     Wages
All farm wage data were sourced from the Department of Agriculture publication Farm Labor on a quar-
terly basis. The daily wage without board measure was consistently reported for the relevant quarter:
for example, July 1945 rates reported in the July 1945 publication issue. Hourly composite wage rates are
available beginning in January 1948. This composite index was computed by "converting the monthly,
weekly, and daily rates to an hourly basis and weighting the rates by approximate distributions of workers
hired by the different arrangement." (USDA 1969, 16). The measure was rebased with new weights from
a 1948 agriculture survey in the January 1951 edition of Farm Labor; we source data for January 1948 to
October 1950 from this issue. Beginning in January 1951, hourly composite rates are reported alongside
the daily without board rate in the relevant quarterly issue. The hourly wage has full state coverage but
fewer years (1948–1971); the daily wage has more years (1942–1975) but is missing three states (CA, OR,
WA) for most years (1951–1962 and 1965–1975). In order to balance the panel, we set the latter measure
for these three states to missing for all years.

A1.3         Data availability, entry, and reconciliation
We began the search for missing worker data from 1948 to 1953 at the National Archives in College Park,
Maryland. Data prior to 1948 was collected by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics in the Department
of Agriculture; these records fall under Archives Record Group 83. Upon the abolition of this office in
1953, the Office of Employment Security of the Department of Labor assumed responsibility for collating
and publishing data on farm employment in 1954; these records fall under Record Group 183 (U.S. Na-
tional Archives n.d.). Upon review of the relevant files for the years in question and consultation with
archivists, it became clear that most of the National Archives content was correspondence and testimony.
It was suggested that any historical statistical information would likely be stored within the Federal De-
pository Library system, charged with collecting and storing official government publications. Under the
Superintendent of Documents Classification (SuDocs) system of the United States Government Publishing
Office (GPO), the relevant files (Bureau of Employment Security) are held under SuDocs stem L7. Thanks
to the help of Celina Nichols McDonald at the University of Maryland, we sent a request for this catalog
entry to all US Federal Depository Libraries; none held the information we were looking for. With the
help of Julie Day from the Department of Labor Wirtz Labor Library, we ascertained that Washington
University in St. Louis, Missouri and the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene, Kansas,
possessed SuDocs L7 holdings. The former did not seem to include granular information on foreign work-
ers; the latter not only held information under this call number, but also the full record of the President’s
Commission on Migratory Labor and supporting information, from 1938 to 1966.39
We therefore visited the Eisenhower Library in December 2016, pulling all archival material potentially
related to bracero employment from 1948–1953. From record group 220 (U.S. President’s Committee on
Migratory Labor) this included boxes 1–4, 11–14, 62–76, 87–97, and 99. From the broader Migratory Labor
subject guide, this included boxes 102, 139, 141, and 178 of the Mitchell papers; box 4 of the Eisenhower
papers (Ann Whitman file), box 17 of the Oveta Culp Hobby papers, box 13 of the Clyde Wheeler papers,
and boxes 10 and 20 of the White House Cabinet Secretariat records. We also visited the Harry S. Truman
Presidential Library in Independence, Missouri for their nine boxes of material on the U.S. President’s
Committee on Migratory Labor.40 These searches yielded important yet sporadic worker data by state to
fill the national level gap from 1948 to 1953, as well as qualitative background material and methodological
information.
We also reviewed all potentially relevant congressional hearings for this period stored at the Library
of Congress. Though some offered relevant information, most data reported was for hires/contracts or
border crossings over a certain time period, not the monthly stock estimates of farm employment we
sought. This extensive archival work in combination with a 1978 records disposal request authorizing the
disposal of original ES-223 forms and related reports, gives us confidence that our dataset is complete to
the fullest extent possible.
We outsourced the entry of both worker and wage data from scanned PDFs to Excel to two separate data
entry professionals on Upwork, an online network for freelancers. These two individuals were selected
through a rigorous sample data entry process; any discrepancies between the final dual entry datasets
were hand-checked and harmonized in Stata to yield the final database.

A2.4      Alternative Nesting
The qualitative results presented are not dependent on the particular nesting of the CES structure used
in the main text (nor are they even dependent on the CES functional form – see Figure 1). In particular,
consider this alternative nesting:




                                                                                 A-7

where j ∈ {0, A}, where a 0 > a A , where L j ,K J and T j denote the amount of labor, capital, and land applied
to production process j, with TA +T0 = T , L A + L 0 = L and the kind of capital used in process j is supplied
elastically at price r j . This is similar to the model in section 2, except capital is now in the inner nest of
the CES form. (In the main text a ≡ a 0 and b ≡ a A .)
Capital can no longer be simply factored out of this functional form, so define k j = K j /T j as the equilib-
rium capital/land ratio in process j (if it is used). So now the cone of diversification is defined by the k 0 ,
k A , ϕ ` and ϕu that are the solution to the system of four equations

A3      Descriptive statistics
Table A1 presents descriptive statistics for the variables used in the regressions in the main text.

A4      Further characterization of worker stocks
A4.1      Effect of bracero exclusion on non-Mexican foreign seasonal farm labor
Figure A1 shows that stocks of non-Mexican foreign seasonal agricultural workers remained very low
after bracero exclusion.

A4.2      States grouped by exposure to bracero exclusion, according to 1955 Mex-
          ican fraction of hired seasonal workers
Table A2 shows the fraction of total seasonal farm workers made up by Mexicans, averaged across the
months of 1955, and the corresponding classification into groups of states with ‘high’, ‘low’, and ‘no’
exposure to bracero exclusion.

A4.3      Seasonal variation in bracero stocks
Figure A2 shows the distribution of bracero stocks on average over the course of a year, for the entire
United States. In the 1950s and 1960s, the stock of bracero workers over the course of each year occurred
in October. In the 1960s, almost all braceros present at any point in the year were present in or after the
month of May.

A5      Robustness checks
The section checks the robustness of some assumptions underlying results in the main text.

slope on the year t . The coefficient estimates shift but statistical inference is qualitatively unchanged, as
                   0

shown in Table A3 and Table A4.

A5.2      Alternative ‘treatment’ year: 1962
Here we present re-analysis of main-text Tables 1 and 2 with the new assumption that ‘treatment’ begins
in 1962, when the first major restrictions were placed on farms’ hiring of braceros, rather than 1965 when
the program was terminated. Table A5 shows the differences-in-differences analysis of wage effects under
this new assumption, and Table A6 shows the analysis of employment effects. There are no substantial
differences from the original results.

  Rhode Island and New Hampshire are missing in all regressions using the 1955 bracero fraction. The original sources do not
  report domestic or foreign farm worker stocks for those two states in 1955 (and most other years).

sources for 1955 in Rhode Island and New Hampshire. If no workers reported for state-month in a month when source report was
issued, assume zero. ‘Exposed states’ means states with nonzero bracero stocks in 1955 (i.e., only the ‘high’ and ‘low’ groups in the
figures). ‘Linear month-by-year trends’ means that the regression includes an interaction term of a dummy for each state and a time

sources for 1955 in Rhode Island and New Hampshire. If no workers reported for state-month in a month when source report was
issued, assume zero. ‘Exposed states’ means states with nonzero bracero stocks in 1955 (i.e., only the ‘high’ and ‘low’ groups in the
figures).




                                                               A-15
A5.3     Sensitivity of wage graph to smoothing and wage measure
Here we show smoothed and unsmoothed versions of the wage graph in the main text (Figure 2b), the
hourly composite wage, in Figure A3a and Figure A3b. Where the graph in the main text averages wages
by season (July and before, August and after) for comparability with the graph of Mexican fraction, Fig-
ure A3b shows the full quarterly data. The smoothed plots show Fan-Gijbels (1992) local linear regressions
of state-quarter wage on quarter-by-year, Epanechnikov kernel, bandwidth 2 quarters. We also show the
same analysis with a different measure of the wage—the average daily wage without board, which covers
more years but omits three states (California, Oregon, and Washington)—with and without smoothing, in
Figure A3c and Figure A3d.

A5.4     Alternative assumptions about missing values
In the differences-in-differences regressions in the main text with domestic employment as the dependent
variable, we assume that when there were no domestic seasonal agricultural workers reported for a state-
month in a month when the source document was issued, there were zero domestic workers of each type
in that state-month. This accords with inspection of the source documents, where missing values for a
state-month typically precede or follow very low values for that state in other months, which would be
expected if the report authors used nonreporting to represent zero.
Here we make the alternative assumption: for months in which the source report was issued, if there is
no report of domestic workers stocks for a state-month, that stock is assumed to be missing, not zero.
This is done in columns 1 and 3 of Table A7. The results in the main text are qualitatively invariant to
this alternative assumption.
Of course, the logarithmic specification of these regressions in the main text takes zero values as missing
by construction. To allow for such nonlinearity without truncating zeros from the dataset, we repeat the
regressions of the main text using the inverse hyperbolic sine of domestic employment as the dependent
variable (returning to the assumption that missing values in the original sources, in months were the
source document was issued, represent zeros). These results are shown in columns 2 and 4 of Table A7.
These results, too, are qualitatively the same as the results in the main text.

A5.5     Compare independent measurements of bracero (outward) flows and in-
         ward stocks
Figure A4 compares the annual total outflow of braceros reported by the government of Mexico (a) with
snapshots of the national-total stocks of braceros reported in state-by-state data by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture in various months (b). The quantities are not strictly comparable: the flow measure captures
how many people made the trip at any point in the year, which will exceed the stock present in the U.S.
at any given moment to a greater degree the shorter the duration of stay for each worker. But given that
some braceros were contracted only for spring work rather than the fall harvest, and some fall workers’
contracts for early-harvest crops ended before October, it is plausible that the stock of braceros present
in October would be roughly 60 percent of the number that had departed for the U.S. at any point in the
year—as is the case in the mid- to late-1950s. This comparison suggests that the stock measures collected
from farmers by the U.S. Department of Agriculture were not severely undercounting the number of
braceros present in each state.

  that month across the years of that decade is equal to the maximum such sum for any month.

  Sources: In Figure A4a the annual total outflow of braceros from Mexico to the U.S. is from González Navarro (1974, Vol. 2,
  Cuadro 39, p. 141), which sources principally the Anuario Estadístico de los Estados Unidos de México but contains data not
  reported in the Anuario, for years 1955–1957, gathered directly from the government by the author.
