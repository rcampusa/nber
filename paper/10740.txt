Disaggregating Employment Protection: The Case of Disability Discrimination

                                            ABSTRACT

Studies of the effects of employment protection frequently examine protective legislation as a whole.
From a policy reform perspective, however, it is often critical to know which particular aspect of the
legislation is responsible for its observed effects. The American with Disabilities Act (ADA), a 1990
federal law covering over 40 million Americans, is a clear case in point. Several empirical studies
have suggested that the passage of the ADA reduced rather than increased employment opportunities
for individuals with disabilities. To the extent this is true, it is crucial to credibly disentangle the
different features of this complex and multi-faceted law. Separately evaluating the distinct aspects
of the ADA is important not only for determining how the law might best be reformed if some
aspects of it produce negative employment effects, but also for improving our understanding of the
potential consequences of ADA-like provisions in race and other civil rights laws. This paper
exploits state-level variation in pre-ADA legal regimes governing disability discrimination to
separately estimate the employment effects of each of the ADA's two primary substantive provisions.
We find strong evidence that the immediate post-enactment employment effects of the ADA are
attributable to its requirement of "reasonable accommodations" for disabled employees rather than
to its potential imposition of firing costs for such employees. Moreover, the pattern of the ADA's
effects across states suggests, contrary to widely discussed prior findings based on national-level
data, that declining disabled employment after the immediate post-ADA period reflects other factors
rather than the ADA itself.

I.      Introduction

        A large literature examines the effects of employment protection on employment levels and other

labor market outcomes for protected workers. In much of this literature, “employment protection” is

taken to be a simple unitary measure. Thus, for instance, in studying the effects of employment

protection on European and Asian unemployment, recent papers by Nickell (1997), Blanchard and

Wolfers (2000), and Besley and Burgess (2004) measure the level of protection or labor regulation using

single-dimension measures from OECD or other data sources. Similarly, Oyer and Schaefer (2000) study

the effects of employment protection on employment levels and other labor market outcomes in the

United States by examining the overall effect of a multi-faceted antidiscrimination law, the Civil Rights

Act of 1991. In many areas, the fact that effects are identified from a single change in the legal regime

means that there is no separate source of variation for identifying which particular components of the new

regime may be primarily responsible for the observed effects; in other cases there are simply not enough

sources of variation to disaggregate the separate components of “employment protection.” Such

limitations on the empirical findings are unfortunate, however, because it is difficult to evaluate potential

policy reforms without an understanding of the specific sources of observed labor market effects.

        The growing literature on the employment effects of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990

(ADA) is a clear case in point. Several recent empirical studies have suggested that the ADA, a law that

broadly regulates the treatment of individuals with disabilities in the workplace and elsewhere, has

reduced the employment of individuals with disabilities (DeLeire 2000, 2003; Acemoglu and Angrist

2001). To the extent this is true—a closely debated question to which we will return in our empirical

analysis—it is critical from a policy perspective to determine which specific features of the ADA may be

primarily responsible for the negative employment effect. While DeLeire (2003:259-60) suggests that

those interested in improving disabled employment opportunities “should reconsider their support of the

ADA as the vehicle for achieving that goal,” policy reform targeted to embracing and preserving the

ADA—a law passed virtually unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed with enthusiasm by a

Republican president—but improving the law’s efficacy appears far more promising from a practical



                                                    1
standpoint than policy reform premised on the broad conclusion that the ADA should be abandoned as a

means of helping individuals with disabilities. If empirical work on protective legislation such as the

ADA is to have genuine policy relevance, it is critical to determine the specific source of the observed

labor market effects of the legislation.

        Despite the voluminous literature on the employment effects of the ADA, the question of why the

ADA might have a negative effect on disabled employment has received essentially no systematic

empirical attention. If the ADA’s provisions render individuals with disabilities more costly to employ

but—because of the difficulty of enforcing prohibitions on discrimination in hiring (Donohue and

Heckman 1991)—do not effectively prevent employers from refusing to hire these individuals in the first

place, then it is unremarkable that the law could be found to reduce rather than increase disabled

employment. But almost no empirical attention has been devoted to the question of just why the ADA

might increase the costs of, and thereby cause the disemployment of, individuals with disabilities.

        Two central provisions of the ADA seem most likely to increase the cost of employing disabled

individuals. First, the ADA mandates that employers provide “reasonable accommodations” to

individuals with disabilities—such as purchasing special equipment or altering workplace structures or

procedures—unless such accommodations would create “undue hardship” for the employer. Such

mandated accommodations impose obvious costs, though the precise magnitude of these costs may be

uncertain (Blanck 1996). Second, by prohibiting discriminatory discharge on the basis of disability, the

ADA creates “firing costs” associated with the employment of individuals with disabilities. These costs

reflect the anticipated expenses (litigation and otherwise) of terminating disabled employees even for

lawful reasons; such costs arise because the legal system must now be convinced that the termination was

not discriminatory. Unlike prohibitions on discriminatory failure to hire, prohibitions on discriminatory

termination are likely to give rise to a significant amount of litigation by employees (Donohue and

Heckman 1991). The ADA, in potentially generating these firing costs, parallels other civil rights

statutes, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act

of 1967. The large existing literature on Title VII’s effects contains competing suggestions on whether



                                                   2
the law has increased (contrary to the firing costs prediction) or decreased (consistent with the firing costs

prediction) employment levels of protected workers (Chay 1998; Heckman and Payner 1989; Donohue

and Siegelman 1991). In light of the existing empirical uncertainty about the validity of the firing costs

account, an empirical investigation of the role of firing costs under the ADA is an important next step in

this literature.

         Because the ADA imposed both a reasonable accommodations requirement and potential firing

costs at the same time (upon its initial enactment), existing studies comparing disabled employment levels

before and after the ADA—including the studies by DeLeire and by Acemoglu and Angrist—are not

well-suited to separating out the effects of the ADA’s reasonable accommodations requirement and its

potential imposition of firing costs.1 The present study seeks to isolate and evaluate the two distinct

explanations for reduced disabled employment after the ADA by exploiting the substantial state-level

variation in disability discrimination regimes that existed prior to the ADA’s enactment. During the pre-

ADA period, some states’ disability discrimination regimes tracked the ADA in both requiring reasonable

accommodations for disabled workers and subjecting employers to a “traditional antidiscrimination

prohibition” (forbidding discrimination on the basis of disability in hiring, firing, and terms and

conditions of employment), with its associated firing costs. During the same period, other states imposed

traditional antidiscrimination prohibitions but departed from the eventual approach of the ADA in not

requiring employers to make reasonable accommodations. Finally, a third group of states imposed no

limits whatever on private employers’ treatment of disabled workers in the pre-ADA period. By

separately evaluating the effects of the ADA—with its dual imposition of a reasonable accommodations

requirement and a traditional antidiscrimination prohibition with its accompanying firing costs—on

  Acemoglu and Angrist briefly attempt to examine the issue of the relative role of the two distinct types of legal
requirements by testing whether “separation rates” for disabled workers fell during the post-ADA period; they find
no discernible effect on separation rates and therefore tentatively suggest that negative effects of the ADA may
result primarily from the law’s reasonable accommodations requirement. However, as Acemoglu and Angrist
emphasize, the separation rate information is “plagued by considerable measurement error,” and this noise may
explain their failure to find an effect of the ADA on separation rates. In contrast to Acemoglu and Angrist, Baldwin
and Schumacher (2002) find that the relative rate of involuntary job changes for disabled compared to nondisabled
workers fell between 1990 and 1993, although again accuracy of measurement may be affecting these results.
Overall, separation rate data does not seem to be a reliable way to disaggregate the employment effects of the
ADA’s distinct provisions.

                                                       3
disabled employment in each of these three distinct state groups, we are able to provide a measure of the

relative importance of the ADA’s reasonable accommodations requirement and its traditional

antidiscrimination prohibition in driving the disabled employment effects of the ADA’s enactment.

           We estimate that in the years just after its enactment the ADA produced approximately a 10

percent decline in disabled employment in states in which the law’s reasonable accommodations

requirement was an innovation, compared to states in which a similar requirement existed at the state

level prior to the ADA’s enactment. By contrast, we consistently find little to no effect of the ADA’s

enactment on disabled employment in states in which the law’s traditional antidiscrimination prohibition,

with its associated firing costs, was an innovation, compared to states with similar preexisting

prohibitions. Our results therefore suggest that the reasonable accommodations requirement of the ADA,

rather than its imposition of firing costs, played the central role in the ADA’s near-term employment

effects.

           The state-law variation in pre-ADA disability discrimination regimes not only allows us to

disaggregate the relationship between the ADA’s enactment and post-ADA employment patterns, but also

provides a new source of variation for probing the robustness of the causal relationship asserted by some

studies between the ADA and the employment trends observed over the 1990s (DeLeire 2000, 2003;

Acemoglu and Angrist 2001). As the significant scholarly debate over the ADA’s employment effects,

culminating in a recent book-length treatment by Dennis Stapleton and Richard Burkhauser (2003),

clearly illustrates, a perennial concern with any study of outcomes before and after the implementation of

a new federal program is that concurrent unmeasured changes other than the passage of the new law—

including shifts in the economic, social, and technological environment—may be the actual causes of the

observed changes in outcomes. Our research, by separately studying the effects of the ADA in those

states that had similar regimes in place prior to the ADA’s enactment, in those states in which the ADA

was an innovation only with respect to imposing a reasonable accommodations requirement, and in those

states in which the ADA was a complete innovation, provides an important new lens on the voluminously

debated question of the causal relationship between the ADA and declines in disabled employment over



                                                    4
the 1990s (DeLeire 2000, 2003; Acemoglu and Angrist 2001; Stapleton, Houtenville and Goodman 2001;

Bound and Waidmann 2002; Beegle and Stock 2003; Kruse and Schur 2003; Stapleton and Burkhauser

2003). Our results clearly support a causal relationship between the ADA and declines in disabled

employment in the years immediately following the law’s enactment, but beyond that period our

findings—contrary to the existing work by DeLeire and by Acemoglu and Angrist—indicate that disabled

employment declines do not appear to be causally linked to the ADA. In particular, while relative

disabled employment was lower in those later years than in the period immediately before the ADA’s

enactment, we find no difference in the employment reduction between states in which the ADA was and

was not an innovation.

        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the data used in our

empirical analysis. Section III presents our basic approach and results. Section IV describes a variety of

robustness checks. Section V offers a concluding discussion.



II.     Data

        A.       Pre-ADA State-Law Regimes

        Tables 1, 2, A1, and A2 report the results of our detailed legal research into state disability

discrimination regimes prior to the ADA. We rely on primary sources (the actual text of statutes and

judicial decisions) and, as described in the tables, have traced statutory provisions through all of their pre-

ADA amendments and code sections. We have also read all of the pre-ADA reported case law, which

provides judicial interpretations of states’ statutory provisions, plus unreported case law available on

Westlaw. The judicial opinions turn out to be a crucial source for us because a number of states imposed

reasonable accommodations requirements by judicial decision rather than by statutory provision, and

because in a few states (most notably Michigan) case law holdings significantly illuminated the meaning

of ambiguous or even conflicting statutory provisions that would otherwise have been read differently.

        As Tables 1 and 2 reveal, states in the pre-ADA period had varying statutory and judicial regimes

governing private employers’ treatment of disabled workers. The largest group of states tracked the ADA



                                                    5
in mandating some form of traditional antidiscrimination prohibition (forbidding discrimination on the

basis of disability in hiring, firing, and terms and conditions of employment), with its associated firing

costs, but differed from the ADA in not imposing a reasonable accommodations requirement; these states

are listed in Table 1, and we refer to them throughout as the “protection without accommodation” states.

A second group of states, listed in Table 2, imposed substantive requirements parallel to those ultimately

imposed by the ADA; we refer to these states as the “ADA-like” states. Finally, a third group of states

(consisting of Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi), which we term the “no protection” states, set no

limits whatsoever on private employers’ treatment of disabled workers prior to the ADA’s enactment.

We address below concerns that there are only three states in this group and that all of them are from the

southern United States.2 No states in the pre-ADA period imposed reasonable accommodations

requirements without having traditional antidiscrimination prohibitions.3



         B.       Disability Status and Other Individual Data

         For the disability status of individuals—as well as for other variables such as employment levels

and various demographic and other controls—we draw on the March Current Population Survey (CPS).

Throughout, we refer to data by its year of observation (the year preceding the March survey), and we

restrict attention to individuals aged 21 through 58. Variables and summary statistics for the years 1988

to 1998 are reported in Table 3.




2
  All three of the “no protection” states did appear to prohibit disability discrimination by public employers (akin to
the employment provisions of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973), but they did not prohibit such discrimination
by private employers. Naturally, given our interest in this paper in examining the effects of the ADA, we focus on
the pre-ADA state-law regimes governing private employers.
3
  Although this research is the first to employ a comprehensive dataset based on original legal sources for state-level
disability discrimination regimes, other studies have made some use of data on these state-level regimes. Acemoglu
and Angrist (2001) briefly use state-law information as an instrument in their empirical analysis and, in so doing,
restrict attention to a limited number of pre-ADA state-law regimes that provided for “misdemeanor charges or civil
penalties” in the event of an employer violation. We do not characterize state regimes along the dimension of
whether or not such sanctions were available because the ordinary set of sanctions—money damages along with
nonmonetary relief such as reinstatement—did not vary significantly across the 47 states with pre-ADA disability
discrimination regimes. Beegle and Stock (2003) also use state-law information in their empirical analysis and,
instead of examining the ADA’s effect across states, examine the effects of the state-law enactments themselves; we
discuss their approach and results at some length in section III below.

                                                        6
         The CPS variable for disability requires some discussion.4 The CPS definition of disability

comes from the March income supplement and reflects the subject’s answer to the question, “Does

[respondent] have a health problem or a disability which prevents him/her from working or which limits

the kind or amount of work he/she can do?” Under the ADA, meanwhile, an individual is disabled if he

or she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, has a record of

such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment. An affirmative answer to the CPS

question certainly does not map perfectly or even that closely onto the ADA’s definition of disability

(Schwochau and Blanck 2000:299-300).

         The reasons that the CPS and ADA definitions may diverge are several. First, individuals who

answer the CPS question affirmatively may be incorrectly reporting health conditions or impairments that

limit work—perhaps because they are unable to find work—and may not in fact be truly impaired (see

Kreider and Pepper 2002). Second, only certain types of genuine impairments that may limit work have

been deemed by the Supreme Court to be covered by the ADA (Sutton v. United Airlines, 527 U.S. 471

(1999)). Third, alongside these respects in which the CPS measure may be broader than the ADA

measure, the CPS measure may be narrower in not including those with a record of impairment or who

are regarded as impaired, but who are not actually impaired.5

         While the CPS measure would clearly provide a poor basis for some empirical conclusions—such

as the absolute number of people protected by the ADA at a given point of time—the estimates we report

are not vulnerable on this ground because our approach uses the CPS measure to assess changes in

employment levels after the ADA’s enactment. Burkhauser, Daly, Houtenville, and Nargis (2002)

provide evidence from National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data that employment changes over time

for populations defined by work limitations (as under the CPS) are not significantly different from



4
  Burkhauser and Daly (2002:219-20) describe varying approaches to the definition of disability. As Acemoglu and
Angrist (2001) note, while the CPS disability question seems to refer to the individual’s status at the time of the
March survey, the question actually serves as a lead-in question for a series of questions about disability income in
the preceding year.
5
  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) claims data (available at
http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/ada.html) suggest that about 15 percent of EEOC claims under the ADA involve the
“record” and “regarded as” prongs of the ADA’s disability definition.

                                                        7
employment changes over time for populations defined by impairments (closer to the ADA’s approach).

Thus, we think that the CPS disability question has enough overlap with the definition of disability under

the ADA that studying how those who answer “yes” to the survey question were affected by the ADA in

terms of their employment levels allows one to learn something important about the effects of the law on

disabled employment.6

        The most important potential concern with the use of the CPS measure of disability or, indeed,

the use of any survey-based measure of disability for purposes of examining pre- and post-ADA

employment levels of individuals with disabilities is that the ADA’s enactment could itself have altered

the composition of the group responding “yes” to the disability survey question. Kruse and Schur (2003)

describe several routes by which the passage of the ADA could alter the nature of the group of individuals

answering “yes” to a disability survey question such as the one in the CPS. If such changes occurred,

then apparent disemployment effects of the ADA could actually be effects of the law on the nature of the

population being counted as disabled. In section IV below, we closely examine the time trend in

affirmative answers to the CPS disability question, and, consistent with prior work on the prospect of

such composition bias (Acemoglu and Angrist 2001:935; Beegle and Stock 2003:855-56), we do not find

evidence that compositional changes are driving our findings.7



III.    Empirical Approach and Results

        The ADA was enacted in July of 1990, so throughout the empirical analysis we compare

employment levels in two-year periods starting in 1990 to employment levels in the two-year period

immediately preceding 1990. Because the ADA did not go into effect until two years after its enactment,

it is possible that effects lagged behind the 1990 enactment date; alternatively, the time immediately


6
  In the future, the CPS is likely to include disability-related questions that map more closely onto the ADA’s
definition (see Kruse and Hale 2003:6-9). No matter how precise this information, however, it will obviously not be
available for either the time period in which the ADA was passed or for the years prior to the ADA’s enactment. In
this light, use of the CPS measure from the pre-ADA and immediate post-ADA periods is a reasonable step in
seeking to measure the effects of the ADA on disabled employment.
7
  The CPS was redesigned between the 1993 and 1994 surveys, corresponding to observation years 1992 and 1993.
Acemoglu and Angrist (2001:925, 951) offer analysis suggesting that the redesign does not materially affect an
understanding of the ADA’s employment effects.

                                                      8
following enactment might have witnessed the largest employment effects as employers in the “protection

without accommodation” and “no protection” states—while facing new potential costs of employing

disabled workers down the road—were not yet restricted by ADA (or ADA-like) provisions and thus

could, for instance, discharge or refuse to hire someone because of the person’s need for reasonable

accommodations without incurring any sort of legal risk during this period. Extensive enactment-period

media coverage of the ADA suggests that many managerial employees in fact learned of the ADA right at

the point of its enactment.8 With respect to our “pre-ADA” period of 1988-1989, because the ADA

actually received widespread media coverage as early as the latter half of 1989—when the law was

already widely anticipated—our use of 1988-1989 as the period against which to measure the law’s

effects will, if anything, tend to bias our estimates against finding an effect of the ADA, as employers’

behavior conceivably could have been affected as early as the second half of 1989.9



         A.       Univariate Results

         Mean employment levels across our three state groups provide a first view of the basic effect of

the ADA’s reasonable accommodations requirement and its traditional antidiscrimination prohibition,

with its associated firing costs, on disabled employment after the ADA’s enactment. Table 4 reports the

mean employment levels in weeks per year for disabled and nondisabled workers, before (1988-1989) and

after (all subsequent pairs of years) the passage of the ADA, separately for each of our three state groups:

the “protection without accommodation” group, containing states with traditional antidiscrimination

8
  A search of the Lexis-Nexis News Group File for mentions of the ADA in 1990 yielded 965 hits.
9
  During the latter half of 1989, media sources frequently referred to the certain or virtually certain passage of the
ADA the following year. In the legal literature, for instance, Chatoff (1989) stated that the ADA “inevitably will”
become law, while Gardner (1989) wrote that Congress “seems almost certain to enact” the ADA “in the very
foreseeable future.” In the popular media, Shapiro (1989) stated of the ADA that “President Bush . . . guaranteed
the bill’s passage with his support,” while Calkins (1989) quoted a disability advocate’s confident declaration that
“for the first time ever, people with disabilities will have civil rights protection under federal law equal to the
protection already afforded to members of minority groups and to women.” Of particular interest are industry
periodicals targeted to employers and their managerial employees; in this category, Romeo (1989) reports in an
article in Nation’s Restaurant News that at a meeting of the National Restaurant Association the “Americans with
Disabilities Act was mentioned several times”; that a member of the Association’s Human Resources Committee
stated that the law “will affect us in the very near future”; and that another Association official stated that the “ADA
seems certain to pass.” Similarly, an editorial entitled “Accommodating Disabled Workers in the Construction
Industry,” published in October of 1989 in the Engineering News-Record, stated that passage of the ADA “seems
certain to follow.”

                                                         9
prohibitions but no reasonable accommodations requirements prior to the ADA’s enactment; the “ADA-

like” group, with states that had both traditional antidiscrimination prohibitions and reasonable

accommodations requirement prior to the ADA’s enactment; and the “no protection” group, containing

states that imposed no restrictions on private employers’ treatment of disabled workers prior to the

ADA’s enactment. We use two-year windows before and after the change in the legal setting (similar to

Katz 1998 and Autor, Donohue, and Schwab 2002).

        Table 4’s top panel compares disabled versus nondisabled employment levels before and after the

ADA in “protection without accommodation” states with disabled versus nondisabled employment levels

before and after the ADA in “ADA-like” states. Because the absence or presence of a pre-ADA

reasonable accommodations requirement is the dimension along which the two state groups differ, this

first comparison provides a measure of the effect of the ADA’s imposition of a reasonable

accommodations requirement. As Table 4 shows, in “protection without accommodation” states, where

the ADA’s reasonable accommodations requirement was an innovation, disabled employment declined by

1.35 weeks per year in 1990-1991 compared to 1988-1989, while nondisabled employment showed a far

smaller decline of 0.23 weeks per year; by contrast, in “ADA-like” states, in which the substantive

requirements of the pre-ADA state-level regimes tracked those of the ADA, disabled employment

actually increased by 0.83 weeks per year in 1990-1991 compared to 1988-1989, while nondisabled

employment was virtually unchanged (a decline of 0.03 weeks per year).

        Taking the difference between the two within-state-group differences for 1990-1991 compared to

1988-1989, the mean-based difference-in-difference-in-difference (DDD) estimate for the change in

disabled employment generated by the imposition of a reasonable accommodations requirement is –1.98

weeks per year (column 3 of Table 4). Given the base number of weeks employed for disabled workers

prior to the ADA’s enactment—16.25 in the “protection without accommodation” states and 18.22 in the

“ADA-like” states—the drop of 1.98 weeks represents over a 10 percent decline in disabled employment.

The evidence of declining relative disabled employment in “protection without accommodation” states

compared to “ADA-like” states continues in 1991-1992 and 1992-1993, and then disappears in 1993-



                                                   10
1994 and subsequent pairs of years—the first suggestion of a near-term but not long-term effect of the

ADA. We discuss this timing pattern in further detail below. Notice the reassuring fact that in all of the

near-term post-ADA comparisons, nondisabled employment—in contrast to disabled employment—is

relatively stable between the pre- and post- ADA periods in both the “protection without accommodation”

and the “ADA-like” states.

        The bottom panel of Table 4 compares “no protection” states, with no pre-ADA legal restrictions

on private employers’ treatment of disabled workers, to “protection without accommodation” states, with

only traditional antidiscrimination prohibitions prior to the ADA’s enactment. This comparison thus

provides a measure of the effect of imposing a traditional antidiscrimination prohibition (an innovation in

the “no protection” states but not in the “protection without accommodation” states). Our mean-based

DDD estimate for the implementation of such a prohibition bounces between negative and positive over

the 1990-1991 through 1997-1998 “after” periods and is always small in magnitude and statistically

indistinguishable from zero. The mean-based results in Table 4 provide a first suggestion that the ADA’s

reasonable accommodations requirement, rather than its potential imposition of firing costs, is the main

source of a near-term negative effect of the law on disabled employment.



        B.       Regression Framework

        Our regression analysis employs a straightforward DDD specification like that used, for example,

in Gruber (1994) and Collins (2003). All regressions take the form:

        Yijt =   β0 + β1Xijt + β2ADAt + β3DISi + β4LPj + β5NPj + β6(ADAt * DISi)

                    + β7(ADAt * LPj) + β8(ADAt * NPj) + β9(DISi * LPj) + β10(DISi * NPj)

                    + β11(ADAt * DISi * LPj) + β12(ADAt * DISi * NPj),                                     (1)

where Y is weeks worked; i indexes individuals, j indexes states, and t indexes years; X is a vector of

demographic and state-level economic characteristics; ADA is a dummy variable equal to 1 in the post-

ADA period; DIS is a dummy variable equal to 1 for disabled individuals; LP is a dummy variable equal

to 1 for states offering limited protection in the form of a traditional antidiscrimination prohibition prior


                                                    11
to the ADA’s enactment (the “protection without accommodation” state group); and NP is a dummy

variable equal to 1 for states in the “no protection” state group. The LP and NP dummy variables

measure effects relative to those in the “ADA-like” group.10

         The coefficients of interest in equation (1) are the coefficients on the triple interaction terms,

ADAt * DISi * LPj and ADAt * DISi * NPj. The coefficient β11 on the first of these terms measures the

change between the pre- and post-ADA periods in disabled versus nondisabled outcomes in “protection

without accommodation” states (those with traditional antidiscrimination prohibitions but no reasonable

accommodations requirements prior to the ADA) relative to this same change in “ADA-like” states (those

with both reasonable accommodations requirements and traditional antidiscrimination prohibitions prior

to the ADA). In other words, β11 tells us how relative disabled outcomes changed in states in which the

ADA’s reasonable accommodations requirement, but not its traditional antidiscrimination prohibition,

was new (the “protection without accommodation” group) compared to how these outcomes changed in

states in which neither substantive requirement of the ADA was new (the “ADA-like” group).

         Our approach here does not assume that the enactment of the ADA made no difference at all in

states that had substantively comparable pre-ADA protections (the “ADA-like” states); among other

things the enactment of the federal statute made available Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

(EEOC) enforcement and altered other procedural aspects of pre-existing disability discrimination law,

such as the availability of federal court adjudication (see generally Neuborne 1977), and these changes

may have influenced disabled outcomes. Effects of the federal regime that are identical across states are

permissible within a DDD framework, although such effects cannot be identified.




10
   Instead of looking at such relative effects, one could examine separate effects within each of the three state
groups. In that model the coefficients of interest would be ADAt * DISi * LPj , ADAt * DISi * NPj , and ADAt * DISi
* ADj , where AD is a dummy variable equal to 1 for states in the “ADA-like” group. Table A3 reports results from
specifications that omit ADAt * DISt and instead estimate the coefficient on ADAt * DISi * ADj. In these
specifications, the coefficients on ADAt * DISi * LPj and ADAt * DISi * NPj measure overall effects rather than
effects relative to the “ADA-like” states. Returning to the original specification reflected in equation (1), because
there are three (nonoverlapping) groups of states in our study, several of the interactions between the dummy
variables are always zero (in particular, LPj * NPj, ADAt * LPj * NPj, DISi * LPj * NPj, and ADAt * DISi * LPj * NPj),
and thus these drop out of equation (1).

                                                       12
        Of course, if the ADA had differential effects across the “protection without accommodation” and

“ADA-like” groups for reasons unrelated to the substantive legal provisions in effect in these groups, then

our estimate of β11 would pick up those additional effects along with the effect of imposing a reasonable

accommodations requirement. If, for example, states in the “ADA-like” group tended to be

systematically more vigorous in accepting and enforcing civil rights claims brought by disabled

individuals than states in the “protection without accommodation” group, then β11 would measure not

only the effect of imposing a reasonable accommodations requirement but also the effect of

supplementing moderate or limited enforcement of disability discrimination law in the “protection

without accommodation” states with the more robust procedures provided by the ADA. Any attempt to

control directly for cross-state variation in pre-ADA enforcement behavior using the number of

discrimination charges brought under the various state laws would be confounded by the significant

endogeneity of charge rates and the employment level (our dependent variable). Acemoglu and Angrist

(2001) address this endogeneity issue in their use of discrimination charge data by instrumenting for state

charge rates with a variable for whether the state had a particular type of pre-ADA disability

discrimination law (one providing for “misdemeanor charges or civil penalties”), but that approach is not

open to us here given the role the state-law information already plays in our analysis.

        Nonetheless, we think it is quite unlikely that our estimate of β11 will be picking up enforcement

differences that could confound the effect on disabled employment of imposing a reasonable

accommodations requirement. The timing of the state-law enactments suggests that the “ADA-like”

states are not the systematically more aggressive, pro-disabled-worker states; in most cases the states that

had reasonable accommodations requirements prior to the ADA’s enactment were those that instituted

disability discrimination regimes relatively late in the game, while the “protection without

accommodation” states were those “early to the party” in protecting civil rights of disabled workers (see

date columns in Tables 1 and 2). Thus, if anything, our estimate of β11 will tend to understate the

potential disemployment effect for disabled workers of imposing a reasonable accommodations




                                                   13
requirement, given the most plausible direction of any pre-ADA enforcement differences between the two

state groups.

        While β11 measures the effect of imposing a reasonable accommodations requirement, equation

(1) also provides us with a direct measure of the effect of simultaneously imposing both a reasonable

accommodations requirement and a traditional antidiscrimination prohibition. The coefficient β12

measures the change between the pre- and post-ADA periods in disabled versus nondisabled outcomes in

“no protection” states (those with no pre-ADA restrictions on employers’ treatment of disabled workers)

relative to this same change in “ADA-like” states, and the difference in legal regimes between those two

groups is the absence (in the former) versus the presence (in the latter) of a reasonable accommodations

requirement and a traditional antidiscrimination prohibition prior to the ADA. Thus the difference in the

two groups’ outcomes (β12) is a measure of the effect of imposing both of these provisions with the

enactment of the ADA; it then follows that the difference β12 – β11, which is also reported in our tables,

measures the effect of imposing just a traditional antidiscrimination prohibition.

        All of the regressions reported below contain controls for individual i’s age, race, sex, educational

attainment, marital status, union membership, and receipt of disability benefits, and for the state

unemployment rate (except where precluded by fixed effects, as noted below) and the interaction of

disability with the state unemployment rate. By the nature of the DDD methodology, our approach

controls for national time trends in employment, the general effect of disability on employment, state-

group specific employment effects, and interactions of each of these factors with the others. Many of our

regressions also include state, year, and state*year fixed effects, although in those specifications we are

unable to identify the effects of the state unemployment rate and of the ADAt, LPj, and NPj variables

from above and their interactions with each other. Importantly, because all of our regressions include the

interaction of disability with the state unemployment rate, our approach controls for the possibility that

individuals with disabilities may face especially poor employment prospects when unemployment rates

are high—an important control given the early 1990s recession immediately following the ADA’s

enactment (Kruse and Schur 2003).


                                                   14
        C.       Regression Results

        The top panel of Table 5 reports the results of the basic specification in equation (1). Consistent

with the findings in Table 4, the estimate for β11, the effect of imposing a reasonable accommodations

requirement, is clearly negative for the post-ADA year pairs 1990-1991, 1991-1992, and 1992-1993, with

estimates ranging from –1.54 to –2.51 weeks per year. Thus, as before, imposing a reasonable

accommodations requirement seems to produce in the neighborhood of a 10 percent decline in disabled

employment in the near-term aftermath of the ADA’s enactment. Meanwhile, again parallel to the results

in Table 4, the estimate for β12 – β11, the effect of imposing a traditional antidiscrimination prohibition,

over the post-ADA years 1990-1991, 1991-1992, and 1992-1993 is small in magnitude, inconsistent in

sign, and never statistically significant. Thus, our results once again suggest that the reasonable

accommodations requirement of the ADA, rather than its traditional antidiscrimination prohibition, was

the source of a short-term negative effect of the law on disabled employment. The second panel in Table

5 shows that our results are unchanged when state, year, and state*year fixed effects are included, and the

top panel of Table A4 verifies that the results are unchanged when state, state*year, and state*disability

fixed effects (to control for compositional changes) are included.

        Our basic finding of a significant negative employment effect of imposing a reasonable

accommodations requirement contrasts with the conclusions of a recent paper by Beegle and Stock

(2003), whose results also point in a direction opposite that of DeLeire (2000, 2003) and Acemoglu and

Angrist (2001). Beegle and Stock use Census data for 1970, 1980, and 1990 to study the effects of the

enactment of state laws governing disability discrimination in the pre-ADA period (whereas we examine

the effects of the ADA across different groups of states characterized by their varying pre-ADA legal

regimes). Beegle and Stock find no significant effect of the enactment of reasonable accommodations

requirements (in contrast with our finding) and no significant effect of the enactment of disability

discrimination law in general (in contrast with the findings of DeLeire and of Acemoglu and Angrist).




                                                    15
         The difference between Beegle and Stock’s results and those of others (including us) is

attributable, we think, to a combination of the relatively imprecise information on state laws used by

Beegle and Stock and some features of their econometric approach.11 Regarding information on state

laws, as detailed above, we obtained information exclusively from primary sources and traced laws

through all of their pre-ADA amendments and code provisions. By contrast, Beegle and Stock rely on

secondary sources, which in some cases prove to be inaccurate and in any event do not allow them to

identify the year of a law’s enactment (just the year when the law is first referred to in the secondary

source in question). The imprecision in the information about state laws will affect Beegle and Stock’s

empirical analysis when the dating errors cross decade markers, as they do in a number of cases.12 This

noise in the coding of the state-law explanatory variable will tend to bias estimates toward zero (see

Autor, Donohue, and Schwab 2002:28), and this may help to explain the difference between Beegle and

Stock’s findings and the results obtained by us, DeLeire, and Acemoglu and Angrist.



11
   An additional difference between Beegle and Stock’s analysis and ours is that most of their regressions include
year and disability*year fixed effects; incorporating disability*year fixed effects proves to have a dramatic effect on
their results. In our analysis, by contrast, the bottom panel of Table A4 shows that adding year and disability*year
fixed effects to our basic specification has little effect on our results.
12
   For instance, Beegle and Stock, relying on a secondary source, state that Arkansas had a law, §20-14-303,
prohibiting private sector disability discrimination by 1987. However, this statute did not, in 1987, cover
employment discrimination, although it did cover private sector discrimination in other areas, such as access to
restaurants and other public places. (The full text of the statute is available in the AR-STANN87 historical
legislative database on Westlaw.) In alphabetical order, other states that are incorrectly classified by Beegle and
Stock in terms of the decade in which private sector employment discrimination laws relating to disability were
enacted include Colorado, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, North Carolina, Oregon, and Rhode Island. Of this
group, Colorado and Louisiana are misclassified as to both the decade in which a traditional antidiscrimination
prohibition was enacted and the decade in which a reasonable accommodations requirement was enacted; Missouri,
North Carolina, and Rhode Island are misclassified as to the decade in which a traditional antidiscrimination
prohibition was enacted; and Massachusetts and Oregon are incorrectly classified as to the decade in which a
reasonable accommodations requirement was enacted. See Tables 1 and 2 below for state law enactment
information.
   Hotchkiss (2002) also makes some use of the pre-ADA state disability discrimination regimes, and differs from
Beegle and Stock in relying on primary legislative materials rather than secondary sources. However, she
nonetheless incorrectly categorizes a substantial number of states, in many instances probably because a state statute
prior in time to the one she located also regulated disability discrimination in employment; these errors may
contribute to her finding of a limited effect of the ADA’s enactment across state groups. States miscategorized by
Hotchkiss, in terms of date of enactment, include Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts,
New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, and Virginia. (In the case of Alaska, California,
and South Dakota, Hotchkiss explicitly notes that “exact original coverage [is] not available.”) Some of the dating
errors will not affect Hotchkiss’s empirical results; she examines the effects of state laws enacted between 1981 and
1991, and, thus, a dating error outside this period will not affect her results. However, in the case of six states—
Alaska, Hawaii, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas—the dating error affects the
classification of states over the 1981-1991 period.

                                                        16
        Apart from the imprecision in Beegle and Stock’s characterization of state-law regimes, their

empirical methodology may be less well-suited than ours to pinning down accurately the employment

effects of reasonable accommodations requirements and traditional antidiscrimination prohibitions

imposed by disability discrimination law. Beegle and Stock employ a framework in which some states

have promulgated a particular law during a given time period while others have not, and in which changes

in outcomes across the two groups of states are then compared. In that setting, a risk always exists that

adjustments in the relative labor market outcomes in the different states reflect not the policy shifts under

study but rather some set of underlying state-level social or economic changes that simultaneously

caused, or at least occurred contemporaneously with, the changes in the state laws (see Besley and Case

2000). As Beegle and Stock note, “[i]f laws were disproportionately passed in states where the disabled

were [already] faring better, we would expect the laws to have smaller effects and our empirical results to

underestimate the negative impact of the legislation (relative to random assignment of the laws, including

states where the negative impact of the laws would be larger).” Examining the enactment of the ADA

against a background of a well-established diversity of state law, by contrast, reduces the concern about

this sort of omitted-variables bias because there is less reason to fear that the degree to which the ADA

was an innovation in a given state is correlated with state-specific social or economic changes, given that

virtually all of the state laws in question were enacted well before the ADA (see Tables 1 and 2).

        Returning to our empirical results, the 93-94 through 97-98 columns of Table 5 show that in this

period neither imposing a reasonable accommodations requirement nor imposing a traditional

antidiscrimination prohibition had a statistically significant effect on disabled employment; estimates for

β11 range from –0.60 to 0.70, while those for β12 – β11 range from –0.25 to 0.87. In other words,

beginning in 1993-1994 and going forward the ADA’s enactment had statistically indistinguishable

effects across the three state groups. What is especially striking about these later “post-ADA” years is

that it is precisely in 1993-1994 that the estimated coefficient on the term ADAt*DISi, measuring the

common effect of the ADA across states, becomes negative and statistically significant; therefore, from

1993-1994 forward, movements in relative disabled employment were downward and similar in



                                                   17
magnitude across all three state-law regimes—a sharp contrast with the clear differential pattern, based on

pre-ADA state legal regimes, in the early years after the ADA’s enactment. The bottom panel of Table 5

underlines the point by showing that in a specification that simply ignores state-law information entirely

(by setting NPj = LPj = 0 in equation (1)), the estimated coefficients on ADAt*DISi in 1993-1994 and

forward are quite similar to the estimated coefficients on these variables in the top and middle panels, in

which the separate effects of being in the “protection without accommodation” and “no protection” state

groups are not restricted to zero.

        Thus, our results for 1993-1994 and forward, while consistent with existing findings of a

persistent decline in disabled employment over the 1990s relative to the pre-ADA period, reveal the

absence of any link between the degree of employment effects in this later period and the degree to which

the ADA was actually a legal innovation relative to pre-ADA state law. Our findings appear to deny

earlier studies attributing declining disabled employment in 1993-1994 and forward to the ADA’s

enactment the obvious theoretical explanations for their conclusions, as we find no evidence that either

the imposition of a reasonable accommodations requirement or the firing costs potentially associated with

a traditional antidiscrimination prohibition can explain the decline in disabled employment in 1993-1994

and forward.

        The juxtaposition of a clear state-group pattern, in a predictable direction, in the immediate post-

ADA period (through 1992-1993) and no state-group differences in the later years raises some questions

about the longevity of any negative employment effects of the ADA. It seems plausible in light of our

findings that the apparent negative effect of the ADA on disabled employment in 1993-1994 and

subsequent years reflects not the impact of the ADA itself but, rather, other contemporaneous changes

disproportionately affecting individuals with disabilities. Otherwise, it is not immediately clear why the

magnitude of the disabled disemployment effect after the ADA (in 1993-1994 and forward) would have

no relationship to the degree to which the ADA was a legal innovation in a given state, when such a

relationship clearly existed in the immediate post-enactment period. Just below we discuss reasons that




                                                   18
the ADA’s imposition of a reasonable accommodations requirement might have had only a short-term

negative effect on disabled employment.



        D.       Discussion

        Our results indicate that in the near-term after the ADA’s enactment, the law’s reasonable

accommodations requirement, but not its traditional antidiscrimination prohibition with its potential firing

costs, had a significant negative effect on disabled employment. The significant negative effect of the

reasonable accommodations requirement on disabled employment in the period just after the ADA’s

enactment may reflect the fact that many accommodations, including physical alterations to the workplace

and modification of workplace policies, impose obvious but often one-time costs on employers – costs

that may well have been exaggerated or particularly salient in employers’ minds just after the ADA’s

enactment.13 Employers might naturally have responded to such perceived costs by curtailing their hiring

of disabled workers, particularly in the period between the ADA’s enactment and effective dates because

in that period curtailed hiring on account of accommodation costs would not have been illegal in the

states in which the ADA’s reasonable accommodations requirement was an innovation. Further reasons

that the effect of the ADA’s reasonable accommodations requirement on disabled employment could have

been more negative in the short term than in the medium and long term include the ADA’s important

symbolic effect and the resulting changes in attitudes over time; the possibility that reasonable

accommodations could ultimately increase the flow of qualified disabled applicants following a short-

term reduction as disabled individuals responded to the ADA by pursuing more education (see Jolls

2000); and declining accommodation costs in response to technological changes and judicial refinements

of the ADA’s requirements. The conclusion that the true employment effects of the ADA are short-term




13
   While some observers have pointed to evidence that accommodation costs may often be modest (Blanck 1996),
measurement issues and skewed samples of accommodations suggest that relatively limited weight should be
attached to such evidence (Stein 2000:1677). In any event it is quite clear that some legally mandated
accommodations—for instance, the need to hire readers for blind employees, as specified by federal regulations (see
29 CFR § 1630.2(o))—are in fact extremely costly for employers.

                                                      19
rather than permanent effects is consistent with Kirchner (1986), who emphasizes that the consequences

of laws such as the ADA may differ significantly over different time horizons.14



IV.     Further Robustness Checks

        This section further probes the robustness of our basic finding in Tables 4 and 5 that in the years

just after the ADA’s enactment, the imposition of the law’s reasonable accommodations requirement, but

not its traditional antidiscrimination prohibition, produced a significant decline in disabled employment.

We also examine the possible role of composition effects and preexisting state-group specific

employment trends in our analysis.



        A.       Robustness to the Timing of State-Law Enactment

        The upper left-hand panel of Table 6 shows the results (for post-ADA years 1990-1991, 1991-

1992, and 1992-1993) of estimating the basic fixed-effects specification from the middle panel of Table 5

on a subsample of observations from states in which the state-level pre-ADA disability discrimination

regime was already in place prior to 1980. We perform this check on the theory that these early

enactors—which, as noted earlier, are predominantly “protection without accommodation” states—may

have differed systematically in their degrees of “civil rights orientation,” and thus in their enforcement

environments, from the later enactors. The fact that in two of the three regressions the estimate of β11

becomes even more negative than in Table 5 provides some support for our suggestion above that the

estimates based on the full 50-state sample may actually understate the effect of imposing a reasonable

accommodations requirement. However, some degree of caution is warranted in interpreting these results

because only three states in the “ADA-like” group (Colorado, Oregon and Washington) had their pre-

ADA regimes in place prior to 1980. Subject to the caveat just noted, the robustness of our estimate of

14
  With respect to the short-term employment effects of the ADA’s reasonable accommodations requirement, a more
positive account than the one given in the text is that negative employment effects were themselves reasonable
accommodations to the scheduling needs of disabled workers (see Tolin and Patwell 2003). Given that we observe
declines in weeks worked, not hours worked per week, however, and that the decline is limited to the immediate
post-ADA period, it seems difficult to view the negative employment effects as the fact, rather than the potential
consequence, of mandated accommodation.

                                                     20
β11 in a sample of states with more uniform enactment dates also responds to the possible concern that, if

there are either lags or bursts in state law effectiveness shortly after a state law is put on the books, then

our 50-state results could be confounded by the different average enactment dates across the “protection

without accommodation” and “ADA-like” state groups. Our estimate of β12 – β11, the effect of imposing

a traditional antidiscrimination prohibition, is also quite stable across the broader (all states) and narrower

(pre-1980 enactors only) samples.



        B.       Robustness to Variation in Employer-Size Coverage Thresholds

        As shown in Tables 1 and 2, pre-ADA state legal regimes varied significantly in the numerical

employer-size thresholds they established for coverage by the state legal regime. To mitigate any concern

with bias from these significantly varying thresholds, we re-estimated the basic fixed-effects specification

from the middle panel of Table 5 using only observations from states with employer-size coverage

thresholds of 15 employees (the ultimate ADA threshold) or higher. (Only one state, Delaware, had a

threshold of greater than 15 employees.) Our results, reported in the upper right-hand panel of Table 6,

again point to a negative effect of imposing a reasonable accommodations requirement and essentially no

effect of imposing a traditional antidiscrimination prohibition. The fact that controlling for variation in

employer-size coverage thresholds does not affect our basic finding provides some further support for our

earlier suggestion that “protection without accommodation” and “ADA-like” states are not differentially

affected by the ADA’s enactment because of a difference in the general civil-rights orientation of these

two state groups, as such a difference in general civil-rights orientation would probably tend to correlate

at least to some degree with a more versus less aggressive approach to the coverage of small employers.



        C.       Robustness to Alternative Measures of Disability Benefits

        At around the time the ADA was enacted, the generosity of federal disability benefits was

increasing substantially (Bound and Waidmann 2002). Higher disability benefit levels provide an

independent ground for reduced disabled employment because higher benefit levels reduce disabled


                                                    21
individuals’ need or desire for wage-based income. The increase in the number of disabled individuals

receiving disability benefits, as well as the decrease in weeks worked for individuals with disabilities,

over the 1990s are readily apparent from the summary statistics reported in Table 3.

        While all of the regressions reported thus far contain controls for disability benefits, the shift in

federal disability benefit levels is actually of less concern for our study than for prior studies that compare

overall disabled employment outcomes before and after the ADA’s enactment (DeLeire 2000, 2003;

Acemoglu and Angrist 2001) because our DDD framework examines disabled employment levels in one

group of states relative to disabled employment levels in other state groups, and thus changes in federal

benefits levels are not as likely to matter for our results. Still, changes in federal disability benefits could

affect our analysis if for some reason the resulting changes in disabled individuals’ need or desire for

wage income (and thus their work incentives) differed systematically across our three state groups. Autor

and Duggan (2003), for instance, note that work incentives depend on the relationship between disability

benefit levels and wages, and thus states experiencing smaller wage increases (or larger wage declines)

would tend to have more individuals receiving federal disability benefits, and thus not seeking and

obtaining employment, at any given federal level of these benefits. If wage levels across states were for

some reason correlated with pre-ADA state-law disability discrimination regimes, then the effects of

changes in federal disability benefits generosity (mediated through the Autor-Duggan mechanism) might

be captured by, and therefore bias, our results.

          The regressions reported thus far control for disability benefits receipt using a dummy variable

for whether individuals received federal disability benefits through either the Disability Insurance (DI)

program or the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.15 Because, however, the measure of

disability benefits receipt in the March CPS is not ideal, we perform additional robustness checks using

state-level DI and SSI applications and receipts in the population from Social Security Administration

records. The lower panel of Table 6 reports the results of re-estimating the basic fixed-effects


15
  The CPS provides information on receipt of benefits from the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance
(OASDI) and SSI programs. However, because our sample does not include individuals 59 and older, OASDI
benefits should be exclusively from the DI program.

specification from the middle panel of Table 5 using, respectively, the percent of the state population

receiving disability benefits interacted with the disability status dummy variable (left-hand panel) and the

percent of the state population applying for disability benefits interacted with the disability status dummy

variable (right-hand panel). (Including state fixed effects means we cannot separately identify main

effects of the new disability benefits variables.) Our results for the effects of imposing a reasonable

accommodations requirement versus a traditional antidiscrimination prohibition are, once again, quite

consistent with our benchmark estimates from Table 5.



        D.      Robustness to Variation in Economic Environment

        As noted above, our basic specification controls for variation in states’ economic environments

by including state unemployment rate and the interaction of disability and state unemployment rate.

However, as a further check on the possibility that unobservable economic variation across states might

be influencing our results, we re-estimated the basic fixed-effects specification from the middle panel of

Table 5 without state unemployment rate information; if removing these controls does not affect our

results, then it seems unlikely that further unobservable economic differences are playing an important

role. The results, shown in the upper panel of Table A5, are quite similar to those in the benchmark

specification reported in Table 5.



        E.      Geographic Robustness

        We noted earlier that, while both the “protection without accommodation” and “ADA-like”

groups are large and well-balanced across the country, the “no protection” group consists of only three

states, all of which are from the southern United States (Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi). Our

estimate of the effect of the ADA’s reasonable accommodations requirement will not be affected by the

limited geographic diversity of the “no protection” group because that effect is identified solely from the

comparison of employment changes in the “protection without accommodation” group with similar

changes in the “ADA-like” group; but our estimate of the effect of the ADA’s traditional



                                                   23
antidiscrimination prohibition, based on a comparison of “no protection” and “protection without

accommodation” states, could be distorted by this aspect of the pre-ADA state legal landscape. In

particular, if some unobserved shock occurred in the southern region of the country between the pre- and

post-ADA periods, and that shock differentially affected disabled and nondisabled workers, then our

estimate of β12 – β11 could capture the effect of this unobserved shock in addition to any effect caused by

the enactment of the ADA.

        A straightforward strategy to alleviate the concern about a possible “southern trend” is simply to

re-estimate equation (1) on just the southern states from each of our three state groups. The “protection

without accommodation” group in this regression includes Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina, and

Tennessee, while the “ADA-like” group contains Louisiana and North Carolina. (The “no protection”

group is, as before, Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi.) Although, not surprisingly, the precision of our

estimates falls with the sharp reduction in sample size, the lower panel of Table A5 shows that the results

of estimating the basic fixed-effects specification from the middle panel of Table 5 on the nine-state

southern sample follow the same basic pattern as the results from the full 50-state sample.



        F.      Composition of the Disabled Group

        As noted earlier, an important question that arises with the use of a survey-based disability

measure, such as the CPS measure used in our analysis, is the possibility of law-driven changes in the

composition of the group answering the survey question affirmatively. If the group of individuals

identifying themselves as disabled in response to the CPS survey question changed in shape or size as a

result of the ADA’s enactment, then measured changes in disabled employment levels between the pre-

and post-ADA periods may capture differences in the nature of the group answering “yes” to the survey

question rather than employer-side effects of the new legal regime. Kruse and Schur (2003:49), for

instance, find evidence from Survey of Income and Program Participation data of higher numbers of

individuals reporting severe limitations in 1993 than in 1991, and it would not be surprising for those with

severe limitations to have lower chances of employment.



                                                  24
         An important advantage of the framework we employ is that changes over time in the shape or

size of the group of individuals identifying themselves as disabled in response to the CPS question will

not affect our analysis unless these changes vary with the pre-ADA legal regime of the state in which an

individual lives. While nationwide changes certainly seem plausible, state-varying changes are less

likely. This is not to say that they are inconceivable, however; one obvious possibility is that legal reform

may make disability more socially accepted and thus lead more people to identify themselves as disabled.

If this were the case, then changes in disability identification with the ADA could be more substantial in

states in which the ADA was a more significant innovation.

         For state-group specific changes in individuals’ identification as disabled to confound our results,

one of three things would have to be the case. First, significant innovation through the ADA in the

“protection without accommodation” and “no protection” states could for some reason have made

individuals with worse employment prospects than those who identified as disabled prior to the ADA

more likely to identify themselves as disabled. This could produce an apparent disemployment effect for

disabled workers in the states in which the ADA was a significant innovation. However, if anything one

would think it would be those closest to the line between disability and nondisability, and thus those with

relatively good employment prospects, who might switch from identifying as nondisabled to identifying

as disabled in a state in which the ADA was a significant innovation (say because the innovation made

disability more socially acceptable). Put another way, it seems rather difficult to tell a story in which

those who are severely limited switch from answering the CPS question “no” to answering it “yes” when

the ADA constitutes a significant innovation in their state, while those who are less severely limited do

not exhibit a similar change.16

         The second possibility for a confounding effect on our results is that individuals with reasonably

good employment prospects became less likely in the wake of significant legal innovation through the

ADA in “protection without accommodation” or “no protection” states to identify themselves as disabled,


16
  Even if it is the case (as suggested by Kruse and Schur 2003:49) that the proportion of disabled individuals who
report severe disabilities has increased on a nationwide basis in the post-ADA years, it is unclear how this effect
could plausibly be correlated with the degree to which the ADA was a significant legal innovation in a given state.

                                                       25
precisely because the reform helped them to obtain and retain jobs (see Kirchner 1986:83). Again, this

could produce an apparent disemployment effect for disabled workers in states in which the ADA was a

significant innovation. If the legal reform did lead to a decline in the reporting of disability, then the

proportion of disabled individuals should either shrink or grow more slowly in “protection without

accommodation” and “no protection” states than in “ADA-like” states. Figure 1 graphs the proportion of

disabled individuals over time across our three state groups from 1988 to 1998, while Figure 2 presents

corresponding fourth-order polynomial trend lines. Over this period it does not appear that disability rates

declined in states in which the ADA was a significant innovation (states in the “protection without

accommodation” and “no protection” groups) relative to the “ADA-like” states. With respect to the “no

protection” states, measuring changes between 1988 and the post-ADA years 1990-1993, Figure 1 shows

that the proportion of individuals answering the CPS disability question affirmatively increased more in

the “no protection” states than in the “ADA-like” states for year pairings 1988-1991 and 1988-1993,

while this proportion increased more in the “ADA-like” states than the “no protection” states for year

pairings 1988-1990 and 1988-1992. With respect to the “protection without accommodation” states,

meanwhile, Figure 1 reveals that over 1990 and 1991 (relative to 1988) the proportion of individuals

answering the CPS disability question affirmatively increased more in the “ADA-like” states (implying

slower growth in the “protection without accommodation” states); but precisely the same trend was

apparent in 1989, even before the ADA was enacted. In 1992 and 1993 (the other years in which we find

a negative effect of the ADA on disabled employment in “protection without accommodation” states

relative to “ADA-like” states), by contrast, Figure 1 shows that disability rates are virtually identical

across the two state groups, as they also were in the 1988 start year.

        A final possibility with respect to the composition of the disabled group, suggested by the work

of Autor and Duggan (2003), is that states in which the ADA was a significant legal innovation also for

some reason happened to be states that were experiencing smaller wage increases or larger wage declines

around the time of the ADA’s enactment; as described above, individuals in such states would both tend

to be more likely to identify as disabled (to get federal disability benefits) and tend to be more likely not



                                                    26
to be employed (again to be eligible for federal disability benefits). This effect could produce a spurious

correlation between the ADA’s enactment and employment effects across states if for some reason state-

level wage changes were correlated with pre-ADA state disability discrimination regimes. The regression

results reported above (Tables 5 and 6), however, show that our results are robust to a range of controls

for disability benefits receipts and applications. In sum, although we cannot entirely rule out an effect on

our results of changes in the composition of the group responding affirmatively to the CPS disability

question, our basic finding of a negative near-term effect of the ADA’s reasonable accommodations

requirement on disabled employment does not appear to be driven by such changes.



        G.      Preexisting State-Group Specific Trends in Disabled Employment

        Our conclusion that declining disabled employment in “protection without accommodation”

states relative to “ADA-like” states in the near-term post-ADA period reflects the ADA’s imposition of a

reasonable accommodations requirement obviously rests on the premise that the observed pattern of

effects did not predate the ADA “experiment.” Figure 3 graphs disabled employment trends in the

“protection without accommodation” and “ADA-like” states from 1987, the first observation year in

which the general disability status question was asked in the CPS, to 1992, the last year in which disabled

employment in the two state groups moved in significantly different ways. (As the results reported above

suggest, convergence between the two state groups began in 1993. As the earlier results from Table 4

also show, nondisabled employment was relatively stable in both state groups over the relevant period, so

Figure 3 focuses on disabled employment.) These data paint a reassuring picture in which disabled

employment moved roughly in tandem across the two state groups prior to 1990 and then diverged

markedly in 1990-1992 (see Figure 3). A longer pre-ADA window would obviously be preferable, but

the available data point to a genuine break in trend upon the ADA’s enactment.




                                                   27
V.      Conclusion

        This paper uses pre-ADA state-law variation to disaggregate the disabled employment effects of

the two central provisions of the ADA, its reasonable accommodations requirement and its traditional

antidiscrimination prohibition with associated firing costs. Our effort to disaggregate the ADA’s effects

in this way reflects a desire to evaluate policy reforms more tailored and more politically realistic than the

broadscale recommendation that the ADA be abandoned (see DeLeire 2003). However, our empirical

approach ultimately yielded a more profound challenge to the existing literature suggesting ongoing

negative employment effects of the ADA. Our results suggest that while the ADA’s reasonable

accommodations requirement had a significant negative effect on disabled employment in the near-term

after the ADA’s enactment, the law may well have had no causal link to the declines in disabled

employment through much of the 1990s.

Notes: The dependent variable is weeks worked per year. The pre-ADA period is 1988-1989. The post-ADA
period is as stated. Robust standard errors clustered on state-disability interactions are in parentheses below
coefficient estimates, and robust standard errors clustered on state-disability-year interactions are in square
brackets below coefficient estimates. All regressions are OLS regressions, employ CPS survey weights, and
include the individual control variables listed in the text plus controls for state unemployment rate (in regressions
without state, year, and state*year fixed effects) and the interaction of disability and state unemployment rate. See
equation (1) for further details.

Notes: The dependent variable is weeks worked per year. The pre-ADA period is 1988-1989. The post-ADA period is
as stated. Robust standard errors clustered on state-disability interactions are in parentheses below coefficient
estimates, and robust standard errors clustered on state-disability-year interactions are in square brackets below
coefficient estimates. All regressions are OLS regressions, employ CPS survey weights, and include state, year, and
state*year fixed effects. Control variables are as stated in Table 5. In the upper panel of the present table, columns (1)-
(3) use observations from states in which the state-level pre-ADA disability discrimination regime was in place prior to
1980; columns (4)-(6) use observations from states with ADA-like employer-size thresholds. See Tables 1 and 2 for
details on employer-size thresholds; observations from Tennessee and Virginia, whose pre-ADA statutory and judicial
law did not specify an employer-size threshold, are not included in the samples used in column (4)-(6). In the lower
panel, columns (1)-(3) replace individual receipt of disability benefits with the percent of the state population receiving
disability benefits interacted with disability status; columns (4)-(6) replace individual receipt of disability benefits with
the percent of the state population applying for disability benefits interacted with disability status. Fixed effects
included in these regressions preclude inclusion of the percent of the state population receiving or applying for
disability benefits alone.

Notes: Results duplicate the first two panels of Table 5 except that state-group effects are overall effects for each
state group rather than effects in the "protection without accommodation" and "no protection" groups relative to
"ADA-like" states. ADA*DIS*AD replaces ADA*DIS in all regressions in this table. The dependent variable is
weeks worked per year. The pre-ADA period is 1988-1989. The post-ADA period is as stated. Robust standard
errors clustered on state-disability interactions are in parentheses below coefficient estimates, and robust standard
errors clustered on state-disability-year interactions are in square brackets below coefficient estimates. All
regressions are OLS regressions and employ CPS survey weights. Control variables are as stated in Table 5.

include the fixed effects specified in the table. Control variables are stated in Table 5. In the upper panel of this
table, the fixed effects preclude the estimation of the coefficients on ADA, LP, NP, ADA*LP, ADA*NP, DIS*LP,
and DIS*NP from the basic specification in equation (1). In the lower panel, the fixed effects preclude the
estimation of the coefficients on ADA, DIS, and ADA*DIS from this specification.
