                                             ABSTRACT

Most technology startups are set up for exit through acquisition by large corporations. In
choosing when to sell, startups face a tradeoff. Early acquisition reduces execution errors but later
acquisition improves the likelihood of finding a better match since in the early market, there are
fewer buyers because early acquisition requires costly absorptive capacity. Moreover, the buyer’s
decision to invest in absorptive capacity is related to the startup’s decision about the timing of the
exit sale. In this paper, we build a model to capture this complexity and the related tradeoffs. We
find that the early market for startups is inefficiently thin if the timing of exit is a strategic choice,
i.e. startups have to commit to whether to exit early or late. Too few startups are sold early, and
too few buyers invest in absorptive capacity. Paradoxically, venture capital aggravates the
inefficiency. However, if the timing of exit is a tactical choice, i.e. startups can choose to go late
after observing the early offers, there are too many early acquisitions and too much investment in
absorptive capacity by incumbents

    1. Introduction

Many inventions begin the journey to commercialization in startups. After a period of incubation and
development, the invention can be passed on to an incumbent, typically by the incumbent buying the
startup.1 When to sell a startups is an important decision for entrepreneurs and investors. There are natural
inflection points in the lifecycles of startups when they can be acquired or can choose to persist and
develop the technology closer to commercialization (Graebner and Eisenhardt, 2004; Allain et al. 2016).
As venture capitalist, Bill Janeway from Warburg Pincus, writes2

      Given the much extended path to self-sustaining positive cash flow from operations, the
      responsible entrepreneur and VC are charged with asking themselves the same question at
      each step along the way:

      -    The technology does “light up” — do we sell now?
      -    We have three credible customers who will testify that they have bought our offering and
           will buy more — do we sell now?
      -    We have access to another round of capital but it will be dilutive and Business Risk
           looms — do we sell now?

It is not difficult to find other examples. Foursquare, a local search-and-discovery service mobile app
based in New York City, was offered $100 million by both Yahoo and Facebook, one year after it
launched in 2010, and both offers were turned down. Receptos, a San Diego-based biotechnology
company, waited seven years after its foundation before accepting a multibillion offer from Calgene,
which outbid AstraZeneca, Teva and Gilead. While both Foursquare and Receptos seem to have made the
right decision in postponing their exit, the counterfactual is unclear. Failure rates among technology
startups are extremely high.3 For instance, Maine and Thomas (2017) provide the example of an MIT
startup, BIND, which raised several rounds of capital to apply its nano-particle drug delivery to new
therapies. Despite going public via an IPO in 2013, in 2016, it was forced to file for bankruptcy following
a failed clinical trial. BIND was acquired by Pfizer shortly thereafter for its intellectual property assets.

  The National Venture Capital Association reports that acquisitions accounted for 82% of the venture
capital-backed exits in 2016 in the US (https://nvca.org/pressreleases/2017-nvca-yearbook-highlights-
busy-year-venture-industry-nvca/). Cunningham (2017) shows that out of the 83 startups in the US
medical device industry that exited, 71 were acquired. Mathisen and Rasmussen (2016) also identify
acquisitions as the most frequent exit strategy in the case of successful Norwegian startups.

  Startup failure rates are as high as 90% in some industries. Remarkably, the probabilities of success of
biotech companies’ in stage III of drug development are lower than the those of large pharmaceutical
firms in comparable conditions (Guedj and Scharfstein, 2004; Arora et al., 2009).


                                                       1
Arguably, BIND would have been better off being acquired at an earlier stage rather than investing in
building an organization and clinical trials.

Figure 1 shows the timing of startup sales across three different industries: bio-pharma, software and
mobile devices.4 It plots the respective fractions of startups acquired before round A, before round B and
after round B. It shows that there is heterogeneity within as well as across industries in the timing of
startup sales, with a higher share of late acquisitions in bio-pharma. Insofar as development costs in
biotech typically are higher than in software, financial constraints on startups are unlikely to be the main
determinant of exit timing; other forces are likely to be at work.

In this paper, we build a model to understand the factors that explain the timing of startup sales, and to
investigate the efficiency properties of the equilibrium between buyers and sellers. We focus on exit
through acquisition by an incumbent, which is by far the most common exit route for successful startups.5
The timing of the acquisition is important for understanding the division of innovative labor (Arora and

  Formally, we ignore IPOs. However, as discussed below, our analysis could be extended to allow for an
IPO as a possible further stage if the startup is not acquired.

Gambardella, 1994).6 If innovation is the outcome of mutual specialization between startups that develop
inventions, and established incumbents that will eventually commercialize most of them (Arora et al.,
2001; Gans and Stern, 2003), our paper analyzes one way in which the market for startups that underpins
the division of innovative labor may be inefficient.

In studying the timing of the startup sale, we focus on the tradeoff between execution errors and the
possibility of a better match. On the one hand, startups are often less efficient at developing inventions.
To anticipate our model, startups have a greater likelihood of failing even if the underlying technology is
good. For instance, they may not hire the right people, they may develop the product for the wrong
market, or try to develop it for too many markets and succeed at none, or they may simply run out of
money. Established firms have developed routines for developing and commercializing inventions, which
are less prone to execution failures. These firms already possess product development processes,
manufacturing capability, sales and marketing channels, logistics and distribution, and other
complementary resources (Teece, 1986) which startups have to create from scratch.7 Mistakes and
missteps are inevitable. On the other hand, early stage markets tend to have fewer buyers than later stage
markets. If the value created by a startup is idiosyncratic to a buyer, having more potential buyers
increases the total value. This creates a tradeoff for the startup: Create and capture more value by being
acquired when the business is more mature but run a greater risk of failing due to poorer execution.

The other important player in this process is the potential buyer. Buying early stage startups requires
absorptive capacity—the ability to evaluate the technology and the ability to develop the nascent
technology and to use it (Cohen and Levinthal, 1989). Buyers may have to be structured differently to
absorb nascent startups, compared to later-stage startups with more mature organizations and technology
(Arora et al., 2014). Naturally, startups wishing to sell at an early stage will do better when there are more
early stage buyers and vice versa.

In our model, a crucial determinant of the market outcome is whether startups have to make a strategic
choice between going early versus late. Flexibility inevitably will result in greater information leakage
and loss of control over the invention (e.g. Gans et al. 2016). If such information leakages destroy value,
the startup must choose between selling early, or remaining in stealth mode till it is more mature.8

6
  Arora et al. (2016) show that nearly 50% of US manufacturing firms that introduced an innovative
product between 2007 and 2009 obtained the invention externally, and that startups were
disproportionately important as sources of invention.
7
  Åstebro and Serrano (2015) also document the importance of access to complementary assets. If a
startup partners with an incumbent firm with complementary assets, they find that the probability of
commercialization doubles, and that expected revenues increase by 29%, at the sample mean.
8
  Gans et al. (2016) argue that entrepreneurship implies choosing between alternatives, and that, once the
choice is made, some options will be extinguished. Indeed, many venture capitalists advise startups to


                                                       3
Startups also may have to commit to exiting late if they are required to make large sunk investments that
are valuable only to later acquirers.9 However, if a startup that enters the early market has the option to
reject all early offers and wait for the late market, its exit timing is a tactical choice. The outcomes in
these two cases differ in important ways.

We start by assuming that a startup has no flexibility, and has to choose between going early or late. We
find that the number of buyers that invest in absorptive capacity, and the probability of the startup selling
early are positively related. As expected, we show that early deals increase as the cost of absorptive
capacity relative to the number of startups shrinks, and when there are fewer late stage buyers.

We also find some less expected results. When startups have to commit, they tend to sell too late relative
to the decision that would maximize value creation. The intuition for this finding is that the gap between
value creation (social) and value capture (private) is larger when the number of buyers is small. Since the
late market has more potential buyers than the early market because absorptive capacity requires
investment, startups exit inefficiently late despite considerable execution risks. An important implication
of this result is that the availability of resources, such as venture capital, to enhance startups’ execution
paradoxically may exacerbate the situation by reducing early deals more than is desirable in terms of
value creation.

If we compare different types of innovation, we find that the relationship between the degree of
radicalness (which we model as startups with higher idiosyncratic uncertainty about their market value)
and the timing of startup sale is more complex than the literature would suggest. Greater uncertainty,
which is typically associated with more radical innovation, complicates negotiation over the terms of the
deal (Jeong and Lee, 2015), increases the risk of misappropriation (Luo, 2014) and biases valuation of the
invention (Allain et al., 2016). Thus, deals may be delayed to allow for the resolution of uncertainty.10 In
our model, there are neither cognitive biases nor agency problems. Instead, in a context of radical
innovation, startups prefer to delay the deal because the marginal increase in the value created will be
greater with more buyers. However, buyers have greater incentives to invest in absorptive capacity, which



avoid investing in capabilities that are not valuable to acquirers such as, for instance, marketing and
regulatory affairs. A late acquisition, on the other hand, can be treated by the buyer as a “stand alone”
business needing little or no integration.
9
  Early vs. late becomes a strategic choice also if a significant amount of external finance is required. In
this case, the startup has to decide whether to raise the money or not. By not raising the money, the
startup de facto commits to going early. Conversely, if the startup does raise the money but sells early, the
time and effort spent on raising money is of little value to the buyer.
10
   To the extent that the timing of an IPO can be equated to the timing of the startup’s sale, Ferreira et al.
(2014) show that firms engaged in more exploratory innovation, find it optimal to delay their IPO
decision.


                                                       4
makes the early market more attractive for startups. The second effect dominates if the cost of absorptive
capacity relative to the number of startups is small, and if there are fewer late stage buyers. In this case,
radical inventions are likely to be acquired early rather than late.

We next analyze the opposite case where startups observe the offers from early buyers, and decide
whether to sell early or to wait for the late market. Somewhat counter-intuitively, this results in startups
accepting too many early offers relative to what would maximize value creation, while too many
incumbents invest in absorptive capacity which compounds the problem. The intuition is that the seller
and the highest bidding buyer enter into an early deal only if it yields a higher value than the one they
expect to capture in the late market. However, they consider only their own payoffs in the late market, not
the payoffs of the other potential buyers. Venture capital, in this case, plays a positive role by reducing
the number of inefficiently early deals, thereby shrinking the efficiency gap between value creation and
value capture.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the contribution of our paper vis-à-vis existing
work. Section 3 describes the baseline model, and Section 4 presents our main findings. Section 5
discusses some extensions to this analysis, and Section 6 summarizes our results and concludes. Omitted
proofs of the formal propositions are provided in the Appendix.

    2. Background literature

Our paper contributes to the literature on markets for technology (Arora et al., 2001; Gans and Stern,
2003) and on high-tech entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial exit strategies (Baumol, 2010; Wennberg et
al., 2010). Compared to existing work on markets for technology, our paper offers three novel elements.
First, we analyze the timing of technology transactions, an important but understudied aspect of the
division of innovative labor. Second, we build a parsimonious model of the equilibrium between early
buyers and sellers. The two sides of technology markets have been studied mostly in isolation (Arora and
Gambardella, 2010; Gans and Stern, 2010; Laursen et al., 2010). In our model, sellers face a tradeoff
between the likelihood of execution failure and better future matches, and buyers choose whether to
invest in absorptive capacity so they can also participate in the early market. Analyzing demand and
supply together provides insights and conclusions not possible with extant approaches. Finally, we
investigate how the market outcomes differ from the value maximizing outcomes.

Our analysis can be interpreted as reflecting the sale of an innovation. Only a handful of papers explicitly
study the timing of technology transactions. Luo (2014) develops a model where early sales (of ideas)
face greater information asymmetry and enjoy weaker intellectual property rights (IPR) protection since
final products are better protected than mere ideas. She finds that both the best and the worst ideas are



                                                       5
sold later, but for two different reasons. The seller captures a larger share in the late market where
expropriation risk is muted, and therefore, prefers to wait if the idea is high-quality. Lower quality ideas
cannot be sold in the early market because the buyer prefers to delay its development investment until
more information about the true value of the idea is revealed. Our model does not rely on asymmetric
information between sellers and buyers, and takes a market rather than a transaction cost perspective. In
particular, we model the decisions of both buyers and sellers to enter the early market.

Ransbotham and Mitra (2010) assume that as time passes, more information is revealed to the market
about the true value of the technology. For the seller of the technology, waiting for a late deal generates a
tradeoff between increased integration problems with the buyer’s established routines and resources
which reduce the price, and reduced uncertainty which leads to a higher price because buyers compete
more aggressively over targets. Our model captures a different tradeoff for startups: the possibility of a
better match in the late market versus a greater likelihood of failure to reach a later stage. Furthermore,
unlike Ransbotham and Mitra (2010), we derive the subgame perfect equilibrium of a model where both
buyers and sellers decide whether to be active in the early market, and explore the efficiency properties of
the market outcome.

Allain et al. (2016) study the way that the decision about the timing of technology licensing in the
pharmaceutical industry depends on the number of buyers. They assume that sellers are overconfident
about the quality of their technology, and delay licensing in the hope that additional (positive) information
is revealed to the market. Delaying, however, is not costless from the point view of efficiency since the
buyer’s development costs are lower than those of the seller. Our paper suggests a different reason for
selling late: Sellers capture more value in the late market where more buyers are present. In our model the
number of early buyers and the likelihood of a startup selling early, are determined jointly in equilibrium,
and delaying the sale can be efficient due to better matching in the late market.

Nörback and Persson (2009) build a model where a startup is either acquired early by an incumbent, or
receives venture capitalist support and is sold late. Similar to Allain et al. (2016), they analyze
competition among downstream firms. Thus, while the acquirer of the startup experiences a profit
increase, other incumbents suffer a profit loss. The venture capitalist has a stronger incentive to develop
the innovation because the price of the startup in the late market reflects both the profit increment for the
acquiring firm and the reduction in the non-acquirers’ profits. On the other hand, incumbents have an
incentive to acquire the innovation early to preempt the over-investment in development. Nörback and
Persson (2009) show that startups are sold in the late market only if venture capitalists have cost
advantages relative to incumbent firms or if the development of the startup’s idea is associated with
double moral hazard problems. While their objective – of understanding how venture capital backing



                                                       6
changes the incentives to innovate – differs from ours, we reach similar conclusions about how venture
capital postpones the timing of startup sales.

Two other papers consider the timing of technology licensing and study how it depends on the features of
the patent system. Gans et al. (2008) argue that licensing deals occur earlier if patent rights are more
clearly defined, and they show empirically that there is an increase in the probability to license around the
patent-grant date. Along similar lines, Hegde and Luo (2016) argue that mechanisms that make
information about technology public, reduce the time-to-license of patented technology. They develop a
model showing that when firms are forced to publish their patented applications, licensing is more likely
even if the patent has yet to be granted. Taken together, these two papers show that if patent rights are
better defined and there is more information available about the technology, technology transactions
occur at an earlier stage.

To sum up, with the exception of Nörback and Persson (2009), in all of the abovementioned papers, the
presence of asymmetric information and the fact that uncertainty tends to dissipate with time create
incentives for startups to exit late. However, our paper assumes that information is symmetric and
uncertainty persists. We introduce absorptive capacity as a (plausible) barrier to entry for buyers in the
early market, and show that this generates a tradeoff for sellers between greater value creation and capture
in the late market and lower execution risk in the early market. A novel feature of our analysis is that it
highlights the importance of flexibility for the efficiency of the market for startups.

We should stress that our aim is not to dismiss the importance of asymmetric information and uncertainty
in technology transactions but rather to offer a complementary set of reasons for the timing of the startup
sale. Also, we ignore the potential agency conflict between entrepreneurs and investors and the varying
motives of entrepreneurs, two issues which have been the focus of the finance and entrepreneurship
literatures (e.g. Cumming and Mackintosh, 2003; Bayar and Chemmanur, 2011; Graebner et al., 2010).




3. Baseline model

We assume that the startup sale can occur at two points in time: early when the technology is nascent and
needs further development (for instance, the startup has only a patent or a prototype), and late when the
technology is already developed (for instance, the startup has a functioning technology or a product).11


11
   Technology transactions can take different forms. In some cases, arm’s length contracts are enough to
transfer both nascent and developed technologies. In other cases, technology is transferred through
corporate acquisitions. In our model, a startup holds only one technology, and there is no difference
between acquiring the technology through an exclusive licensing contract, or acquiring the firm.


                                                       7
The key characteristics of early deals are: a) only buyers who have the absorptive capacity to evaluate and
use the nascent technology participate; b) early acquisitions permit greater efficiency in scale-up.

We now describe each side of the market, and the decisions companies can make.

Buyers or incumbent firms

We assume that there is an exogenous number, n, of incumbent firms (buyers) that have no limit on the
number startups they can acquire. This implies that buyers are not capacity constrained, and that the
technologies they can acquire are not substitutes.

Buyers are always active in the late market where they acquire developed technologies, or more mature
ventures. However, to participate in the early market, buyers need “absorptive capacity”, i.e. the ability to
understand, assimilate, develop and integrate nascent technology (Cohen and Levinthal, 1989).
Absorptive capacity is the outcome of investments in basic research and scientific capabilities
(Rosenberg, 1990) which we model as a fixed cost, T.12 We use m to denote the number of buyers active
in the early market. Buyers that have invested in absorptive capacity can acquire startups in both the early
and the late markets. For simplicity, we assume that a startup acquired by an incumbent buyer is always
successful. This assumption can be relaxed by allowing the probability of failure to be a constant fraction
of the probability of failure if the startup was not acquired early.

Sellers or startup firms

We normalize the total number of startups to 1. Endogenous entry by startups in discussed in session 5.6.
Startups can either sell in the early market (i.e. “go early”) or “wait” for a late deal. If they sell in the
early market, potential buyers will be firms that have invested in basic research, and therefore, are able to
integrate and develop nascent technology. If the startup waits, buyers will compete for its technology in
the late market.

Startup j has a success probability j of transitioning from the early to the late market which, abusing
notation, we refer to simply as . Thus, 1- is a measure of the startup’s execution disadvantage relative
to an incumbent. Startups are heterogeneous in their ability to make the transition from a nascent to a
developed technology, i.e. they differ in their execution (recruiting, manufacturing, sales, marketing)
capability, which we assume independent of the quality of the underlying technology.




12
  Investing in basic research and scientific capability allows the generation of invention internally. Given
our assumptions of the unlimited capacity of buyers and non-substitute technologies, the benefits from
internally developed technologies can be modeled as a reduction in T.


                                                        8
All startups draw a success probability from the same distribution function Q(.), and their draws are
public knowledge. For tractability, Q(.) is assumed to be the uniform distribution over [b, 1], where 1 > b
 0.

Exit strategy

Entrepreneurs exit through their acquisition by an incumbent firm. We analyze two polar cases. In one,
startups have to commit to going either early or late. If the startup goes early but is not acquired, it must
exit the market. For a startup, finding an early buyer can divert the focus from developing the business.
Entrepreneurs have many demands on their time: The technology has to be developed, engineers and team
members recruited, and customers wooed. Looking for potential acquirers during this early phase of the
startup lifecycle can be a distraction. Moreover, some of the investments made to develop the business
may not be of value to early acquirers. These costs are likely to depend upon the industry and the
technology, and other features of the environment. An alternative explanation for the need for
commitment is weak protection of early stage ideas (Luo, 2014). Interaction with potential buyers may
result in information leakages that undermine the value of the startup in the late market. The other case is
where the startup can costlessly obtain offers from all the early buyers, and then can decide whether to
accept one, or to reject all and continue to develop the business and opt for the late market.13

The value of a startup

Consider the case where startups have to commit to selling in either the early or the late market (the case
without commitment is analyzed in section 4.2). In the late market, a startup’s value to buyer i is w+i
where w is a common component, and vi is an idiosyncratic component. In the early market, buyers bid
anticipating the value of the startup’s technology once fully developed. Since we ignore discounting, the
value to buyer i in the early market is also w+i. Again, abusing notation, we drop the subindex
henceforth. The common component represents the part of the value of the technology on which all
buyers agree and which is known by all buyers, an assumption that we relax in section 5.2. The
idiosyncratic component is buyer-specific. It represents heterogeneity in the value of the technology, and
the specific fit with the buyer’s existing products and capabilities. For instance, buyers might be
heterogeneous in terms of geographic markets, distribution channels, potential for cannibalization of
existing products, breadth of application of the innovation, etc. All buyers draw the idiosyncratic
component from a distribution function H(.). For tractability, we sometimes assume that H(.) is uniform




13
  Participating in an IPO or remaining independent are alternative startup exit routes. In the context of
our model, these alternatives can be considered an outside option for startups selling in the late market.

on [-a, +a], so that vi is mean zero, and its variance increases with a. As we explain below, the variance
of the idiosyncratic component can be related to the degree of radicalness or novelty of the technology.

Early and late markets

We model the functioning of the technology market as a sealed-bid second price auction (or Vickrey
auction) where bidders (or buyers) submit bids without knowing those of the other bidders. The buyer
submitting the highest bid ultimately acquires the startup paying the second-highest bid. Auctions provide
a convenient micro-foundation for modeling price formation in startup sales (see, for instance,
Ransbotham and Mitra, 2010; Nörback and Persson, 2009; Allain et al., 2016). We use a sealed-bid
second price auction because it mimics a bidding competition among buyers for a target startup in which
all potential buyers drop out except the final acquirer, a situation common in technology-based industries.
However, our results do not rely on this specific modeling choice. They would hold in any situation in
which the startup is assigned to the buyer with the highest valuation (in the given market) and the seller’s
share of the surplus is increasing in the number of buyers.

Timing

We assume that actions and decisions follow a four-stage game (see table 1). In stage I, incumbents
decide whether to invest in absorptive capacity to allow them to be active in the early market. In stage II,
startups discover their type, , and in the commitment case, choose between the early and late markets. If
startups are flexible, they do not have to make this choice before they observe all the early offers. In stage
III, startups in the early market receive bids from those m buyers that have invested in absorptive
capacity. Profits are realized for those startups that have committed to going early, while in the flexible
case, profits are realized if a bid is accepted by the startup. In stage IV, the startups that chose the late
market and survived, receive bids from all n buyers, and profits are realized.

4.      Solving the model

It is useful to introduce some additional notation and results from the theory of order statistics. Buyer i’s
valuation of startup j has the form w + v, and all z buyers draw the idiosyncratic component from the
distribution H(.). Let x(k, z) represent the kth highest out of z idiosyncratic components. Then, x(1, z)
represents the highest idiosyncratic component, and x(2, z) the second highest. Denote by X(k, z) the
expectation of x(k, z).

Lemma 1. The cumulative distribution functions of the idiosyncratic component of the highest and the
second highest valuation with z buyers are respectively:
F(x, z) = H(x)z and
G(x, z) = z H(x)z-1 - (z – 1) H(x)z.

Proof: Application of Theorem 5.3.1 in Arnold et al. (1992: 111).

      4.1. Case 1: Exit timing is a strategic choice (commitment)

In a sealed-bid second price auction, the dominant strategy for a buyer is to bid up to the true valuation;
see, e.g. Dutta (1999). Hence, the expected price is equal to the expected value of the second-highest
valuation. Because there are no transaction costs, this corresponds also to the seller’s expected profit.

A buyer wins the auction if it draws the highest idiosyncratic component. Due to symmetry, this happens
with probability 1/z. It pays a price equal to the second highest bid, yielding a profit of x(1, z) - x(2, z).
Thus, using the above notation, buyer’s and seller’s expected profits are:
                       1
            𝜋𝐵𝐸 (𝑚) = 𝑚 [𝑋(1, 𝑚) − 𝑋(2, 𝑚)] 𝜋𝑆𝐸 (𝑚) = 𝑤 + 𝑋(2, 𝑚)
                        1                                                                          (1)
             𝜋𝐵𝐿 (𝑛) = [𝑋(1, 𝑛) − 𝑋(2, 𝑛)]          𝜋𝑆𝐸 (𝑛) = 𝑤 + 𝑋(2, 𝑛)
                        𝑛

where E denotes the early market, L the late market, S the seller (startup) and B the buyer (incumbent). In
this case, startups have to commit to an exit strategy. Since the exit choice is made before observing the
potential bids in the early market, it is based on the expected profits in the two markets (stage III and
stage IV of the game). Consider startup j. Denote the threshold value of 𝜃 such that the startup is
indifferent between selling early and late by 𝜃̃. Then, 𝜃̃ is characterized by:

                                    𝜋𝑆𝐸 (𝑚) = 𝜃̃ 𝜋𝑆𝐿 (𝑛).                                                (2)

In stage II, startup j decides to sell early if 𝜃 ≤ 𝜃̃ and late if 𝜃 > 𝜃̃.

Notice that the expected profit of the startup is increasing in the number of buyers, in both the early and
the late markets. Thus, while an early acquisition increases value because of reduced execution errors, it
might lead to a lower price for the startup because of the smaller number of potential buyers in the early
market. (Indeed, if m > n, all startups would choose to sell in the early market and 𝜃̃ = 1.)

We can now consider stage I of the game and look at buyers’ investment decisions in absorptive capacity.
Notice that, because we have assumed unlimited acquisition capacity, all buyers are active in the late
market. The decision to enter the early market is independent of the profit that a buyer makes in the late
market. The expected number of startups sold early is sE = 𝑄(̃ ). Buyers enter the early market until the
expected profit from entry is equal to the cost of absorptive capacity. Ignoring integer constraints, the
number of incumbents m investing in absorptive capacity and participating in the early market is given
by:

                                                  𝑄(̃ )𝜋𝐵𝐸 (𝑚) = 𝑇.                                             (3)

Assuming that  and v are uniformly distributed, we can rewrite equations (2) and (3). The indifferent
type ̃ as a function of m* is given by:


                                                            12

The number of early buyers m* as a function of ̃ is:

Figure 2 provides a graphical representation of the equilibrium in θ and m.14 We assume in what follows
that the parameters of the model are such that there are equilibria with an active early market, and we
focus here on the stable equilibrium. It should be noted that an equilibrium with no early market always
exists. If a buyer expects other buyers not to invest in absorptive capacity, it has no incentive to invest
itself because two or more competing buyers are needed to attract startups to the early market.

Most of these comparative statics are straightforward. A reduction in the cost of investment in absorptive
capacity makes entry in the early market cheaper for incumbents, and thus, makes going early more
attractive for the startups. A larger number of incumbents makes the late market more attractive for
startups since they might expect to capture more value by selling in a thicker market. Thus, entry
downstream (i.e. an increase in n) is associated with lower investment in absorptive capacity. By contrast,
consolidation leads to more investment in absorptive capacity, and more early deals. A larger common
component makes the expected profit of the startup less sensitive to the number of buyers, and thus, tilts
its choice toward the early market, which avoids execution errors. The comparative statics with respect to
the idiosyncratic component which proxies for the degree of radicalness of the invention, is less
straightforward, and is analyzed in subsection 5.1. We can summarize this discussion in the following
proposition:

Proposition 1: The number of incumbents investing in absorptive capacity, and the number of startups
sold in the early market, increase if the cost of investment in absorptive capacity declines, the total
number of buyers declines, execution failure increases and the invention has a larger common value.

Proof: By noticing that both curves in Figure 1 are positively sloped and that each of these changes either
affects only one curve or affects both curves in the same direction. 

An interesting result is the changes in execution failure. As we discuss below, greater availability of
venture capital leads to a reduction in execution failure, or equivalently, to an increase in the probability



                                                      14
of reaching the late stage. Therefore, we can model the availability of venture capital by an increase in b
(see, for instance, Nörback and Persson, 2009). Greater availability of venture capital has the direct effect
of thinning the early market (more startups choose to go late). In response, fewer prospective buyers
invest in absorptive capacity, further reducing the proportion of early sales. More generally, any policy
that favors startup survival to the later stage can be reinterpreted as an increase in b.15

     4.1.1.   Value creation vs. value capture
In this section, we study whether startups go too early or too late in relation to value creation, and whether
too few or too many incumbents invest in absorptive capacity. We start by examining startups and what
division between early and late markets would lead to the highest level of value creation. This requires
comparing expected value creation in the early and late markets. It is straightforward to show that value
creation is highest if startups with 𝜃 ≤ 𝜃̂ go early, and startups with 𝜃 > 𝜃̂ go late, where:
                                                      𝑤+𝑋(1,𝑚)
                                                 𝜃̂ = 𝑤+𝑋(1,𝑛)                                                  (4)

Startups care about value capture, and thus, the price they can secure in the early and late markets which
would correspond to the second highest valuation, rather than about total value creation. The following
lemma is useful.

Lemma 4. Let 𝐻(𝑣)~𝑈(−𝑎, +𝑎). The ratio between value creation (highest valuation) and value capture
                                                                       𝑤+𝑋(1,𝑧)
                                                                   𝜕
                                                                       𝑤+𝑋(2,𝑧)
(second highest valuation) shrinks with the number of buyers,                     < 0.
                                                                         𝜕𝑧


Lemma 4 implies that in thicker markets for startups not only is value creation greater because of a better
matching but also the seller captures a larger share of the value created. We can now derive the key
proposition of this section that when startups are forced to make strategic choices between going early
versus going late, they systematically go too late.

Proposition 2:
(i) The equilibrium number of early buyers maximizes value creation conditional on the expected number
of startups in the early market.
                                                                                                        ̂, is

  Alternatively, startup location in a cluster might increase survival chances, thus corresponding to a
larger b. Indeed, Delgado et al. (2016) show that companies located in clusters tend to be more resilient to
downturns. Provided they have a valuable business proposition, startups located in a cluster have easier
access to complementary resources which reduces startup mortality in the transition from invention to
innovation.


                                                        15
(iii) Since there are too few startups selling early (relative to the value maximization level), the number of
buyers that invest in absorptive capacity also is less than the number that maximizes value creation.
Proof: From Lemma 1, F(x, z) = H(x)z is the distribution function for the highest value of the
idiosyncratic component from z bidders, and f(x, z) is the corresponding density function. A buyer’s profit
from entry into the early market is:
                                       𝑎     𝑣
                            𝑄(𝜃̃ ) ∫ (∫ 𝑓(𝑥, 𝑚 − 1)(𝑣 − 𝑥)𝑑𝑥 ) ℎ(𝑣)𝑑𝑣 − 𝑇
                                   −𝑎       −𝑎

The additional value created by an additional buyer is:
                                    𝑎        `𝑣
                            𝑄(𝜃̂) ∫ (∫ 𝑓(𝑥, 𝑚 − 1)(𝑣 − 𝑥)𝑑𝑥 ) ℎ(𝑣)𝑑𝑣 − 𝑇

Hence, if 𝑄(𝜃̃ ) = 𝑄(𝜃̂), the equilibrium number of buyers in the early market maximizes value creation.
This proves part (i) of the proposition. If 𝑄(𝜃̃ ) < 𝑄(𝜃̂), there are too few early buyers from the point of
view of value creation. Next, we show that too few startups go early for a given number of early buyers, m.
Notice that:
                            ̃ ⇔ 𝒘+𝑿(𝟏,𝒎) > 𝒘+𝑿(𝟐,𝒎) ⇔ 𝒘+𝑿(𝟐,𝒏) > 𝒘+𝑿(𝟐,𝒎).

Using lemma 4, this holds because n > m. Hence, we obtain 𝑄(𝜃̃ ) < 𝑄(𝜃̂) from which it follows
immediately that in equilibrium there are too few early deals and too few early buyers. 



Intuitively, the difference between value creation and value capture shrinks with the number of buyers.16
A startup compares value capture in the early and the late markets. If value capture were a constant
fraction of value creation, the startup’s decision would always coincide with the allocation that maximizes
value creation. However, the share of the value captured by the seller is increasing in the number of
potential buyers. Thus, startups inefficiently go too late because in the thin early market they capture a
smaller fraction of the total value creation than in the thicker late market.

Below we analyze the conditions under which the difference between value creation allocations and value
                                                                                       ̂ and 𝜽
capture allocations is larger or smaller. We call the efficiency gap the ratio between 𝜽     ̃ , that is:
                                                                   𝑤+𝑋(1,𝑚)
                                                             ̂
                                                             𝜃     𝑤+𝑋(1,𝑛)
                                           Efficiency gap = 𝜃̃ =   𝑤+𝑋(2,𝑚)   .                              (5)
                                                                   𝑤+𝑋(2,𝑛)




Proposition 3. The efficiency gap declines with m, and increases with n.


16
  This result holds also for a variety of other distributions including the Generalized Extreme Value
distribution and exponential.


                                                        16
This proposition is interesting and helps identify a number of factors that might exacerbate the efficiency
gap. Obviously, m is endogenously determined by the incumbents’ entry condition in the early market.
However, because m* is conditionally efficient we can study the effects of all exogenous parameters that
affect m* only through equation (2). Consider an increase in T, the cost of developing absorptive capacity
for early acquisitions. Because a higher T leads to a smaller m*, i.e. in a thin early market, the tendency
for startups to go too late is reinforced. This suggests that if the cost of performing basic research which
typically is associated with absorptive capacity (Rosenberg, 1990; Arora and Gambardella, 1994)
increases, not only do we have fewer early acquisitions but this also reduces the efficiency of the market
for startups. We normalized the number of startups to 1 but we observe a similar effect if the number of
startups declines. Thus, policies that stimulate the creation of startups through training or access to
mentoring and expertise for instance, have the effect of increasing the number of active buyers in the
early market, and thus of increasing value creation per startup.

Because m* depends, among other things, on the distribution of θ, any shift in this distribution might
increase or reduce the efficiency gap. Here, we focus on a factor that has received some attention in the
innovation literature: the availability of venture capital. For a given supply of startups, we model an
increase in the supply of venture capital as a shift in the distribution of  to the right (first order stochastic
dominance). This is consistent with the notion that venture capitalists help to develop the startup’s
organization, and reduce execution failure (Gompers and Lerner, 2001; Hsu, 2006). A shift in the
distribution (an increase in b) increases the share of startups that go late. In turn, this implies that m* falls
(see table 2). From Proposition 2 we can conclude that a greater availability of venture capital increases
the efficiency gap, i.e. startups go inefficiently late, and especially in a condition of abundant venture
capital. While venture capital has many benefits, a possible undesired effect of venture capital which our
model identifies is that if they have to commit between going early versus going late, venture capital can
cause excessive delays. This result contrasts with Hellmann and Veikko (2017) which shows that funding
policies which presumably help to increase startups’ survival chances, are effective for reducing
inefficiencies due to dynamic interlinkages between generations of entrepreneurs which allow successful
entrepreneurs to accumulate both expertise and wealth to support future generations of entrepreneurs.

Another potential interpretation of a first order stochastic shift in the distribution of  is related to the
geographical location of the startup. If startups located in a cluster have a higher chance of survival then
such startups may tend to go too late relative to maximizing value creation. Proposition 3 implies that this
effect is reinforced if there are more potential buyers. Clusters cause this because close geographical
proximity increases awareness of startup existence and technology which increases the number of
potential buyers. On the other hand, a greater concentration of startups could incentivize buyers to invest



                                                       17
in absorptive capacity, potentially offsetting the tendency for delay.


      4.2. Case 2: Exit timing is a tactical choice (flexibility)

Here, we consider the case where the technology is well-protected, and the investments made are valuable
to prospective buyers. Then, startups are flexible and can consider offers from buyers in the early market
while also investing to scale-up for the late market. In this case, we need to examine when the startup is
willing to accept a given bid in the early market rather than waiting to receive bids in the late market, and
how the bidding strategies of buyers change in response. We assume that buyers active in both markets
draw each time from the same distribution of idiosyncratic valuations which thus, are independent across
markets. In section 5.5., we discuss the case of valuations that are the same across the two markets. Our
qualitative findings do not change but the algebra is more cumbersome.

After observing its , the startup will foresee that the expected profit in the late market is (𝑤 + 𝑋(2, 𝑛)),
and thus will accept any offer that is greater than the offers in the early market. We capture this by
assuming that there is a reserve price 𝑅 ∗ () = (𝑤 + 𝑋(2, 𝑛)) in the second-price auction.17 This implies
that the winning buyer pays 𝑀𝑎𝑥{𝑤 + 𝑥(2, 𝑚), 𝑅 ∗ ()}, where 𝑥(2, 𝑚) is the second highest valuation
among all the early buyers.

Buyers too take into account that they can buy in the late market if the startup is not sold in the early
market, and this possibility modifies their bidding strategies. Lemma 5 characterizes the equilibrium
bidding strategy of an early buyer.

Lemma 5. Define 𝑣 ∗ () = 𝑀𝑎𝑥{ (𝜋𝐵𝐿 (𝑛) + 𝑤 + 𝑋(2, 𝑛)) − 𝑤, −𝑎}. Then, there exists a symmetric

equilibrium in the early market where the bidding strategy of a buyer with idiosyncratic valuation v is
given by:
i)        Bid its true valuation (𝑤 + 𝑣) if 𝑣 ≥ 𝑣 ∗ ();
ii)       Do not bid if 𝑣 < 𝑣 ∗ ().

Here, we provide the intuition for the case where 𝑣 ∗ () =  (𝜋𝐵𝐿 (𝑛) + 𝑤 + 𝑋(2, 𝑛)) − 𝑤. A buyer with a

valuation equal to 𝑤 + 𝑣 ∗ () is indifferent between bidding and not bidding. The buyer can only make
strictly positive profits if all other buyers have lower valuations. However, in this case, bidding 𝑤 +
𝑣 ∗ (), and paying the reserve price, or not bidding, and competing for the startup in the late market, yield

17
  This is a credible reserve price. In principle, startups could do even better by setting an optimal reserve
price. However, any reserve price above 𝑅 ∗ () requires commitment on the seller’s part: If the highest
offer were below the optimal reserve price but above 𝑅 ∗ (), it would be ex-post optimal to accept it.
Since startups do not transact repeatedly with buyers, commitment is not plausible.


                                                       18
the same expected profit equal to 𝜋𝐵𝐿 (𝑛). Consider now a buyer with a valuation greater than 𝑤 + 𝑣 ∗ ().
Two situations can arise: There are either competing buyers or not. If there are competing buyers, it is
optimal to bid the true valuation in a second-price auction. If there are no competing buyers, it is also
optimal to bid the true valuation and pay the reserve price, the lowest price at which the startup can be
acquired.

A buyer’s expected profit from its participation in the early market when bidding for a start-up of type 
is denoted ∆𝜋𝐵𝐸 () and is given by:

             a                                                           𝑣
∆𝜋𝐵𝐸 () = ∫𝑣 ∗ () (𝐹(𝑣
                     ⏟ (), 𝑚 − 1) (𝑤 + 𝑣 − 𝑅 () − 𝜋𝐵 (𝑛)) + ∫
                         ∗                   ∗        𝐿
                                                                        𝑓(𝑥, 𝑚 − 1)(𝑣 − 𝑥) 𝑑𝑥) ℎ(𝑣)𝑑𝑣 (6)
                                                               ⏟𝑣 ∗ ()
                          The highest valuation among the                The highest valuation among the
                     competing buyers is less than or equal to 𝑣 ∗ ()   competing buyers is above 𝑣 ∗ ()




A buyer acquires the startup and earns a strictly positive profit from its participation in the early market if
(i) it has the highest valuation among the early buyers, and (ii) its valuation exceeds 𝑣 ∗ ().18 Integrating
by parts, ∆𝜋𝐵𝐸 () can be written as:

                                           𝑎         𝑣
                            ∆𝜋𝐵𝐸 () = ∫𝑣 ∗ (𝜃) (∫𝑣 ∗ (𝜃) 𝐹(𝑥, 𝑚 − 1) 𝑑𝑥) ℎ(𝑣)𝑑𝑣.                                  (6)

It follows immediately that ∆𝜋𝐵𝐸 () is decreasing in m as 𝐹(𝑥, 𝑚 − 1) decreases in m. Integrating over the
startups’ set of types, the equilibrium number of buyers in the early market is given by the zero profit
condition:
                                   1
                                  ∫𝑏 ∆𝜋𝐵𝐸 () 𝑞()𝑑 − 𝑇 = 0                                                 (7)

Suppose that the cost of absorptive capacity T is sufficiently low as to ensure a viable early market. Then,
since ∆𝜋𝐵𝐸 () is decreasing in m, there exists a unique number of buyers m* which solves equation (7).

Proposition 4. When exit timing is a tactical choice, startups tend to sell inefficiently early, and the
number of buyers that invest in absorptive capacity is also greater than the number that maximizes value
creation.

While the formal proof is included in the Appendix, we provide the intuitive arguments underlying this
proposition. From the standpoint of value creation, a startup should be traded in the early market if and
only if the highest realized valuation 𝑤 + 𝑥(1, 𝑚) is greater than or equal to the expected value if the


18
  If there is only one early buyer with a valuation above 𝑣 ∗ (), its profit from participation in the early
market is the profit earned in the early market, 𝑤 + 𝑣 − 𝑅 ∗ (), minus the expected profit that it would
have earned had it not been in the early market, 𝜋𝐵𝐿 (𝑛).


                                                           19
startup continues to the late market, (𝑤 + 𝑋(1, 𝑛)). However, Lemma 5 implies that the transaction
takes place in the early market if and only if the highest valuation is greater than 𝑤 + 𝑣 ∗ (). Since
(𝑤 + 𝑋(1, 𝑛)) > 𝑤 + 𝑣 ∗ (), it follows that too many deals take place in the early market for a given
number of early buyers. This in turn, attracts too many buyers to the early market.

Intuitively, there is too much early trade because the trading parties consider only their own payoffs when
evaluating an early deal. By setting a reserve price, the seller ensures for itself at least the expected profit
in the late market, and the buyer bids only if the profit from winning the auction is greater than the
expected profit in the late market. The outcome is that the buyer with the highest valuation trades with the
seller if and only if their joint profit is greater than the expected joint profit in the late market. Therefore,
they ignore the expected profits that accrue to other buyers if the startup were to continue to the late
market, i.e. early deals generate a negative externality on the expected profits of other potential late
buyers that is not accounted for. From the point of view of value creation, there are thus too many early
deals.

Corollary 1. The number of early deals and the number of buyers investing in absorptive capacity are
value maximizing when n  .

As the number of late buyers becomes very large, the profit in the late market goes to zero. Therefore, the
negative externality that an early buyer’s acquisition of a startup imposes on the potential late buyers
disappears, and the market outcome is efficient.
    4.3. Discussion

Taken together, Propositions 2 and 4 show that flexibility is pivotal to the efficiency properties of the
market for startups: If startups have to commit to an exit strategy, early markets are too thin. In contrast, if
startups can enter the early market, collect offers, and then decide on the timing, early markets are too
thick. To our knowledge, this is a novel result, and has some important implications for policy,
exemplified by the opposing effects of venture capital.

The intuition behind this important finding is twofold. In the case of commitment, startups tend to sell too
late because the late market offers better value capture. In the case of flexibility, the option of selling late
increases the value that the startup can capture in the early market. This reduces the incentive for the
startup to wait, and there is early trade if buyer and seller have higher payoffs than in the late market.
Since the expected payoffs of other potential buyers in the late market are not considered, there is too
much early trade from the point of view of value creation.

    5. Extensions

    5.1. Degree of radicalness
Radical inventions have more unpredictable outcomes since the path to a marketable product is longer, is
characterized by various hazards and typically requires the orchestration of different complementary
resources. Radical inventions are both more likely to fail and more likely to lead to a blockbuster
innovation.

A natural way to model the degree of radicalness, as in Ransbotham and Mitra (2010), is through a which
parameterizes the variance of the idiosyncratic component. To preview our most interesting finding (see
below), consider that the conventional wisdom among innovation scholars is that more radical inventions
are sold later. Greater uncertainty which typically is associated to more radical inventions, complicates
the negotiations around the terms of the deal (Jeong and Lee, 2015), and increases the risk of
misappropriation (Luo, 2014) and the chances of biases in assessments of the value of the invention
(Allain et al., 2016). As a result, both sellers and buyers might find it profitable to wait for additional
information. Put differently, radical innovations are more uncertain and deals are delayed in order till the
uncertainty is sufficiently resolved.

Our model highlights a more complex relationship between the degree of radicalness and the timing of the
technology sale. Under certain conditions, we show that greater radicalness makes early deals more, not
less, likely. Specifically, an increase in radicalness has two effects that push in opposing directions. One
effect is through the greater importance of the matching between buyer and seller which pushes startups
to the late market which, in turn, has more potential buyers. The following proposition demonstrates this
result formally.

Proposition 5. Let 𝑯(𝒗)~𝑼(−𝒂, +𝒂). The number of early deals decreases for a given m, in both the
flexible and the commitment cases.
While this first effect conforms to the conventional wisdom, it should be noted this is a different
mechanism from the ones previously identified. For instance, we do not assume that uncertainty is
resolved with time (i.e. a declines while w increases), that uncertainty causes adverse selection problems,
or that sellers or buyers have cognitive biases. Instead, the result is driven by value creation: As a
increases, value creation increases more in the late than in the early market.

In addition, there is a second effect. The second effect arises because an increase in radicalness makes an
early deal more profitable for buyers since it reduces the competition by increasing the degree of
heterogeneity in valuations. This effect tends to increase m*, making the early market more attractive for




                                                       21
startups. It is interesting that these two effects are general, and do not depend on any distributional
assumptions.

Obviously, to investigate under what conditions one effect dominates the other, requires reliance on
distributional assumptions. Also, the answer will depend on the model parameters. For example, if the
number of buyers in the early market, m*, is relatively close to the total number of buyers, n, a change in
radicalness has a very limited effect on startups’ decisions. Thus, the comparative statics are driven by the
effect on the expected profit of the buyers in the early market. Because n and m* are close when n is
relatively small and T tends to zero, under these conditions, an increase in radicalness brings about more
early deals. Thus, by considering both demand and supply in the market for startups, we find that greater
radicalness can lead to more and not fewer startups acquired early, and more incumbents investing in
absorptive capacity.

We also consider a variant of the model in which the startups in an industry are heterogeneous with
respect to the radicalness of their technology. We assume that startup j draws both a success probability j
and a technology radicalness aj, and the timing of the sale depends on both these parameters. In this
model, it is possible to compare the decisions of startups with more and less radical technologies for a
given number of buyers in the early and late markets. Here, only the first effect is present, and startups
with more radical technologies sell later which is consistent with the conventional wisdom outlined
above.

    5.2. Uncertainty about the common value component

In the main analysis, we assumed perfect information about the common value component w. However, it
is plausible that the invention has a common value component that is not perfectly observable in the early
market. Instead, buyers might receive different and imperfect signals about the common value component
(e.g. Ransbotham and Mitra; 2010). In such a setup, the problem of the “winner’s curse” arises. The buyer
that draws the highest valuation and wins the auction knows that the other buyers are likely to have
received lower value signals related to the common component. Therefore, if the buyer had submitted a
bid equal to the value indicated by the signal received, it would be likely to pay more than the true value
of the startup. In response, buyers shade their bids in equilibrium. A natural assumption in our framework
is that more information about startups is available in the late market. Therefore, the issue of the winner’s
curse is less severe in the late market which results in higher bids and more value capture for startups in
that market. Hence, we could have the same trade-off between execution failure and value capture for a
constant number of buyers in the early and late markets. Put differently, introducing uncertainty about the
common value component reinforces the trade-offs in the baseline model.




                                                      22
    5.3. Competition among buyers

In the above analysis, buyers do not face competition in the downstream market, although they compete
with each other over acquiring startups. That is, a buyer’s valuation is independent of the number and
identities of other buyers. However, if several firms are active in the same market segment, the benefits
they derive from acquiring a technology are likely to depend on the intensity of the competition among
them. Below, we try to accommodate competition in the simplest possible way in order to understand
how it affects our results.

Following Allain et al. (2016), consider a product market with n buyers and one startup available for sale.
For simplicity, we focus on the case in which exit timing is a strategic choice (case 1). Before the
acquisition, buyers are symmetric and earn profits equal to t0(n), t0(n) > 0. If buyer i acquires the startup it
makes a profit t1(n) in the current market and profits vi in other unrelated markets. If another buyer
acquires the startup, buyer i’s profits are t-1(n), where t-1(n) < t0(n) < t1(n). This implies that buyer i’s
valuation of the startup is w(n) + vi, where w(n) = t1(n) - t-1(n). Using the comparative statics in table 2,
we know that a decline in w(n) increases the probability of a late deal, and thus, reduces the number of
buyers investing in absorptive capacity. If w(n) declines with n, as in several models of product market
rivalry, increasing competition among buyers makes a late sale more likely. Conversely, consolidation, as
occurred for example, in the pharmaceutical industry, increases the number of early sales.

    5.4. Startups can choose between commitment and flexibility

We analyzed two opposite cases for startups: 1) exit timing is a strategic choice that requires
commitment, 2) exit timing is a tactical choice and the startup remains flexible. We considered these two
cases as exogenously given to startups, possibly the outcome of industry characteristics. Here, we discuss
the case where startups can choose between commitment and flexibility, and explore under what
conditions one solution is preferred over the other.

Assume that startups can invest F to gain intellectual property (IP) protection for their invention. If they
do not invest in IP protection and are active in the early market, their invention becomes public
knowledge, and thus, becomes worthless to buyers in the late market. Alternatively, the startup could hide
the invention and solicit bids only in the late market. This is equivalent to exit timing being a strategic
choice. However, if they invest F they can be present in both markets without risk of expropriation. This
is equivalent to exit timing being a tactical choice. In other words, F is the price of flexibility.

Flexibility provides the startup with two advantages. First, the startup can collect more offers since it can
solicit bids in both the early and late markets. Second, flexibility allows the startup to establish a credible
reserve price and improve rent-extraction in the early market auction. Both of these advantages depend on



                                                       23
, i.e. the probability that the startup survives to the late market. For low values of , flexibility has
almost no value as the startup will probably not make it to the late market, and its reserve price tends to
zero. For  close to 1, the startup will only strike a deal in the early market if there is a very high bid, an
event with a low probability. Thus, flexibility has little value because the startup typically will ultimately
sell late. The (gross) payoff from flexibility is the largest for intermediate values of : Startups with a
high execution risk will sell early, and do not invest in IPR protection; startups with moderate execution
risk will invest in IP protection and will receive bids in both markets; finally, startups with low execution
risk will wait till the late market and will not invest in IPR protection.

    5.5. Buyers’ valuations are constant over time

In our analysis of the case where startups are flexible, we assumed that buyers draw independent
valuations of the startup in each market. This might be the case if there is a long period between the early
and late sales, and thus, the startup is a substantially different object. In other circumstances, it is more
reasonable to assume that a given buyer’s valuation of a given startup remains constant over time.
Intuitively, because buyers’ valuations are constant for the m buyers active in the early market, both early
buyers and startups use this information and the bids from the early auction to update their beliefs about
the outcome of the auction in the late market. As a result, the optimal strategies of buyers and sellers are
more complex.

Despite this greater complexity, the results are qualitatively similar. In equilibrium, startups are sold too
early because when striking a deal neither early buyers no startups take into account the expected profits
of late buyers. This is the same effect we observed in the previous analysis. Further, it can be proved that
there is excessive buyer entry in the early market. In short, while introducing constant buyers’ valuations
makes the algebra more complicated, the results remain qualitatively similar. Details are available in the
online appendix. In light of these findings, we speculate that in the more general case where late
valuations are correlated but are not identical, the early valuations will yield similar results.

    5.6. Endogenous entry by startups

So far, we have assumed that the supply of startups is fixed. However, the basic model could be extended
by allowing the number of startups to be determined endogenously by a free entry condition (i.e. startups
enter the industry as long as their expected profits are larger than their entry costs). In an earlier version of
the paper, we analyzed a model in which the marginal entry costs increased with the number of startups
that entered. This could reflect the scarcity of key resources needed to set up a technology company such
as specialized labor, managerial talent and seed capital. Within this framework, entry by startups and by
incumbents in the early market are mutually reinforcing: More startups make incumbents’ entry into the



                                                       24
early market more attractive, and vice-versa.
Turning to the efficiency properties of the equilibrium, when deciding about entry startups consider only
their own profit, and disregard the profit of incumbents. This externality pushes insufficient entry by
startups from the point of view of value creation. When the exit timing is a strategic choice (i.e. startups
have to commit), we have shown that too few incumbents enter the early market for a given number of
startups. Since both sides of the market have insufficient incentives to enter, there is unambiguously too
little entry by startups in equilibrium. When the exit timing is a tactical choice, our analysis shows that
there are too many incumbents in the early market for a given number of startups, inducing more entry by
startups. In this case, there may be excessive or insufficient entry by startups in equilibrium, depending on
the model parameters.



    6. Conclusions

Many technology startups devise strategies for acquisition by large incumbents (Gans et al., 2002). In
some cases, the acquisition is meant to take place at the idea stage, when the technology is nascent. In
others, startups target a late acquisition by developing their innovation. The choice of startups of early
versus late acquisition is interrelated to the decision of incumbents to develop the capabilities to evaluate
and absorb nascent technologies. Thus, the timing of a startup-sale is influenced by the actions and
characteristics of both seller and buyers, and depends on different environmental factors. An important
novelty of our model compared to previous formal analyses of this issue is that we consider the
interactions between sellers and buyers in both the early and the late market for startups. These
interactions drive not just the value captured by each side but also the value created in the form of the fit
between startup and acquirer.

A key determinant of the efficiency of the market for startups in terms of the timing of the acquisition is
whether timing is a strategic choice for the startup, requiring commitment, or a tactical one, allowing
flexibility. When startups are flexible, and after testing the early market can decide to pursue internal
development (i.e. can choose to sell later), the early market sees too much activity. Too many startups
accept early deals, and too many incumbents invest to participate in the early market.

On the other hand, when startups have to commit to developing their innovation internally (i.e. a late
sale), too many choose to do so. Consistent with this, too few incumbents invest in absorptive capacity.
Thus, if venture capital is abundant startups might inefficiently go late. This inefficiency arises through
the reduced incentives of buyers to invest in the absorptive capacity required to participate in the early
market, highlighting the value of adopting a market level perspective that aggregates the individual
transaction level view common in the literature. Moreover, insofar as incumbents invest in research to


                                                      25
acquire absorptive capacity, the rise in venture capital funded firms might in part explain the decline in
corporate research (Arora et al., 2018).

       C. Proof of Lemma 6

In the construction of the equilibrium, we assume that buyers with a valuation 𝑣 ≥ 𝑅(𝜃) follow a symmetric
                                           𝜕𝑏(𝑣)
bidding strategy b(v) where                 𝜕𝑣
                                                   > 0. Also, it is assumed at this point that 𝜃 (𝜋𝐵𝐿 (𝑛) + 𝑤 + 𝑋(2, 𝑛)) −

𝑤 ≥ −𝑎. A buyer of type 𝑣 ∗ (𝜃) bids 𝑏(𝑣 ∗ (𝜃)) and wins only if all other buyers have valuations below
𝑣 ∗ (𝜃). Hence, whenever a buyer of type 𝑣 ∗ (𝜃) wins, it pays the reservation price 𝑅(𝜃). For a buyer of type
𝑣 ∗ (𝜃) the alternative to bidding 𝑏(𝑣 ∗ (𝜃)) is to not bidding. If all other bidders have valuations below
𝑣 ∗ (𝜃), the expected profit from not bidding is 𝜃𝜋𝐵𝐿 (𝑛), because the startup is sold in the late market. In
equilibrium, the marginal type 𝑣 ∗ (𝜃) has to be indifferent between bidding and not bidding:

                            𝐹(𝑣 ∗ (𝜃), 𝑚 − 1) (𝑣 ∗ (𝜃) + 𝑤– 𝑅(𝜃)) + (1 − 𝐹(𝑣 ∗ (𝜃), 𝑚 − 1)) × 0 =

𝐹(𝑣 ∗ (𝜃), 𝑚 − 1)𝜃𝜋𝐵𝐿 (𝑛) + 𝐹(𝑣 ∗ (𝜃), 𝑚 − 1) × 0 

                           𝑣 ∗ (𝜃) = 𝜃𝜋𝐵𝐿 (𝑛) + 𝑅(𝜃) − 𝑤 = 𝜃 (𝜋𝐵𝐿 (𝑛) + 𝑤 + 𝑋(2, 𝑛)) − 𝑤

Consider now types 𝑣 > 𝑣 ∗ (𝜃). Two situations can occur: There are either competing buyers or not. If there
are competing buyers, it is optimal to bid the true valuation. The startup is sold in the early market because
there is at least one other buyer that bids above 𝑅(𝜃), and it follows from standard second-price auction
logic that bidding the true valuation is optimal. In the other case, without competing buyers, it is also
optimal to bid the true valuation. The start-up is then bought at the price 𝑅(𝜃) which (i) results in higher




                                                                        30
profits than buying in the late market since 𝑣 > 𝑣 ∗ (𝜃), and (ii) 𝑅(𝜃) is the lowest price at which the startup
can be acquired.

If 𝜃 (𝜋𝐵𝐿 (𝑛) + 𝑤 + 𝑋(2, 𝑛)) − 𝑤 < −𝑎, a similar argument establishes that it is optimal for a buyer to bid

its valuation for all v, and hence 𝑣 ∗ (𝜃) = −𝑎 in this case.

    D. Proof of Proposition 4

We show first that buyers over-invest in absorptive capacity. We then show that this behavior results in
too many early deals from the point of view of value creation.

Claim 1: Buyers overinvest in absorptive capacity.

Suppose that a startup of type  is sold in the early market for some 𝑥(1, 𝑚) ≥ 𝑣̂(𝜃) ≥ −𝑎. There is a
reserve price 𝑅̂ (𝜃) in the auction representing the expected value creation in the late market. Then,
applying the same steps as in the derivation of ∆𝜋𝐵𝐸 (𝜃), the contribution of the marginal early buyer to
value creation can be written as:
                          𝑎                                                  𝑣
       ∆𝑉   𝐸 (𝜃,
                    𝑚) ≡ ∫       (𝐹(𝑣̂(𝜃), 𝑚 − 1) (𝑤 + 𝑣̂(𝜃) − 𝑅̂ (𝜃)) + ∫       𝐹(𝑥, 𝑚 − 1) 𝑑𝑥) ℎ(𝑣)𝑑𝑣.
                         𝑣̂(𝜃)                                              𝑣̂(𝜃)


where 𝑣̂(𝜃) is the threshold value that maximizes value creation. The value created is maximized for
𝜕∆𝑉 𝐸 (𝜃, 𝑚)⁄ = 0 ⇔ 𝑣̂(𝜃) = 𝑅̂ (𝜃) − 𝑤 if −𝑎 < 𝑅̂ (𝜃) − 𝑤. Otherwise, 𝑣̂(𝜃) = −𝑎. As argued in the
             𝜕v̂
main text, the expected value creation in the late market is 𝑅̂ (𝜃) = 𝜃(𝑤 + 𝑋(1, 𝑛)). Hence,

                                       𝑣̂(θ) ≡ 𝑀𝑎𝑥{θ(w + 𝑉(1, 𝑛)) − 𝑤, −𝑎}.

Plugging 𝑣̂(θ) into ∆𝑉 𝐸 (𝜃, 𝑚), we obtain:

                                                𝑎      𝑣
                                 ∆𝑉 𝐸 (𝜃, 𝑚) = ∫𝑣̂(𝜃) (∫𝑣̂(𝜃) 𝐹(𝑥, 𝑚 − 1) 𝑑𝑥) ℎ(𝑣) 𝑑𝑣                      (A1)

Finally, arguing as in the proof of Lemma 6, we can show that ∆𝑉 𝐸 (𝜃, 𝑚) is decreasing in m. Hence, the
value maximizing the number of early buyers is determined by the following equation:
                                      1
                                     ∫𝑏 ∆𝑉 𝐸 (𝜃, 𝑚) 𝑞(𝜃)𝑑𝜃 − 𝑇 = 0                                  (A2)

Comparing equations (A2) and (6), and using 𝑣 ∗ (𝜃) ≤ 𝑣̂(𝜃), we obtain ∆𝑉 𝐸 (𝜃, 𝑚) ≤ ∆𝜋𝐵𝐸 (𝜃, 𝑚).
Furthermore, ∆𝑉 𝐸 (𝜃, 𝑚) < ∆𝜋𝐵𝐸 (𝜃, 𝑚) for  sufficiently large as −𝑎 < 𝑣 ∗ (1) < 𝑣̂(1). Using equations
(7) and (A3), this implies that 𝑚∗ > 𝑚
                                     ̂.

Claim 2: Too many early deals.

     E. Proof of Corollary 1

Using equations (A.1), (A.2), (6), and (7), we have that the market outcome is value maximizing in the
                                          ̂ (θ) → 𝑅 ∗ (𝜃) for 𝑛 → ∞.
limit for 𝑛 → ∞ since 𝑣̂(θ) → 𝑣 ∗ (𝜃) and R

     F. Proof of Proposition 5.

Consider first the case of commitment. The probability of a late sale is Prob(Late) = 1 − θ̃. Since
𝜕𝜃̃⁄ < 0 for given m, the proposition follows immediately in this case. Consider now the case of
    𝜕𝑎
                                                                                 1
flexibility. The probability of a late sale can be rewritten as Prob(Late) = ∫𝜃 𝐹( 𝑣 ∗ (𝜃))𝑞(𝜃)𝑑𝜃, where

     (𝑤 − 𝑎)                        (𝑤 − 𝑎)
𝜃≡          ⁄                     =       ⁄           2𝑎           𝑎(𝑛−3)     is the lowest value of  for
             (𝜋(𝑛) + 𝑤 + 𝑋(2, 𝑛))           (                +𝑤+          )
                                                    𝑛(𝑛+1)          𝑛+1

which a late sale can be optimal. For 𝜽 = 𝜽, a late sale takes place if and only if x(1,m) is equal to the
lower-bound (i.e. x(1,m) = - a). For 𝜽 < 𝜽, the execution risk is so high that the startup is always sold
early, no matter how unfavorable the valuations in the early market. We have:
                                                      1
              ∂Prob(Late)                    𝜕𝜃                   𝜕𝑣 ∗ (𝜃)
                          = −𝐹 (𝑣 ∗ (𝜃)) 𝑞(𝜃) ⁄𝜕𝑎 + ∫ 𝑓( 𝑣 ∗ (𝜃))         ⁄ 𝑞(𝜃)𝑑𝜃.
                                                                           𝜕𝑎
                  ∂a                                 𝜃

                         𝜕𝜃                               𝜕𝑣 ∗ (𝜃)
Calculations show that     ⁄ < 0. Furthermore, for 𝜃 ≥ 𝜃,         ⁄ = 𝜃 ( 2 + (𝑛−3)) > 0.
                            𝜕𝑎                                     𝜕𝑎    𝑛(𝑛+1) 𝑛+1
                             𝜕𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑒)
Together, these imply that       𝜕𝑎
                                           > 0.
