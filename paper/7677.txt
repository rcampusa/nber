                                              ABSTRACT


        This paper explores several issues concerning a possible zero lower bound (ZLB) including

its theoretical rationale; the magnitude of effects of low sustained inflation on real interest rates; the

validity of analyzing monetary policy in models with no monetary variables; and the dynamic

stabilizing properties of Taylor rules in a ZLB context. The most important argument, however, is

that if the short nominal rate is immobilized at zero, there nevertheless exists a route for monetary

stabilization policy to be effective--- via the foreign exchange market. Its quantitative importance

is examined in a calibrated, optimizing, open-economy model.

1.      Introduction

        The object of this paper is to explore theoretical issues relating to the idea that

there exists a zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and to the possibility that such a

bound might interfere with the conduct of monetary policy in an environment of low

inflation. The possibility of such an impediment has been mentioned over the years by

Vickrey (1954), Phelps (1972), Okun (1981), and Summers (1991); recently it has been

analyzed quantitatively by Fuhrer and Madigan (1997), Rotemberg and Woodford

(1997), Orphanides and Wieland (1998), Wolman (1998), Reifschneider and Williams

(1999), and possibly others. There has been little explicit theoretical analysis, however,

the main exception that I am aware of being some work in progress by Woodford (1999).

        Interest in the subject of a zero lower bound—which will be abbreviated below as

ZLB—has been greatly enhanced in recent years by the success that central banks have

had in reducing average inflation rates to the range of 1-3 percent (per annum), and by

the failure of Japanese stabilization policy to prevent a prolonged macroeconomic slump

in which short-term nominal interest rates1 have fallen to figures approximating zero.

Many writers have suggested, especially in the journalistic literature, that such a situation

leaves a central bank helpless to provide macroeconomic stimulus. This point of view

has been contested by Goodfriend (1997), Krugman (1999), Meltzer (1999), and others.

        The discussion below takes up a number of distinct issues and utilizes a variety of

analytical models. It begins in Section 2 with a simple but explicit analysis of the source

of a possible ZLB on interest rates. Next, Section 3 introduces an argument to the effect




1
 Henceforth, the term “interest rate” should be understood to mean nominal interest, unless the modifier
“real” is included or very obviously implied.


                                                     1
that most formal analysis has overstated the restrictiveness of the ZLB by failing to

recognize forces that tend to raise steady-state real rates of interest when maintained (i.e.,

policy target) inflation rates are lowered. Section 4 returns to models with inflation-

invariant steady-state real rates and reconsiders the popular practice of analyzing

monetary policy in models with no monetary variables. It is argued that neglect of

monetary variables is theoretically inappropriate, but probably not quantitatively

important. The main analysis, concerning the effectiveness of monetary policy in a ZLB

situation, is put forth in Sections 5 and 6. The first of these argues that if the one-period

nominal interest rate is for some reason fixed at zero (or some other value), there is

nevertheless a route for monetary stabilization policy operating via the foreign exchange

market. Then in Section 6 the quantitative importance of this stabilization approach is

investigated by means of a structural macroeconomic model developed and utilized

previously. Section 7 takes up a somewhat esoteric topic concerning dynamic stability

analysis and expresses disagreement with some alarming views recently put forth.

Finally, Section 8 provides a concluding overview. Because of the variety of topics

considered, different models are used from section to section. Unfortunately, some

accompanying changes in notation are needed, to which the reader should be alert.

2.     The Source of a Zero Lower Bound

       Let us begin with an elementary but explicit analysis of the theoretical basis for

the common-sense belief that nominal interest rates cannot be negative. For this purpose

it will be useful to consider an extremely simple general equilibrium model that abstracts

from uncertainty and sticky prices, both of which will be introduced later in the paper.

Thus we imagine an economy populated by a large number of identical (but



                                              2
independently acting) households, a typical one of which seeks at time 1 to maximize the

objective function

                 u(c1) + βu(c2) + β2u(c3) + …

subject to a sequence of constraints for t = 1,2,….

(1)              f (nt,kt) – txt = ct + kt+1 – (1-δ) kt + (1+πt)mt+1 – mt +

                                  (1+πt) (1+Rt)-1 bt+1 - bt + wt (nt–1) + ψ(ct,mt).

Here ct denotes consumption2 during period t while yt = f(nt, kt) is the output produced by

the household from inputs of labor (nt) and the services of capital (kt), in accordance with

the well-behaved production function f(nt, kt). The economy should be thought of as one

in which there are many distinct goods; households specialize in production but choose

consumption bundles ct that include many differentiated goods. As has become well-

known, the formulation shown can then be justified by assuming that ct is a CES index of

the various goods while Pt indexes the money price of one consumption bundle and is

appropriately related to the prices of the distinct goods.3 In (1), txt reflects lump-sum

taxes net of transfers from the government, πt = (Pt+1–Pt)/Pt; mt is real money balances

held by the household at the start of t; and bt+1 is the number of bonds purchased in t,

each for the price (1 + Rt)-1, and redeemed in t + 1 for one unit of money

        The final term in (1), ψ(ct,mt), reflects the transaction-facilitating properties of

money, i.e., the economy’s medium of exchange (MOE). Over a range corresponding to

normal conditions the function ψ has partial derivatives satisfying ψ1(ct, mt) > 0 and

ψ2(ct,mt) < 0, but at very low inflation rates the latter inequality may not hold, as will be


2
 More specifically, ct is the number of many-commodity bundles consumed during t, as discussed below.

 See, for example, the treatments in Rotemberg and Woodford (1997, pp. 308-310), Blanchard and Fischer
(1989, pp. 376-381), or Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996, pp. 236-8, 661-5).


                                                  3
discussed shortly. Thus the assumption is that the act of acquiring the many-good

bundles consumed during t requires an expenditure of resources on transaction services,

in addition to the purchase price of the goods. The magnitude of this expenditure

increases with ct, but is decreased—at least up to a point—by larger holdings of real

money balances, which make it less likely that their holder will have to resort to barter or

hastily-negotiated credit arrangements to effect desired purchases.4 There are, of course,

other analytical devices for representing this transaction-facilitating property of the MOE.

Quite common are cash-in-advance and money-in-utility-function specifications, and I

have often promoted the “shopping time” approach that expresses transaction

requirements in terms of time rather than tangible resources. By and large, the messages

conveyed by most of these devices are the same.5 But the resource transaction-cost

variant represented in (1) is somewhat cleaner analytically and so will be utilized

throughout most of the present paper.

        Assuming that f(         ), u(    ), and ψ(      ) are such that interior solutions are

obtained, the household’s first-order conditions for optimality in the problem stated

above include, for t = 1,2…:

(2)              u′(ct) - λt[1+ψ1(ct,mt)] = 0

(3)              f1(nt,kt) – wt = 0

(4)              -λt + βλt+1 [f2(nt+1, kt+1) + 1-δ] = 0

(5)              -λt(1+πt) + βλt+1[1 - ψ2(ct+1,mt+1)] = 0

4
  There has been a sizeable volume of theoretical work in recent years that seeks to provide a firm micro-
theoretic basis for the MOE role of money; leading examples are Kiyotaki and Wright (1989), Lacker and
Schreft (1996), and Wallace (1997). The specification of ψ( ) used here is intended to serve as a reduced-
form shorthand for these analyses, one that is suitable for macroeconomic (but not microeconomic) issues.
The model does not explain which asset society has somehow selected as the MOE, but the discussion
presumes that it is paper money issued by a governmentally sponsored central bank.



                                                    4
(6)                 -λt(1+πt)(1+Rt)-1 + λt+1 β = 0

Here λt is the Lagrange multiplier attached to constraint (1). There are also transversality

conditions (TCs) pertaining to the household’s choice problem. Presuming them to hold,

equations (1) – (6) determine optimal time paths for ct, mt+1, kt+1, nt, bt+1, and λt in

response to market- or policy-determined values of wt, πt, txt, and Rt.

           For general equilibrium, we have, in addition to relations (1) – (6), the following:

(7)                 nt = 1

(8)                 mt = Mt/Pt

(9)                 gt – txt = (1+πt) mt+1 – mt + (1+πt) (1+Rt)-1bt+1 - bt

(10)                πt = (Pt+1-Pt)/Pt

Here (7) and (8) are market-clearing conditions, (9) is the identity that reflects the

government’s budget constraint, and (10) is the inflation definition mentioned above—all

expressed in per-household terms where relevant. We assume that the government—a

combination of a central bank that issues high-powered money Mt and a fiscal

authority—exogenously determines time paths for the variables gt, bt, and Mt. Then the

model’s 10 equations (plus TCs) determine time paths for ct, mt, kt, nt, λt, txt, wt, Rt, Pt,

and πt.

           If we were to append the Fisher identity

(11)                1 + rt ≡ (1+Rt) (1+πt)-1,

then equations (4) and (6) would imply

(12)                1 + rt = f2(nt+1,kt+1) - δ + 1,




5
    An exception is that the cash-in-advance setup implies an interest-inelastic money demand function.


                                                       5
i.e., that the real rates of return on bonds and capital are equalized. If the model featured

uncertainty regarding tastes or technology, then the differing risk characteristics of bonds

and capital would introduce a stochastic differential in these returns.

       We now ask, is there anything in the equations governing market equilibrium in

the system at hand that is suggestive of a ZLB on the value of Rt? For an answer, we

combine (5) and (6) to obtain

(13)           1 + Rt = 1 - ψ2(ct+1,mt+1),

which says that the interest rate Rt equals –1 times the partial derivative of transaction

costs with respect to real money balances. The latter may be described as the marginal

service yield from holding money balances; thus our condition (13) can also be written as

                            ∂ψ (c t +1 , m t +1 )
(14)           Rt = −Pt+1                         .
                                ∂M t +1

This equality is similar to (24) on p. 32 of Friedman (1969), under the assumption that

bonds provide no non-pecuniary services to their holders.

       From the foregoing it is apparent that any bounds pertaining to Rt are going to be

decisively influenced by limits on ψ2(ct, mt). If ψ2 <0 strictly, then we would have the

implication Rt>0. But it seems rather implausible that such would be the case. One

would expect to have ψ22>0 over an extended range, so that the marginal service yield on

mt decreases as the quantity of money held grows larger. But at some point, say m*(ct),

real money holdings would be so large in relation to spending—e.g., ten times as large as

annual spending flows!—that additional money holdings would not provide any extra

services. Then -ψ2 would fall to zero at m = m*(c). Suppose then, that ψ(ct, mt) is such

that the relationship between -ψ2 and mt is (for given ct) as depicted in Figure 1A. Then



                                                      6
with ψ2(ct,mt) ≤ 0, condition (13) implies Rt ≥0. In this way we obtain, via formal

analysis, a ZLB on the one-period interest rate.

        Continuing this line of thought, however, it seems apparent that ψ(ct,mt) in (1)

should be regarded as reflecting transaction services together with any storage costs

associated with money. If the economy’s MOE were metallic coins or uncoined bullion,

then storage costs would clearly be relevant. But even with paper money, which we are

presuming to be relevant for the analysis at hand, one can imagine that stocks of money

balances could be so large that storage costs at the margin would become non-negligible.6

In that case Figure 1B would be relevant, and a ZLB on Rt would not be implied. To the

author, this case seems most relevant.7 It is, nevertheless, rather difficult to imagine that

such storage costs could permit Rt to be negative by more than a few basis points in any

currently-conceivable circumstances.

        The main point of the foregoing discussion is that the presence or absence of a

ZLB on (short term) nominal interest rates depends upon the properties of the function or

constraint of the model that represents the transaction-facilitating properties of the

economy’s MOE, together with any storage costs necessitated by stocks of the MOE.

Strictly speaking, then, it seems to be logically unsatisfactory to discuss the topic of a

ZLB in the context of a model that takes no explicit position concerning the properties of

ψ(ct, mt) or some analogous function that depicts the transaction and storage cost

properties of the MOE.



6
  With paper money, pure storage costs would depend upon nominal rather than real money balances. But
one can construct a relationship such as that of Figure 1B nevertheless, contingent upon some assumption
regarding the composition of bills by denomination. For “storage” costs that reflect insurance or guard
services, the relationship would pertain to real balances in any case.
7
  For some supportive argumentation, see Thornton (1999).


                                                    7
        Before proceeding, it will be useful to prepare some background for the next topic

by noting one of the steady-state properties of the system at hand. With no population

growth and no technical progress, a steady state equilibrium must have constant values of

ct, yt, kt, rt, and mt so the rates of growth of Pt and Mt must be equal: the inflation rate

must equal the rate of growth of the money stock. But furthermore (4) implies that

(15)            λ = βλ[f2(n,k) + 1-δ]

holds in a steady state, so that

(16)            1/β = 1 +ρ = 1 + f2(n,k) - δ,

i.e., that r = f2(n,k) - δ = ρ. Of course the latter implies via (11) that

(17)            1 + R = (1+ρ) (1+π).

If then the rate of money growth µ and inflation were negative and greater in absolute

value than ρ, a negative value of R would be implied. Suppose, then, that the central

bank were to destroy money at a constant rate −µ larger than ρ and that the nature of

ψ(     ) is such that ψ2( ) ≤ 0 so that there is a ZLB on R. It would then appear to be the

case that no steady-state equilibrium is possible, when -µ>ρ.

        The property just derived should be regarded, in my judgment, as a defect of the

model at hand—a defect due to the model’s assumption that the steady-state equilibrium

value of r is totally independent of the ongoing inflation rate. This superneutrality

property is a useful approximation for thinking about macro-monetary issues, but is a

rather special property of models with time-separable, infinite-horizon utility functions

for the household agents. Not all well-known models possess this property, however, as

we shall review in the next section.




                                                8
3.         Real-Rate Effects of Inflation

           The present section considers the possibility that a permanent reduction in the

central bank’s inflation target—a fall in the long-run average inflation rate—may not

sharply reduce the “policy buffer” between the average level of Rt and the ZLB because

of an increase in the steady-state real rate, r.8 The reason is that a decreased pecuniary

yield differential between capital and money may induce wealth-holders to allocate a

larger fraction of their wealth to money and less to capital. As this occurs, the marginal

product of capital will tend to rise, carrying the real yield on paper assets along with it.

We need to consider whether such effects can be of quantitative importance.

           Effects of this type cannot obtain in the Sidrauski-Brock model of Section 2, of

course, but can in models in which individuals have finite lifetimes. For our formal

analysis, let us for simplicity adopt an overlapping generations (OG) setup in which

agents live for only two periods, keeping in mind that such periods must be thought of as

(say) 25 years in duration.

           Notation for our model is similar, but not identical, to that of McCallum (1987).

Thus ct denotes consumption when young, and xt+1 consumption when old, of an

individual born in period t. Such an individual’s utility function when young is u(ct, xt+1),

which we specialize to the separable form

(18)                u(ct,xt+1) = v(ct) + βv(xt+1).

Here the discount factor must be recognized to pertain to a period of 25 years. Thus for

an annual rate of time preference of 0.025, we would have β = (1.025)-25 = 0.5394.




8
    The policy buffer term is taken from Clouse et.al. (1999).


                                                        9
        When young, individuals supply one unit of labor inelastically and earn a real

wage of wt. Old individuals cannot work, but can and do operate production processes

using capital goods (obtained from their savings when young) and hired labor of youths.

Let yt = f(nt, kt) denote output in t of an old producer who has kt units of capital to use

and hires nt young workers.

        Young individuals can hold their savings wt – ct in the form of capital, bonds, or

money. Let kt+1, bt+1, and ξt denote capital, bond, and real-money holdings at the end of t.

Then the young person’s budget constraint is

(19)             wt = ct + kt+1 + bt+1 (1+rt)-1 + ξt,

and when old in t+1 this person will be constrained by

(20)           xt+1 = f(nt+1,kt+1) + (1-δ)kt+1 – wt+1 nt+1 + bt+1 + ξt Pt/Pt+1 + trt+1 - ψ(xt+1,mt+1).

Here trt+1 = -txt+1 denotes lump-sum transfers to an old person in t + 1, while money

holdings are

(21)             mt+1 = ξt Pt/Pt+1 + trt+1

and ψ(xt+1, mt+1) represents transaction costs of consuming in old age. The function ψ

has the same general interpretation as in Section 2, although it is more strained by the

extreme length of a period in the present setting.9

        Maximization of (18) subject to (19), (20), and (21) yields the following first-

order optimality conditions for a young individual:

(22)             v′(ct) = βv′(xt+1) [f2(nt+1,kt+1) + 1-δ]/[1+ψ1(xt+1,mt+1)]

(23)             f1(nt+1, kt+1) = wt+1

9
 It is natural to ask why no such shopping considerations apply to young consumers. For simplicity we
assume that they must obtain their goods by barter since they have no assets when born. The cost of




                                                   10
(24)             v′(ct) = βv′(xt+1) (Pt/Pt+1)[1 - ψ2(xt+1, mt+1)]/[1+ψ1(xt+1,mt+1)]

(25)             rt = f2(nt+1, kt+1) - δ.

These plus (19), (20), and (21) determine the individual’s choices of ct, xt+1, kt+1, nt+1,

bt+1, mt+1, and ξt given exogenous (to the individual) values of wt, wt+1, trt, Pt/Pt+1, and rt.

        We assume that population growth proceeds at the rate ν, so that 1 + ν is the

number of young persons per old person in each period. Then for general equilibrium,

we must have for each t = 1,2,…

(26)             nt = 1 +ν,

(27)             Mt/Pt = (1+ν) ξt,

where Mt = money supply per old person in t, after transfers, and the government budget

identity

(28)             Pt(gt + trt) = (1+ν)Mt – Mt-1 + (1+ν)Ptbt+1(1+rt)-1 − Ptbt.

Assuming that the government sets time paths for gt (government purchases), Mt, and bt,

the ten listed equations determine equilibrium paths for the variables ct, xt, kt+1, nt, mt, ξt,

Pt, trt, wt, and rt (t = 1,2,…).10

        In a steady-state equilibrium, we have constant values for c, x, m, ξ, k, w, r, b, π =

(Pt+1/Pt)-1, tr, and n = 1+ν. In this context, r = f2(1+ν, k)−δ and w = f1(1+ν,k). But

determination of the value of k is not independent of m and Pt/Pt+1. For simplicity, let us

eliminate g and b from the model. Then the relevant set of conditions determining k, c, x,

and m is




conducting barter exchanges should then be included also, but has been omitted for simplicity. It would
appear that this omission should not have major misleading effects on the analysis that follows.



                                                    11
(29)               v′(c) = βv′(x)[f2(1+ν,k) + 1-δ] / [1+ψ1(x,m)]

(30)               v′(c) = βv′(x)[1-ψ2(x,m)] / [1+ψ1(x,m)](1+π)

(31)               f(1+ν,k) + (1-δ)k = x + (1+ν)c + (1+ν)k + ψ(x,m)

(32)               f1(1+ν,k) = c + k + m/(1+ν)

Here equations (29), (31), and (32) include the four endogenous variables c, x, k, and m.

Therefore their values cannot be determined without use of (30), where the inflation rate

π appears. If we treat π as exogenous—determined by the average growth rate of M—

then the monetary authority’s choice of π will typically affect the steady-state value of k

and therefore r.

         Our objective now is to see whether the effect of π on r is quantitatively large

enough to be of policy significance. Thus we need to calibrate the model at hand. For

the production function we take y = A n.64 k.36 and choose A to yield a realistic value of

k/y. In annual terms the latter would be about 3 so, in our setup with 25-year periods, we

need k/y in the range of about 0.1-0.2. In equilibrium, n = 1+ν so if we take population

growth to be one percent per year we obtain n = (1.01)25 = 1.2824. We also want the real

rate of interest to be around 2.0 – 4.0 percent per year. It turns out that together these

requirements suggest a value of A = 20. For the 25-year depreciation rate, we use δ =

0.90, which implies that about 10 percent of gross output goes to depreciation. For our

utility function, an intertemporal elasticity of substitution of 0.25 seems appropriate,11 so

we specify u(c) = (1−θ)-1c1−θ with θ = 4, which implies u′(c) = c-4.




10
   In this setup, mt = Mt/Pt is not assumed but can be shown to be implied by the equilibrium conditions.
Also implied is the overall resource constraint f(nt, kt) + (1-δ)kt = xt+1 + (1+ν)ct + (1+ν)kt+1 + gt + ψ(xt,mt).
11
   Virtually identical results were obtained with an elasticity of 0.4, i.e., θ = 2.5.


                                                       12
       Turning now to the transaction cost function ψ(x,m), let us suppose that the cost

per unit of purchases declines with m/x, according to

(33)           ψ(x,m)/x = a1(x/m)a2            a1, a2 > 0.

From a relation analogous to (13) we have that the elasticity of money demand with

respect to the nominal interest rate equals –1/(1+a2). To yield a conservatively small

value of 0.2, we then set a2 = 4. Finally, to keep the ratio of m to k (or m to y)

realistically small, we specify a1 = 0.1 × 10-8.

       With these values, we consider annualized inflation rates of 10, 5, 2, 1, 0, -2, -5,

and -10 percent. In terms of our 25-year periods, these imply values of π as shown in

Table 1. Steady state values of c, x, k, and m are also reported in Table 1 for these

alternative inflation rates. It will be observed that real money balances rise and the

capital stock falls as inflation rates are reduced toward zero, and then on into the negative

range. The real rate of interest—the marginal product of capital net of depreciation—is

shown in the final column in annualized percentage terms. It rises quite slowly with

reduced inflation, but climbs more significantly as deflation ranges are encountered.

Indeed, in the model at hand, it seems to rise enough to keep the nominal interest rate

positive in all cases, even with substantial deflation. That finding accords with the type

of effect that this section was designed to investigate.

       In quantitative terms, however, Table 1 results are unlikely to provide much

reassurance to policymakers concerned with the issue raised by Summers, Okun, and

others, which has to do with cyclical stabilization, not the potential infeasibility of

sizeable steady-state deflation rates. In that regard, our quantitative results suggest that

the increase in the steady-state real interest rate associated with a reduction in inflation



                                              13
from 2 percent to 0 percent (per year) would be negligible. Accordingly, we henceforth

ignore the effects of inflation on the average real rate of interest, and return to models of

the Sidrauski-Brock type in which the steady-state real rate r is invariant to alternative

maintained inflation rates.

4.     The Role of Monetary Variables in Policy Analysis

       At this point we resume the main line of argument. Much practical monetary

policy analysis during recent years has been conducted, as is well known, in models that

include no monetary variables whatsoever. Instead, they consist of the three following

components: (i) an IS-type relation (or set of relations) that specifies how interest rate

movements affect aggregate demand and output; (ii) a price adjustment equation (or set

of equations) that specifies how inflation behaves in response to the output gap and to

expectations regarding future inflation; and (iii) a monetary policy rule that specifies each

period’s settings of an interest-rate instrument. These settings are typically made in

response to recent or predicted values of the economy’s inflation rate and its output

gap—as, e.g., in the case of a Taylor rule. Examples of such analytical work, stemming

from conferences held by NBER and the Sveriges Riksbank (in collaboration with IIES

of Stockholm University), are presented in Taylor (1999) and in the June 1999 issue of

the Journal of Monetary Economics (vol. 43, no. 3). This practice of conducting

monetary policy analysis in models with no monetary variables is of particular interest in

situations in which interest rates are close to a ZLB. But before turning to that case, it

will be useful to consider the absence of monetary variables from a more general

perspective.




                                              14
           As a point of reference, let us write out a simple specification of the IS-AS-MP

type under discussion.12 Symbols are basically the same as in Section 2, but in addition

we let y t be the natural-rate value of yt, i.e., the value that would prevail in the absence

of any price stickiness in the economy, and define p t as the associated price level. Also,

let vt and et represent shocks to spending and monetary policy behavior. We suppose that

y t is generated exogenously, influenced perhaps by the shock vt. Then the schematic

model is given by the following three equations:

(34)       log yt = b0 + b1(Rt - Et∆log pt+1) + b2(log gt – Et log gt+1) + Etyt+1 + vt

(35)       log pt – log pt-1 = (1-α)(log p t −1 - log pt-1) + Et-1(log p t - log p t −1 )

(36)       Rt = Et-1∆log pt+1 + µ0 + µ1(Et-1∆log pt+1 - π*) + µ2(log yt – log y t ) + et .

Here (36) is a Taylor-style (1993a) policy rule, with a forward-looking flavor, and (35) is

a particular price adjustment specification that will be discussed below in Section 5. For

present purposes, our concern is with the IS-type relationship (34) about which we ask:

can it be given an adequate theoretical foundation?

           In fact, a reasonably satisfactory justification has become quite well-known from

a number of papers, including Kerr and King (1996), Rotemberg and Woodford (1997),

McCallum and Nelson (1999c), and Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999), among others. It

can be outlined briefly as follows. Consider the optimizing model presented in Section 2

and note that equations (4) and (12) can be combined to yield

(37)       λt = βλt+1(1+rt),

where λt is the shadow value (in utility units) of a unit of output in t while rt is the real

rate of interest. Suppose then that the transaction-cost function ψ(ct,mt) is separable, so

12
     Here AS and MP stand for aggregate supply and monetary policy, respectively.

                                                       15
that its first partial derivative with respect to ct can be written as ψ1(ct). Then using (2)

for λt we can substitute into (37) and obtain

(38)       u′(ct)/[1+ψ1(ct)] = βu′(ct+1)(1+rt)/[1+ψ1(ct+1)].

Now the latter is a relationship that determines a household’s choice of ct in response to rt

and its expectations regarding ct+1. Taking a log-linear approximation, then, we can

obtain13

(39)       log ct = b0’ + Etlog ct+1 + b1’ rt

where b1’ < 0. In the literature, derivations such as the foregoing have usually been

presented in models in which the transaction-facilitating property of money is expressed

by including mt as an argument of the utility function, rather than in the manner involving

our transaction-cost approach. But the basic idea is the same. And in either case, a

disturbance term will appear on the right-hand side of (39) if there is a serially-correlated

preference shock appearing appropriately in the utility function.

           Next, armed with (39) we make use of the economy’s overall resource constraint.

A log-linear approximation is written as

(40)       log yt = ω1log ct + ω2log it + ω3log gt

where it denotes investment in period t. The weights ωj sum to 1.0 and reflect average

shares of the three components. We substitute (39) into (40) for ct and solve out Etct+1

using (40), thereby obtaining

(41)       log yt = b0 + b1rt + b2(it – Etit+1) + b3(gt – Etgt+1 ) + Etyt+1 + vt.

The latter is the “expectational IS function” that we set out to justify. It might be

mentioned that applications have often ignored the investment and government spending


13
     For a summary of useful approximation formulae, see Uhlig (1997).


                                                     16
terms. In the case of investment, that practice is rationalized by treating capital as a fixed

constant (e.g., Rotemberg and Woodford (1997)) or by treating log investment as an

exogenous random walk (McCallum and Nelson (1999c)).14 If assumed exogenous,

government spending can be included easily. Thus we end up with a relation basically

equivalent to (34).

        At this point let us return our attention to the system (34), (35), (36). If gt is

excluded, or assumed exogenous, then the system is complete in the sense that yt, pt, and

Rt are the only endogenous variables. To append a money demand function, which could

be derived in the model of Section 2 by solving (13) for mt+1, would be redundant. The

only role of such a function would be to describe the path of the nominal money stock Mt

that would be necessary to support the Rt policy rule (36). Including this relation in the

model would therefore have no effect on time paths of the variables yt, pt, and Rt.

        But of course it should be clear that this conclusion depends upon the absence of

any term involving real money balances in the expectational IS function (34). And that

absence depends upon the assumption, inserted provisionally three paragraphs ago, that

the transaction-cost function ψ(ct,mt) is separable in ct and mt. An obvious task, then, is

to reconsider that crucial assumption. But my own position has already been introduced

in Section 3, where it is suggested that a plausible specification for ψ( ) would be of the

form

(42)    ψ(ct,mt) = cta1(ct/mt)a2




14
   A formulation with endogenous investment, together with an analysis of the constant-capital assumption,
is developed by Casares and McCallum (1999).


                                                    17
with a1, a2 > 0. This function is clearly not separable so the issue becomes one involving

quantitative magnitudes. Is the role of real money balances in the IS function likely to be

quantitatively important?15

           To approach that question, let us see how the IS function would be specified

under the assumption that (42) is the relevant specification for transaction costs. Then

equation (2) can be written (assuming that u′(ct) = ct−θ) as

(43)       λt = ct-θ /[1 + (1+a2)a1(ct/mt)a2]

and a log-linear approximation would be

(44)        log λt = −θ log ct − φ(log ct – log mt),

provided that φ/a2 is small relative to 1.0, where φ = a1(1+a2)a2(c/m)a2.16 Substitution of

(44) into the log of (37) followed by rearrangement yields

(45)       log ct = Etlog ct + (θ+φ)-1[φ(log mt – Etlog mt+1) – rt – log β] + disturbance.

Clearly, then, combination of the latter with (40) would result in an IS function like (41)

but including an additional term, equal to

(46)       [(c/y)φ/(φ+θ)](log mt – Et log mt+1).

In sum, we have found that non-separability of ψ(c,m) implies that a term involving real

money balances appears in the expectational IS function based on optimizing analysis,

and if the form of ψ(c,m) is as given in (42) then the additional term can be approximated

by expression (46). It is clearly of interest, then, to obtain an idea of the magnitude of the

attached coefficient, i.e., the term in brackets in (46).

           To do so we again draw on the implication that the money demand equation in the

model under discussion would be of the form (13), which we now write as

15
     This is apparently the way that Woodford (1999) views the issue.


                                                      18
(47)    R = a1 a2 (ct/mt)1+a2.

Then an assumed money demand elasticity with respect to Rt of –0.2 would again suggest

a value of a2 = 4. To calibrate a1, let us express R and c/m in units pertaining to annual

time periods. Then for R a value of 0.05 would be reasonably appropriate and for c/m a

value of 5.17 These choices yield a1 = 0.05/4(5)5 = 4 × 10-6. Also let θ = 2.5. Thus we

have φ = 20(4 × 10-6)(5)4 = 0.05 and φ/(φ+θ) = 0.05/(0.05 + 2.5) = 0.0199. Consequently,

the coefficient attached to log mt – Et log mt+1 in the IS function is estimated by our

calibration exercise to be smaller than 0.02. Of course there are numerous uncertainties

and approximations involved, but the figure obtained seems to be too small to justify any

confidence that the effect of real money terms in the IS function would be economically

sizeable, contingent upon our basic model specification.

         Woodford (1999, Sect. 3.1) suggests a considerably larger number (approximately

0.1) for the comparable slope coefficient, primarily because he assumes a much larger

value for the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption.18 Nevertheless, he

concludes that there is no prospect from this source for escape from a liquidity trap

situation—one with Rt at a ZLB—because approximations such as those used above

break down in the vicinity of satiation with monetary transaction services. Woodford’s

reasoning seems to be correct, but we will consider the liquidity trap issue more generally

in the next section.

         First, however, it should be noted that some analysts—most notably Meltzer

(1999)—argue that monetary variables cannot legitimately be ignored in policy analysis


16
   Here (c/m) is interpreted as a steady-state value. Similar usages appear below, e.g., in (46).
17
   For the latter, we use recent U.S. ratios of consumption to M1.
18
   That Woodford uses a money-in-the-utility-function formulation, rather than (42), seems an inessential
difference.


                                                    19
because they are related to market outcomes in a manner that does not work through a

real-money-balance term in an IS function. Instead, Meltzer argues that the relevant

transmission process involves adjustment in the relative prices of assets that are not

recognized in simple models such as the ones used here (and by Woodford (1999)). Of

course Meltzer is correct to say that it is a gross simplification of reality to pretend that

economies include only two assets.19 Whether monetary policy can be used to

systematically influence the relevant relative asset prices is, however, an open question.20

Also, modelling of the relevant transmission process is both necessary and difficult. For

one such relative price it does seem clear, however, that there are systematic effects of

monetary policy that are both relevant and comprehensible. That argument will be

spelled out in the following section.

5.       Stabilizing Monetary Policy in a Liquidity Trap

         Probably the most contentious and important topic under consideration is the idea

that the potential stabilizing powers of monetary policy can be nullified by the occurrence

of a “liquidity trap,” i.e., a situation in which the central bank’s usual policy instrument

Rt cannot be lowered past a prevailing ZLB (or possibly some negative lower bound as

suggested in Figure 1B). The purpose of the present section is to argue, by means of an

expository model, that even in a liquidity trap there is scope for monetary stabilization




19
   That is the case for the model of this section because (abstracting from uncertainty) capital and bonds are
perfect substitutes.
20
   In Casares and McCallum (1999) the model includes bonds and capital goods that are not perfect
substitutes, because of capital adjustment costs. But their relative prices are not influenced by the
systematic component of monetary policy.


                                                     20
policy provided that the economy is internationally open—as all actual economies are.21

Then the argument will be evaluated quantitatively in an optimizing model in Section 6.

        We begin by specifying a schematic model designed for illustrative purposes.

The macroeconomic structure will consist of an open-economy IS sector, with no real-

money terms included, a price adjustment relation, and a monetary policy rule. For the IS

sector we have

(48)             yt = Etyt+1 + b0 + b1(R − Et∆pt+1) + b2(xt – Etxt+1) + vt

(49)             xt = c1(st-1 – pt-1) + c2yt-1.

Here (48) is an expectational IS function of the type described above, in which now yt

denotes the log of output, pt the log of the price level, and xt the log of net exports.22

(Please note the change in notation relative to Sections 2 and 4!) The disturbance term vt,

taken for simplicity to be white noise, reflects taste shocks. As suggested by optimizing

analysis, b1<0 and b2>0. In the real interest rate term, R has been written without a

subscript so as to reflect the hypothesized liquidity trap situation, i.e., that the one-period

nominal interest rate Rt is held fixed over time by some force not explicitly modeled but

presumed to reflect a ZLB or some such constraint. Relation (49) represents effects of

relative prices and incomes on net exports. We treat foreign prices and income as

constant, so st – pt represents the modeled economy’s (log) real exchange rate, st being

the log of the domestic price of foreign exchange. We presume, as is quite standard, that

c1>0 and c2<0.23 A one-period lag is assumed for simplicity, but distributed-lag effects

would not fundamentally alter the model. It is necessary, in the present simplified setup,

21
   I am deeply indebted to Edward Nelson for encouraging me to pursue the approach developed in this
section and the one to follow.
22
   More precisely, xt is the log of exports minus the log of imports.




                                                   21
that the effect of st – pt on xt not be entirely contemporaneous, for reasons discussed

below in footnote 25. (No such assumption will be used, however, in the more complete

model of Section 6.)

        Next, regarding price adjustment behavior we posit that

(50)             pt – pt-1 = (1-α) ( p t-1 – pt-1) + Et-1( p t - p t-1),

where p t represents the price that would be market-clearing in the absence of nominal

stickiness. With 0<α<1 price level stickiness is implied, however. McCallum and

Nelson (1999a) show that (50) is equivalent to the Barro-Grossman-Mussa-McCallum

“P-bar” model, which is one of the few sticky-price formulations that implies satisfaction

of the natural rate hypothesis of Lucas (1972). They also show that (50) is equivalent

(assuming demand function log-linearity) to the condition

(50′)            Et-1 ~y t = α ~y t-1,

where ~y t = yt - y t with y t representing the (log) natural-rate value of output, i.e., the

value that would prevail with fully flexible prices. Relation (50′) can be used instead of

(50) in a model, analytical or numerical, to significantly facilitate the analysis.

        For simplicity suppose that y t = y . Then equations (48)-(50) contain the

endogenous variables yt, xt, st, and pt. We close the system with the following monetary

policy rule:

(51)             st – st-1 = µ0 - µ1(∆pt - π*) - µ2Et-1 ~y t + et

where µ1, µ2>0. Thus when inflation is low and/or expected output is below its natural-

rate value, the rate of depreciation of the exchange rate ∆st is increased. This is


23
  In the next section, a model is presented in which the import component of (49) is modeled in an
optimizing fashion.


                                                    22
accomplished via central bank purchases of foreign exchange at a pace more rapid than is

normal. Such an action reflects expansionary monetary policy, conducted in accordance

with the rule (51), designed to stabilize ∆pt toward its target value π* and ~y t toward zero

(yt toward y t). In (51), et represents the unsystematic “shock” component of monetary

policy, which we take to be white noise. The constant term µ0 is set equal to the average

real rate of interest, which is –b0/b1.

         The MSV rational expectations solution to the system (48)-(51) can be obtained

as follows.24 Write (49) in first difference form ∆xt = c1(∆st-1 - ∆pt-1) + c2(yt-1 – yt-2), and

substitute into (48) in place of Et∆xt+1. That step yields25

(52)              yt = Etyt+1 + b1(R − Et∆pt+1) – b2Et[c1(∆st − ∆pt) + c2(yt – yt-1)] + vt.

Then (50), (51), and (52) comprise a system for which the MSV solution is of the form

(53)               yt = φ10 + φ11yt-1 + φ12vt + φ13et

(54)              ∆pt = φ20 + φ21yt-1 + φ22vt + φ23et

(55)              ∆st = φ30 + φ31yt-1 + φ32vt + φ33et.

Thus we have Eyt+1 = φ10 + φ11yt, Et∆pt+1 = φ20 + φ21yt, and Et∆st+1 = φ30 + φ31yt with yt

given by (53). Substitution into (50)-(52) and application of the undetermined

coefficients procedure indicates that the solution values (ignoring constants) are as

follows, where Φ ≡ 1-α + b1φ21 + b2c2:




24
   Here MSV stands for “minimum state variable.” For a recent discussion that characterizes the MSV
solution as the solution that excludes “bubble” components, together with the exposition of an algorithm
that yields the unique MSV solution in a very broad class of linear models, see McCallum (1999b).
25
   Here it can be seen why a purely contemporaneous version of (49) is unsatisfactory in the present setup:
it would introduce Et∆pt+1 rather than ∆pt into (52), and then ∆pt would appear nowhere in the system.


                                                     23
(56)           φ11 = α                                           φ12 = 1/Φ    φ13 = -b2c1/Φ

       Unfortunately, it is not possible to determine the sign of φ21 or therefore Φ on the

basis of the qualitative specification given above. Nevertheless, it can be seen from (56)

that as µ1 → ∞, i.e., as the strength of policy response to ∆pt - π* increases without

bound, φ21 → 0 and therefore the variance of ∆pt − π* goes to zero. Also, as µ2→ ∞,

φ21→ ±∞, so 1/Φ → 0 causing the variability of yt relative to Et-1yt = αyt-1 to approach

zero. So the exchange-rate-based stabilization rule (51) possesses policy effectiveness.

The extent to which this is quantitatively significant will be explored, in a somewhat

larger model that is realistically calibrated, in the following section.

       Before turning to that exploration it will be appropriate to provide some additional

discussion concerning the nature of policy rule (51). First, is such a rule feasible? Is it

possible, that is, for a central bank to control an economy’s nominal exchange rate under

liquidity trap conditions, with (domestic) agents satiated with the transaction-facilitating

services of money and a short-term nominal interest rate equal to zero? In that regard it

must be noted that, in a model of the type under discussion, the left-hand-side variable in

the policy rule is not literally an instrument but rather an indicator variable. Assuming

that the model applies to quarterly or monthly time periods, that is, the value of ∆st on the

left-hand-side of (51) can be viewed as an intermediate “operating target” to be obtained



                                                  24
by day-to-day or hour-by-hour manipulation of other tools (e.g., open-market purchases)

serving literally as the central bank’s instrument. The issue, then, is whether a central

bank can, based on virtually continuous observation of its exchange rate st, push it in the

desired direction? There are limits to how far a central bank can reduce st, i.e., appreciate

its currency, since it will always hold at most a finite stock of foreign exchange reserves.

But depreciation, i.e., upward movement of st, is the crucial requirement in the situation

under discussion. And it seems clear that there would be no economic limit to the

upward movement of st that could be engineered by central bank purchases (with high

powered money) of foreign exchange.26

         The idea that st can be used as an instrument variable (in the relevant sense) is not

a new one. For a number of years, for example, economists associated with the Reserve

Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) used st as the instrument variable in analytical

descriptions of RBNZ policy; see, e.g., Grimes and Wong (1994) or Hansen and

Margaritis (1993). Alternatively, Ball (1999), Gerlack and Smets (1996), and others have

described the use by several countries of a “monetary conditions index” as an instrument

variable. There are various definitions of a monetary conditions index (MCI), but those

that I have seen all feature measures that in some fashion combine a short-term interest

rate and an exchange rate. One plausible, dimensionally coherent definition would be

(57)              mcit = ωRt − (1-ω)∆st.

Clearly, in a ZLB situation this mcit measure would reduce to use of a ∆st instrument, as

specified in (51). Thus there seems to be significant practical evidence of two types, as




26
  Of course there might be political limits, but that is a different matter altogether, outside the scope of the

well as a priori reasoning, to support the hypothesis that use of a ∆st instrument is

feasible. Nevertheless, more discussion will be provided, immediately.

        In the model presented above, there are two non-standard features. The first is

that Rt is held fixed at Rt = 0; that feature is imposed so as to address the issues

concerned with monetary policy in a ZLB situation. The second feature is that the model

apparently does not include a relationship reflecting uncovered interest parity (UIP). In

that regard, most analysts (including myself) would normally include UIP as one

component of an open-economy macroeconomic model—despite the existence of

mountains of empirical evidence that are, at least on the surface, strongly inconsistent

with UIP on a quarter-to-quarter basis.27 So how is UIP avoided here? The answer is as

follows.

        It is well known that to be consistent with the data, UIP relations must include a

discrepancy term, typically referred to as a risk premium. Thus UIP in empirical models

is typically expressed as

(58)             Rt – Rt* = Et ∆st+1 + ξt,

where the risk premium ξt has a large variance relative to shock terms and furthermore is

serially correlated.28 Recently it has been standard practice to treat ξt as generated

exogenously, but there are theoretical reasons for believing that it would be related to the

relative amounts of outside domestic and foreign nominal liabilities outstanding. For

example, a hypothesis widely entertained during the 1970s might be expressed as

   A standard reference is Lewis (1995). For data averaged over long time periods, see Flood and Taylor
(1997).
28
   In McCallum and Nelson (1999a), the variance is by far the largest of any exogenous disturbance and the
process is an AR(1) with coefficient 0.5. These values were taken from evidence in Taylor (1993b).


                                                   26
(59)            ξt = λ[Bt – (Bt* + st)] + ζt

where Bt and Bt* are logs of domestic and foreign government debt (including base

money) and ζt is an exogenous stochastic shock term. Substituting and recognizing that

lags could be involved, we then write

(60)            Rt – Rt* = (Etst+1 – st) + λ (L)[Bt – Bt* − st] + ζt,

which is similar to equations prominent in several older writings of Dornbusch (e.g.,

1980, p. 169, and 1987, p.7). This “portfolio balance” hypothesis has receded from its

earlier prominence because empirical studies by Frankel (1982, 1984), Dooley and Isard

(1983), and others failed to find empirical support. But it is, I suggest, not unreasonable

to believe that some such relation obtains in fact, probably with weak or transitory effects

of the Bt – Bt* variable. And if such is the case, then our procedure above is fully

justified. For (60) indicates that even with Rt = R, st can be affected by purchases of

foreign exchange since they alter the value of Bt – Bt*. Yet the precise specification of

relation (60) need not be known, and the relation need not be included in the model, for

exactly the same reason that money demand functions are not needed in analyses that

presume use of an interest rate instrument. Thus appending (60) to the model (48)-(51)

would have no effect on the implied behavior of ∆pt, xt, yt, or ∆st; it would merely specify

the magnitude of open-market purchases of foreign exchange needed to implement the

∆st policy rule (51).

        Still another way of expressing the argument is as follows. Suppose that policy

rule (51) is relevant but the economy is not in a liquidity trap. Then let strict UIP be

included as part of the model and note that Rt is determined endogenously. In that

determination of Rt, the UIP relation plays a major role—one might say that UIP is the



                                                27
“proximate determinant” of Rt. Next suppose that the economy in question has a fixed

nominal exchange rate. Then Et∆st+1 = 0 in all periods so the UIP condition implies that

the home-foreign interest rate differential is constant over time; in that case the home

country’s central bank has no influence on Rt, not even temporarily. Most practical

analysts would not, however, accept that conclusion. Instead they would view this lack

of influence over Rt as a medium-term tendency, and would contend that on a month-to-

month or quarter-to-quarter basis the central bank can influence Rt, keeping it temporarily

high or low relative to the relevant foreign rate. But that contention implies that strict

UIP does not hold on a period-to-period basis. Instead the home-foreign interest

differential can be temporarily influenced by policy actions of the central bank as

suggested by formulation (60).29 Some evidence supportive of this position has been

provided by Stockman (1992).

6.         Quantitative Application

           Our objective now is to provide quantitative support for the position developed in

the previous section, viz., that a policy feedback rule with an exchange rate instrument

can provide macroeconomic stabilization in a situation in which interest rate

manipulation is infeasible because of a ZLB. The basic research strategy is to adopt a

quantitative open-economy macroeconomic model, alter the policy rule so as to use ∆st

rather than Rt as the left-hand-side instrument or indicator variable, and impose the

constraint that Rt ≡ 0. The latter step requires that some relationship in the model be

ignored to avoid over-determination of the endogenous variables; the relationship that we

ignore is UIP.

29
     In this regard, see the evidence of Flood and Rose (1996) for members of the European Exchange Rate



                                                     28
       The model to be used here as a starting point is the small-scale, open economy,

quarterly model based on explicit optimizing analysis that is developed by McCallum and

Nelson (1999b). It has been utilized subsequently—together with an additional variant—

by McCallum (1999a); the next three paragraphs constitute an adaptation of descriptive

material taken from the last-mentioned paper.

       Basing one’s analysis on the assumption of explicit optimizing behavior by the

modeled individuals in a general equilibrium setting is obviously not sufficient—and

perhaps not necessary—for the creation of a structural model that is specified with

reasonable accuracy relative to economic reality. The optimizing general equilibrium

approach can be very helpful in this respect, however, since it eliminates potential

internal logical inconsistencies that are possible when this source of intellectual discipline

is absent. The model at hand, henceforth termed the M-N model, has a simple basic

structure since it depicts an economy in which all individuals are infinite-lived and alike.

As with many recent models designed for policy analysis, it assumes that goods prices

are “sticky,” i.e., adjust only slowly in response to changes in conditions. It differs from

many previous efforts in this genre, however, in three ways. First, the gradual price-

adjustment specification satisfies the strict version of the natural-rate hypothesis. Second,

the modeled economy is open to international trade of goods and securities. And, third,

individuals’ utility functions do not feature time-separability, but instead depart in a

manner that reflects habit formation.

       This last feature is specified as follows. A typical agent desires at t to maximize

Et(Ut + βUt+1 + …), where the within-period measure Ut is specified as



Mechanism.


                                              29
(61)                Ut = exp(vt)(σ /(σ -1))[Ct/Ct-1h](σ-1)/σ + (1-γ)-1[Mt/Pt]1-γ.

Here Ct is a CES consumption index, Mt/Pt is real domestic money balances, vt is a

stochastic preference shock, and h is a parameter satisfying 0≤h<1. With h = 0,

preferences feature intertemporal separability, but with h>0 there exists “habit formation”

that makes consumption demand less volatile.

           The open-economy aspect of the model is one in which produced goods may be

consumed in the home economy or sold abroad. Imports are exclusively raw materials,

used as inputs in a production process that combines these materials and labor according

to a CES production function. Capital accumulation is not modeled endogenously, but

securities are traded internationally. The relative price of imports in terms of domestic

goods, i.e., the real exchange rate, affects the demand for exports and imports, the latter

in a explicit maximizing fashion. Nominal exchange rates and the home country one-

period nominal interest rate are related in the M-N model by a version of uncovered

interest parity that realistically includes a stochastic and highly variable “risk premium”

term (as in Taylor (1993b) and many multi-country econometric models). That

relationship is eliminated, however, in the present application.

           Price adjustments conform to the P-bar model, mentioned above, but with

capacity output y t now treated as a variable that depends upon raw material inputs and

the state of technology, the latter driven by an exogenous stochastic shock that enters

production in a labor-augmenting fashion.30 As mentioned above, price adjustment

behavior implies Et-1 ~y t = α ~y t-1, so application of the unconditional expectation operator

yields E ~y t = αE ~y t and with α ≠ 0 this implies E ~y t = 0 regardless of the monetary policy


30
     As mentioned above, we treat capital as exogenously determined.


                                                     30
rule employed. This strict natural-rate property is not a feature of the Calvo-Rotemberg

or Fuhrer-Moore models of price adjustment. Indeed, there are very few sticky-price

models that have the natural rate property, the only other one that I know of being Gray-

Fischer style nominal contracts that imply limited persistence of ~y t magnitudes.

         The foregoing paragraphs should provide the reader with a broad qualitative

overview of the basic M-N model. Quantitatively, the model is calibrated by reference to

empirical relationships estimated in various studies with U.S. data.31 In terms of

openness, a crucial consideration in the present context, the U.S. economy is of course

quite similar to Japan or to Euroland (i.e., the members of the European monetary union).

For a complete description of the model, the reader may consult McCallum and Nelson

(1996b), with an additional price-adjustment variant described in McCallum (1999a).32

         Our objective now is to combine the M-N model with policy rule (51),33 generate

rational expectations solutions, and then characterize the effects of monetary policy on

the behavior of inflation and the output gap ~y t. In considering policy effects, we shall

devote some attention to the unsystematic (shock) component et, but will place more

emphasis on the systematic part of policy behavior since in practice it accounts for most

of the variability of policy instruments.34 In this analysis use will be made of impulse

response functions and also stochastic simulations. In these simulations, all constant

terms are set to equal zero—a standard practice in work of this type—so the standard

deviation of ∆pt can be interpreted as the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) value of

31
   Notably, the value of 0.8 for h in (61) was estimated by Fuhrer (1998).
32
   One small change effected in the latter reference and utilized here is to use 0.95 rather than 1.00 for the
autoregressive coefficient in AR(1) processes generating technology and foreign income shocks.
33
   For the standard deviation of the policy shock term et, I have used 0.01. This is much larger than is
estimated for actual policy rules with an Rt instrument, but is only one-fourth as large as standard
deviations of ∆st for major economies under current policy regimes.



                                                      31
∆pt - π* and the standard deviation of ~y t as the RMSE value of yt - y t. In all cases, the

reported magnitudes are mean values (of standard deviations) averaged over 100

replications, with each run pertaining to a sample period of 200 quarters (after 53 start-up

periods are discarded). Calculation of the RE solutions are conducted using the algorithm

of Paul Klein (1997).

           A first set of results is presented in Table 2. There for each µ1, µ2 combination,

the three reported values are standard deviations of ∆pt, ~y t, and ∆st, respectively. Going

down each column we see that increases in the feedback policy coefficient µ1 serve to

decrease the variability of inflation around its (implicit) target value. Similarly, in each

row we see that increases in µ2 typically decrease the variability of ~y t, although not

strongly in the region 0 < µ2 < 1. Simultaneously, increases in µ2 serve to increase the

variability of inflation over most of the range considered. Thus it is clear that the

systematic component of monetary policy is relevant for inflation and output gap

stabilization in the ZLB situation under analysis, much as is the case with more familiar

policy rule studies.

           A more graphic way to represent the stabilizing effects of the policy rule is by

means of impulse response functions. Several figures presented below plot responses of

yt (not ~y t), pt, ∆pt, qt, st, and Rt to a unit realization of various shocks appearing in the

system.35 In Figure 2A, responses to a unit realization of the vt taste shock (see equation

(61)) are reported for policy rule parameter values of µ1 = 1 and µ2 = 1. In Figure 2B the

experiment is the same except that µ1 is increased to 10, reflecting a much stronger


34
     For an argument to this effect—but presuming an interest rate instrument—see McCallum (1999a).
35
     Here and below qt denotes the log of the real exchange rate.


                                                    32
monetary policy reaction to departures of inflation from its target level. A comparison of

the lower left-hand panels of these two figures shows that the response of inflation to the

shock is greatly muted by the stronger policy reaction represented in the second case.

Also, the middle right-hand panels reveal clearly the stronger reaction of the ∆st

instrument in this case.

         Some readers may be surprised by the negative response of pt to a positive

realization of vt. There is no clear-cut reason to believe that anything is logically amiss in

the model, for the behavior of pt to a real shock in any dynamic optimizing framework

depends in subtle ways on details of the specification.36 There are, however, some

aspects of the model at hand that are not fully consistent with the time series properties of

important macroeconomic variables. Most prominent of the failures, perhaps, is the

rather small amount of inflation persistence in the basic M-N model.37 In McCallum

(1999a), this problem is attacked by replacing the P-bar price adjustment relation (53)

with the following:

(62)              ∆pt = 0.5 Et ∆pt+1 + 0.5 ∆pt-1 + α1 ~y t + ut.

The latter, which is similar but not identical to the specification of Fuhrer and Moore

(1995), 38 imparts a good bit of persistence to the inflation process as can be seen readily

from the lower left-hand panels in parts A and B of Figure 3.

         Table 3 and Figures 3A and 3B report results analogous to those presented

previously for the M-N model with the P-bar price adjustment relation. In the version

with (62) replacing (53) the qualitative conclusions are much the same: the variability of

36
   In the present model, the response of ∆pt to vt > 0 would be positive if vt were an AR(1) process with
autocorrelation coefficient of 0.5.
37
   There is some persistence of ∆pt shown in Figure 2, which is not the case for several prominent models
with sticky price levels (see Nelson (1998)), but not much.


                                                    33
πt and ~y t is smaller with larger values of µ1 and µ2, respectively. The figures in Table 3

suggest that inflation variability is quite weakly responsive to µ1, but the main reason for

this finding is that a sizeable fraction of the inflation variability is directly due to the

presence of the ut shock term in the price adjustment rule (62). That component of the

variance of ∆pt is only slightly affected by policy. The standard deviation of the output

gap, by contrast, appears slightly more responsive to µ2 in Table 3 than in Table 2.

           Figures 3A and 3B present impulse response functions for cases analogous to

those in Figures 2A and 2B, i.e., cases with µ1 = 1 and µ1 = 10, respectively (µ2 = 1.0 in

both cases). The lower left-hand panels show that the muting of ∆pt responses to this

particular taste shock is quite slight, although definitely perceptible. The exchange rate

(instrument) reactions are, of course, much larger in the part B panels. Of most interest

in these figures, probably, are the inflation responses—for two reasons. First, inflation

now rises in response to a positive vt realization, in contrast with Figure 2. Second, the

shape of the impulse response function suggests that there is considerable persistence of

inflation in the model at hand—which in fact there is.

           To conclude this section, let us turn to the unsystematic component of monetary

policy—i.e., et shocks. The results are shown in Figures 4 and 5, the former pertaining to

the basic M-N model and the latter to the variant with price-adjustment equation (62).

Part A of each figure has µ1 = 1.0, µ2 = 1.0 and part B has µ1 = 10.0, µ2 = 1.0. In these

figures we see that the strength of policy reaction to ∆pt - π* has a major effect on the

responses of both inflation and also the output gap, with larger values of µ1 reducing ∆pt

responses sharply and yt responses considerably. Again, incidentally, inflation

38
     The present implementation follows McCallum (1999a) in setting α1 = 0.0032 and σu = 0.02.


                                                     34
persistence shows up as a property of the model with (62). All in all, our quantitative

results support the proposition that monetary policy can be effectively stabilizing even

with Rt frozen in a liquidity trap.

7.      Issues Regarding Dynamic Analysis

        In this section the object is to consider some slightly esoteric issues concerning

dynamic analysis. This discussion is included because several writers—e.g., Benhabib,

Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe (1998), Krugman (1999), and Reifschneider and Williams

(1999)—have suggested that recognition of the existence of a ZLB has drastic effects on

the dynamic properties of models that include interest-rate policy rules such as the Taylor

rule. It is my own belief that these particular effects represent theoretical curiosa that are

not relevant for practical policy analysis, even granting the possibility of a ZLB-induced

liquidity trap.39

        The argument here will be conducted in the context of a simple example. To

maintain some continuity in the face of the various topics considered in this paper, let us

adopt the model of Section 4, but simplified by elimination of government purchases and

stochastic shocks.40 Also, we now use notation such that yt and pt represent logs of

output and the price level. Finally, and merely for simplicity, we let µ2 = 0 in the Taylor

rule, making it one of the inflation-targeting variety. With those amendments, the model

(34)-(36) can be written as

(63)             yt = Etyt+1 + b0 + b1 (Rt - Et∆pt+1)

(64)             ∆pt = (1-α) ( p t-1 – pt-1) + Et-1( p t - p t-1)


39
   It should be unnecessary to mention that many accomplished theorists are likely to disagree with my
views on this particular issue.
40
   This streamlining is irrelevant for the issues at hand.


                                                    35
(65)           Rt = −b0/b1 − µ1π* + (1+µ1)∆pt.

Thus we have, as in Section 4, an expectational IS function consistent with optimizing

behavior, a price adjustment relation that features some inflation persistence yet satisfies

the natural-rate hypothesis, and a policy rule that is designed to stabilize inflation around

the target value π*.

        Before seeking a rational expectations solution, we again express (64) as

(53")          Et-1yt = αyt-1

and combine (63) with (65) as follows:

(66)           yt = Etyt+1 + b1[(1+µ1)∆pt - µ1π* - Et∆pt+1].

In this system (53″),(66) there is only one relevant state variable, yt-1, so the unique

“bubble-free” or “fundamentals” MSV solution will be of the form

(67)           yt = φ10 + φ11yt-1

(68)           ∆pt = φ20 + φ21yt-1

and it is clear from (53") that φ10 = 0 with φ11 = α.41 Substitution of Etyt+1 = α(αyt-1) and

Et∆pt+1 = φ20 + φ21(αyt-1) into (66), followed by application of the undetermined

coefficients (UC) logic, yields the following solution for inflation:

(69)           ∆pt = π* + [α(1-α)/b1(1+µ1-α)] yt-1.

Thus ∆pt equals π* on average and would fluctuate around that value if stochastic shocks

were included in the system.

        Suppose, however, that in obtaining a solution the analyst specified that ∆pt-1 is a

relevant state variable, even though it appears nowhere in the system (63), (53″), (65).

Then instead of (68) we would have




                                              36
(70)             ∆pt = φ20 + φ21yt-1 + φ22∆pt-1.

Again (53") would imply that yt = αyt-1, but application of the UC procedure would now

imply that the solution value for φ22 is either 0 or 1 +µ1. Thus for ∆pt we would obtain

either the same solution as before, equation (69), or else

(71)             ∆pt = − µ1π* − [(1-α)/b1] yt-1 + (1+µ1)∆pt-1.

The latter gives π* as the steady-state value of inflation (when yt = 0 and ∆pt = ∆p), but

with µ1 > 0 as suggested by Taylor the dynamic behavior of ∆pt would be explosive. If

the system “begins” with ∆pt-1 > π*, inflation will increase explosively; if the initial value

is less than π* then it will approach −∞, according to (71).42

        In the absence of a ZLB, ∆pt → −∞ would be ruled out as a solution path in a

complete version of the model because it would violate a transversality condition

necessary for optimizing behavior. But with recognition of a ZLB, it becomes apparent

that inflation cannot behave as specified by (71) when the ZLB is encountered. Instead,

the outcome is that ∆pt approaches the negative value b0/b1 = − r , which corresponds to

Rt → 0. Thus the Taylor rule has, in this case, failed to stabilize inflation around its

target value.43 For a graphical representation, see Figure 6, which is—so as to permit a

two-dimensional diagram—drawn for the special case with complete price flexibility

(i.e., yt = 0). If the system begins with an initial inflation rate below π*, it will approach

− r in an oscillatory fashion. In the absence of the ZLB, by contrast, inflation would




41
   It should be emphasized that yt would not be policy-invariant if the system included stochastic shocks.
42
   Here the word “begins” is put in quote marks because the MSV approach suggests that any beginning or
initial value is irrelevant.
43
   Related problems are emphasized, in a limited-participated model, by Christiano and Gust (1999).


                                                    37
approach −∞ according to (71) so a transversality condition that ruled out such a path

would lead the analyst back to (69).

         My own conclusion is quite different. It is that the last ZLB solution is not

economically relevant.44 It is a bubble solution that results from designating ∆pt-1 as a

relevant state variable even though it does not appear in the system (i.e., is in my

terminology a redundant state variable). It is my belief that emphasis on such bubble or

non-fundamental solutions constitutes a perversion of the original objectives of rational

expectations analysis.45 But in any event it can be noted that the MSV solution (69),

which clearly is a RE solution to the model at hand, is entirely well behaved so long as π*

> b0/b = - r . In Figure 6 this solution implies that ∆pt is determined at point A in each

period. With yt = 0, there are no dynamic adjustments—which is natural since there are

no shocks and no relevant state variables other than yt-1 (which equals zero in Figure 6,

though not in the more general case considered algebraically).

         Furthermore, it should also be noted that the non-MSV solution (71) implies that

inflation explodes toward +∞ if the system “begins” with a value above π*, since fully-

developed models typically include no transversality condition that would preclude such

behavior. (Again see Figure 6.) Thus if one is inclined to doubt the stabilizing property

of Taylor rules, or interest-instrument rules for inflation targeting, then this doubt should

logically exist without any regard to ZLB considerations!

         The foregoing analysis is not specific to the model utilized, but applies rather

generally (I believe) to models with optimizing IS functions and either flexible prices or

44
  Woodford (1999, Sect. 3) also argues that the solution of the previous paragraph is unlikely to prevail in
actual economies, but his reasoning is different and will often lead to conclusions that do not agree with
mine.

forward-looking price adjustment specifications.46 In particular, it would apply to price

adjustment relations of the Calvo-Rotemberg type or the more general form (62). I have

not used either of these in the foregoing example for expositional convenience: the

former gives a MSV solution with no relevant state variables—a case that is

expositionally confusing as well as dull—while the latter leads to a cubic expression for

the counterpart of the coefficient φ22 in (70) and is therefore difficult to work with

analytically (although the analysis is quite manageable in numerical systems such as

those of Section 6).

8.       Conclusion

         We conclude with a brief overview. The present paper has explored a number of

distinct theoretical issues that are relevant to recent discussions regarding the possibility

of a zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates and the implications of such a

bound for monetary policy in regimes with low inflation. First, the paper seeks to spell

out an explicit theoretical rationale for the idea that a ZLB may exist and indicates that its

validity depends upon the assumption that it is costless at the margin to store money (the

economy’s medium of exchange). It is argued that the foregoing assumption is probably

not correct, strictly speaking, so that negative interest rates are possible. But the

quantitative extent of the phenomenon is almost certainly very small. Second, an

investigation is conducted of the extent to which the absence of superneutrality will lead

to an increase in the steady-state real rate of interest as steady-state inflation is reduced




45
   The second objective, in addition to ruling out the possibility of persistently-maintained expectational
errors, was to provide an objective list—dictated by the model—of relevant determinants of expectations.
46
   The specification used on pp. 7-10 of Reifschneider and Williams (1999) includes IS and price-
adjustment relations that are entirely backward looking.


                                                     39
(and turned negative) by sustained policy. The conclusion based on a quantitative

overlapping generations model is that this effect is unlikely to be of much importance in

the context of stabilization issues, although it is of considerable theoretical relevance as it

suggests that real rates would rise sufficiently to keep an economy’s steady-state nominal

rate positive even with sizeable rates of deflation. Next, the analysis returns to models

with the property of real-interest invariance to maintained inflation and explores the

suitability of the common practice of conducting monetary policy analysis in models with

no monetary variables. It is argued that this practice is almost certainly unjustified in a

strict sense, but again the quantitative magnitude of the omitted effects is estimated to be

very small.

       The most important analysis, from the perspective of current policy issues, is that

of Sections 5 and 6. In the former it is shown analytically that even if short run nominal

interest rates are fixed at zero, there nevertheless exits a route for monetary policy actions

to exert stabilizing effects on inflation and output (relative to capacity). This route,

available in any economy that is open to foreign trade of goods and securities, works by a

policy rule that adjusts the rate of depreciation of the exchange rate, acting in the role of

an instrument variable, so as to meet stabilization objectives. The analysis presumes that

strict uncovered interest parity does not prevail on a period by period basis, a

presumption for which there is much empirical justification. Then in Section 6 the

quantitative magnitude of this stabilization strategy is investigated by means of

simulations with a small but complete macroeconomic model, one that is designed to be

consistent with optimizing analysis and calibrated to U.S. quarterly data. The results




                                              40
suggest that the extent of stabilization that can be obtained by this exchange-rate

approach is substantial.

       Finally, recent warnings concerning some alarming theoretical results, obtained

with Taylor-style policy rules in optimizing models that recognize the existence of a

ZLB, are reconsidered. It is argued that these anomalous and undesirable effects obtain

only when non-fundamental “bubble” solutions are considered despite the existence of

fundamental solutions. Consequently, it is suggested—but not established

conclusively—that the empirical relevance of such effects is highly dubious.

Furthermore, if bubble solutions are considered then undesirable outcomes occur even if

there is no ZLB.
