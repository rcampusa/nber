                                           ABSTRACT

In 2011, Colombia instituted a tax on repayment of bank loans, thereby increasing the cost of
short-term bank credit more than long-term credit. Firms responded by cutting their short-term
loans for liquidity management purposes and increasing their use of cash and trade credit. In
industries where trade credit is more accessible (based on U.S. Compustat firms), we find
substitution into accounts payable and little effect on cash and investment. Where trade credit is
less available, firms increase cash and cut investment. Thus, trade credit offers a substitute source
of liquidity that can insulate some firms from bank liquidity shocks.

I. INTRODUCTION

         How do firms respond when bank liquidity dries up? In most economies, banks pre-

dominate as suppliers of liquidity and payments mechanisms between counter-parties. Demand

deposits and credit lines (or, equivalently, very short-term loans) are fundamental payments

products supplied almost uniquely by banks (Kasyhap, Rajan and Stein, 2002; Gatev and

Strahan, 2009). Many firms use credit lines both to make payments and to smooth out liquidity

needs over time, drawing funds when payments need to be made (i.e., making payroll or paying

for supplies) and re-paying those funds when payments are received (i.e., after realizing sales

receipts). Demand deposits and credit lines differ mainly in that the latter include a credit aspect

(they are not pre-funded by the customer), whereas the former do not. Firms with limited access

to lines of credit use deposits (out of their buffer stock of cash) to make payments, and they use

trade credit with suppliers and customers to smooth payments over time. 1

         This paper offers a clean and well-identified setting to estimate how firms respond to a

negative shock to very short-term bank loans. We show that firms substitute into cash and trade

credit as alternative sources of liquidity. In industries where trade credit is less available, the

increase in cash is large and leads to cuts in investment. In contrast, in industries with better

access to trade credit, firms increase accounts payable but neither their cash balances nor

investment change after the shock. Together, these results have two implications. First, cash is a

costly substitute for bank liquidity facilities. Holding cash can be costly, both because cash


1
  Banks also supply term loans as a source of credit to firms, usually structuring them with a short-maturity as a key
contracting tool to help solve information and monitoring problems. Outside of real estate and other projects
collateralizable by hard assets, most bank loans are short term, thus requiring borrowers to roll them over frequently.
This discipline in turn provides banks the option to restrict or deny credit, thereby improving borrower ex ante
incentives. Diamond (1991) offers the seminal theoretical treatment of debt maturity and argues that small and
information-intensive firms are often only able to borrow short-term. Stohs and Mauer (1996) provide empirical
support for this prediction.

                                                          1
yields low, after-tax returns and because cash exacerbates agency problems (Jensen (1986); Yun,

(2009)). Moreover, when external funds are costlier than internal, firms needing to raise their

stock of cash (because short-term bank credit has become expensive) must draw funds away

from investment. 2 Second, for some industries trade credit offers liquidity services that can

substitute for bank-provided liquidity without distorting real decisions (investment).

         The empirical setting is Colombia, whose two unique institutional features we exploit to

identify how an increase in the cost of – or, equivalently, a decrease in the supply of – bank

liquidity affects firms. First, in Colombia bank liquidity is more available for ‘preferential

clients,’ those with annual sales above a specific sales cutoff set by banks, than it is for smaller

firms. The large preferential firms have access to Treasury Facilities, which are very short-term

extensions of credit from banks that allow firms to manage their liquidity needs. Large firms use

these facilities to make payments but not to finance real investment (due to their very short

maturity). Smaller firms also have access to bank credit lines for liquidity management, but

these come with much more restricted access and tighter covenants. 3 Second, in 2011 Colombia

initiated a new law that taxed each re-payment on any bank loan. The change made short-

maturity Treasury Facilities and other very short-term debt instruments prohibitively expensive,




2
  Sufi (2009) argues that many firms, in fact, must self-insure against liquidity shocks because their access to credit
lines is limited by low cash flow, a key contractual control mechanism that banks use to monitor their borrowers.
Credit lines expose banks to substantial credit risk as well as liquidity risk because firms may want to draw funds
when cash flow is low due to poor fundamentals. Cash-flow based covenants help lenders alleviate this risk, but also
imply that lines do not provide firms insurance against low cash flow in bad states. In fact, Lins et al (2010) survey
CFOs from the largest firms across 29 countries and conclude that credit lines are a more important source of liquidity
than cash among their sampled firms, but also that firms will simultaneously hold cash buffers to self-insure against
bad states. Thus, credit lines are often used to allow firms to take advantage of future uncertain investment
opportunities.
3
 Small firms can also access short-term debt (say a 30-day loan), but supply is more constrained and conditions (rates,
collateral, covenant) less favorable. Operationally, firms with sales below the sales threshold would bank out of a
branch office; in contrast, firms with higher sales are assigned to a loan officer/account manager who gives this
customer preferential treatment.

                                                          2
but had little effect on the cost of long-term bank loans (due to the very low rate of 0.4%). Since

the tax shock had a much greater effects on large firms (i.e. those with more access to very short

term debt), we identify the causal effect of shocks to bank-supplied liquidity from the shift in the

relationship between firm size and short-term bank debt for firms above the sales cutoff. The

identification strategy, a modified regression-kink design (RKD), works like a heterogeneous

treatment effects model.

       We report three core results. First, there is a strong ‘first stage’ relationship between

large-firms’ use of short-term bank credit and the tax shock. In other words, the use of short-

term bank borrowing for liquidity among large firms falls sharply after the 2011 tax shock; in

contrast, there is very little change among small firms. Second, the decline leads to an increase

in both trade credit and cash. Accounts receivable and accounts payable increase after 2011,

with the increase being larger for firms more exposed to the tax shock. The result suggests

substitution between these two payments technologies: trade credit and cash. As we discuss

below, trade credit offers a payments mechanism for firms that can avoid the punitive tax regime

discouraging the use of bank credit lines.

       Third, we test for real effects. The decline in bank liquidity has a small effect on real

investment that is not statistically robust (and the decline has no effect on profits). But this effect

varies by industry. For firms in industry segments where trade credit is relatively available, we

find a large substitution into trade credit and no investment response. Moreover, the substitution

to trade credit seems complete, as there is no change in cash for firms in these sectors. Firms in

industries with greater frictions in the supply of trade credit, however, experience both a large

increase in cash and a decline in investment (but no change in trade credit). Thus, in these




                                                  3
segments the decline in bank liquidity spills over to real decisions because firms need to increase

their buffer stock of cash to manage liquidity. The increase displaces investment.

         In contrast to the extant literature, our shock – discussed in detail in Section II – focuses

very precisely on banks’ role as liquidity providers. Most existing studies test how shocks that

affect banks’ cost of funds (e.g. monetary policy), or bank solvency (e.g. bank failures, as in

Peek and Rosengren, 2000), or the supply to banks of local deposits (e.g. Becker, 2007; Gilje et

al, 2016) propagate to non-financial firms. These kinds of shocks affect both the

liquidity/payments role of banks and the credit-production role, thus making it hard to unpack

which aspect of banking (credit or liquidity) is affecting which outcomes for firms. We know of

no existing study that can isolate a shock to the payments/liquidity role alone. As we explain in

detail below, the tax shock in our setting increases the cost of short-term bank credit

substantially, but it has little effect on the cost of longer-term bank credit. We find that trade

credit can substitute for the liquidity-provision role of banks in some industries, consistent with

Fisman and Love (2003), who show that poor financial development constrains growth less in

industries that can substitute toward trade credit. Our setting differs because we have an

exogenous shock to bank liquidity supply within a well-developed (bank-based) financial

system. 4

         Our results on investment suggest that most of the documented real effects from bank

shocks occur because of disturbances to their credit role, even though many shocks themselves

originate from liquidity problems. As we have argued, most of this literature considers cases


4
  Most existing studies of banks as liquidity suppliers focus on why banks combine deposits with credit lines (e.g.
Kashyap, et al, 2002; Gatev and Strahan, 2006; Gatev, Schuerman and Strahan, 2009) and how lines are used, but do
not explore substitution into trade credit, as we do. See also Jimenez, Lopez and Suarez, 2009, Ivashina and
Scharfstein, 2010, Campello, et al, 2013. For a survey on the use of bank credit line by non-financial firms to manage
liquidity, see Demiroglu and James (2011).

                                                          4
where drawing a bright line between credit and liquidity is difficult. The 2007-2008 Financial

Crisis illustrates on a grand scale how difficult such a separation can be, as solvency shocks

metastasized when amplified by illiquidity, leading to a massive reduction in both bank credit

and liquidity, followed by an economic disaster (e.g., Brunnermeier, 2009; Ivashina and

Scharfstein, 2010). Much of the banking and macroeconomics literature has focused on the

importance of banks as suppliers of both liquidity and credit to firms, but without a way to

separate the two roles. 5 To take a specific example of how hard that separation can be, consider

Merrouche and Nier (2010), who study a shock that improves bank payments systems. The paper

finds that following payments innovations (in several Eastern European countries), funds flowed

into banks, which in turn used those funds to expand credit. Our empirical setting is again

different because it allows us to focus on the liquidity role alone, with little feedback to the credit

role of banks. 6 We find that many firms can attain this liquidity via firm-to-firm trade credit

without constraining their operating decisions.

           We also contribute to the literature on trade credit by cleanly tracing out how firms

respond to a well-identified increase in trade credit demand originating from a shock to their

banks. Early studies, such as Petersen and Rajan (1997), rely on reduced form links from firm

characteristics to accounts payable and receivable, making it hard to sort out demand v. supply

side effects. More recent papers, in contrast, attempt to identify one side or the other. Amberg et

al. (2016), for example, use the failure of Panaxia – a Swedish cash-in-transit firm - as a

plausibly exogenous shock to liquidity demand for firms exposed to the failure. They find that



5
 In fact, Rajan (1998) describes how those two roles jointly evolved in medieval European banking, whereby money
changers began using their ‘float’ from customers needing payments services to provide credit to other customers.
This history illustrates the tight link between the liquidity and credit roles of banks.
6
    In fact, there is no change in aggregate deposits in the Colombian banking system after 2011.

                                                            5
this shock leads to increases in the use of trade credit and declines in firms’ cash balances.

Using shocks to payment terms in the French trucking industry, Barrot (2016) finds that firms

substitute into cash when trade credit supply declines. Breza and Lieberman (2016), using a

similar restriction on trade credit terms among Chilean retailers, also find a decline in trade credit

accompanied by an increase in vertical integration.

       A number of existing studies emphasize the relative substitutability of banks v. trade

creditors. Both Wilner (2000) and Cunat (2007) argue that trade creditors have advantages over

banks in enforcement and in renegotiation. Burkart and Ellingsen (2004) argue that trade

creditors have an advantage over banks because they directly supply goods rather than cash,

which unlike goods is uniquely vulnerable to diversion (i.e. theft). But none of these studies

trace out how shocks to banks affect trade credit, as we do. Similar to our study, Garcia-

Appendini and Montoriol-Garriga (2013) find indirect evidence of substitution, in that firms with

relatively high cash extend more trade credit and constrained firms use more trade credit during

the financial crisis. The interpretation is complicated, however, because high-cash firms also

were better able to sustain investment after the crisis (Duchin, Ozbas and Sensoy, 2010), and

because the crisis affected both bank liquidity and credit supply as well as investment demand.

Our study differs in that we examine a specific decline in bank-supplied liquidity from the tax

shock, as opposed to a broad credit shock like the crisis, with limited spillovers to potential

confounds such as changing investment opportunities.

       In the next section, we describe the specifics of our institutional setting. Section III

outlines the research design and identification, the data, and the results. We conclude briefly in

Section IV.

II. COLOMBIAN BAD TAXES, THE 2011 CHANGE, AND TAX AVOIDANCE
        For several reasons, Colombia offers an interesting setting to assess the importance of

bank loans for firm liquidity management. First, the 2011 tax change that we describe below

offers a clean shock to the cost of using bank credit for liquidity purposes. Second, Colombia is

a bank-centric economy with limited alternatives for liquidity in other parts of the financial

system, such as what the commercial paper market would offer to large, public firms in the U.S.

Third, we have access to detailed financial statements data on a large, representative sample of

firms in Colombia, both before and after the tax shock, which allows us to observe within-firm

changes in cash management, financial policies, investment and profits.

        The 2011 tax shock emerged out of the bank account debit tax (BAD), adopted in

Colombia in 1999 amid a weak economy, an unhealthy financial system, and low fiscal

revenues. 7 Under the original legislation, all debits from bank accounts generate a tax liability.

That is, BAD taxes affected withdrawals from bank accounts, including check clearances,

electronic transfers, ATM cash withdrawals, loan payments (but, until 2011, firms could evade

the tax on loan re-payments) and most other transactions that involve debiting money from a

bank account. 8

        The tax rate started at 0.2% per transaction and increased to 0.3% in 2001. The rate

increased again in 2004, to its current level of 0.4%. Over time, firms and households found

ways to avoid the tax. For example, payments made outside the banking system do not pay the


7
  Other countries have implemented similar taxes on bank transactions (e.g. Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador,
Hungary, Peru and Venezuela). In the U.S., a two cent tax on bank checks was imposed during the Spanish-American
war at the end of the nineteenth century, and then from June 1932 through December 1934. Lastrapes and Selgin
(1997) document how the Hoover administration adopted the tax in the early 1930s when “faced with a dramatic
collapse in income tax revenues.”
8
 Prior to 2011 firms could use funds held in investment accounts (e.g. a money market fund) to dispense the loan
principal payment to the bank without incurring the tax. The 2011 law change eliminated the ability to use this
mechanism to avoid the tax on loan payments.

                                                        7
BAD tax. Figure 1 shows the general effect of the advent of tax arbitrage by plotting BAD tax

receipts (relative to GDP) over time. As economic agents learn how to avoid the tax, collections

gradually decline. In fact, Arbeláez et al. (2002) document a significant increase in the use of

currency relative to bank deposits following the introduction of the tax, which is the easiest way

to avoid it. They also show a decrease in the number of checks cleared after the tax, and checks

would often circulate for many payments and with multiple endorsements before finally clearing

(and thus being taxed). Restrepo (2016) shows that this dis-intermediation in the Colombian

economy after 1999 reduced bank credit production, which in turn harmed financially dependent

firms. Thus, as with most of the current banking literature, the original BAD tax affected both

the liquidity and credit roles of banks.

          Prior to 2011, large firms could – and did – use Treasury Facilities (essentially very

short-term bank loans) to make payments without incurring the BAD tax. Payors would borrow

funds and deposit those funds directly into the recipient’s bank account, thereby avoiding a bank

account withdrawal and thus any tax. When the loan was due, firms would dispense the loan

payment using an investment account, also avoiding paying the tax on the repayment. The 2011

law stopped this practice. 9 As can be seen in Figure 1, the change worked, as BAD tax receipts

jumped by about 1/3 after the law change (from 0.59% to 0.82% of GDP in 2010 and 2011

respectively) without the need to increase the statutory tax rate, which has remained at 0.4%

since 2004.

          The easiest way to understand the effect of the tax change is with an example. Consider a

firm purchasing $10 million in supplies. Payment options include: 1) an immediate cash




9
    Law 1430 of December 29th, 2010.

                                                   8
disbursement from funds withdrawn from the firm’s checking account; 2) the use of trade credit

(with, say, up to 30 days to pay); or, 3) the use of funds borrowed from a Treasury Facility.

Under the tax regime prior to 2011, the firm would pay a tax of $40,000 (0.4% times $10

million) using either cash or trade credit because either mechanism would require a debit of $10

million from the firm’s checking account. The difference between the two comes down to

timing: with cash, payment would be immediate; with trade credit, a firm could make the

payment any time over the subsequent 30 days. The second option – trade credit – would allow

the firm to time its payment to coincide with its sales receipts, thus lowering the optimal balance

in its checking account. 10 Note that the tax burden depends on the flow of payments through the

checking account, not the level (or buffer stock) held in the account itself. The firm, however,

could avoid the tax entirely before 2011 by borrowing the $10 million from a Treasury Facility

and having the payment deposited directly into the supplier’s bank. Firms with access to these

facilities would choose them to avoid the transaction tax.

           In 2011, the Colombian Government eliminated the third option to use funds borrowed

from a bank, such as a Treasury Facility, to avoid the BAD tax. This change occurred both

because banks could no longer put borrowed funds directly into a third-party’s account, and

because borrowers would incur the tax when those funds were later re-paid to the bank. Thus,

after 2011 borrowing $10 million from the bank for a payment would incur two taxes because

these funds first would go into the borrower’s checking account (and hence incur the BAD tax

when the supplier gets paid), and a second time when the loan comes due. Given the change,

firms are now better off either paying suppliers immediately from cash (i.e. from their checking

account), or using trade credit. Both would incur a one-time tax payment because the firm would


10
     Trade credit has costs as well, which we are leaving out for illustrative purposes.

                                                              9
have to debit the same $10 million from its account to pay the supplier eventually, thereby

incurring the same $40,000 tax (ignoring the small effect of time-value of funds). However,

trade credit would have the advantage of allowing the firm to time its payments to coincide with

incoming sales receipts. Thus, we would expect that firm demand for trade credit would

increase after 2011 to improve its ability to smooth payments and conserve on its holdings of a

cash buffer stock (i.e. accounts payable would rise). Market clearing dictates that the increase in

trade credit demand generates and equivalent increase in trade credit supplied, so accounts

receivable also should increase.

       As we will show, the tax law change in 2011 encouraged firms to switch away from bank

loans for payments and to increase the use of trade credit (or, if not available, cash). However,

as we have argued, the change had little effect on the cost of long-term credit from banks. The

tax change also had no effect on the other side of the banking system’s balance sheet (hence

there is no reason to expect the supply of longer-term loans to change); nor did it have a large

effect on the cost of using bank debt to finance investment directly.

       Figure 2 illustrates this latter point. We graph the increase in borrowing cost on an

annualized basis as a function of a loan’s maturity. Since borrowers must pay the 0.4% tax for

every loan re-payment, it affects the ‘all-in’ cost of debt most for very short maturity loans. For

instance, consider the annualized cost for an 8% (APR) loan, roughly the average rate for a bank

loan in Colombia. At a maturity of five days, the all-in cost annualizes to 37.25% (= [(1 + 8.0%

× 5/365) × (1 + 0.4%) – 1] × (365/5)); in contrast, the ‘all-in’ cost for a 1-year loan comes to just

8.4% (= [(1 + 8.0% × 365/365) * (1 + 0.4%) –1] × (365/365)). By the time maturity gets beyond

60 days, the effect of the tax is small (Figure 2). At maturity of one year, the tax falls to just

0.4%, a five percent increase in the average interest rate on a bank loan in Colombia; for longer

                                                  10
loans the effect is even smaller. And, the tax clearly had a major impact on the use of bank

liquidity. Aggregate issuance of bank loans for liquidity management to preferential customers –

Treasury Facilities – falls nearly to zero at exactly the time that the tax goes into effect (Figure

3).



III. RESEARCH DESIGN, DATA AND RESULTS


Research Design & Identification
        As explained above, we exploit two unique features of the Colombian financial system.

First, firms with sales above a size threshold of COP 15,000 million have access to Treasury

Facilities, which expands their access to short-term bank loans for payments uses. 11 Smaller

firms do sometimes use bank credit lines to make payments, but these are more limited in the

amount committed and come with tighter contractual restrictions (e.g., covenants) compared to

the Treasury Facilities. Thus, small firms self-insure by holding higher cash stocks (i.e. bank

deposits) as a store of liquidity to make payments. Second, the tax change in 2011 substantially

raised the cost to large firms of using the Treasury Facilities because their maturity is typically

very short (normally under one month). Use would generate a BAD tax liability because the tax

comes due when funds get repaid. The 2011 tax change thus should have reduced the use of

bank liquidity both from credit lines and Treasury Facilities, and that effect should increase with

firm size for firms above the sales cutoff (because only large firms had access to Treasury


11
   Different banks have used different sales thresholds to classify firms into ‘small and medium enterprises’ and
‘corporate’ clients. For the top five banks in Colombia: Bancolombia, Banco de Bogota, Davivienda, Banco de
Occidente and Banco Polular, the threshold in 2010 ranged between COP 15,000 million for both Bancolombia and
Banco de Occidente, to COP 20,000 for Banco de Bogota and Davivienda. Since firms above COP 15,000 could
access the portfolio of ‘corporate’ financial products from at least one bank, we use the lower bound of the range as
our threshold. Together the top five banks in Colombia account for over 60% of total assets in the banking system.
The annual sales threshold of COP 15,000 million is approximately equivalent to $5 million.

                                                         11
Facilities). This effect can be seen clearly in the left panels of Figure 4, where we plot the

annual flow of bank loans with maturity under 60 days (per dollar of assets) against firm sales

(Figure 4A) and against log of firm sales (Figure 4B) from 2008 to 2010. 12 For firms below the

sales cutoff, the annual issuance of these short-term loans is just 1.6% of assets, versus 5.2% for

firms above the cutoff. Above the size threshold, short-term debt increases with sales (and log

sales) because access to Treasury Facilities improves with firm size.

         We aim to identify the causal effect of a negative shock to short-term bank debt for

liquidity on firm financial and real decisions. One might be tempted to use the kink illustrated in

Figure 4 to generate identification from the slope change around the sales-size threshold, as in a

standard Regression Kink Design (RKD). This strategy works well in settings in which kinks

emerge exogenously. For example, Card et al. (2012) exploit policy rules in unemployment-

insurance programs in which the source of the slope-change comes from non-linearities in

benefits formulas. 13 In our setting, we would need to assume that the slope steepens around the

kink only because liquidity-supply constraints loosen with size. But firm liquidity depends also

on demand. What if part of the variation above the cutoff represents larger firms’ greater

demand for liquidity, compared to that of smaller ones? To avoid making strong assumptions

about liquidity demand, we exploit the 2011 tax. The change made short-maturity Treasury

Facilities prohibitively expensive, as a borrower would incur the tax each time it repaid the

amount borrowed. In fact, the aggregate issuance of Treasury Facilities declines by a staggering

73% right after the tax law was introduced (recall Figure 3). Since large firms have increased



12
  Our data do not allow us to separate out Treasury Facilities from other loans at the firm level; hence, we use loans
with maturity under 60 days as a close proxy for them.
13
   In another context, Scharlemann and Shore (2016) use kinks in the rules for principal reduction under the Home
Affordable Modification Program (HAMP’s) to infer the causal effect of debt forgiveness on default.

                                                         12
access to these credit facilities, the 2011 tax change mattered most to firms above the sales

threshold, and its impact increased with sales size thereafter. Thus, firms above the threshold

should have reduced their use of Treasury Facilities for liquidity purposes, and the decrease

should have increased with size. Comparing the left and right panels of Figure 4 illustrates this

pattern exactly, as the relationship between sales and short-term loans flattens beyond the kink

after 2011.

       We exploit these two unique features – represented in Figures 3 and 4 – to build an

excludable instrument based strictly on the slope change above the sales-size threshold due to the

2011 tax law. The instrument equals a triple interaction between firm (log) sales, an indicator

equal to one for firms above the cutoff before the tax change (reflecting the increased slope

above the cutoff), and an indicator equal to one after the 2011 tax change (reflecting the slope’s

flattening). The flattening reflects the increasing cost of using Treasury Facilities and other very

short-term bank debt due to the tax in the post-2011 period. Our identification strategy requires

that the flattening reflect only the tax change (as opposed to some other change related to firm

size that might reflect liquidity demand). If true, then our instrument passes the exclusion

restriction. As usual, the exclusion restriction is not directly testable. But we do show no

changes in the sales/short-term bank loan link prior to 2011. This test acts like a test for parallel

trends that has become standard when researchers use difference-in-differences methods

(Roberts and Whited, 2012).

       Given these features, we estimate a first-stage equation with the following general

structure:




                                                 13

where 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 equals the flow of loans with maturity under 60 days used during the year, divided

by total assets at the beginning of the year. 14

          We include both firm (αi) and time (γt) fixed effects in all models to control for

unobserved heterogeneity across firms as well as macro-economic shocks affecting all firms.

AboveCutOffi equals a time-invariant indicator for firms whose average annual sales exceed COP

15,000 million in the pre-2011 years, which gives them access to Treasury Facilities. LnSalesi

equals firm sales size (again, time invariant using the pre-2011 period). The direct effects of

each of these variables, as well as their interactions, get absorbed by the firm fixed effects. By

using pre-2011 levels, we avoid a potential feedback from the tax change to firm outcomes. We

also allow the effects of both LnSalesi and AboveCutOffi to change after 2011 by interacting each

with Postt (= an indicator for all years after 2011). The time effects absorb the direct effect of

Postt.

          We argue that the shift in the slope in the relationship between LnSalesi and STDi

(captured by 𝛽𝛽1 in equation (1)) occurs because of the tax-law change in 2011. Moreover, this

change plausibly affects other aspects of firm financial and operating policies only through

reduced use of bank liquidity. Hence, the triple interaction term is an excludable instrument. To

test whether higher costs of short-term debt, in turn, induce other changes in firm behavior, we

estimate the following reduced form models:



14
   We are not able to observe exactly the Treasury Facilities in our firm-level data, nor are we able to observe flows
into and out of credit lines. Hence, we use issuance of very short-term bank loans as a proxy for bank liquidity.

                                                                       14

Where Yi,t represents other outcomes related to financial policies (leverage, cash and trade credit)

or operating policies (investment = capital expenditures / assets, and profit margin = earnings /

sales). Assuming the exclusion restriction holds, the coefficient on the triple interaction (𝛽𝛽1 in

equation (2)) reflects the causal effect of declines in short-term debt on these outcomes. 15

         Another way to understand our empirical strategy is as an application of a ‘natural

experiment’ research design, where the treatment comes from the 2011 tax-law change. Firms

below the size cutoff act as a pure ‘control’ sample, in that they are not affected at all by the tax

due to their inability to access Treasury Facilities, either before or after treatment. Large firms

constitute the treatment group, and we exploit heterogeneity in exposure to the treatment by

interacting size for firms above the cutoff with the post-treatment indicator.

         We report our results with three approaches. First, we report them only with firm and

time fixed effects. Second, we add six additional control variables to the right-hand side. These

include the following time-varying firm characteristics: 1) asset growth; 2) size (= log of firm

assets); 3) asset tangibility (= property, plant and equipment / assets); 4) asset turnover (= sales /

assets); 5) log of firm age; and 6) the interaction between lagged GDP growth and LnSalesi. We

measure each control as of the prior year to ensure that they are predetermined relative to the

outcome. Third, we replace the time effects with industry × time effects, where we define

industry by ISIC at the section level. This level of granularity generates 13 industry

classifications (see Appendix Table IA.2). The industry-time effects help control for industry-

  There is an equivalent representation of equation (2) as a second-stage of a 2SLS regression (since the model is
just-identified). We report just the reduced forms to streamline the exposition.

specific common shocks that might drive financial or operating decisions, such as investment

opportunities. To build standard errors, we cluster by firm.

Data

         Our firm-level sample comes from financial statements data collected by Colombia’s

Corporations Superintendence (Superintendencia de Sociedades), a government agency in charge

of overseeing privately held corporations. 16 We also obtain loan issuance for each firm from

Colombia’s central bank (Banco de la República). The sample includes annual firm-level data

between 2008 and 2013. Focusing on this period allows us to examine firm behavior for three

years before (2008-2010) and three years after (2011-2013) the tax law change. We drop utilities

(ISIC codes 40 and 41) and financial firms (ISIC codes 65 to 67) from the sample. The final

sample contains 67,212 firm-year observations corresponding to 12,649 distinct firms between

2008 and 2013. 17

         Table 1 reports summary statistics for our data, divided into two groups: firms with and

firms without access to Treasury Facilities. As expected, firms with access are larger (true by

construction). They also have more credit across all dimensions than smaller firms: more short

and long-term bank debt as well as more trade credit (both accounts receivable and payable).

Conversely, large firms hold less cash than smaller ones. These differences are as expected, but

it is worth re-emphasizing that our identification does not rely on comparing these two sets of

firms. Instead, we rely on the differential impact of the 2011 tax change across firms within the



16
   Privately held companies represent the vast majority of firms in Colombia. In 2010, for instance, there were only
92 listed firms in Colombia’s stock exchange (Bolsa de Valores de Colombia). In contrast, we have data for over
twelve thousand private firms in that same year. Public firms are not part of our dataset.
17
   The data are free from survivorship bias (records are not deleted). If a firm no longer meets the conditions set by
law requiring submission of financial statements, its data time series ends but its historical data remain.

differ much less across the two groups.

Results: First-stage Effects of Tax Change on Bank-Supplied Liquidity

        Table 2 reports our first-stage regression (Equation 1). We find a very strong effect of

the tax law change on the link (slope) between firm sales and short-term bank debt (STD) for

firms above the sales-size threshold (COP 15,000 million). We report the estimates both with

and without control variables (columns 1 & 2), and then we introduce industry × time effects

(column 3). We also report the models with a ‘placebo’ test that allows the relationship between

Log Sales and STD to flatten in 2010, one year prior to the actual change in tax rules (columns 4-

6). These latter tests are analogous to ‘parallel trends’ tests used in difference-in-differences

models, in that we are checking that the change in slope (the basis of our identification) stems

from the 2011 tax change, rather than from some other change that happens to occur around the

same time.

        Across all six models, the relationship between firm sales and STD flattens after 2011.

We focus on this flattening for firms with the greatest access to banks as liquidity suppliers –

those preferential clients who can issue Treasury Facilities to make payments. As we have

explained, this mechanism becomes prohibitively expensive after 2011; hence, there is a big

decline in STD among large firms. Essentially, these regressions replicate the graphical evidence

in Figure 3. 18 The magnitude is large: firms that are one log-point above the sales threshold (for

access to the Treasury Facilities) reduce their use of STD by 1.2-1.3% more than firms that are at




18
  In Table IA.3 in the Internet Appendix, we show that the flattening happens for loan issuance below 30 days and
between 30 and 60 days, but not for issuance of longer-term loans.

                                                        17
the threshold. The difference equals about one-third of the mean issuance of STD by firms

above the cutoff (= 0.039; see Table 1).

         We use this shift in slope to identify whether the exogenous change in usage of STD has a

causal effect on other firm financial and operating policies. In other words, we use 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 ×

𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 as the identifying instrument in Equation (2). The exclusion restriction

is plausible as long as STD changes only because of the 2011 tax-law change; since this tax had

no effect on other firm decisions, financial and operating policies should only change because of

the effects of STD on them. This assumption, while not directly testable, is supported by the

results in columns 3-6, as there is no significant flattening before 2011 (i.e. we pass the

equivalent of a ‘parallel trends’ test). 19

Results: Financing Effects

         Tables 3 and 4 link the tax shock to firm financial policies: leverage = bank debt / assets

(as well as its subcomponents, short-term bank debt/assets and long-term bank debt/assets), cash

/ assets, and trade credit (accounts payable / assets and accounts receivable / assets). We report

each set of models with three specifications, as in Table 2. Table 3, Panel A reports results for

leverage and cash; Table 3, Panel B then dis-aggregates leverage by maturity (over v. under one-

year in residual maturity). Table 4 reports results for trade credit.

         Three dimensions of financial policy change when firms cut STD for liquidity

management. First, firms borrow less from banks overall. In the leverage regressions, the



19
  We have estimated an expanded placebo test in which the slope of the relationship between LnSales and STD can
differ in each year. These models support the idea that the slope is flatter in all years after the tax shock, and in no
years before the tax shock (see table IA.4 in the Internet Appendix). We also have estimated similar placebo
regressions for the other outcomes and find similar (non) results. That is, we pass this placebo test in reduced form
analysis of operating and financial outcomes.

                                                          18
coefficient on the triple interaction - 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 × 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 - enters negatively and

significantly (Table 3, columns 1-3). Firms that are one log-point above the cutoff cut leverage

by about 1% of assets more than firms at the cutoff, which is important relative to mean leverage

of 19% for these firms (Table 1). Second, firms hold more cash after the tax change (columns 4-

6). The relative increase in cash for more-exposed firms represents about 10% of mean cash

balances for large firms. The change in the stock of cash occurs, we surmise, because firms are

more likely to use direct cash disbursement to make payments after the tax change as a substitute

for payments from Treasury Facilities or lines of credit (although we cannot directly measure

these flows of payments).

         Panel B of Table 3 shows that all of the declines in leverage come at the short-end of the

maturity spectrum. We find no change in long-term bank debt/assets. This ‘non-result’, along

with the placebo evidence, supports our identification assumption: the tax shock has a very large

effect only at the short-end of the maturity distribution (recall Figure 2). It also suggests that

long-term bank debt is not a close substitute for short-term debt; otherwise, firms would increase

their use of long-term debt. The two serve different roles in corporate finance. Short-term bank

loans exist to help firms manage payments and liquidity; long-term debt exists to help firms

finance long-term investment projects.

         Third, the tax change has a substantial effect on trade credit. Both accounts payable and

accounts receivable increase following the tax change (Table 4). Accounts payable increase by

0.006 to 0.01 more for exposed relative to less-exposed firms (columns 1-3), whereas accounts

receivable increase somewhat less. The relative increase in accounts payable for more exposed

firms represents about a 5% increase over the unconditional mean (= 0.15; recall Table 1).

Notably, the increase in accounts payable is larger in magnitude than the increases in accounts

                                                           19
payable. 20 This may reflect the fact that the tax shock itself raises the cost to firms of supplying

trade credit to their counterparties. Hence, the tax shock induces both an increase in demand for

trade credit and a decline in its supply. The observed increase in the equilibrium quantity of

trade credit implies a strong effect of the reduction in short-term bank credit on demand for

liquidity via trade credit. (These changes also suggest an increase in the equilibrium price of

trade credit, which we explore below.)

Results: Operating (or Real) Effects

         Table 5 reports how investment (= capital expenditures/assets) and firm profit margins (=

earnings/sales) are affected by changes in the tax cost of using bank liquidity. We again report

both outcomes with and without other control variables (six columns).

         Overall, real effects are small and generally not statistically robust. Investment declines

somewhat, but only in the models with control variables. This weak result stands in contrast to

much of the banking literature, which consistently finds that constraints on banking due to

adverse shocks lead to declines in real outcomes for non-financial firms. But, as we have

argued, our setting differs from much of that literature because our shock only affects the cost of

using very short-term borrowing from banks. Unlike, say, a shock to monetary policy, ours is a

pure liquidity-management shock that does not feedback to credit supply. Thus, almost all of the




20
   Across the whole economy, the sum of accounts payable and receivable must be equal, but our effects are somewhat
larger for payables than for receivables. This occurs for at least two reasons. First, we scale our outcomes: the same
$1 million in receivables for the lending firm equates to the $1 million in payables for the borrowing firm; however,
the two do not equate once expressed as a ratio if the scaling variable – assets in our case – is not exactly the same for
both firms. Second, our regressions only capture payables to and receivables from customers who are other firms.
We do not capture the large segment of receivables to households purchasing goods and services from firms to non-
firm payees, such as employees, or from and to firms outside the country (i.e. exports and imports).

                                                           20
effect of the shock gets absorbed by firms’ substituting into other means of payments –

immediate repayment with cash and deferred repayment with trade credit.

Results: Focusing on the role of Trade Credit

        We have shown that trade credit usage rises sharply with the tax change, but real effects

change less. Thus, it seems that trade credit allows firms to mitigate the impact of the tax shock

to bank liquidity. But do firms less able to substitute trade credit for bank credit experience real

operating effects when the tax law changes? To see why they might, imagine a firm that can

wait just 30 days to make its payments (without penalty), but waits 45 days to receive cash from

customers after a sale. A firm like this needs a bridge to span the 15-day timing mismatch. The

bridge could be built either by holding a cash buffer stock or by borrowing on a credit line or

Treasury Facility. Clearly if the option to access bank credit over very short horizons like 15

days becomes more expensive, this firm would need to increase its cash, which in turn may

displace investment, either because internal funds get diverted away from investment, or because

holding a higher buffer of cash leads to permanently lower investment. Firms in the opposite

situation, those with greater access to trade credit, would be less dependent on banks (or cash)

for liquidity because of their ability to substitute into trade credit.

        Given this intuition, we follow Murfin and Njoroge (2015) and construct a measure of

trade credit access to firms that reflects the timing of payments flows in and out of the firm.

Specifically, we build an indicator, High TC Access, equal to one for firms in industries in which

the average days to make payments (= accounts payable / (cost of goods sold + change in

inventory)) exceeds the average days to receive payments (= accounts receivable/sales). Firms

that can wait longer to make payments (relative to when they receive them) are in a better

position to substitute trade credit for bank-supplied short-term loans.

                                                   21
        Much of the theory of trade credit relies on the idea that suppliers have an informational

advantage over other providers of liquidity (i.e., banks), or that suppliers are best able to

redeploy collateral. Schwartz (1974) provides an early explanation of trade credit as a key

component of a firm’s pricing policy, in part motivated by differential access to capital markets.

Smith (1987) provides a broad theory of inter-firm credit that includes product quality, market

power and sunk costs. She proposes that delayed payment facilitates allow buyers to verify

product quality before paying. Smith also models trade credit as a screening contract where

terms can be designed to provide credit quality information, as the response to credit terms may

help identify low creditworthiness buyers. Burkhart and Ellingsen (2004) argue that a key

advantage for trade credit suppliers is their certainty that the transaction with the buyer has

occurred. Overall, such explanations suggest that industry characteristics will determine the

availability of trade credit. In fact, Ng, Smith and Smith (1999) use data compiled from a survey

to credit managers for over 2,000 Compustat firms and show that there is significant variation in

trade credit policies across industries, while there is little variation within industries.

        Petersen and Rajan (1997) provide comprehensive empirical evidence correlating

accounts payable and accounts receivable to firm characteristics using small US firms. They

show that the use of accounts payable is more than 70% lower for firms whose inventories are

finished goods, compared to firms with no finished goods in inventory. Fisman and Love (2004)

report that they find similar correlations based on comparisons across countries and industries.

In contrast, Giannetti et al. (2011) find more trade credit supplied by firms selling differentiated

products. The difficulty with these reduced-form correlations, however, is that they reflect both

supply and demand-side factors. On the trade credit supply side, raw materials are easier to

repossess and put into alternative uses. On the demand side, however, trade credit users may



                                                   22
have a greater demand to delay payments on differentiated goods in order to certify their quality

(Smith, 1987).

           Our setting allows us to identify a shock to trade credit demand stemming from the tax on

short-term bank credit. Thus, firms that face a better availability trade credit (i.e., higher supply

elasticity) ought to substitute more into accounts payable in response to the negative tax shock,

compared to firms with less availability. To test this idea, we measure trade credit availability in

a setting that has not been distorted either by the BAD taxes or by the tax change on bank loans

from 2011; that is, we construct our indictor based on the median Compustat firm in the United

States by industry, defined at the 3-digit ISIC level. 21 Murfin and Njoroge (2015) document

substantial heterogeneity in this measure by firm size, but our purpose is to avoid variation in

access due to firm-specific characteristics and to capture the overall availability of trade credit

based on exogenous industry characteristics such as the nature of inventories (raw materials v.

finished goods) or technology differences.

           We focus in this analysis on the reduced form regressions (equation (2)) with additional

interaction terms. These modified reduced forms, with trade credit interactions, are as follows:

     𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽1 (𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 × 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝛽𝛽2 (𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 )

21
  Similar to Rajan and Zingales (1998) and Fisman and Love (2003), we interpret the US data on trade credit as
representative of the inherent use of trade credit by firms in a given industry. We use Compustat data from 1990 to
2006 to construct this measure.

                                                                          23
Where Yi,t equals either financial (leverage, cash, accounts payables or receivables) or real

outcomes (firm investment and profit). High TC Accessk equals an indicator set to one for a firm

in 3-digit ISIC industry k in which the time to make payments exceeds that of the time to receive

payments. The coefficient 𝛽𝛽1 measures the effect of exposure to the tax treatment for industries

where trade credit leaves a financing gap (e.g., payments come in after 45 days but are due in

just 30), whereas 𝛽𝛽4 allows us to test for differential effects across industries. The sum of the

two coefficients (𝛽𝛽1 + 𝛽𝛽4 ) estimates the effect of the tax shock for firms in industries where trade

credit effectively can substitute for bank liquidity.

       Tables 6 and 7 report financial outcomes. Bank debt declines with exposure to the tax

shock, consistent with Table 3. And, importantly, the decline in bank debt is similar across

industries (Table 6, columns 1-3). That is, there is no heterogeneity in the treatment effect on

short-term bank debt by industry. In contrast, the effect of exposure to the bank-tax shock on

cash does differ across industries. For those with High TC Access, we find no change in cash

(i.e., 𝛽𝛽1 + 𝛽𝛽4 is not significant), as shown in Table 6, columns 4-6. In contrast, cash increases

significantly in industries without High TC Access (𝛽𝛽1 > 0). Table 7 reports the opposite patterns

for trade credit. We find a large increase in accounts payable in industries with High TC Access

(𝛽𝛽1 + 𝛽𝛽4 > 0) but no effect where access is low (𝛽𝛽1 = 0). Thus, some firms substitute into trade

credit when short-term bank credit becomes expensive; this allows them to manage liquidity

without raising cash. Others – those where trade credit frictions are substantial – instead must

increase their buffer stock of cash.

       Is the increase in cash costly? Table 8 suggests that it is. While we find no changes in

profits, investment behavior differs sharply across industries. Firms without High TC Access cut

investment, while firms with High TC Access do not. From equation (3): 𝛽𝛽1 > 0 but 𝛽𝛽1 + 𝛽𝛽4 = 0.

                                                  24
So, firms unable to substitute from bank credit into trade credit both increase cash and cut

investment. Investment rates fall, presumably, because raising the buffer stock of cash to replace

short-term bank loans diverts internal funds away from investment (and external funds are

costly). 22 In contrast, firms with High TC Access are able to increase their use of accounts

payable, thereby limiting the need to raise cash and avoiding the investment distortions that

would otherwise occur.

Results: Effects on the Cost of Trade Credit

        We have shown that a shock to the cost of short-term bank credit leads to increased trade

credit that is concentrated among firms with an elastic supply of trade credit (i.e., industries

where High TC Access = 1). We now trace these effects on the cost (or price) of trade credit. As

highlighted in the literature (e.g. Petersen and Rajan (1994), Giannetti et al (2011)), foregone

discounts are the predominant cost of trade credit. Thus, if higher demand for trade credit

follows from the bank-tax shock, early payment discounts should decline and the cost of inputs

should increase. We test this notion with both aggregate and firm-level data.

        First, since we cannot observe early payment discounts at firm level, we collect data on a

separate, albeit much smaller, sample of firms that are required to report additional financial

statements information, including early payment discounts on sales. 23 Although this sample is

significantly smaller (we collect data available for 156 distinct firms, relative to over 12

thousand in our main sample), we show in Figure 5 that the percentage of early payment


22
   Increasing the cash buffer following the trade shock requires financing, which we presume displaces investment.
Once the cash stock reaches a new higher level, however, investment ought to return to its old level. We are not able
to test this effectively because not enough time has passed since the tax law change.
23
   Companies that issue publicly traded securities are required to report financial statements data to Colombia’s
Financial Superintendence (Superintendencia Financiera). Although these companies are required to report financial
data using a similar reporting format as in our sample, they have the disadvantage that balance sheet items are not
separated into short-term or long-term accounts, which is a key feature we exploit in our private firms’ sample.

                                                         25
discounts relative to total sales declines right after the shock to the cost of short-term bank debt.

The average early payment discount over sales falls from an average of 0.26% between 2006 and

2010 to an average of 0.22% in the post-shock period (2011 to 2014). This suggest that as firms

demand more trade credit, they forgo early payment discounts (increasing the cost of trade

credit), which ultimately compensates the supplier for the provision of liquidity.

         Second, and back to our large sample of firms, we build on the notion that foregone

discounts are the main cost of trade credit and, similar to Gianetti et al (2011), we proxy it using

the ratio of cost of goods sold (COGS) to sales. This variable should capture, even if roughly,

the effect of changes in the cost of trade credit: foregone discounts should lead to a higher cost of

inputs. We report regression results for equations (2) and (3) using costs of goods over sales as

our outcome in Table 9. Panel A first shows that more exposure to the tax shock – which leads

to increased accounts payable – appears to have a positive effect on the cost of trade credit

(𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 × 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 enters positively in column 1). However, this baseline

result loses statistical significance when we add control variables (columns 2 and 3).

         In Panel B of Table 9, we introduce the interactions with High TC Access, as in equation

(3). Where trade credit offers a poor substitute for short-term bank loans to manage liquidity,

the cost of inputs seems to increase with the tax shock (𝛽𝛽1 > 0), although the result loses

significance when we add industry × time effects. In contrast, where trade credit is a better

substitute for bank liquidity, the effect is close to zero. These results, together with the earlier

ones, suggest that if trade credit supply elasticity is low (i.e. when High TC Access = 0), an

increase in trade credit demand has a positive effect on prices, while quantity remains largely

unchanged. In contrast, where supply of trade credit is elastic (i.e. High TC Access = 1), an

increase in demand has a much smaller effect on the price of trade credit, while quantity goes up

significantly more. That said, these results should be interpreted with caution; the firm-level

measure of the cost of trade credit is quite imprecise, as it pools with everything else that

determines a firm’s cost of goods sold.



IV. CONCLUSIONS

       Bank credit lines and very short-term loans offer liquidity to firms and limit the need to

hold cash. Our results suggest that some firms can avoid holding larger buffers of cash when

short-term bank credit becomes more expensive by substituting into trade credit. Identifying this

substitution has been challenging in the literature, but we can exploit a tax shock in Colombia

that penalizes very short-term bank loans. We show that substitution away from banks and into

trade credit is important, as it allows firms to avoid the real investment reductions that we find in

industries where access to trade credit is constrained. Trade credit is thus an important alternate

source of liquidity that can insulate firms from bank liquidity shocks. Unlike much of the

existing literature, we can analyze a shock that affects very short-term bank credit used for

liquidity without feeding back into the long-term credit role of banks.

       Our paper also highlights a pervasive theme in the empirical literature, which is the

fundamental tradeoff between tight identification vs. generality, sometimes called ‘external

validity’. We certainly recognize limitations from concern over external validity, as our tax

shock happens in an unusual setting that has already adapted to a broad bank transaction tax. Yet

the key finding – that trade credit can substitute for bank liquidity and thereby avoid real

distortions – is consistent with other broader but less well-identified settings. For example,

Garcia-Appendini and Montoriol-Garriga (2013) show that trade credit supplied by cash-rich

firms increases around the 2008 Financial Crisis. They argue that the increase reflects

                                                 27
substitution motivated by the declining supply of liquidity from banks. Our study extends theirs

because the tax shock in Colombia is very precise – it affects only very short-term bank loans,

while leaving other potentially confounding variables like investment demand or changes in the

supply of long-term bank loans unaffected. Our study thus helps mitigate identification concerns

with their study, while their study helps mitigate external validity concerns with ours.

This figure illustrates the increase in the cost of debt on an annualized basis stemming from the 2011 tax
law change, as a function of a loan’s maturity. For simplicity, the red dashed line is set constant at 8.0%,
reflecting a flat term structure of interest rates. The blue solid line depicts the ‘all-in’ cost of debt at after
the cost of the tax is included in the loan’s cash flow. The tax law change adds a cost of 0.4% to every
loan, irrespective of its maturity; thus the ‘all-in’ annualized cost for shorter term loans increases
significantly more than for longer term debt. For example, the ‘all-in’ cost for a 5-day loan is equal to:
[(1+8.0%*5/365) * (1+0.4%)-1] * (365/5) = 37.2%, while the ‘all-in’ cost for a 1-year loan is equal to:
[(1+8.0%*365/365) * (1+0. 4%)-1] * (365/365) = 8.4%

Figure 5. Early Payment Discounts on Sales / Sales around 2011 Tax Law Change
This figure plots sales discounts over total sales between 2006 and 2014 for a separate sample of 156
Colombian firms that issue public securities and are thus required to report additional financial statements
items not reported by our larger sample of private firms, including the COP amount of early payment
discounts provided on sales. The graph plots the average sales discount over total sales per year (we account
for differences across firms by estimating the average per year in a regression that includes firm fixed
effects).

This table reports summary statistics (means and standard deviation) for our sample of firms during the
period 2008-2013. The data source stems from Colombia’s Corporations Superintendence
(Superintendencia de Sociedades). Summary statistics are divided by firms below and above the sales
cutoff of COP 15,000 million (approximately $5 million).

Table 2. Effect of 2011 Law Change on the Issuance of Short Term Debt (0 to 60 days)
This table reports panel regressions of the issuance of short term debt (maturities between 0 and 60 days)
on our instrument: the triple interaction between firm (log) sales, an indicator equal to one for firms above
the cutoff before the tax change (reflecting the increased slope above the cutoff), and an indicator equal to
one after the 2011 tax change (reflecting the slope’s flattening). Columns 1 to 3 report the ‘first stage’
regressions. Columns 4 to 6 report placebo regressions where interactions with a 2010-year indicator
variable (the year before the shock) are included. All regressions include time and firm fixed effects,
columns 2 and 5 add firm controls, and columns 3 and 6 add Industry × Year fixed effects. Standard
errors clustered by firm (in parentheses). ***, **, and * indicates significance at the 1%, 5% and 10%
level, respectively.

Table 3. Effect of 2011 Law Change on Leverage and Cash Holdings
This table reports reduced form regressions for leverage and cash holdings. Reduced form regressions for leverage (panel A, columns 1 to 3) and
cash holdings (panel A, columns 4 to 6) show the effect of a shock to the cost of short-term liquidity loans based on the triple interaction term:
“Ln(Sales) * Above Cutoff * Post 2011”. Panel B shows the decomposition of the effect on leverage by maturity: columns 1 to 3 show the effect
on short term debt (one year or less in maturity) and columns 4 to 6 show the effect on long term debt (more than a year in maturity). All
regressions include time and firm fixed effects, columns 2 and 5 add firm controls, and columns 3 and 6 add Industry × Year fixed effects. Note
that the time and firm fixed effects absorb the direct effects of Ln(Sales), Above Cutoff and Post 2011. Standard errors clustered by firm (in
parentheses). ***, **, and * indicates significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively.

Table 6. Differential Effect on Industries with High TC Access: Leverage and Cash
This table reports reduced form regressions for leverage (columns 1 to 3) and cash holdings (columns 4 to 6), exploring the differential effect of
the shock (based on the triple interaction term: “Ln(Sales) * Above Cutoff * Post 2011”) on firms in industries with positive net trade credit
borrowing days (i.e. firms with High TC Access). Positive net trade credit borrowing days are calculated at the ISIC 3-digit level using Compustat
data between 1990 and 2006. Panel A reports the reduced form regressions. Panel B reports an F-test evaluating whether the added effect of
coefficients (a) + (b) is different from zero for each column. All regressions include time and firm fixed effects, columns 2 and 5 add firm controls,
and columns 3 and 6 add Industry × Year fixed effects. Standard errors clustered by firm (in parentheses). ***, **, and * indicates significance at
the 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively.

Table 7. Differential Effect on Industries with High TC Access: Trade Credit
This table reports reduced form regressions for accounts payable (columns 1 to 3) and accounts receivable (columns 4 to 6), exploring the
differential effect of the shock (based on the triple interaction term: “Ln(Sales) * Above Cutoff * Post 2011”) on firms in industries with positive
net trade credit borrowing days (i.e. firms with High TC Access). Positive net trade credit borrowing days are calculated at the ISIC 3-digit level
using Compustat data between 1990 and 2006. Panel A reports the reduced form regressions. Panel B reports an F-test evaluating whether the
added effect of coefficients (a) + (b) is different from zero for each column. All regressions include time and firm fixed effects, columns 2 and 5
add firm controls, and columns 3 and 6 add Industry × Year fixed effects. Standard errors clustered by firm (in parentheses). ***, **, and *
indicates significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively.

Table 9. Effect of 2011 Law Change on the Cost of Trade Credit
Panel A. Baseline
This table reports reduced form regressions for Costs of Goods / Sales. Reduced form regressions
(columns 1 to 3) show the effect of a shock to the cost of short-term liquidity loans based on the triple
interaction term: “Ln(Sales) * Above Cutoff * Post 2011”. All regressions include time and firm fixed
effects, column 2 includes firm controls, and column 3 adds Industry × Year fixed effects. Standard errors
clustered by firm (in parentheses). ***, **, and * indicates significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level,
respectively.

Panel B. Differential Effect by TC Access
This table reports reduced form regressions for Costs of Goods / Sales, exploring the differential effect of
the shock (based on the triple interaction term: “Ln(Sales) * Above Cutoff * Post 2011”) on firms in
industries with positive net trade credit borrowing days (i.e. firms with High TC Access). Positive net
trade credit borrowing days are calculated at the ISIC 3-digit level using Compustat data between 1990
and 2006. Panel C reports an F-test evaluating whether the added effect of coefficients (a) + (b) is
different from zero for each column. All regressions include time and firm fixed effects, column 2
includes firm controls, and column 3 adds Industry × Year fixed effects. Standard errors clustered by firm
(in parentheses). ***, **, and * indicates significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively.

Table IA.1. Summary Statistics by Below vs. Above Sales Cutoff and Negative vs. Positive Net TC Days

This table reports summary statistics (means and standard deviation) for our sample of firms during the period 2008-2013. The data source stems
from Colombia’s Corporations Superintendence (Superintendencia de Sociedades). Summary statistics are divided by firms below and above the
sales cutoff of COP 15,000 million (approximately $5 milllion) and for firms in industries with negative and positive net trade credit borrowing
days.

Table IA.3. Effect of 2011 Law Change on the Issuance of Short Term Debt for Different Maturities
This table reports panel regressions of the issuance of short term debt for different maturities, on the triple interaction between firm (log) sales, an
indicator equal to one for firms above the cutoff before the tax change (reflecting the increased slope above the cutoff), and a set of indicator
variables equal to one for each year between 2008 and 2013, reflecting the slope’s flattening year-by-year. All regressions include time and firm
fixed effects, firm controls and Industry × Year fixed effects. Standard errors clustered by firm are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicates
significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively.
