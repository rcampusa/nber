Challenges in Constructing a Survey-Based Well-Being Index

                                         ABSTRACT

Many in both government and academia are showing renewed interest in developing new
measures of national well-being. A new measure that goes “beyond GDP” to comprehensively
capture non-market goods could be a useful supplement to traditional economic indicators for
guiding policy and more accurately tracking welfare. But how should national well-being be
conceptualized in theory? How could it be measured in practice? How could it be constructed in a
systematic and politically neutral way? These questions should be approached by economists
with the same level of care that has been taken in the theoretical and practical development of
GDP.

In this short paper, we focus on one conceptual framework (Benjamin, Heffetz, Kimball, and
Szembrot, 2014), which uses self-reported responses to subjective well-being (SWB) and stated
preference (SP) survey questions to construct an index of well-being. We briefly review the
framework and highlight challenges in the first two steps a government agency would need to
take before conducting the SWB and SP surveys: (1) formulating a set of aspects of well-being
that is theoretically valid and can be measured accurately via surveys; and (2) choosing and
interpreting the surveys’ response scales.
