Obesity and Skill Attainment in Early Childhood

                                               ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the association between obesity and skill attainment in early childhood (aged
2-4 years). Data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study are used to estimate models of developmental
functioning in four critical areas (verbal skills, activities of daily living, motor skills, and social skills)
as a function of various measures of weight (including body mass index and obesity) controlling for
a rich set of child, parent, and family characteristics. The findings indicate that, among boys, obesity
is associated with reduced verbal skills, social skills, motor skills, and activities of daily living. Among
girls, obesity is associated with reduced verbal skills. Further investigations show that the correlations
exist even for those preschool children who spend no time in day care, which implies that it cannot
be due solely to discrimination by teachers, classmates, or day care providers.

Introduction

        In developed countries, obesity tends to be associated with worse labor market

outcomes; in particular, lower wages or earnings (Cawley, 2004; Cawley et al. 2005;

Brunello and d’Hombres 2007; Lundborg et al. 2007), less wealth (Zagorsky 2005), and a

lower probability of employment (Paraponaris et al. 2005; Lundborg et al. 2007; Morris,

2007; Burkhauser and Cawley, 2008). Several papers have found evidence that the

relationship is causal (e.g. Cawley, 2004; Cawley et al. 2005; Morris 2007).

        Obesity may worsen labor market outcomes for several reasons, including

discrimination by employers or lower productivity due to worse health. Another

possibility is that childhood obesity, which is a strong predictor of adult obesity1, leads to

less skill formation and therefore lower productivity in adulthood (Sabia 2007; Lobstein

et al. 2004). An obese child might attain fewer skills for several reasons; e.g. obesity-

related illness may impair skill acquisition, there may be discrimination by teachers, day

care providers, or classmates, or high-ability parents may be better producers of both

skills and health in their children.

        This paper tests whether childhood obesity is associated with lower skill

attainment, at younger ages (2-4 years) than previously examined. This research question

is timely because the prevalence of childhood obesity has risen rapidly in many countries

(Lobstein et al. 2004; Kurth and Schaffrath Rosario 2007; Ogden et al. 2002; WHO

2005), which has led some to describe childhood obesity as a pandemic (Malecka-

Tendera 2006; Kimm 2002). This research is also timely because it contributes to the

  Roughly 20% of obese adults were obese as children (estimates range from 5-44%) and the probability of
becoming an obese adult is roughly 400% greater for obese children than non-obese children (estimates
range from 200% to 650%); see Freedman et al. (2005) and Serdula et al. (1993).

growing literature on early-childhood health and skill formation (e.g. Heckman 2008;

Heckman 2007; Cunha et al. 2005).

       Previous studies of whether childhood overweight is associated with lower skill

attainment have focused largely on children of elementary school age (Datar and Sturm

2006; Cairney et al. 2006; Datar et al. 2004; Graf et al. 2004; Mo-suwan et al. 1999) or

those about to enter elementary school (Mond et al., 2007). To our knowledge, this is the

first study of obesity and skill attainment to study children as young as 2 to 4 years old.

Studying pre-school children is informative because if obesity is associated with skill

attainment prior to school entry, it suggests that it cannot solely be due to discrimination

by schoolteachers or classmates.

       Several studies have examined how childhood obesity correlates with academic

outcomes. A study of nationally representative U.S. data on kindergarten children found

a negative correlation between overweight status and test scores on math and reading

exams, but these differences tended to become insignificant after controlling for

socioeconomic and behavioral characteristics (Datar et al., 2004). A study of children

and adolescents in Thailand found that overweight was associated with significantly

lower grade point average among young adolescents (grades 7-9) but not younger

children (grades 3-6) (Mo Suwan et al. 1999). A study of nationally representative

Icelandic data of 14- and 15-year old schoolchildren found that body mass index (BMI)

was significantly and negatively correlated with grades in three language classes and

mathematics (Sigfusdottir et al. 2007). Among older youths (aged 14-17) in the U.S., a

negative relationship between BMI and grade point average has been documented among

white girls, but not nonwhite girls or males (Sabia 2007). A large literature has




                                              4
documented discrimination against obese students by classmates, teachers, and

administrators; see the reviews in Puhl and Latner (2006) and Puhl and Brownell (2001).

       Other research has examined the relationship between childhood overweight and

motor skills. A study of first-grade children in the Cologne region of Germany found that

obesity was associated with impaired motor development for both boys and girls (Graf et

al., 2004). A study of elementary school children aged 9-14 years in a city in Ontario,

Canada found that Developmental Coordination Disorder is a risk factor for overweight

and obesity for boys but not girls (Cairney et al., 2005). A study of children aged 4.4 –

8.6 years in Lower Bavaria in Germany found that obese male (but not obese female)

children were more likely to have impaired gross motor skills (Mond et al. 2007).

       This paper tests whether childhood obesity is associated with lower skill

attainment on four dimensions: verbal skills, activities of daily living, motor skills, and

social skills. To our knowledge, our sample of children (between the ages of two and

four years) is younger than that used in any previous study of this question. In contrast to

previous studies based on German data (Graf et al. 2004; Mond et al. 2007), a nationally

representative data set is used.



Data and Methods

       Data: German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP)

       The sample consists of children aged between the ages of 26 and 44 months who

are the offspring of respondents to the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP).

The SOEP is a wide-ranging nationally representative longitudinal study of private

households that includes information on all household members and includes Germans




                                              5
living in West and East Germany, foreigners, and recent immigrants (Wagner et al.

2007); for more information see the SOEP webpage at: http://www.diw-

berlin.de/english/soep/soepoverview/27908.html. The SOEP was started in 1984 and in

2006 it included more than 20,000 individuals in nearly 11,000 households. SOEP data

are collected in varying ways from respondents: oral interviews, written questionnaires,

and computer-assisted interviews; the way in which the mother-child questionnaire data

(which are the main source of this study) were collected is not indicated.

       Child Body Mass Index, Overweight, and Obesity

       Since 2002 the SOEP has included questions on the health (including weight) of

adult respondents (see e.g. Cawley et al. 2005 and Heineck 2006). In addition, mother’s

reports of the weight and height of children have been collected since 2003. A

substantial body of research has studied the accuracy of parental reports of child weight;

in general, this literature finds that parents tend to underreport the weights of relatively

heavy children and therefore obesity is underestimated (Scholtens et al. 2007; Wing et al.

1980; Davis and Gergen, 1994). Huybrechts et al. (2006) finds no difference in the

accuracy of parental reports across the gender of the preschool child. Several studies

conclude that parental reports of child weight are sufficiently accurate to be used in

research (Garcia-Marcos et al. 2006; Sekine et al. 2002; Goodman et al. 2000).

       Reporting error by mothers in Germany may be less than in other samples

because, in Germany, preventive medical check-ups for very young children are offered

on a regular basis starting at birth and are free of charge. Weight and height at each

check-up are documented in a medical record booklet that is kept by the family. 98% of

SOEP children had such check-ups, so to the extent that mothers referred to these




                                              6
booklets when reporting child weight and height to the SOEP, reporting error in mother’s

report of child weight and height are presumed to be small.

         Clinical weight classifications were defined using the standard reference values

for German children (Kromeyer at al., 2001): overweight is above the historic 90th

percentile, and obesity is above the historic 97th percentile, of BMI. These reference

values are those used by major German studies of childhood overweight (e.g. Kurth and

Schaffrath Rosario 2007). As a robustness check we also use the international thresholds

for overweight and obesity (Cole et al. 2000). We do not include among the regressors

an indicator variable for underweight for the two reasons stated by Cole et al. (2000):

standardized cutoffs for underweight tend to result in “unacceptably high” percentages of

children classified as underweight, and underweight lacks validation as a measure of

disease risk in children. As a result, the reference category is having a BMI less than the

overweight threshold.

        Skill Attainment

        The outcomes are measures of skill attainment. Collectively they are a

modification of the German Vineland scale (Tietze, 1998; Sparrow et al., 1984) that has

been developed and used by researchers studying child development in Germany (Tietze,

1998; Coneus and Pfeiffer 2007). In each of four areas -- verbal skills, activities of daily

living, motor skills, and social skills -- mothers were asked to rate their child’s ability to

perform five skills as either yes, to some extent, or no. Yes was scored as two points, to

some extent was scored as one point, and no was scored as 0 points. Scores were

summed across the five tasks to create an index that ranged from 0 to 10 indicating the

child’s skill attainment in each of the four areas. The Appendix provides the full text




                                               7
(English translation) of these SOEP questions and also provides information about the

skills that were most and least commonly exhibited by the children.2

        As these measures of skill attainment are reported by the mother, they represent

noisy measures of true skill attainment. The extent of maternal error in this measure is

unknown, but in related work Furnham and Bunclark (2006) conclude that parents are

accurate in assessing both male and female children’s overall intelligence, and that it is

not clear that parents are more accurate at assessing it for one gender relative to the other.

        Regression Models

        Ordinary least squares regression models were used to examine the association

between skill attainment and either BMI or indicator variables for clinical weight

classification (overweight and obese), while controlling for the following characteristics:

age of child in months (linear and squared), age of mother in years, household income

(thousands of Euros per month, reported by the household head), number of other

children in the household, and indicator variables for: whether in day care four or more

hours a week, mother has completed vocational training, mother has completed university

degree, father has completed vocational training, father has completed university degree,

single parent household, whether mother migrated to Germany (i.e. was foreign-born),

living in West Germany, living in urban area, living in rural area, missing income data,

missing education data, and year.

        Models are estimated separately by gender because the mechanisms for the

association (e.g. discrimination, parental investments) may vary by child gender. For

  This study uses data from the questionnaires on child development that were administered in 2005 to the
parents of the “2003 cohort” of newborns and those administered in 2006 to the parents of the “2004
cohort” of newborns. (The cohort year refers to when the mother was interviewed, not necessarily the year
that the child was born.)

example, Thomas (1994) finds that parents’ resource allocations can result in differentials

in height that vary by the gender of the child.

       Various sensitivity analyses and extensions are conducted. Ordered probit models

rather than ordinary least squares models are estimated. In order to explore mechanisms

for the correlations, we also estimate our models for children who spend no time in day

care. In order to determine whether results are driven by differences between the

immigrant and native-born population, we estimate models for families who speak only

German at home, child who are German citizens, children whose mothers are German

citizens, and children whose mothers are native born Germans. All analyses were

conducted using STATA version 9.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

       Weight and height were missing for 28 observations, and an additional three

observations were dropped because the child BMI was implausible – either below 10

(one observation) or above 36 (two observations). Four additional observations were

dropped because of missing data on mother’s age or whether the mother had migrated to

Germany. Subtracting these 35 observations from the total of 479 children in the 2005

and 2006 waves with valid data from the SOEP mother questionnaire leaves us with a

sample of 444.



Results

       Table 1 lists the summary statistics by gender. By the thresholds developed for

the German population of children, 7.9% of boys and 6.0% of girls are overweight but

not obese, and 7.4% of boys and 9.8% of girls are obese. Scores on the verbal skills,

social skills, and motor skills developmental scales are high; the mean score (out of 10)




                                              9
on these tests ranges between 8.1 and 8.7 for boys and between 8.2 and 9.0 for girls. The

average score on activities of daily living is lower: 5.8 for boys and 6.7 for girls. For

both genders combined, the correlation coefficients between any two of the four

measures of skill attainment from .39 (activities of daily living and social skills) to .55

(verbal and social skills).3 These correlations are higher for obese than non-obese

children.

         Associations between skill attainment and BMI are shown in Table 2. For the

sake of brevity the main tables in this paper present only the coefficients or marginal

effects associated with the weight variables. Full regression results are available upon

request, and as an example Appendix Tables 1A (boys) and 1B (girls) provide full results

for one set of regressions (those corresponding to Table 2).

         Table 2 indicates that, among boys, higher BMI is associated with significantly

lower verbal skills (P<0.10), social skills (P<0.05), and motor skills (P<0.05). The

magnitudes of the point estimates are such that weighing 12.8 units of BMI more than the

average is associated with scoring one point lower on the verbal skill index, weighing 9.2

BMI units above average is associated with scoring one point lower on the social skills

index, and weighing 11 BMI units above average is associated with scoring one point

lower on the motor skills index. To put this in context, scoring one point lower on any of

these indices is equivalent to the difference between fully having a skill (such as speaking

in complete sentences) and partly having the skill, or between partly having the skill and

not having the skill at all. Among girls the point estimates on BMI are always less than

  The correlation between mother with vocational training and the four measures of child skills range from

half those for boys, and in no case is BMI significantly correlated with a measure of skill

attainment.

          Nonlinearities in the association between skill attainment and BMI are explored in

Table 3. Obesity among boys is associated with significantly lower developmental

functioning on each scale: verbal skills (P<0.01), social skills (P<0.01), motor skills

(P<0.10) and activities of daily living (P<0.05). The magnitude of the associations are

substantial; relative to healthy weight, obesity is associated with between a 1.2 and 1.6

unit deficit on a ten-unit scale for three of the four measures of development. Overweight

is not associated with significantly lower skill attainment for boys.

          To put these magnitudes into perspective, obesity is associated with a decrement

in verbal skills more than 9 times larger than that associated with the household having

1,000 Euros lower monthly income. Also relative to the household earning 1,000 fewer

Euros per month, the association of obesity is almost 8 times larger for social skills,

almost 6 times larger for motor skills, and more than 8 times larger for activities of daily

living.

          Among girls, obesity is associated with lower developmental functioning on only

one scale: verbal skills (P<0.10). As was the case for BMI, the point estimate for girls is

less than half that for boys, implying that obesity is associated with scoring slightly more

than half a point lower on the ten-point scale. Still, the conditional difference in verbal

skills between girls who weigh less than the overweight threshold and those who are

obese is only slightly smaller than the gap in verbal skills between girls whose fathers

did, and whose fathers did not, attain a university degree.




                                              11
Sensitivity Analyses and Extensions

        As a sensitivity analysis, overweight and obesity were defined using the

international thresholds (Cole et al. 2000) rather than the thresholds tailored to the

German child population (Kromeyer at al., 2001). The international threshold results in a

lower prevalence of obesity than that associated with the German threshold for both boys

and girls. The international threshold also results in a prevalence of overweight that is

lower than that based on the German threshold for boys, but higher than that based on the

German threshold for girls. Table 4 presents results for regression models that use the

international thresholds, but which are otherwise comparable to the results in Table 3,

which are based on the German thresholds. Use of the international threshold generates

interesting differences in results; in particular, it is overweight rather than obesity that is

associated with lower verbal skills and activities of daily living among boys. Both

overweight and obesity are associated with lower social skills among boys. The results

for boys’ motor skills are largely unaffected by using the international rather than the

German thresholds; in both cases obesity is associated with scoring 0.8 to 0.9 units lower.

For girls, the coefficient on obesity defined using the international threshold is two-thirds

the size of that defined using the German threshold, and is not statistically significant.

An explanation for the difference in results is that using the international rather than the

German thresholds moves some children out of the obese category and into the

overweight category, increasing the average BMI among the overweight children and

therefore strengthening the association between overweight and skill attainment. The

difference in results by threshold is a specific example of the general point that the

measure of fatness one uses, and where one draws the line for overweight and obesity can




                                               12
have important implications for one’s research findings (Burkhauser and Cawley 2008).

For the purposes of this paper, it is more appropriate to use the German than the

international thresholds because they were developed for precisely this population of

children (Kromeyer at al. 2001). For the extensions and sensitivity analyses described

below, the German thresholds are used.

        The finding that obese boys attain fewer skills prior to school entry is informative

about the mechanisms of the association. For example, it suggests that the association

cannot solely be due to discrimination by schoolteachers or classmates. However, one

might argue that it is due to discrimination by day care providers. To test this possibility,

we estimated our models using only the children who spend zero hours per week in day

care; such children represent 61.3 percent of the total sample used to estimate the models

described earlier in this paper. The results are presented in Table 5. For boys, obesity is

associated with at least a 1.2-unit decrease on each of the four measures of skills; in each

case the coefficient is statistically significant at the 10 percent level or better. For girls,

obesity is associated with a 0.97 unit decrease on the index of motor skills, which is

statistically significant at the 10 percent level. For girls, the association of obesity with

verbal skills is not significant in this subsample, but the point estimate is slightly larger

than that for the full sample. In summary, this extension confirms that the association of

obesity with lower skill attainment cannot be due solely to discrimination by day care

providers (or, for that matter, by schoolteachers or classmates) – it is found even among

preschool children who spend no time in day care.

        Our dependent variables are ordinal indices, so as another sensitivity analysis we

estimate ordered probit regressions rather than ordinary least squares regressions. (The




                                               13
pattern of statistically significant coefficients is very similar in each case regardless of

whether ordered probit or OLS is used, so given the ease of interpretation OLS are

presented as the primary results in this paper.) Marginal effects associated with the

ordered probit coefficients are listed in Table 6. For boys, obesity is associated with a

25.9% lower probability of scoring a perfect 10 on verbal skills, a 28.0% lower

probability of a perfect score on social skills, an 11.1% lower probability of a perfect

score in motor skills, and a 3.9% lower probability of a perfect score on activities of daily

living. Among girls, obesity was associated with a 21.7% lower probability of a perfect

score on verbal skills, but was not significantly associated with the probability of a

perfect score on the other skill indices. To put these associations into context, the

difference in verbal skills between obese and less-than-overweight children is

approximately that equal to the difference in verbal skills between children whose fathers

did not and did attain a university degree. For boys, the decrement in social skills

associated with obesity is five times larger than that associated with the household

earning 1,000 fewer Euros per month.

        In order to determine whether results are driven by differences between the

immigrant and native-born population, we estimated our models for various subsamples:

children who speak only German at home (N=364), children who are German citizens

(N=416), children whose mothers are German citizens (N=398) and children whose

mothers are native born (i.e. did not migrate to Germany) (N=375). These results for

each of these subsamples are extremely similar to those for the sample as a whole (for the

sake of brevity we do not include tables of these results but the results are available from

the authors upon request). This implies that the results for the full sample are not driven




                                              14
by differences in weight and skill attainment between native-born and immigrant

children.



Discussion

        This paper contributes to the growing literature on early-childhood health and

skill formation (e.g. Heckman 2008; Heckman 2007; Cunha et al. 2005) by providing

new evidence on the association between early-childhood obesity and skill attainment.

We find that obesity is associated with lower skill attainment at ages two to four years -

younger than previously appreciated. Moreover, the magnitude of the association is

substantial; on three out of four measures, obesity in boys is associated with more than a

one-unit deficit on a ten-unit scale, which is equivalent to a shift from “to some extent” to

“no” on one of the five skills in that domain. This difference in development cannot be

attributed to discrimination by day care providers; the gap is found even among children

who spend zero hours per week in day care.

        These findings are significant because skill attainment at one stage of the life

cycle raises skill attainment at later stages of the life cycle, a process called “self-

productivity” (Heckman 2007; Cunha et al. 2005). As a result of this process, the skill

attainment of young children is correlated with subsequent educational and labor market

outcomes (Heckman 2008; Heckman 2007; Cunha et al. 2005; Currie and Early, 2001).

In particular, our finding that obesity is associated with skill attainment among boys may

explain why youth obesity is associated with lower eventual educational attainment in

men (Karnehed et al., 2006).




                                               15
       Our findings also indicate that the association between obesity and skill

attainment is stronger for boys than girls. This is consistent with two previous studies

that found that obesity was associated with worse academic performance in boys but not

girls (Datar et al. 2004; Mond et al. 2007). Some previous studies found different

patterns across gender. One study found that BMI was associated with impaired motor

skills in both boys and girls in Germany (Graf et al. 2004) and one study found that

excess weight is associated with worse academic performance among teenage girls but

not teenage boys in the U.S. (Sabia 2007). Resolving and better understanding gender

differences in such associations are important areas for future research.

       The labor market penalty for obesity tends to be greater for women than men

(Averett and Korenman 1996; Cawley, 2004; Lundborg et al. 2007), and the decrement in

wealth associated with obesity is also greater for women than men (Zagorsky 2005). One

explanation is that obesity lowers human capital accumulation more for women than

men; however, this paper finds the opposite pattern – the skill deficits associated with

obesity are greater for boys than for girls. Future research should explore what other

factors may be responsible for these disparities in adulthood.

       A strength of this study is that it is the first to study the association between

overweight and skill attainment in children as young as 2-4 years of age. The youngest

children previously examined in this context were aged 4.4 – 8.6 years (Mond et al.

2007). By examining children aged 2-4 who spend no time in day care this paper is able

to rule out discrimination by day care providers, teachers, or classmates as an explanation

for the gap. Another strength of the analysis is the range of skills considered – verbal




                                             16
skills, activities of daily living, motor skills, and social skills. Furthermore the results are

based on a nationally representative sample.

         Three of the four measures of skill attainment had high mean scores (above 8 out

of 10 for each gender, pooling all ages). In addition, average scores rise with age. The

skills in question were generally not sufficiently difficult or rare to create a lot of

variation, especially for the children closer to 4 than 2 years old. For this reason, the

variation being explained by the regression models is among younger children who lag

the norm for their age. It is not possible to say how the associations would have differed

if the measures of skill attainment had more variation at the high end.

         The study has the following limitations. The measures of skill attainment are

assessed by the mother rather than a professional; however, the measures are designed to

be answered by non-professionals. These measures of developmental functioning are a

modification of the Vineland scale (Sparrow et al. 1984) that has been used by other

researchers studying child development in Germany (Tietze 1998; Coneus and Pfeiffer,

2007).

         Another limitation is that weight and height are reported by parents. Although

several studies conclude that parental reports of child weight are sufficiently accurate to

be used in research (Garcia-Marcos et al. 2006; Sekine et al. 2002; Goodman et al. 2000),

and although maternal reporting error of child weight is expected to be small in the SOEP

because virtually all children had recent medical check-ups and therefore a recent

measured weight and height in their medical booklets, such reporting error is likely to

bias coefficient estimates so future studies on this topic should seek to collect data that

include measured weight and height.




                                               17
       Another limitation is that body mass index is a poor measure of fatness, as it does

not distinguish fat from lean body mass (Burkhauser and Cawley, 2008). More accurate

measures of fatness include total body fat or percent body fat, which can be assessed

using methods such as Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (Ibid). However, BMI is the

only measure of fatness available in the SOEP. A direction for future research is to find

data that include the more accurate measures of fatness and use them to test the

robustness of this paper’s findings.

       Finally, we are unable to make causal inferences; obesity may cause

developmental delays, slow development may result in obesity, or both obesity and

developmental delays may be caused by unobserved factors. For example, boys who are

stigmatized for being obese may lack opportunities to develop their social skills. Cramer

and Steinwert (1998) find that even among three year olds, overweight peers are seen as

undesirable playmates. Alternatively, it may be that boys with poor social skills have a

hard time finding playmates and therefore play less, raising the risk of obesity. A third

possibility is that unobserved physical health problems led to both obesity and impaired

social skills. One possible candidate is Prader-Willi syndrome, which is associated with

both early onset of obesity and emotional and behavior problems (Curry and Early,

2001). Another possibility is that mothers who are more able in unobserved ways are

better at producing skills and healthy weight in their children.

       Despite these limitations, this paper contributes to the literature by establishing

that the association of childhood obesity with lower skill attainment exists at younger

ages (2-4 years) than previously appreciated, that the association is greater for boys than




                                             18
girls, and that it cannot be due solely to discrimination by teachers, classmates, or day

care providers.

Notes:
     1) Figures in the table represent estimates of the association between skill attainment and clinical weight classification (defined
        using German thresholds), controlling for child and family characteristics.
     2) Table cells list OLS coefficient and the associated standard errors in parentheses.
     3) Asterisks indicate statistical significance: * = significant at 10%, ** = significant at 5%, *** = significant at 1%.
     4) Results are shown only for clinical weight classification. The regression models also included the following controls: age of
        child in months (linear and squared), age of mother in years, household income, number of other children in the household,
        and indicator variables for whether in day care 4 or more hours a week, net monthly income, mother has completed
        vocational training, mother has completed university degree, father has completed vocational training, father has completed
        university degree, single parent household, mother has a migration background, living in West Germany, living in urban

Below is the full text (English translation) of the SOEP questions that were used to create

the measures of developmental functioning used in this paper.



For parents, it is always a big event when their child learns something new.

Please tell us what those new things in the case of your child.

(Rate child’s ability to perform each task as either “Yes”, “To Some Extent” or “No”)



Verbal Skills:

V.1. Understands brief instructions such as “go get your shoes”

V.2. Forms sentences with at least two words

V.3. Speaks in full sentences (with four or more words)

V.4. Listens attentively to a story for five minutes or longer

V.5. Passes on simple messages such as “dinner is ready”



Activities of Daily Living:

ADL.1. Uses a spoon to eat, without assistance and without making a mess

ADL.2. Blows nose without assistance

ADL.3. Uses the toilet to do “number two”

ADL.4. Correctly puts on pants and underpants

ADL.5. Brushes teeth without assistance



Motor Skills:



                                             33
M.1. Walks forwards down the stairs

M.2. Opens doors with the door handle

M.3. Climbs up playground climbing equipment and other high playground structures

M.4. Cuts paper with scissors

M.5. Paints/draws recognizable shapes on paper



Social Skills:

S.1. Calls familiar people by name; for example, says “mommy” and “daddy”

S.2. Participates in games with other children

S.3. Gets involved in role-playing games (“playing pretend”)

S.4. Shows a particular liking for certain playmates or friends

S.5. Calls own feelings by name, e.g. “sad”, “happy”, “scared”



Among the verbal skills, the most commonly-achieved skills are V.1. and V.2. (over 90%

Yes) and the least-achieved skills are V.3. and V.4. (between 60-70% Yes).

Among the activities of daily living, the most commonly-achieved skill is ADL.1. (60%

Yes) and the least-achieved skill is ADL.3. (30% Yes).

Among the motor skills, the most commonly-achieved skill is M.2. (95% Yes) and the

least-achieved skill is M.5. (39% Yes).

Among the social skills, the most commonly-achieved skill is S.1. (99% Yes) and the

least-achieved skill is S.3. (67% Yes).

Average scores on each of the four indices rise with age.
