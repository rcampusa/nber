                                              ABSTRACT

Debilitating events could leave either frailer or more robust survivors, depending on the extent of scarring
and mortality selection. The majority of empirical analyses find frailer survivors. I find heterogeneous
effects. Among severely stressed former Union Army POWs, which effect dominates 35 years after
the end of the Civil War depends on age at imprisonment. Among survivors to 1900, those younger
than 30 at imprisonment faced higher older age mortality and morbidity and worse socioeconomic
outcomes than non-POW and other POW controls whereas those older than 30 at imprisonment faced
a lower older age death risk than the controls.

       The first total war, the American Civil War, provides a unique opportunity to examine the

long-run effects of acute malnutrition and the stresses associated with imprisonment on later life

socioeconomic outcomes and older age mortality and morbidity. At Andersonville, the most no-

torious of the POW camps, roughly one-third of POWs died within 7 months (Rhodes 1904: 404)

and forty percent of the men who passed through Andersonville died there. 1 Diarists accounts de-

scribe men weighing 90-95 pounds, down from almost 180, when they left Andersonville (Basile

1981; Ransom 1963). Walt Whitman wrote of the returning prisoners, “Can these be men – these

little, livid brown, ash-streaked monkey-looking dwarfs? Are they not really mummied, dwindling

corpses?”

       This paper examines the effect of imprisonment in Confederate POW camps on the mortality,

morbidity, occupational attainment, and property ownership of Union Army veterans 35 years after

the end of the war. Conditions in Confederate POW camps deteriorated sharply when prisoner

exchanges stopped, leading to severe over-crowding and reduced rations. Union Army non-POWs

and POWs imprisoned when conditions were better provide control groups for POWs imprisoned

when conditions were at their worst.

       Starvation and the diseases and stresses of imprisonment could leave either permanently scarred

survivors or very resilient survivors through positive selection effects. Models of mortality selec-

tion posit that when mortality at younger ages is high, frailer individuals die, leaving a more robust

population that survives longer. These models have been used to explain the deceleration of the

age pattern of mortality at older ages (Horiuchi and Wilmoth 1998) and the black-white mortal-

ity crossover (Manton and Stallard 1981; cf. Preston et al. 1996). Empirical analyses, however,

predominately show positive associations between debilitating events and the morbidity and mor-

tality of adults more than 20 years after the event (e.g. Horiuchi 1983; Finch and Crimmins 2004;
   1
     See United States War Department (1880- 1901), Series II, Vol. VIII, pp. 615, 781. In a longitudinal random
sample roughly 38 percent of the 554 men held at Andersonville died there. In the National Park Services cross-
sectional data base 40 percent of the listed men died at Andersonville (see Costa and Kahn 2007).

Barker 1992, 1994; Almond and Mazumder 2005; cf. Casselli and Capocaccia 1989; Kannisto et

al. 1997). Studies of POWs are no exception, with the caveat that the biological processes through

which insults at young adult ages affect older age mortality are different from the processes through

which insults at ages when organs are still developing affect older age mortality. Dent et al. (1989)

found that Australian WWII POWs held by the Japanese faced excess mortality rates compared

to non-POW combatants more than 38 years after the war, even though the the two groups had

similar degrees of medical morbidity (Goulston et al. 1985; Tennant, Goulston, and Dent 1986).

Page and Brass (2001) and Page and Ostfeld (1994) report that among US POWs acute malnutri-

tion was correlated with higher risks of death from ischemic heart disease, particularly after age

75. In contrast, studies of Holocaust survivors find no difference in the mortality of camp survivors

compared with other European-born Jews both 20-41 years and 40-50 years following World War

II (Williams et al. 1993; Collins et al. 2004), but the samples in these studies are small.

       I find both positive and negative older age mortality effects of the Civil War POW experience.

Among men younger than age 65 in 1900, POWs imprisoned when conditions were at their worst

were more likely than non-POWs to die of any cause and to die of heart disease and stroke. They

also exhibited more cardiovascular signs and symptoms and valvular heart disease. They were also

more likely to be laborers and were less likely to own property. But among men older than 64

in 1900, those imprisoned when conditions were at their worst were less likely to die than their

counterparts who were not POWs or who were POWs during better times. These POWs were older

than age 30 at captivity and faced a higher mortality rate in captivity than younger men, suggesting

that those older men who survived POW camps may have been more robust.

       This study has several advantages over previous work on the long-run effects of starvation and

the stresses of imprisonment. Twenty-five percent of the Union Army was above 30 years of age at

enlistment2, enabling me to examine how catastrophic stress affects different age groups. Because

records on the Union Army cohorts are in the public domain, I am able to examine a broader array

of outcomes than many other studies. Finally, because the data are based on administrative records,

including detailed medical examinations at older ages, I do not have to depend on self-reports.



1 Confederate POW camps

An estimated 211,411 Union soldiers were captured during the Civil War. 16,668 were never

imprisoned because they were paroled on the field, but of the remaining 194,743 men, 30,218 died

while in captivity (Rhodes 1904: 507). Thus, 7 percent of all U.S. soldiers were ever imprisoned

compared to figures of 0.8 percent for World War II and 0.1 percent for Korea.3 Until mid-1863

many POWs were exchanged immediately. Prisoner exchanges stopped as the two sides argued

over the terms, particularly the treatment of black soldiers, who could be re-enslaved, and their

white officers, who could be executed as leaders of a slave insurrection. Men were exchanged

again in December of 1864 and early in 1865. The mean number of days spent in prison until

death or release for men who were captured prior to mid-1863 was 20 whereas it was 92 for men

who were captured after mid-1863.

       Men who were captured after mid-1863 faced ever worsening conditions as the crowds of pris-

oners increased. In a random sample of soldiers, 4 percent of the men captured before July of 1863

died in captivity whereas 27 percent of those captured July 1863 or later died in captivity. In con-

trast, the total wartime mortality rate was 14 percent (Costa and Kahn 2007b). Although men could

buy food and goods within POW camps and trade with the guards, men who had been imprisoned

for long had nothing left to trade. POWs suffered from poor and meager rations, from contam-

inated water, from grounds covered with human excrement and with other filth, from a want of

shoes, clothing, and blankets (having often been stripped of these by needy Confederate soldiers),

from a lack of shelter in the open stockades that constituted camps such as Andersonville and

Millen, from the risk of being robbed and murdered by fellow prisoners, and from trigger-happy

guards. Andersonville (also known as Camp Sumter and located in Georgia), with a maximum

capacity of 10,000 men held at one point 32,899 men (Speer 1997: 332). As crowding increased,

rations were stretched thin. According to Warren Lee Goss, “The first morning after our arrival

[at Andersonville on May 1, 1864] about twenty pounds of bacon and a bushel of Indian meal was

given to me to distribute among ninety men. We had no wood to cook with ...” (Goss 1866: 75).

By June of 1864 corn bread and corn meal (a large fraction of which was ground cob) became

the principal staples of the diet, and by August most prisoners were reported to be suffering from

scurvy (Marvel 1994: 74, 179). Once pellagra became recognized as a public health problem in the

United States, Niles (among others) argued that veterans’ descriptions of “how the men had a sup-

posed eczema; ... how their skins were rough and hard, and how their hands were sore and cracked;

how their bowels were chronically loose ... [and how] the melancholy deepening into the different

forms of dementia” were suggestive of pellagra but added that “[w]hether or not this was really

pellagra will probably not be positively known” (Niles 1912: 26-27). The chief recorded causes of

death were scurvy, diarrhea, and dysentery. Scorbutic ulcers became gangrenous.4 Andersonville

was emptied of men in September of 1864 when Sherman’s army threatened and, although still

used as a POW camp, never achieved the same levels of crowding.

      Camp crowding was the single most important predictor of death as a POW (Costa and Kahn

2007b, 2009: Figure 2, p. 147). The individual characteristic that mattered the most was age. In

a random sample of soldiers, 14 percent of those who became POWs before age 30 died whereas

21 percent of those who became POWs after age 30 died. In this same sample, 31 percent of those

who became POWs before age 30 at Andersonville died compared to 54 percent of those who

became POWs after age 30 at Andersonville.

2 POW Status and Older Age Outcomes

POWs suffered from starvation, disease, and psychological stress. Apriori, this earlier life experi-

ence could leave either a more robust older population through mortality selection or a frailer older

population through scarring. Suppose that frailty in the population prior to entry in the POW camp

is normally distributed with mean μ with frailer individuals below the mean. Assume that scarring

shifts the distribution toward the left so that everyone is frailer and the new mean is μ  . If selection
                                                                                        
                                                                                 φ((a−μ )/σ)
truncates the new distribution at frailty level a, mean frailty becomes μ  +σ[ 1−Φ((a−μ  )/σ) ]. Whether


the average person becomes frailer or more robust depends both on the extent of scarring and mor-

tality selection. Because I observe the effect of the POW experience on older age outcomes, I can

only determine which effect, on average, dominates.

   The scarring effects of POW status on older age outcomes could operate through several chan-

nels. Poor health when discharged from the army, by limiting men’s ability to work and to climb the

occupational ladder, would increase their chances of being laborers rather than farmers or artisans

and decrease their wealth, their likelihood of owning property, and their odds of being married.

Their lower socioeconomic status might then place them at greater risk of developing cardiovas-

cular disease, either through greater exposure to disease, their worse nutrition, or stress. However,

POW status in itself could also have an effect on later life heart disease.

   The evidence linking starvation, disease, and psychological stress to heart disease is largely

epidemiological. Although there is no clear biological mechanism linking nutritional deprivation

to subsequent chronic heart disease, cardiac atrophy has been found in healthy adult volunteers

subjected to a semi-starvation diet, in starved rats, in individuals on energy-restricted diets, and

in patients suffering from cardiac cachexia. However, during the rehabilitation of healthy adult

volunteers on a semi-starvation diet, heart size increased rapidly after the initial decline (Keys et

al. 1950: 203-206).

   Dietary deficiencies also have cardiac sequelae. Thiamine deficiency leads to peripheral va-

                                                    5
sodilation, potentially resulting in cardiac failure, and selenium deficiency has been associated

with cardiomyopathy (see Webb, Kiess, and Chan-Yan 1986 for a review). Folates and vitamins

B6 and B12 are required for the metabolism of homocysteine to methionine. Elevated homocys-

teine levels are a risk factor for coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke (see the review by

Fairfield and Fletcher 2002). The reporting of such signs of vitamin deficiency as edema and night

blindness while in WWII Japanese prison camps (where the diet consisted mainly of polished white

rice) is correlated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Page and Ostfeld 1994).

   The weakened immune systems of the starved POWs placed them at greater risk of develop-

ing infectious disease and camp crowding increased their exposure to infectious disease. Some of

infectious agents most commonly linked to heart disease include rheumatic fever (valvular heart

disease), the coxsackie B virus (pericarditis and myocarditis), and chlamydia pneumoniae, heli-

cobacter pylori, and dental infections (atherosclerosis via inflammation). Those who have had a

prior attack of rheumatic fever (common in the Civil War armies) are highly susceptible to recur-

rences after future streptococcal infections. A study of former British Far East WWII POWs (Gill

1983) found a higher proportion of deaths mentioning rheumatic heart disease compared to the

general population, but the number of cases was small.

   Physiological changes associated with the dysregulation of the stress system are implicated

in the development of a variety of illnesses, including hypertension and atherosclerosis. Former

POWs are more likely to suffer from depression and PTSD than veterans who were not POWs

(Page 1992) and POWs with PTSD had statistically significant increased risks of cardiovascular

diseases including hypertension and chronic ischemic heart disease when compared to both non-

POWs and POWs without PTSD (Kang et al. 2006).

   Starvation is associated with a fall in heart rate, blood pressure, and blood volume and during

refeeding there is a sudden reversal in these compensatory factors. Cardiac output needs to rise to

handle increased salt, water and energy loads (see Webb, Kiess, and Chan-Yan 1986 for a review).


                                                6
Congestive cardiac failure is a danger during refeeding of starved individuals. Refeeding syndrome

has been noted in Japanese-held WWII POWs (Schnitker, Mattman, Bliss 1951), malnourished

children (Edozien and Rahim-Kahn 1968), and patients suffering from anorexia nervosa (Casiero

and Frishman 2006). The long-run effects of refeeding on chronic heart conditions are unknown.



3 Data

The data come from two different sources – a sample of Union Army soldiers (the Fogel sample),

some of whom were taken prisoners, and a random selection of men who were at Andersonville.

The Fogel sample comes from a full sample of all men within 303 companies. 5 Complete mili-

tary records are available for these men and these provide information on wartime service and on

demographic and socioeconomic characteristics at enlistment. 6 These data contain 3,175 cases of

captivity with known dates of capture and of release or death for 3,040 men. 7 I know which prison

a man entered and on what date, whether he survived or whether he died. These records are not

limited to men who were at Andersonville.

       The National Park Service’s Andersonville database contains 35,323 men and was drawn from

such disparate sources as the lists of the dead and published state muster rolls. 8 While the sample

does not cover the entire population of Andersonville (and probably never can given the lack of

complete records), it comes close. An estimated 45,000 men passed through Andersonville (United
   5
      The data are available at http://www.cpe.uchicago.edu and were collected by a team of researchers led by Robert
Fogel. The sample of 35,570 represents roughly 1.3 percent of all whites mustered into the Union Army and 8 percent
of all regiments that comprised the Union Army. Ninety-one percent of the sample consists of volunteers, with the
remainder evenly divided between draftees and substitutes. The data are based upon a 100 percent sample of all
enlisted men in 331 randomly chosen companies. The sample is limited to 303 companies because complete data are
not yet available on all 331 companies.

      Linkage to the 1860 census reveals that the sample is representative of the Northern population of military age in
terms of 1860 real estate and personal property wealth and in terms of literacy rates.

      Because of the system of prisoner exchange (and the hope that it would be revived), the South had an incentive to
record information on men who were captured.

States War Department (1880-1901), Series II, Vol. VIII, p. 789). The data provide capture

and death dates (but are not always complete) and also information on the soldier’s name, rank,

regiment, and company. I collected a random sample of roughly 1,000 men who lived to 1900 (as

ascertained from their pension records) from this database.

       The men in both samples are linked to their military service records, their pension records

(including the detailed reports of the examining surgeons), and the 1860, 1880, and 1900 censuses.

Linkage procedures for the 1880 census differ across samples. The Andersonville sample used

information on residence and on family members from the pension records, whereas the linkage for

Fogel sample was done purely on name and state (or country) and year of birth. The Andersonville

sample is also linked to the 1870 census, as is a small subsample of the sample of Union Army

soldiers (i.e. those soldiers enlisting in DC, Delaware,Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri,

Ohio, and West Virginia).9 The military service records provide detailed information on men’s

wartime illnesses, wounds, and captivity. The pension and surgeons’ records provide information

on date of death after the war, cause of death, and chronic conditions after the war. These records

also contain information on wartime illnesses (for POWs either before or after captivity). The

censuses provide socioeconomic and demographic information, including on wealth (in 1860 and

1870), occupation, and marital status.

       I restrict both samples to men who survived to 1900 and who were on the pension rolls by

1900.10 I also restrict the samples to men who have information on date of death and, among for-

mer POWs, men who have complete information on capture dates. This leaves 11,025 non-POWs,

889 POWs from the Fogel sample, and 893 POWs from the Andersonville sample. I lose 65 men

in the Fogel sample (4 of them POWs) in the regressions because of missing information on age

in 1900. Information on cause of death is available for 47 percent of the Fogel sample and for

     Because information on cause of death comes from the pension records, men are not at risk to die until they are
on the pension rolls.

50 percent of the Andersonville sample. Cause of death is more commonly available when there

was a surviving spouse. Causes of death is often vague, e.g. “heart disease.” I therefore examine

the combined category of heart disease, as well as the more specific categories of stroke, valvular

heart disease and pericarditis, and the combined category of angina, atherosclerosis, arteriosclero-

sis, coronary occlusion, coronary thrombosis, myocarditis, and endocarditis. Fleming (1997) and

Finlayson (1985) argue that mentions of angina, atherosclerosis, coronary occupation, and coro-

nary thrombosis may represent ischemic heart disease and I will refer to this combined category as

ischemic heart disease though it may not necessarily be equivalent to ischemic heart disease today.

       The detailed records of the examining surgeons provide information on various chronic con-

ditions, symptoms, and signs. Patient accounts, physical examination, and diagnostic information

from surgeons’ exams were used to determine the existence of medical conditions based on di-

agnostic criteria. These criteria, determined by actively practicing physicians knowledgeable in

medical history, were derived from modern medical knowledge while recognizing the limitations

of 19th and early 20th century medicine. The primary limitation is that examining surgeons were

constrained by what they could detect through sight, touch, feel, and smell. For example, the

records describe heart murmurs and their location. Valvular heart disease is diagnosed from a

murmur in the aortic or mitral valve as noted in the records. The examining surgeons diagnosed

arteriosclerosis by feeling whether the arteries had hardened. Arteriosclerosis therefore refers to

peripheral arteriosclerosis and could be either atherosclerosis, an associated disease (such as dia-

betes), or local inflammation. The examining surgeons also noted whether the pulse was irregular

or bounding and the presence of arrythmia, tachycardia, or bradycardia. The examining surgeons

were unable to detect any of the conditions that required modern diagnostic equipment, such as

hypertension.11 However, the team of current physicians who reviewed the data reported that if in
  11
     Shell shock, combat fatigue, and post-traumatic stress (all names for the same phenomenon in different wars)
were not recognized as disorders either during or after the Civil War (see Hyams, Wignall, and Roswell 1996 for a
history of PTSD). The records therefore provide little information on psychiatric disorders.




                                                        9
the field, with no diagnostic equipment, they could not do any better. (For a detailed discussion of

potential biases in the surgeons’ exams see Costa 2000, 2002). Surgeons records are available for

over 95 percent of the men in my sample. These records are less likely to be found both for the

severely wounded and for men who applied for a pension on the basis of age rather than a chronic

condition.

   I examined men’s time spent in captivity in six month intervals and classified men either as

being POWs for a lengthy time during the period of no prisoner exchanges ( non-exchange POWs),

that is captured July 1863 to July 1864, or as being POWs earlier or later, that is captured prior

to July 1863 or captured July 1864 or later (exchange period POWs). These measures reflect both

time spent in captivity and conditions at the time of capture. Although men captured in July 1864

might not be exchanged until December, they faced only about a month of Andersonville at its

worst (and some came in with money or goods) and were less likely to develop scurvy, a sign of

severe malnutrition.

   Table 1 shows that the prevalence of scurvy as mentioned in either wartime records or the later

surgeons’ reports was higher among men who were captured July 1863 to July 1864 than among

men who were captured earlier, later, or were never captured. In the Fogel sample wartime records

mention scurvy for 11 percent of all non-POWs, 14 percent of POWs captured before July 1863,

16 percent of POWs captured after June 1864 and 23 percent for POWs captured between July

1863 and July 1864. The reports of the examining surgeons mention scurvy for 1 percent of non-

POWs, 2-5 percent of POWs captured before July 1863 or after June 1864, and 8 percent of POWs

captured between July 1863 and July 1864. The Andersonville sample also yields differential

scurvy rates by time of capture, but with higher prevalence rates. (Within the Fogel sample the

roughly 100 men who were at Andersonville at its worst had somewhat higher prevalence rates for

wartime scurvy mentions than the men in the Andersonville sample, but slightly lower surgeons’

certificates mentions of scurvy. The results are not shown.)


                                                10
   This analysis combines the Fogel and the Andersonville samples to obtain a larger working

sample. Compared to the POWs in the Fogel sample, the men in the Andersonville sample were

more likely to have been prisoners in the non-exchange period, were more likely to have enlisted

in 1863 or later than in 1861 or 1862, were younger, and were more likely to have been laborers at

enlistment. Compared to exchange period POWs, non-exchange period POWs were more likely to

be laborers at enlistment and less likely to be 1864 enlistees.

   Although among survivors to 1900 men who were POWs in any time period were more likely

than non-POWs to be on the pension rolls before 1890, former POW status by itself did not entitle

men to a pension. In 1900, former non-exchange period POWs received an average pension of

$11.80 per month whereas non-POWs received one of $11.20 per month. Because controlling for

pension amount did not affect the coefficients on POW status, pension amount is not included in

the control variables.

   Compared to non-POWs, POWs were more likely to be volunteers, to have enlisted earlier

(1862), to be slightly better off, and to be from companies that experienced higher death rates,

as might be expected from men who were captured in the field. (However, having been recently

wounded did not predict POW camp survival, perhaps because those who made it to a POW camp

were those less severely wounded.) The results of a probit in which the dependent variable is POW

status and the independent variables are individual economic and demographic characteristics and

the number of men in the company who were ever wounded or who ever died shows that these two

company characteristics were the main predictors of POW status (Costa and Kahn 2007b). POWs

are not necessarily a random sample of soldiers on unobservables either. If a subset of men “fight

to the death” I would never see them in a POW camp. Thus, I am less likely to sample the most

ideological men.

   The veterans used in the analysis were all alive and on the pension rolls in 1900. Because the

data are drawn from administrative records and the only source of death information is from the


                                                 11
pension rolls, the sample cannot be used to investigate morbidity and mortality immediately after

the war. Those on the pension rolls immediately after the war were the most disabled (and men

imprisoned at Andersonville were more likely to be on the rolls than other ex-POWs). Studies of

mortality are possible only once the Union Army pension program becomes a universal old-age

and disability program.12



4 Empirical Strategy

I examine the effect of POW status on mortality subsequent to 1900, among men both younger

than age 65 and those older than 64, by running Cox hazard models of the form


          h(t) = h0 (t) exp(βe (Exchange POW) + βne (Non-exchange POW) + βs SES                                    (1)


where h0 (t) is the baseline hazard. Differences in the specifications are in the socioeconomic vari-

ables used. The initial specification includes only those SES variables describing socioeconomic

status prior to or at enlistment, i.e. dummy variables equal to one if the veteran was laborer at

enlistment, if the veteran enlisted in a city of 50,000 or more, if the veteran had personal property

wealth in 1860, if the veteran was found in the 1860 census, and enlistment year dummies (1862,

1863, 1864-5, with 1861 as the omitted dummy). 13 Later specifications control for subsequent

socioeconomic status (dummy variables equal to one if the veteran was a laborer in 1870, if the

veteran owned property in 1870, if the veteran was a laborer in 1880, if the veteran owned property

in 1900, and if the veteran was married tin 1900) to determine if the effects of POW status are

mediated through socioeconomic status.
  12
      World War II POWs held by the Japanese experienced higher mortality rates for at least 8 years after the war
whereas those held by the Germans did not. Excess mortality was due to tuberculosis and to trauma, including suicide,
with the highest mortality rates among the youngest men (Cohn and Cooper 1954; Nefzger 1970; Keehn 1980).
   13
      Additional socioeconomic variables were investigated, including whether the veteran was a private (privates faced
higher mortality rates in POW camps than non-privates), but none of these were statistically significant and did not
affect the other coefficients.


                                                          12
   I examine the effects of POW status on mortality from all heart disease and from valvular

heart disease and pericarditis, stroke, and from the combined category of ischemic heart disease,

myocarditis, and endocarditis using a competing risks hazard model for both age groups of men.

Other causes of death are assumed to be independent.

   I also examine the effects of POW status on cardiovascular morbidity in 1900 using a series of

probit models of the form


      Morbidity = β0 + βe (Exchange POW) + βne (Non-exchange POW) + βs SES + u                  (2)


where the morbidity measures are arteriosclerosis, irregular heart beat, presence of murmurs, and

valvular heart disease. The SES variables describing socioeconomic status prior to or at enlistment

are the same ones used in Equation 1.

   I examine the effect of POW status on socioeconomic status of men alive in 1900 by running

probit regressions of the form,


     SES = β0 + βe (Exchange POW) + βne (Non-exchange POW) + βs (Past SES) + u                  (3)


where the dependent SES measures are the same ones used in Equation 1.



5 POW Status and Mortality

5.1 Results

The left panel of Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier hazard rates for men less than 65 years of age

in 1900 for no exchange period POWs, POWs captured either early or late, and non-POWs. The

right panel, for men older than 64 in 1900, shows that compared to non-POWs and POWs captured

either early or late, POWs captured during the no exchange period were longer-lived.

                                                13
       Figure 2 shows the hazard rates for death from any type of cardiovascular disease by age group

in 1900 among men with information on cause of death. Regardless of age group, no exchange

period POWs were more likely to die of heart disease than non-POWs and POWs captured either

early or late.

       POWs captured during the non-exchange period and younger than age 65 in 1900 were 1.1

times likelier to die than non-POWs, controlling only for characteristics at enlistment and personal

property wealth in 1860 (see Table 2). POWs captured during the exchange period faced the same

odds of death as non-POWs. Controlling for laborer status in 1880 and property ownership and

marital status in 1900 does not change the results. Neither does controlling for wartime illnesses

and wounds and mentions of scurvy in the surgeons’ exams. 14 The coefficient on an interaction be-

tween POW status and wartime rheumatic fever was not statistically significant (results not shown).

Controlling for arteriosclerosis, valvular heart disease, heart murmurs, and irregular heart rate in

1900 did not affect the coefficients on POW status (results not shown), suggesting that the effects

of POW status on mortality do not operate through conditions already observed in 1900.

       The last six regressions in Table 2 show that the excess mortality of POWs captured during

the non-exchange period and younger than 65 in 1900 comes from heart disease. POWs captured

during the non-exchange period were 1.2 times as likely to die of heart disease as non-POWs, even

controlling for laborer status in 1880, property ownership and marital status in 1900, and wartime

illnesses and wounds. POWs captured during the non-exchange period were 9 times more likely

to die of valvular heart disease (the caveat is that the number of deaths known to be from valvular

heart disease was small), 1.3 times more likely to die of stroke, and 1.8 times more likely to die of

the combined category of ischemic, myocarditis, and endocarditis than non-POWs. These cause of

death effects do not arise from the sample being restricted to men with a cause of death: the fourth

regression yields similar results as the first three regressions on the entire sample.
  14
       Even with no controls for type of POW, a mention of scurvy was not a statistically significant predictor of death.



                                                            14
   Among men older than 64, POWs captured during the non-exchange period were 0.9 times

as likely to die as non-POWs (see Table 3). However, as control variables are added, the effect

becomes statistically insignificant. The excess of non-POWs deaths comes partially from the com-

bined category of ischemic, myocarditis, and endocarditis and also from pneumonia and influenza

(not shown), however, none of the effects were statistically significant. Non-exchange POWs were

more likely than POWs to die of other heart conditions, but the effects are statistically significant

only for valvular heart disease (where the number of cases is small). There is evidence of un-

observed heterogeneity (frailty) among men older than 64, but not among men younger than 65.

Using a gompertz specification and assuming the unobserved heterogeneity, θ, has a gamma dis-

tribution yielded a χ2 (01) of 0.10 and 19.27 for the test of significance of θ for men less than age

65 and greater than age 64, respectively. However, explicitly controlling for this heterogeneity did

not affect the hazard ratios on POW status.

   Tests of the proportional hazard assumption in the regressions in Tables 2 and 3 showed that it

was not met for the first three regressions. (It was met for all other regressions, except for all heart

conditions with controls for later socioeconomic status. Testing the proportional hazard models

on the basis of the Schoenfeld residuals for men younger than 65 yielded χ 2 (11) =16.64, 12.26,

29.86, 34.50, 11.74, 12.11, 7.80, respectively for each of the last 7 specifications.) However,

the alternate strategies of stratifying and restricting the sample to a 15 year observation period

yielded very similar results and satisfied the proportional hazards assumption. When the samples

were restricted to a 15 year observation period, the hazard ratio on no exchange period POW

became 1.182 (σ̂ 2 =0.067) for men younger than 65 and 0.817 (σ̂ 2 =0.079) for men older than 64.

(Testing the proportional hazard models on the basis of the Schoenfeld residuals after regressions

in which the controls were enlistment characteristics and 1860 personal property wealth yielded

a χ2 (11) of 13.93 for men less than age 65 and one of 13.75 for men older than 64.) When the

entire sample period was used, the proportional hazards assumption failed to hold for POWs who


                                                  15
were exchanged, for men who enlisted in a large city, and for men found in the 1860 census. I

therefore re-ran the specifications, omitting 1860 personal property wealth from the specification,

and stratifying on city size and whether the POW was an exchange period POW. I found that the

hazard rate on non-exchange period POW was 1.088 (σ̂ 2 =0.043) for men younger than age 65 and

testing the Schoenfeld residuals yielded a χ2 (7) of 11.17.



5.2 Explanations

Potential explanations for the high survival rates of ex-POWs older than 64 in 1900 include mor-

tality selection in the POW camp and mortality selection when men were in their fifties and early

sixties. There is suggestive evidence that high POW camp mortality rates among older men killed

the frail, perhaps those with latent chronic conditions while in the army, leaving a more robust

population. Among non-POWs who survived to 1900, 11 men had brothers (as determined from

the 1850 and 1860 censuses) who had been POWs. Average year of death for the 7 men with a

brother who had survived the worst POW period was 1920 compared to 1910 for the 4 men with-

out a survivor brother. Although the difference is statistically significant, the small number of men

makes the evidence only suggestive.

   There is no evidence that high mortality rates when men were in their fifties and early sixties

left a more robust older population. When I took the sample of men younger than 65 in 1900

and restricted the sample to those alive in 1 910 and examined their mortality experience after

1910, I found that POWs during the non-exchange period were still 1.1 times less likely to die than

non-POWs (results not shown).

   Comparing non-exchange POWs with non-POWs of all ages in 1900 reveals a non-linear rela-

tionship between age at captivity and older age mortality. I restricted the sample to non-exchange

POWs and non-POWs and created a set of five dummy variables indicating whether the veteran

had been captured prior to age 20, at age 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, and age 35 or older. Controlling for


                                                 16
age in 1900, size of enlistment city, laborer status at enlistment, native-born, and year of enlistment

dummies, I found that the hazard ratios on the captivity dummies were 0.981 (σ̂ 2 =0.080), 1.109

(σ̂ 2 =0.057), 1.083 (σ̂ 2 =0.075), 0.894 (σ̂ 2 =0.091), and 0.807 (σ̂ 2 =0.128). Within the Fogel sample,

the death rate for men at Andersonville was 35 percent for men younger than 20, 30 percent for

men in their twenties, and 54 percent for men age 30 or older.

   An explanation for the poor survival rate of former non-exchange period POWs younger than

age 65 at captivity is scarring. Scarring implies that ex-POWs who faced a lower mortality risk

should do better. Costa and Kahn (2007b) found that those with kin at Andersonville, as proxied

by the number of men in the company with the same last name, were more likely to survive.

Among the men who survived to 1900 and who had been imprisoned when conditions were at

their worst, those who had had kin in the camp (as proxied by at least one man with the same last

name in the company), faced an odds of death of 0.809 (σ̂ 2 =0.074) compared to men with no kin,

controlling for age in 1900 (full Cox hazard results not shown). Having had kin in the camp was

not a statistically significant predictor of older age mortality among men who had been in POW

camps when conditions were better.

   Another explanation, unrelated to scarring, for the worse survival outcomes of non-exchange

period POWs younger than 65 is that the characteristics that enabled men to survive captivity hurt

their survival chances at older ages. One potential candidate for such a characteristic is height.

The tall were less likely to survive POW camps because all men received the same size ration and

the tall need more food (Costa and Kahn 2007b). In very large samples, the tall are less likely to

die of cardiovascular disease (Waaler 1984). However, the camp survival advantage of being short

was small (Costa and Kahn 2007b) and controlling for height in the regressions did not affect the

coefficients on POW status (results not shown).

6 POW Status and Cardiovascular Morbidity

Among men who were younger than 65, having been a POW during the non-exchange period

increased the probability of having murmurs and valvular disease in 1900 by 0.04 compared to non-

POWs for each condition (see Table 4). Men who were POWs during the exchange period were not

statistically different from non-POWs. There was no change in the probability of arteriosclerosis

or irregular heart beat. However, controlling for later life socioeconomic status and wartime health

conditions, both non-exchange and exchange period POWs were statistically significantly more

likely to have an irregular heart beat (results not shown). The coefficients on exchange period and

non-exchange period POW were 0.047 (σ̂ =0.020) and 0.039 (σ̂ =0.020). POW status did not

predict any cardiovascular conditions among men older than 64.



7 POW Status and Socioeconomic Outcomes

Among men younger than 65 in 1900, POWs in 1870, regardless of when they were captured,

were more likely to be laborers and less likely to have any personal property wealth, controlling

for laborer status at enlistment and personal property wealth in 1860 (see Table 5). By 1880, POWs

captured during the exchange period resemble non-POWs. Their laborer status is similar in 1880,

as is property ownership in 1900. However, POWs captured during the no exchange period were

more likely to be laborers in 1880 and were less likely to own property in 1900 than non-POWs.

POW status had no effect on marital status in 1900 (or 1880, not shown).

   POW status did not have a statistically significant effect on the occupational, home ownership,

and marital status of men older than 64 (see Table 6). However, former POWs, regardless of when

they were captured, were less likely to have personal property wealth in 1870. POWs captured

when the exchange system had stopped were more likely to be laborers than non-POWs in both

1870 and 1880, but the effect is not statistically significant. The effects of POW status on property


                                                 18
ownership in 1900 are positive, but statistically insignificant.



8 Conclusion

Using data on Union Army soldiers, I found that imprisonment as a POW had very heterogeneous

effects on older age outcomes, depending on age at captivity. Men above age 30 at captivity

when conditions were at their worst were more likely to die in captivity but 35 years after the

end of the war the survivors had a lower mortality rate than non-POWs or POWs imprisoned when

conditions were better and the same morbidity rate and socioeconomic outcomes. Thirty-five years

after the end of the war, men below age 30 at captivity had worse socioeconomic outcomes, were

more likely to die of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, and faced greater cardiovascular

morbidity.

   The mortality findings for men below age 30 at captivity are consistent with studies of Japanese

held World War II POWs who faced different social, physical, disease, and medical environments

but who also experienced severe malnutrition and even worse psychological stress, (Dent et al.

1989; Page and Brass 2001; Page and Ostfeld 1994), suggesting that there are certain common

sequelae of starvation and the stress of imprisonment. The mortality findings for men above age 30

at captivity may differ from those of Japanese held World War II POWs because when conditions

in Civil War camps were at their worst, mortality rates from disease and malnutrition were higher

than in Japanese POW camps, potentially leading to greater mortality selection in Civil War camps.

Mortality effects may need to be very high for selection effects to operate: the mortality rate for

men above age 30 at Andersonville was 54 percent compared to one of 30 percent for men in their

twenties.
