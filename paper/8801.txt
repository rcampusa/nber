What Have Two Decades of British Economic Reform Delivered?

NBER Working Paper No. 8801
February 2002



                                             ABSTRACT

        Beginning in 1979 with the newly elected Thatcher Government and continuing under successive
Conservative and Labour Governments, the United Kingdom has embarked on a two-decade-long
experiment in economic reform. We present evidence that the reform process has succeeded in making
the UK more market-friendly than its European competitors. In fact, by the 1990s Britain ranked near the
top of the league tables for freedom of markets, in some cases even ahead of the United States. To
evaluate the effects of these reforms we compare trends in macroeconomic outcomes in the UK relative
to the US, Germany, and France. During the 1980s and 1990s Britain halted the relative declines in GDP
per capita and labour productivity that had characterized earlier decades, and partially closed the gap in
income per capita with France and Germany. These gains were mainly attributable to relative rises in
employment and hours. Unlike its EU competitors, Britain was able to achieve high
employment-population rates with rising real wages for workers. The case that the change in economic
performance can be credited to market-oriented reforms is harder to prove. Nevertheless, based on our
own macro-level analyses, and micro-level evidence from several companion studies, we conclude that
economic reforms contributed to halting the nearly century-long trend in relative economic decline of the
UK relative to its historic competitors, Germany and France.

                   What Have Two Decades of British Economic Reform Delivered?

        For much of the 19 th and 20 th centuries Britain, which pioneered the Industrial Revolution, had a

disappointing growth record, falling markedly from the top ranks in the league economic tables. In 1979,

the U K w as 12th in per capita GDP among advanced OECD countries, well below Germany, France, and

other EU econom ies.1 In response to this weak economic performance, recent UK governments have

adopted po licies designed to move the eco nom y back to “prem iere league” status. Beginning with M rs.

Thatcher and continuing under John Major and Tony Blair, these reforms have sought to increase the

efficacy of labou r and prod uct m arkets and limit governm ent an d institutional involvement in econom ic

decision-making.

        The mov e toward more markets and less government is not unique to the UK. Many other

advanced economies also responded to the economic challenges of the 1980s and 1990s by granting

markets more leeway in the allocation of resources and the setting of prices. All the major economies

eliminated restrictions on the flow of cap ital by the early 19 80s. Most privatized state-run industries in

the 1980s and 1990s. All lowered marginal tax rates for high-income earners. Most also made labour

contracts m ore flexible and moved from national w age setting to more localized collective agreements in

the 1990s. For its part, the EU Comm ission pushed comp etition policies and the reduction of subsidies

to declining industries while seeking a unifo rm social charter to regulate labo ur m arket outcom es.

Outside the EU, the other English-speaking economies – the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand –

moved toward less state and institutional intervention in the economy.

        Have two decades of economic reform significantly shifted the market orientation of the UK

economy relative to other advanced OECD economies, or has the UK only kept pace with its peers?

What have the reforms done for aggregate economic output and the average income of citizens? Have the

reforms improved the position of the U K in the econo mic league tables?



        1
         This refers to GDP per capita in purchasing power parity units, as reported in our table 8, which
includes 13 OECD countries. The precise position of the UK varies with the number of countries included
in the analysis and particular purchasing parity adjustment used.
                                                                                                                2

        This paper examines these questions. Section 1 compares the market-orientation of the UK

relative to other advanced economies using a diverse set of market indicators. We find that the post-1980

reforms have made the UK more market-friendly than its EU competitors, and that in the 1990s the UK

ranked higher on som e measures of freedom of markets than the U S. Section 2 contrasts macro-econom ic

outcomes. We show that during the 1980s and 1990s the UK arrested the relative declines in GDP per

capita and labour productivity that had characterized earlier decades, and partially closed the gap in per

capita income with France and Germany through relative gains in employment and hours. While the UK

did not experience an American-style “New Economy” boom, it combined high employment-population

rates w ith rising real wages fo r workers: an achievement that the U S was unable to match until the late

1990s. Section 3 examines the link between the reforms and outcomes. Since there is no ready

counterfactual again st wh ich to com pare the observed UK performance, our analysis is m ore judgm ental.

Based on macro-level analyses and the micro-level evidence available from several compan ion studies,

how ever, we conclude that econom ic reforms contributed to halting the nearly cen tury-long trend in

relative econom ic decline of the U K relative to its historic comp etitors, G ermany and France.




1. The Market-Friendliness of the UK and other A dvanced Econom ies

         “They used, when I first cam e in, to talk abou t us in terms of the British disease. Now they talk
abo ut us and say, ‘L ook, Britain has got the cure. Come to Britain to see how Britain has done it’ That is
an enormous turn-around.” Margaret Thatcher, Financial Times, 15 February, 1988

        “Government should have a role that is enabling: supporting small businesses, encouraging
technological adva nce; investing in science; above all, promoting competition and removing the barriers
to business growth... I call it a Third Wa y ... Sup porting w ealth creation. Tackling vested interests.
Using market mechanisms.” Tony Blair, speech at World Economic Forum, Davos 18 January 2000

        For the past two decades British econom ic reforms have been motivated by a desire to increase

the reliance on market forces and reduce the role of the state in the determination of prices and the

allocation of resources. Mrs. Thatcher’s Conservative governm ent privatized industries and council

hou sing, enacted law s to weaken trade union s, created financial incen tives fo r workers to choose private
                                                                                                              3

pensions, and reduced the benefits available to unemployed workers, all the while preserving national

health and other features of the welfare state. The M ajor government pursued a similar agenda,

abolishing the Wages Cou ncils and privatizing many of the remaining state-owned enterprises. Even

after the defeat of the Conservatives, Tony Blair’s New Labo ur government continued to introduce

market-enhancing reforms. It created tax breaks for employee share ownership programs, opposed EU

directives that were interpreted by private employers as anti-business, and enhanced the work incentives

of the income support system. In the realm of monetary policy, Labour went beyond the Tories by

shifting interest-rate-setting authority from the Treasury to an independent M onetary Policy com mittee.

While there are some exceptions – the Thatcher campaign to centralize the public sector and limit the

authority of local government, and the Blair efforts to ease the formation of unions and introduce a

national minimum w age – the main thrust of UK policy reforms has been to reduce the economic role of

the state and enhance the role of markets.2

        For purposes of analysing the potential effect of these reforms on the economic performance of

the UK relative to other advanced cou ntries, it is importan t to determ ine whether these reform s were

larger, smaller, or similar to those in other advanced countries. This in turn requires measures of the

institutional and policy stance of advanced countries. In the absence of a single GDP-style measure of

the free market stance of economies, we examine a variety of indicators that rate countries by the way

different m arkets determine outcomes. Som e of these indicators are b ased on objective data w hile others

are based on the assessments of expert analysts or surveys of m anagers. Som e of the m easures are

produced by think tanks with conservative ideological bents, such as the “economic freedom” indices of

the Fraser In stitute and the Heritage Found ation. These indices stress particular measures of econom ic

freedom , such as low taxes, which fit a more con servative agenda, while ignoring social inclusion factors


        2
         Since local governm ents must “com pete” for residents and businesses (in the Tiebout sense),
many economists believe that market forces exert greater discipline on the local public sector than on the
central government. We therefore classify reforms which decentralize political decision-making as pro-
market, an d those that centralize autho rity as anti-m arket.
                                                                                                            4

such as spending on education. Another broad set of m easures are the indexes of “com petitiveness”

produced by the World Economic Forum, most recently in conjunction with the Harvard Center for

International Developm ent. These indices mix the stance of po licy, institutions, and specific outcomes,

and give higher scores to econom ically successful social dem ocratic regimes than the freedom indices.

Finally, the OECD and some independent scholars have produced indices of regulations and procedures

in particular markets, such as labor m arkets, product markets, and capital m arkets.

        All of these measures of the market friendliness of institutions have shortcomings. Som e are

formed by weighting linear sums of sub-indices, with the weights determined subjectively, and with some

potential measures excluded. Some are scaled in ways that have little basis in theory or other empirical

work. Some treat all regulations and administrative decrees as if they were rigidly enforced, when in fact

the degree of enforcement of regulations that limit markets varies across countries. All the measures

igno re potential com plem entarities or substitutions among institutions.

        Competitiveness indices have other problems. The groups who provide these measures have

changed their modes of calculating competitiveness over time, so that their indices do not reflect the same

underlying data over time. In 2001, for exam ple, the Fraser Institute revised its historical indices,

producing generally modest adjustments as they accumulated additional data (see www .fraserinstitute.ca)

The W orld Econo mic Forum-H arvard Center for International Developmen t 2000 Comp etitiveness

Report reported tw o different indices, one for “current comp etitiveness” and one for “growth

competitiveness”, reflecting the different weights placed on the same data for different purposes. Finally,

the measures for individual markets can be criticized for focusing on some features of markets and

regulatory mechanisms but not on others. For instance, measures of labour market performance

concentrate on the extent of centralization of bargaining and employment protection legislation, but not

on the potential for court suits over discrimination or insurance of pension moneys. Comparisons of the

market-friendliness of product markets ignore difference in bankruptcy laws, which can greatly affect

business formation and dissolution. While the sub-indices necessarily cover only parts of econom ies,
                                                                                                                 5

they prov ide ch ecks on the m ore aggregate measures. If an aggregate index rates an econ om y as m arket-

friendly while it has highly restrictive labour contracts or a highly regulated p roduct m arket, then we will

know that something is amiss. These measures also allow analysts to relate policies or institutions to the

specific outcomes they are designed to affect, rather than to measures like GDP per capita, which depend

on a wider set of factors.




W here the UK Fits in Econom ic Freedom and C ompetitiveness

        Differences and shortcomings among the indices notwithstanding, the principal indicators of the

market stance of economies show that the policy reforms of the 1980s and 1990s made the UK one of the

most market friendly economies in the wo rld. The high rank of the U K in m arket friendliness at the turn

of the 21 st Century reflects more rapid market-oriented reforms in the UK than in most other advanced

econom ies, rather than a general increase in regulation in other countries.

a. Measures of Economic Freedom

        The indices of economic freedom produced by the Fraser Institute and the Heritage Foundation

value key features of capitalist economies: private property rights, freedom to operate a business, and

freedom of capital and labor markets. Both include measures of free trade, which reflect international

policies, while neither includes measures of imm igration policies. Each treats cursorily the labour market

institutions that have drawn continuing policy attention in the wake of the divergence of unemployment

and employment-population rates between the US and the EU in the 1980s and 1990s. Morever, the

indices differ in their emphasis on particular dimensions of “freedom” (Hanke and Walters, 1997). The

Fraser Institute Index rates countries with military conscription as having less economic freedom, and

gives countries with higher top m arginal tax rates and governm ent transfers and subsidies lower scores. 3


        3
         Com paring the higher ranking that the Heritage/WSJ gives to Israel, which has conscription, than
the Fraser Institute, Alvin Rabushka (2000) argued that the “Fraser Institute index is far superior to that of
the Heritage/W SJ. It is based on far more exten sive research , deliberation, and testing by far m ore
qualified and distinguished scholars”.
                                                                                                           6

The Heritage Found ation/Wall Street Journal index penalizes higher corporate and value-added taxes.

Reflecting the view that even a democratically chosen state sector is inimical to economic freedom, the

Fraser and Heritage indices rate the size of governm ent as important negative in dicators of freedom . Both

measures penalize high inflation, although this is an outcome of economic policy and market function,

rather than an indicator of market orientation.

        A third aggreg ate index of economic freedom was created by Freedom House. This index differs

somewhat from the other two – for example, it ignores the level of taxation but counts freedom of

association in the labour market. The index was produced only one, and so we leave it out of our

analysis. Nevertheless, it is sufficiently highly correlated with the other two indicators that we do no

harm to the analy sis by exclu ding it.

        Wh ile the Fraser and Heritage measures lead to somewh at different rankings of the market stance

of particular countries, the high correlation between them shows that they are measuring essentially the

same phenomenon. For all of the countries covered, including the less developed countries, Hanke and

Walters (1997) report a rank-order correlation between the two indexes of 0.85 in 1995-96. For advanced

OE CD countries, w e obtain a rank correlation of 0.83 betw een the Fraser and H eritage/W SJ m easures.

Most importantly, both indices give a relatively high rank to the UK in the 1990s. The Heritage/WSJ

index ranks the UK third in 1996 among advanced OECD countries in market friendliness (after the US

and New Zealand, tied with the Netherlands) and 5th in 2001 (after Ireland, New Zealand, US, and

Luxemb urg). 4 According to the Fraser Institute index, the UK was tied for second with the US in 1995

among the advanced OE CD coun tries (after New Zealand), while in 1999 it ranked 2nd after New

Zealand and just ahead of the US.5

          In the Freedom House ranking in 1996, the UK was tied with the US and 4 other countries for
the top rank.
        5
      We exclude Singapore, Hong K ong and Bahrein from the rankings since they are not advanced
OECD countries, but in some years they score higher than the UK
                                                                                                               7

a.1 Fraser Institute Index

        Because the Fraser Institute Index (FII) is available from 1970 to the present, while the Heritage

index covers a shorter period, we use the FII to measure the change in the UK’s position over time. The

FII measures the degree of econom ic freedom on a scale from 1 to 100, with higher values reflect m ore

freedom in m arket transactions.

         Table 1 reports the FII for the UK and other major OECD countries every five years from 1970

to 1995 and fo r 199 9. Th e levels and trends in the value of the index for various countries accord well

with informal observations on the level and change in policy stances toward m arkets. For example, most

analysts place the US and other English-speaking countries at the market-friendly end of the spectrum,

and Nordic countries and other social democratic EU countries at the other end. The FII orders the

countries in the same manner. Still, the index has potential errors. It does not deal with the

imp lementation or enforcem ent of regulations that lim it markets, so countries like Italy w ith a sizeable

und ergro und econ om y are arguably given too low a score. It also ignores the use of the judicial system to

regulate m arket transactions, which m ay lead to an overstatement of the market freedom s in the US.

From 1970 to 1975 the index shows a decline in economic freedom in most countries (though not the US)

when governments struggled to control inflationary pressures. This is odd since the US introduced wage

and price controls in this period while many other countries relied o n collective bargaining agreem ents to

contain wage pressures.6 From 1980 to 1999 there was a general trend toward increased market

freedom s.

        Focusing on the UK, the FII tells a clear story about trends in the market friendliness. In the

1970s, before the Thatcher reforms, the UK scored relatively low among advanced countries in the

economic freedom league table. In 1970 and 1975, when the UK had exchange controls, it ranked 17th

and 16 th. By 1980, after the elimination of controls, the UK had risen to 13th position. Over the


        6
        Canada also adopted wage and price controls in the period between 1975 and 1980, and yet the
FII shows a rise in econ om ic freed om .
                                                                                                                   8

following two decades it rose sharply in the rankings, so that by 1999 , the UK sto od second behind only

New Z ealand among the advanced OEC D countries. Measured by the change in FII points, the UK w as

the third most reformed economy between 1980 and 1999, after New Z ealand and Portugal. Thus, in an

epoch of increasing market-friendly economic reforms, the UK reformed more than most other advanced

countries.

        The Fraser Institute index contains seven components, four of which – the total size of

government expenditures, monetary policy and price stability, regulation of international exchange and

freedom to trade with foreigners, and freedom to use alternative currencies – fall outside the purview of

the micro-domestic policies which are our primary focus. Accordingly, in Table 2 we show the three

components of the FII that more closely reflect domestic market freedoms: the structure of economy and

use of markets, legal structure and property rights, and freedom of exchange in capital and financial

markets. 7 As a crude summary, we also report the unweighted average of these components. They show

that the UK ranked in the middle of the pack in 1980 but near the top by 1999, considerably ahead of

most of its EU co mpetitors.

b. World Econ omic Forum /Harvard Institute Competitiveness Scores

        Since 19 80 the International Institute for Managem ent D evelopm ent (IM D) and the W orld

Economic Forum (WEF) have developed jointly or separately a world competitiveness report of

countries. From 1998 to 2000 the W EF collaborated with Harvard University’s Center for International

Development to give the Global Competitiveness Report (GCR) In contrast to the economic freedom

indices, indices of competitiveness measure the “set of institutions and economic policies supportive of

high rates of econ omic grow th in the m edium run.” (GCR, 2000, p 14). Th e com petitiveness scores are

based on a mixture of quantitative economic measures and the responses of executives to questions about


        7
          Freedom of exchange in capital and financial markets includes a subcategory for freedom of
citizens to engage in capital tran sactions w ith foreigners, so this is not exclusively a m easure of dom estic
market activities. Note that the vast majority o f countries score 100 in the legal structure and pro perty
rights sub-index in 1997, while the rem ainder are in the 90+ range, except for Greece.
                                                                                                                  9

the situation in their country. Most of the questions in the 2000 Report ask executives to rate “the extent

to which” a country fits a particular statement on a scale from 1 to 4; earlier reports used a scale from 0

(not at all) to 100 (to a great exten t). The response rate to the survey has varied in the range of 15% to

20% , with non-respond ents having sim ilar characteristics to respo ndents.

        Because the com petitiveness scores are heav ily weighted toward actual (or prospective) econom ic

perfo rmance, the rankin gs of countries d iffer from rankin gs based on the market friendliness of their

institutions. Som e highly regulated coun tries such as Germany, Switzerland, and the N ordic countries,

and others such as Japan that have performed better during various time periods than the m arket-friend ly

English-speaking countries receive higher competitiveness scores. For instance, in 1990 Japan,

Switzerland, Germany, and Sw eden scored higher on the world competitiveness index than less-regulated

UK, Ireland, and Australia. Across all countries, however, Hanke and W alters (1997) report that

competitiveness scores are highly correlated with the Fraser Institute and Heritage/WSJ indices of

econom ic freed om , with rank-order correlation coefficien ts in the area of 0.85 .

        Table 3 shows the competitiveness index rankings for advanced OECD countries in the 2000

Global C om petitiveness Ranking and som e of the sub-indices that go into the agg regate measures.

Column 1 records ranks in the GCR’s “growth competitiveness” index, which is designed to measure a

country’s standing in the factors likely to produce economic growth. Column 2 gives its rank in “current

com petitiveness”, which is desig ned to measure facto rs that are likely to determ ine the level of eco nom ic

activity . While the two indices rank som e cou ntries d ifferently, most notably Germany (poo r in gro wth

competitiveness but good in current competitiveness), they give similar scores to the UK. By either

measure, the UK ranks in upper third or so of advanced OECD countries. This is considerably above the

position of the U K in GD P per capita tables, but falls well short of the top 3 rating that the UK received in

the indices of econo mic freedom .

        Why does the UK rate lower in competitiveness than in market freedoms? The lower ranking

does not reflect differences in the ran king that the GCR and Fraser or H eritage foundations give to
                                                                                                               10

indicators of market freedom s. For example, column (3) show s that the UK is 2 nd in one GCR indicator

that meshes well with the indexes of market freedom -- the time executives say that they spent dealing

with government bureaucracies. Column (4) shows that the UK ranks 6 th in protection of property rights,

which was one of the major factors in indices of economic freedom, ahead of the US, Germany, and

Fran ce. Th e area where the UK does relatively poorly is in the provision of pu blic services. This is

illustrated in columns 5 and 6 of Table 3. The UK scores 17th in terms of overall infrastructure and 20 th in

the quality of pu blic schoo ls. While econo mists are uncertain about the contribution of infrastructure to

national outpu t, and of the effect of scho ol quality on pro ductivity, both factors surely do affect econo mic

performance.8

c. Indices for Sp ecific M arkets: Prod uct M arkets

        To assess the extent and intrusiveness of regulations on business in 1988 the OEC D sent a

detailed questionnaire to member states asking about 1,300 different regulations concerning economy-

wide and industry specific laws, regulations, and administration of laws. 9 The responses to this

questionnaire form the basis of the OECD regulatory data base, which is the most comprehensive and

detailed body of information on product market regulations across countries. The data base measures

adm inistrativ e regulations but does not take account of differences in the use of the judicial system to

regulate product markets. Since legal challenges to business operations are a greater threat in the US than

in most other countries, indexes based on the IRDB arguably over-state the market-friendly orientation of

the US economy. Only in the US do liability suits have the potential to bankrupt firms (as they have done



        8
          The GCR gives the UK a mixed record in use of modern technology. The UK scores among the
top 10 countries in terms of innovation but much lower in its ability to copy technological advances of
other countries (World Economic Forum-HCID Econom ic Com petitiveness 2000 Report). The Fraser
Institute measures of protection of patent rights gives the UK a rank of 14 among 15 advanced countries
(Fraser Institute, 2001, exhibit 4-3A).

        The OECD supplemented the questionnaire with information from other sources, so that about
10 percent of the data comes from other sources. See Nicoletti, Scarpetta, and Boylaud (1999), and the
overview in O ECD (1999, chapter V II).
                                                                                                              11

in the cases of asbestos and breast implants, for example) and only in the US are class action and

individual employmen t discrimination suits a major concern for business. 10 In addition, the OECD

regulatory data base does not really address the extent to which state regulators actually enforce

regulations, which depends on the level of state fund ing fo r gov ernm ent ag encies, the salaries paid to civil

servants, and modes of comp liance.

        There are various w ays to sum marize the information on the 1,300 regulations in the OE CD data

base. In a companion report on the OECD report on the product market regulations, Nicoletti, Scarpetta,

and Boylaud (2000) use a factor analysis procedure to derive aggregate measures of the burden of

regulation in two key domains: inward oriented regulations, covering state control of industry, barriers to

entrepreneurship, and regulations of domestic markets; and outward-oriented regulations, covering

barriers to trade and investment. The scaling is such that higher scores mean a thicker and more intrusive

set of regulations – and thus one nominally less friendly to market mechanisms. Different aggregations of

the information in the database would give different measures to each country than Nicoletti, et al

produce, but would presumab ly give a sim ilar ordering of countries by the scope and depth of regulatory

practices. W e use the N icoletti et al measures in this paper.

        Table 4 records the product market regulatory scores for the OECD countries. In all of the

inward oriented regulatory domains and in the overall score the UK is the least regulated economy. The

US, Ireland, and Australia also show limited regulatory activity. At the other end of the spectrum, Italy,

Norway and Greece have the most highly regulated product markets. In the outward-oriented domain the



        10
           There are factors that work in the other direction as well. The regulatory scale gives the UK a
lower score in barriers to entrepreneurship than the US, which is often cited as the ideal environment for
aspiring entrepreneurs. The gap between the US and UK comes from two sub-indices: one that measures
the “regulatory and administrative opacity” (attributed to the high number of administrative procedures
and services involved in business startups) an d another than measures barriers to com petition. However,
the IRDB may be misleading in this respect, because it fails to account for lenient US bankruptcy law s,
which enable entrepreneurs who fail to start up again with less cost than in most other countries. And the
OECD also failed to collect data on land-use regulations (OECD , 1999, footnote 8) which may be less
restrictive in most parts of the US than the UK or other European countries.
                                                                                                           12

UK is tied with Ireland and Australia for the least regulated economy. Over all domains the UK is ranked

as the least reg ulated of the OE CD econ om ies, with Ireland in second place and the US in third.

        Nicoletti et al (2001) have used information from the OECD regulatory data base to create a

measure of the coverage of regulations for each country from 1990 to 1996 that allows us to measure the

changes in regulatory practices across countries. They find that all of the covered countries reduced

regulations in the 1990s, but that the UK deregulated its markets to a greater extent than did the US,

France, and G ermany. In 1990 the UK w as 7 th in freedom from regulation whereas in 1996 it was at the

top of the table. This illustrates one of our major points: that the market reform stance of the UK

continued post-M rs. Thatcher.

        That the UK developed a more m arket friendly regulatory regime in product markets than

Germany and France fits well with general views of government involvement in these economies. But

this does not necessarily mean that consumers are uniformly better off in Britain. The prices of some

goods such as autom obiles have long been higher in the UK than on the continent, reflecting the structure

of private product markets.11 Still, the OECD has a clear message: the UK has gone from a regime of

relatively m edium regulation of business to a relatively deregulated regim e in the period of econom ic

reforms.

d. Indices for Specific M arkets: Lab our M arkets

        The labour market is arguably the most idiosyncratic market in modern capitalist economies. The

extent and nature of unionization, employer associations, and regulations vary w idely across countries,

leading many analysts to try to explain differences in economic performance across countries in terms of

differences in labour market institutions (for example Bruno and Sachs, 1985; Calmfors and Driffil, 1988;

Freeman, 1998; OECD, 1999). To do this, these analysts have developed ratings of country wage-setting

institutions and employment protection legislation, and have estimated union density and collective


        11
         In April 2000, the UK C ompetition Commission issued a report finding that new car prices were
about 10 percent higher in the U K than elsewhere in the EU – see D etroit New s (2000).
                                                                                                            13

bargaining coverage.

        Table 5 shows how different analysts ranked countries by their degree of centralization of wage-

setting from the early 1980s to the mid 1990s. In this table a high number means that the analyst regards

the wage setting system as highly centralized while a low number means that the analyst regards the

system as decentralized. Most analysts built their rankings from a limited number of “facts”(such as

whether there is a central union negotiating body, whether there is one bargaining federation or many,

etc.) analogous to the way the freedom or competitiveness indices are constructed. Several of the

rankings give rise to ties betw een countries b ecause the underlying facts are sim ilar. Still, there is

subjectivity in the building blocks chosen and, perhaps m ore im portantly, in the weights that analysts

accord them in aggregating to a single statistic. While analysts generally place the same countries at the

top or bottom of the table in terms of market-based wage setting, there are some notable differences (for

instance, in rating Japan or France). The UK is invariably among the countries that have more market

based wage-setting. Over the period of reforms, the UK moved up the rankings as it shifted from a

collectively bargained system of wage-setting to a largely market determined system. New Zealand

followed a sim ilar pattern.

        But rankings can only tell us about changes in relative position. The final co lum n in the table

gives absolute changes in centralization of wage-setting as summarized by Elmeskov, Martin, and

Scarpetta (1998). They code countries from 1 (decentralized wage setting) to 3 (coordinated or

centralized) and specify periods of change. Eight countries change their wage-setting stance in the period

they covered, with five moving towards less centralized institutions while the Netherlands, Ireland, and

Italy moved in the opposite direction.

        Quantitative data on the extent of unionism and collective bargaining coverag e in the U K confirm

this picture of movement toward more market-oriented wage-setting. In 1980 approximately 50% of UK

workers were unionized and 70% were covered by collective bargaining (see Appendix Table 5). By

contrast, twenty-odd years later, in 1997, 30% of UK w orkers were unionized and only 44% w ere covered
                                                                                                               14

by collective bargaining. Relative to its major European competitors, the UK has a smaller fraction of

nonunion workers who are covered by collective bargaining. France, w hich has a very low rate o f

unionization, has a very high rate of collective bargaining coverage because of laws that extend union

contracts to nonunion workplaces. Germany lies somewhere between the UK and France. Over the

1980s and 1990s unionization and collective bargaining coverage remained roughly stable in Germany,

compared to the declines in the UK. This reflects a more general pattern of divergence among OECD

countries in the im portance of union ism in the labour m arket.

        In addition to having different institutions for wage-setting, advanced countries have different

rules th at regulate emp loym ent ad justm ents. E U coun tries like Spain, Portugal and Italy m ake it difficult

to lay off w orkers w ith perm anent contracts, while German y and Belgium m ake it difficult to hire

temporary labor. All continental EU coun tries have w orks councils and require managem ent to consult

with those cou ncils abou t plant closings, which invariably delay s closures and increases their cost.

Employment protection policies effectively shift the property rights of a job from management to the

incumb ent w orker. Sev eral analysts have stressed the role of em ploy ment pro tection legislation (E PL) in

constraining em ployer’s flexibility and ultimately holding down the rate of em ploym ent growth (L azear,

1990; Bertola, 1990; Grubb and Wells, 1993).

        Com parisons of EPL across countries show that throughout the past two decades the UK w as

among the least restrictive countries on the rights of employers to alter employment at will. In the 1994

Jobs Study the O EC D ranked the UK in fourth place in terms of reliance on m arket forces as op posed to

EPL intervention in the labour m arket. Table 6 records rating s of the strictness of the EPL regulations in

the late 1980s and late 1990s by the OECD. The scores given to the regulations are scaled so that low

values (m inimum of 0) imply little em ploy ment pro tection while high values (m axim um of 6) imply

considerable employment protection. The A measures in columns 1, 2, and 4 are based on data for

regular contracts and temporary contracts. The B measures (in column 4, for the late 1990s only) add

additional information on regulations covering collective dismissals. All the EPL measures show that the
                                                                                                              15

UK , US, and other English-speaking countries have the least restriction s on the rights of employ ers to

alter em ploy ment at w ill. Over time, however, the difference betw een the U K and E U coun tries with

more restrictive legislation declined over this period, as other EU countries weakened their regulation of

regular contracts and eased the rules on temporary contracts. Because the UK had relatively weak

regulations to begin with, employment protection legislation is an area where most other EU countries

have moved their policies closer to those of the UK, though substantial differences in employment

protection remain.

e. Indices of Specific M arket: Business Form ation a nd C apital M arkets

        To assess the ease of starting a new business, researchers in corporate finance hav e gath ered data

on regulations covering start-ups (Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, 2000). Columns 1-3 of

Table 7 summarize their analysis in terms of three broad measures of the ease of business formation: the

estimated num ber of procedures needed to start a business, the estimated time to m eet those requirements;

and the estimated direct and indirect cost of m eeting the req uirem ents relative to GD P per capita.

Djankav et al not the wide variation in these measures: “T o meet go vernment requirem ents fo r starting to

operate a business in Austria, an entrepreneur must complete 12 procedures taking at least 154 days and

pay US$1 1,612 in government fees” (Djankov, et al, p. 1). This compares with 4 procedures that take 7

days at a cost of $2806 in the US and even less in Canada (D jankov, et al, Table III). The UK is number 2

in terms of the estimated costs of forming a business relative to GDP, right behind New Zealand and

ahead of the US.

        To assess the protection given to investors to invest or loan money to firms, La Porta, Lopez-de-

Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1999) have developed indices of the rights of investors and creditors in the

various countries. Columns 4-7 of Table 7 present their summary measures of the assessment of law and

order in the cou ntry (on a scale from 0 to 10), based on the International Co untry Risk G uide, and their

indices of shareholder rights (scale of 0 to 4) and creditor rights (scale of 0 to 5). The majority of the

advanced countries obtain the highest value in the rule of law measure, while some of the lower income
                                                                                                            16

countries scoring substantially lower than the maximum 10 score. There is greater variation in the

protections given to shareholders and creditors, at least by these measures. The US, for instance, provides

considerable anti-director protection while Italy does not; whereas the UK provides considerable creditor

rights while France does not. La Porta et al (1999) show that the different legal codes produce different

corporate valuations, but do not attem pt to link these institutional differences to differences in aggregate

national econom ic outcomes.

f. Summa ry

        The evid ence in this section shows that U K governm ents have made co nsiderable progress in

reforming the economy in a pro-market direction over the past two decades. In the late 1970s the UK was

ranked near the middle of all advanced countries in terms of the market friendliness of its institutions.

Some indices put the UK even further down, reflecting such factors as the relatively high rate of

government own ership, exchange rate controls, and high marginal tax rates. By the late 1990s, the UK

stood at or near the top of the rankings – close to and in some cases even ahead of the US. To the extent

that orthodox economic thinking is correct and a greater market orientation of policy and institutions

means better functioning markets and superior economic outcomes, the UK should have benefitted from

these reforms by an improvement in its relative economic performance. What in fact happened?




2. Trends in UK E conomic Performance, 1960-1999

        In this section we analyze the economic performance of the UK relative to the US and its major

EU peers, France and Germany, from 1960 to 2000. We focus on the relative trends in aggregate output

per capita, and on the associated trends in output per un it of labor input and labor input per capita. There

are several reasons for this narrow focus. First, output per capita is the subject of many international

comparisons, and policy-makers regularly monitor league tables comparing gross domestic product

(GD P) per capita. Second, internationally co mparable data on GDP and labor inputs are available for a

long period, facilitating an analysis of changes in UK relative performance in these dimensions. Third,
                                                                                                               17

other macroeconomic indicators, such as the unemployment rate, are highly correlated with labor input

per capita . Finally, and most importantly, although conventional econ om ic reasonin g says that m arket-

oriented reform s will raise total income, there is no claim that such reform s will im prove other potentially

imp ortant outcom es, such as the poverty rate or the distribution of income. Advocates for market-

oriented reform s usually em phasize the goal of increasing incom e. Taken on their ow n term s, then, it is

important to evaluate the effect of the UK reforms on total market income.

        As a starting point, Table 8 presents data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on the

level and rank of GDP per capita for 13 leading countries. Real GDP figures for each country have been

converted to a comm on currency (1998 US dollars) using purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted

exchange rates.12 A comparison of 1960 and 1979 figures for the UK suggests that prior to 1980 UK

relative economic performance was declining relative to the US (from 74 to 68 percent of the US average)

and relative to most other countries, including Germany and France. In 1960 UK output per capita was

similar to the level in W est Germany and 15 percen t higher than in France. By 1979, GDP per capita in

Britain was 15 percent lower than in W est Germany, 12 percent lower than in France, and a little lower

than in Italy. Britain’s position in the league table fell from 3rd to 12th. Over the 1980s and 1990s the UK

did better. Relative to the US, per capita GDP in Britain fell slightly, from 68 to 66 percent of the US

average. Relative to Germany and France the UK gained slightly. Nevertheless, the UK remained 12th

among the 13 countries in the table.

        The comparisons in Table 8 open up a series of questions about how the UK m ight have done

absent its market reforms. Would U K output per capita have continued to decline relative to other

countries in the 1980s and 1990s in the absence of a sustained reform effort? Or, was the relative decline


        12
          The PPP factors used by the BLS are very similar to those used by OECD. For the time periods
shown in the table, the use of PPP-adjusted real GDP (versus G DP at market exch ange rates) mainly
effects cross-country comparisons in 1980. PPP factors suggest that exchange rates for most European
countries (except the UK and Italy) were significantly over-valued relative to the US. Thus, 1980 PPP-
adjusted real GDP figures for Germany and France are 30 percen t lower than market-based figu res, while
PPP -adjusted GD P figures for the N ordic countries are 60 percent lower.
                                                                                                             18

of the UK in the 1960s and 1970s driven by particular forces that would have come to end anyway? To

help answer this question we delve into the sources of differential growth of the UK and three key

competitors: Germany, France, and the US in the pre-1980 and post-1980 periods. We also present some

limited comparisons with Italy and Ireland.

a. Trends in the Growth Rates of G DP per C apita a nd Its C om ponents

        Tables 9 and 10 summarize decompositions of the changes in the relative rate of growth of GDP

per w orking age ad ult (age 15-64 in most cases) between the U K and the key com pariso n countries. W e

analyze GDP per working age adult rather than GDP per capita to remove the variation in per capita GDP

that is attributable to shifts in the fraction of children or elderly in the population, and that are thus

independent of econom ic reforms. 13 The first three columns of Table 9 present the rates of growth of

GDP per working age adult in the 1960-1979 and 1979-1999 periods for each country. The underlying

data for the UK, the US, and Germany and France, which we plot in Figure 1,14 show that the UK had

slower growth in output per working age adult than Germany or France in the 1960s and 1970s, but

somewhat faster growth than the US. The UK also grew more slowly than Italy or Ireland. After 1979,

the UK and the US experienced similar growth rates of around 2.0 percent per year while Germany,

Fran ce, and Italy had slow er growth. Only Ireland, w hich achieved a 3.7 percent an nual grow th rate in

real GDP per working age adult, out-performed the UK and US in the 1980s and 1990s. In terms of

changes in growth rates before and after 1979 the UK performed well relative to Germany, France, and

Italy, and about the same as the US.

        The growth rate in G DP per w orking age ad ult can be decomp osed into the sum of the grow th

rate in GD P per unit of labor input and the growth in labor input per working age adult. The upper panel


        13
          The data on popu lation are taken from U S Bureau of L abor Statistics (2000a). Appendix T able
1 presents data on the changing shares of young and old people in the populations of the UK, Germany,
France, Italy, Ireland, and the US.
        14
         The series for West Germany and France track each other very closely and we have averaged
them to avoid clutter in the graphs.
                                                                                                             19

of Table 9 presents this decomposition using employment per working age adult as a measure of labor

input, while the lower panel shows a decomposition based on hours of work per working age adult. The

underlying series for the UK, Germany, France, and the US are plotted in Figures 2 and 3.15 The figures

show that all countries experienced a slowdown in the rate of growth of productivity after 1979. The

slow dow n was bigger in Germany, France, and Italy than in the UK , and bigger in the UK than the US.

Com pared to the 1960s and 1970s, when growth rates in output per worker ranged from 1.6 percent per

year in the US to 3.6 percent per year in G ermany and France, the grow th rates of outpu t per w orker in

the 1980 s and 1990s were rem arkably similar across countries. The sam e story characterizes the grow th

rates in GDP per hour. In the 1960s and 1970s the UK lagged about 1 percent per year behind Germany

and France in the growth of productivity per hour and even further behind Italy, but after 1979

productivity per hour grew at similar rates in all four countries.

        Unlike the productivity trends, which converged across countries in the post-1979 period, trends

in labor input show little evidence of convergence. Prior to 1979, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, and

Ireland all had declining employment-population rates, although the rate of decline was slower in the UK

than elsew here in E urope. After 1979, the U K (and Ireland) moved to a more “US -like” pattern of rising

employ ment rates, while Germ any, France and Italy continued to experience declining em ploym ent rates,

albeit at a slower pace than pre-1979. Hours per working age adult show a similar pattern of divergence.

In Germ any, France, and Italy, hours declined at abou t 3/4 to 1 percent per year in the 1980s and 1990s,

whereas in the UK the post-1979 trend was negligible, and in the US the tren d was positive.

        The implicatio ns of these shifting trends in prod uctivity and labor inp ut in the UK relative to

other countries are summarized in Table 10. The first column of the table shows the growth rate in GDP

per working age adult in the UK relative to a particular co mparison country. The second and third

columns divide this difference into differences in the growth of GD P per worker and employm ent per


        15
           For reference, Appendix Table 2 presents data on employment-population rates and average
hou rs per working age adu lt for the various countries.
                                                                                                               20

working age adult, while the fourth and fifth columns divide the difference into relative growth of GDP

per hour and hours per working age adult. Panel A decomposes relative growth rates in the “pre-reform”

period (19 60-79), panel B decomp oses grow th rates in the “reform” period (1 979 -1999), and panel C

shows the decomposition of the relative change in growth rates between the two periods. For example,

panel A shows that in the 1960-79 period the UK had 0.63 percent per year slower growth in GDP per

working age adu lt than in W est Germany, and 1.02 percent per year slow er growth than in France. This

resulted from slower relative productivity growth in the UK dominating a more modest decline in the

growth of labor inp uts. Relative to the US, on the other hand, the UK had 0.48 percen t faster grow th in

GD P per working age adu lt in the 1960s and 1970s, due to relativ ely faster produ ctivity grow th

dom inating a relative decline in labor inputs.

        Panel B show s that in the post-1980 reform era, UK productivity gro wth was roughly com parable

to rates in Germany and France, but the UK had stable or rising labor inputs while Germany, France and

most other European nations experienced continuing declines. Thus, the 0.8 percent per year faster

growth in UK G DP per working age adult relative to Germany or France in the 1980s and 1990s was

attributable almo st entirely to the growth in labor inp uts. Again, the contrast w ith the US is different:

relative to the US, the UK had som ewhat faster growing productivity but slow er growth in labor inp uts.

        Finally, Panel C show s that the UK accelerated its econom ic performance relative to W est

Germany and F rance in the post-reform period. Relative to Germany, the differential in GDP growth per

working age adu lt shifted from -0.63 percent per year in the pre-reform era to + 0.84 percent per year in

the reform era, for a net relative gain of 1.47 percent per year. Regardless of w hether labor inputs are

measured by em ploy ment or hours, mo st of this relative gain is attributable to the larg er drop in

productivity in Germany and France than in the UK. A fairly sim ilar story emerges in the com pariso n to

France, although in this case a larger fraction of the UK’s relative improvement is attributable to a relative

gain in labor inp uts in the U K. B enchm arked to the US econo my , how ever, the U K does not fare as well.

In the 1960s and 1970s the UK had faster productivity growth than the US, but this was partially offset by
                                                                                                                 21

relative declines in per capita labor inputs. After 1979 productivity growth slowed down everywhere, but

more in the UK than in the US, though productivity growth rates were still faster in the UK (see Figures

3A and 4A). Th is was only partially offset by the bigger turnaround in the trend toward declining work

activity in the UK.

        Tables 9 and 10 show that the reform era coincided with a reversal of the faster growth in GDP

per w orking age ad ult in G ermany and France than in the UK, due m ainly to the slow er deceleration in

productivity growth in the UK. They also show that after 1979 UK labor productivity grew at about the

same rate as in Germany and France, but Britain had stable or slightly rising labor inputs per capita, w hile

Germany and France had declining labor inp uts. This relative rise in work effort led to higher growth

rates in British GDP per capita after 1979. Finally, the tables show no apparent turnaround in UK

performance relative to the US. Indeed, the comparison of the US to the UK has the same character as the

comparison of the UK to Germany/France. The US had a smaller productivity slowdown than the UK

and a bigger rise in the rate of growth of labor inp uts, with the net result that GD P per capita rose faster in

the US than the UK after 1979, whereas the opposite was true before 1979.

b. Explanations for Differential T rends in Labor P rodu ctivity G rowth

        Much of the improvement in UK econ om ic perform ance relative to G ermany and France is

attributable to the closing of the gap in productivity growth rates. Similarly, the worsened performance of

the UK compared to the US in the post-1979 period relative to earlier decades is due mainly to the

narrowing of productivity growth rate differentials. In this section we consider three explanations for the

shifting trends in labour productivity growth: relative trends in the transition out of agriculture, relative

trends in the rate of growth of capital per unit of labor input; and relative trend s in the quality of labor.




(i) The Shift Out of Agriculture

        One widely recognized source of economic growth is the movement of labor from low

productivity sectors such as agriculture to more highly productive sectors such as manufacturing and
                                                                                                                22

distribution (e.g. Feinstein, 1999). By 1960, only 5 percen t of workers in the UK w ere em ploy ed in

agriculture. In W est Germany and France, however, the fractions w ere 14 and 23 percent, respectively.

The fall in agricultural emp loym ent in these countries in the 1960 s and 1970s can explain som e of their

rapid prod uctivity gro wth in this period. To the extent that the m ovement out of agriculture was comp lete

by the late 1970s, the slowdown in employment reallocation can also help explain the greater slowdown

in productivity growth experienced by Germany and F rance than the UK or the US. Table 11 presents a

share-shift analysis of the effects of declining agricultural em ploy ment on aggregate productivity grow th

rates in the pre-1979 and po st-1979 periods. 16 To a first order approxim ation, the change in aggregate

productivity associated w ith a shift )S in the share of agricultural employm ent is !)S × (1 !R), where R

is relative productivity in agriculture. The entries in colum ns 4 and 5, drawn from sectoral productivity

data reported by van Ark (1996 ), show that R w as about 33 percent in the UK and France, 18 percent in

Germany, and 60 percent in the US in the early 1960s. In light of these differentials, the 8.7 percentage

point decline in the share of agricultural employment in Germany in the 1960-79 period contributed about

0.4 percent per year to the trend rate of growth of labor productivity, while the 14.4 percentage point

decline in France contributed about 0.5 percent per year. By comparison, the much smaller shifts in the

UK and the US had negligible impacts on aggregate productivity (less than 0.1 percent per year). In the

1979-98 period the contributions of the movement out of agriculture were small in all four countries, but

particularly in the UK and U S. These calculations suggest that the declining share of agricultural

employm ent can explain one-quarter to one- third of the faster productivity growth of Germany/France

than the UK in the pre-1979 period17. The slowdown in sectoral reallocation explains about the same

fraction of the 1.2-1.4 percentage point faster slowdow n in productivity growth in Germany/France than



        16
             Appendix Table 3 presents employment shares in three sectors: agriculture, industry, and
services.
        17
          That is the differential shift explains 0.3 to 0.4 percent per year of the 1.2 percent per year gap
in the growth in produ ctivity per w orker.
                                                                                                             23

the U K after 1979. A s these effects are presumably independent of the reform process in the U K, w e will

factor them out before attemp ting to evaluate the contribution of the UK reforms.




(ii) Chang es in the Ca pital-la bor Ratio

        Standard growth accounting exercises decompose the growth rate of labor productivity into three

components: changes in the amount of capital available per unit of labor input; changes in the “quality” of

labor inputs; and technological change or other efficiency improvements.18 Specifically, assuming a

constant returns to scale aggregate production function,

(1)     ) log (Y/L) . " ) log q + (1 !") ) log (K/L)             +   ) log A

where ) log x represents the logarithmic differential (or percentage ch ange) in the variable x , Y/L

represents real output per unit of labor input, q is the relative quality of labor inputs, K/L represents real

capital per unit of labor inpu t, " represents labor’s share (the cost of labor inputs divided by the value of

output), and A is an index of overall efficiency. Since different institutions and policies potentially affect

the accumulation of physical and human capital, and the rate of growth of technological efficiency, we

next decom pose the shifts in the relative trends of UK labor productivity into these three components.

        Figure 4 plots the trends in capital per worker for the UK, West Germany, France, and the US

from 1960 to 1999, using data on real net physical capital stocks from M ary O’Mahon ey. To maximize

international com parability, O ’Mahoney’s series use a consistent set of geom etric depreciation factors.

Similarly, for consistency with the practices in other countries, the underlying investment series for

computer related equipment in the US have been deflated by a traditional cost-based index, rather than by

the hedonic price index developed by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) (see O’Mahoney,

1996, pp. 174-176). Consequently, the growth rate of the US capital stock in the 1990s is somewh at




        18
        See e.g. Griliches (1970). In this framework, sectoral shifts can be modeled as efficiency
improvements.
                                                                                                                24

slower than shown by official BEA data. 19 The data in Figure 4 show that the growth rate in capital per

worker w as faster in all three European countries than in the US bo th before and after 1979. U K grow th

rates in capital per w orker are very sim ilar to those in West Germany, but slo wer than those in France in

the 1980s and early 1990s.

        If labor’s share is constant, then equation (1) im plies that we can adjust the observed grow th in

labor productivity for the effects of rising cap ital per unit of labor input by subtracting (1 !") times the

growth rate in capital per unit of labor. This exercise is carried out in Table 12. As in previous tables, we

consider tw o measures of labor inpu t: employ ment, and total hours. The first three colum ns of the tab le

reproduce the estimated trends in G DP per unit of labor input from the middle of T able 9. Colum ns 4-6

show the corresponding trends in capital per unit of labor. Finally, columns 7-9 report estimates of

productivity grow th rates in the pre-reform and post-reform eras, adjusted for changing capital intensity.

In these calculations w e use an estimate of lab or’s sh are of 0.65 for all four countries. In view of this

over-simplification, the estimates in columns 7-9 should be interpreted as rough guides to the adjusted

productivity growth rates that would emerge from a more detailed calculation.20

        We draw three conclusions from Table 12. First, the growth rates in capital per unit of labor were

similar in the UK, West Germany, and France in the pre-1979 period. Thus, the relatively slow rate of

UK prod uctivity gro wth in the pre-reform period does not reflect a shortfall in investm ent relative to

employment growth.21 Second, in all three countries the growth in capital per unit of labor input slowed

dram atically after 1979 . In the reform era capital per unit of labor inp ut grew at about the same pace in


        19
        The capital series for all four countries are very highly correlated (r>0.99) with the series in the
OEC D International Sectoral Database (1999 edition), and with an alternative set of series constructed
by O’Mahoney (1996) using som ewhat different methods.
        20
         Blanchard (1997) presents an interesting analysis of the so urces of variation in labor’s share
over time. In the UK , labor’s share of G DP was 65.9% in 1960, 69.0% in 1970, 68.5% in 1980, 65.9% in
19990, and 62.3% in 1996 (Office of National Statistics, 1997, Table 1.4).
        21
         Recall from Table 9 that in the 1960-79 period labor inputs per capita grew a little faster in the
UK than in Germany or France. So investment per capita grew slightly faster in the UK too.
                                                                                                               25

the UK as in West Germany (especially when labor input is measured on an hours basis), and somew hat

slower than in F rance. Based on these co mparisons, w e believe that investm ent is not the primary

mechanism behind the gains in UK productivity growth relative to its European competitors in the period

of market reforms. For example, using an hours-based measure of labor inputs, the UK had a 1.21

percent per year gain in the rate of growth of productivity relative to W est Germany after 1979 (see Panel

C of Table 10). After adjusting for the impact of changing trends in capital per hour, the relative gain was

1.10 (!0.15+1.25). Similarly, the gain relative to France in the growth of productivity per hour was 1.21

percentage points per year: after adjusting for shifting trends in capital per hour, the relative gain was

slightly larger (1.43= !0.15+1.58).

        But changing trends in capital growth per unit of labor input go a long way toward explaining the

changing relative trends in productivity growth between the UK and the US. Capital accumulation per

worker slowed less in the US than in the UK (or Germany/France), and after adjusting for this fact, the

trend rates of grow th of productivity are very sim ilar in the UK and US. Using an hours-based m easure

of labor inp ut, the trend grow th rate in productivity in the U K net of capital w as 1.57 percent per year in

1960-79, compared to a rate of 1.41 percent per year in the US. In 1979-99 the trend growth in UK

productivity net of capital was 1.42 percent per year compared to 1.40 percent per year in the U S. Thus,

the changing relative trends in productivity growth between the two countries are well explained by the

changing relative trends in capital per w orker.




(iii) Chang es in Labo r Qu ality

        A final source of growth in labor produ ctivity is rising labor quality, driven by increases in

educational attainment or shifts in other skill characteristics of the labor force. Availab le data suggests

that the rise in form al education qualifications was bigger in the U K than in Germany (e.g., Broadberry

and W agner, 1996), although the disappearance of the apprenticeship system in the UK (Blanchflower

and Lynch, 1994) suggests that Britain has fallen behind other E uropean countries in one area of skill
                                                                                                                26

formation. We evaluate the impact of changing labor quality on productivity by: 1) estimating a micro-

level wage equation which relates individual earnings to observed characteristics such as education,

vocational qualifications, gender, and age; and 2) by u sing the estimated co efficien ts in a base year to

evaluate the changes in the relative quality of the labor force by calculating average predicted wages for

workers in two different years, and forming the ratio of these averages (see Griliches, 1970).22 This

method weights changes in different characteristics by the same market metric (relative earnings) that

und erlies the con structio n of G DP statistics. A prob lem is that co efficien ts from different base years will

give different estim ates of the ch ange in labor qu ality w hen the m arket returns to different skill

characteristics change over time.

        We use different data sets for different co untries in this analysis. For the UK , there is no single

micro data source that spans the past four decades. T he best available source is the General Household

Survey (GHS ), which has sampled roughly 10,000 workers each year from 1974 onward, and includes

detailed inform ation on both academic and vocational qualifications. W e use GH S data to estimate

changing labor quality in the UK over the period from 1975 to 1996. For the US, the March Current

Population Survey (CPS) provides annual data from 1967 onward. Comparable data were collected in the

196 0 Censu s. Pooling there data sources it is possible to construct estim ates of changin g labor qu ality in

the U S econo my over the 1959 -99 period. For Germany there are no publically availab le data sets

com parable to the GHS or CP S. The Germ an Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) provides micro data for a

fixed panel of households starting in the early 1980s. Detailed cross-tabulations of the age, education,

and gender distribution of the G erman lab or force (based on the M ikrozensus) are available irregularly

starting in 1976. We use a combination of the GSOEP micro data (to estimate the coefficients) and the

Mikrozensus cross-tabulations to estimate changes in West German labor force quality over the period

from 1976 to 1999 . We drop France from our analysis due to the absence of publicly available micro data


        22
         In practice, we constructed weighted averages that weight each worker by his or her relative
hours of work.
                                                                                                              27

sets on labor skills and earnings over time.

        Table 13 summarizes our estimates of the relative rates of change in the quality of labor in the

UK , West Germ any, and the U S. For the UK , our micro level wage m odel includes a m easure of years

of total schooling, dummies for three levels of academic qualifications (university degree, A-levels, 3 or

more O-levels), dummies for three levels of vocational qualifications, and dummies for ten 5-year age

categories, fu lly interacted with gender. The estimates in T able 13 use coefficien ts from a model fit to

1984-86 data.23 The implied rates of growth in labor qu ality are abo ut 0.2 percentage points per year in

the late 1970s and 0.9 percentage points per year in the 1980s and 1990s. The relatively rapid pace of

quality growth in the 1980s and 1990s reflects a substantial rise in averag e education am ong UK workers

(+1.75 years fro m the mid-1970 s to the mid-1990s) coupled with rises in the fractions of w orkers with

university degrees and vocational qualifications (see Appendix Table 4). Offsetting these gains was a 10

percentage point rise in the fraction of women. Since women earn substantially less than men, this trend

has slowed down the growth of labor force quality in the UK.

        For West German y, our wage determination model includes a full set of interactions of gender

with eleven 5-year age categories and five education categories. These 110 cells represent the finest level

of detail available in published cross-tabulations of age, education, and gender from the Mikrozensus. 24

Comp ared to the UK , the rate of growth of labor quality in W est Germany was relatively high in the late

1970s but much slower in the 1980s and 1990s. This is because the distribution of workers across



        23
         We use this for comparability with the German model, which is fit to 1985 GSOEP data. Use of
estimated coefficients from earlier years give slightly slower rates of growth, since the wage disadvantage
for women is higher and the return to education is lower. Estimates from later years give higher rates of
growth of quality.

        24
          The edu cation categories are: a regular university degree (or m ore); a techn ical college d egree; a
“meister” (master craftsman) qualification; a completed apprenticeship; and a residual category that
includes those w ith only a high school education and those w ho started but did not finish a post-
secondary program. The 1999 cross-tabulations include all of Germany. This may lead to some
dow nward bias in the trend in education over the 1980 -99 period. Over the 1980-89 period the tren ds is
similar to that observed over the longer period.
                                                                                                                 28

education categories in Germany changed only modestly, while fraction of female workers increased from

38 percent in 1980 to 43 percent in 1999.

        For the US our wage determination model includes years of education, a dummy for a college

degree, dummies for nonwhite race and Hispanic ethnicity, and full interactions of gender with ten age

categories. Over the 1959-79 period we estimate that the average quality of the US workforce rose by

about 0.3 percent per year. The main co ntributors were a rise in average edu cation (from 10.5 to 12.4

years) and in the fraction of workers w ith a college degree (from 8.8 to 17.5 percent). Working against

this trend were a rise in the fraction of y oun g workers (from 31 percent under the age of 31 to 41 percen t)

and a 10 percentage point rise in the fraction of women (from 35 to 45 percent). Over the 1980s and

1990s our mod el suggests that labor force quality growth was a little faster than in the 1960s and 1970s,

despite a slowdown in the rate of growth of average years of education. Contributing factors were a drop

in the fraction of young workers and a dramatic slowdown in the entry of women.

        The key conclusion from T able 13 is th at labo r force quality grew faster in the UK in the post-

1979 reform era than in West Germany or the US. The differential relative to Germany is 0.66 percentage

points per year. Assuming that labor’s share is 65 percent, this gap would be expected to lead to about

0.4 percentage points per year faster growth in labor productivity in the UK than in Germany. A similar

calculation suggests that relative improvements in labor force quality contributed to a 0.3 percentage

point per year difference in productivity growth relative to the US. Since column 8 of table 12 shows

that labor produ ctivity adjusted fo r trends in capital grew at about the same rate in all three countries in

the 1979-98 period, the implication is that UK productivity growth net of labor quality growth was slower

than expected in the reform era, relative to Germany and the US. The absence of data on the

characteristics of UK and Germ an workers in the 1960s, preclude any definitive assessment of whether

shifts in the trend grow th in labor quality can account fo r the bigger slow dow n in productivity gro wth in

West Germany than Britain. Extrapolating from limited data for the late 1970s, it appears that the

growth rate of labor force quality accelerated in the UK and declined in G ermany after 1979/80. These
                                                                                                              29

patterns are consistent with the relative changes in productivity growth rates.




(iv) Summ ary of Chang ing T rend s in Productivity Gro wth

        Table 14 summarizes our attempt to decompose productivity growth in the UK, West Germany,

France, and the US into compon ents attributable to the movement out of agriculture, the rise in capital per

unit of labor input, and changing labor quality. For simplicity, we focus on trends in productivity per

hour 25. Sectoral shifts out of agriculture help explain some of the more rapid productivity growth of

France and Germany relative to the UK (or US) prior to 1979. After 1979, most of the adjustment was

com plete, leading to a bigger productivity slowdow n for France and Germany than the U K or US .

Increasing capital per unit of labor is an im portant co mp onent of productivity gro wth in all countries.

Trend rates of capital growth are similar in the UK, Germ any, and France, however, suggesting that

relative investment trends have not been a major source of differential productivity growth am ong these

three countries. The slowdown in capital accumulation was smaller in the US, and an adjustment for

capital brings the productivity trends in the US and the U K into close alignm ent.

        Adjusting for sectoral shifts and capital trends, the productivity growth rate in the UK in the

1960-79 period was 1.5 percent per year – 0.7 to 0.9 percent per year lower than in West Germany or

France, but 0.2 p ercent per year higher than in the US. Given the lim itations of the available data we are

unable to estimate ho w m uch of the gap betw een the U K and its major European comp etitors w as due to

slower growth in labor quality: we suspect this may be a part of the story for the UK-Germany

differential. After 1979 adjusted UK productivity growth was 1.4 percent per year – only slightly below

the rate in the previou s decades, and about equal to the rates in Germany, France, and the US. We

estimate that the UK had somewhat faster growth in labor quality than Germany or the US in the 1980s

and 1990s. The growth rate in productivity in the UK attributable to efficiency gains, technological



        25
             The calculations for trends in produ ctivity per w orker are similar.
                                                                                                             30

change, and other unobserved factors was therefore slower than in West Germany or the US.

        The bottom line is that while the various factors that we have examined explain some of the

imp roved relative p erformance of the UK in the era of market reform s, there still remains an upswing in

the growth of GDP per working age adult (and per capita) in the UK compared to its major EU

comp etitors.




3. Relating Reforms to Performance

        Did the economic reform s adopted in the UK in the 198 0s and 1990s cause the changes in

economic performance documented in the previous section? Given the complexity and overlapping

nature of the reforms, and the difficulty of specifying w hat w ould have hap pened in the U K econom y in

the absence of refo rm, this is a difficult question. Rather than attempt to answ er it, we address a more

modest question: is there a plausible link between some of the major reforms and the economic changes

we have identified? Our analysis highlights two key facets of the change in the economic performance of

the British economy after 1979:

        1. (Produ ctivity). Pre-1 979 , UK prod uctivity gro wth was about 1 percen t per year slower than in

        Germany or France (net of sectoral shifts). After 1979 the gap disappeared. None of the

        convergence is explained by trends in capital accumulation; some may be due to rising labor

        quality in the UK. After adjusting for trends in capital accumulation, trends in relative

        productivity growth in the UK and US were very similar before and after 1979.

        2. (W ork Effort). Pre-1 979 , employ ment rates and hours per capita were declining more slo wly

        in the UK than Germany/France. After 1979 this difference widened, contributing to faster

        growth in GDP per capita. Although work effort rose relative to Germany and France, it has not

        kept pace with trends in the US.

        Potential explanations for the productivity resu lts include reform s that lowered barriers to

productivity growth in the UK, or that generated once-for-all increases in the productivity of UK
                                                                                                           31

businesses. Potential explanations for the work effort results include reforms that increased the incentives

for work in the UK relative to continental Europe.




a. Productivity-enhancing Reforms

        Many UK po licy reforms could have contributed to rising labor productivity, including laws that

have weakened the coverage and power of trade unions, leading to changes in union policies;

privatization of nationalized industries; the creation of incentives for self em ploym ent and share

ownership.

        Some of the most prominent early reforms introduced by M rs. Thatcher were designed to reduce

trade union power. The Employment Acts of 1980, 1982, and 1984 limited secondary picketing,

abolished statutory un ion recognition procedures, weakened the closed shop, and m andated chan ges to

internal union governance (including compulsory pre-strike balloting). In addition, other government

actions, such as the privatization of highly unionized state-owned industries and the removal of contract

requirem ents to pay union-negotiated w ages, substantially weakened the governmen t’s indirect support

for unionism and collective bargaining (Pencavel, 2002). Union membership rates, which had reached a

peak of over 50 percent in 1980, declined steadily in the subsequent decades and by 1999 stood at under

30 percent of wage and salary workers (see Appendix Table 5). Strike activity plummeted in the 1980s

(Pencavel, 2002). The presence of multiple unions in the same work place, which contributed to some of

the worst excesses of British industrial relations in the pre-1980 period, also fell. The evidence shows

that the relationship between productivity and collective bargaining shifted in this period. Using data

from the Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (WIRS) conducted in 1998 , Pencavel (2002) concludes

that by the end of the 1990s union ized establishm ents w ere no less productive on average than their

nonunion counterparts. By comparison, Pencavel’s analysis of similar data from the 1990 WIRS, and

studies by other researchers (e.g., Machin, Stewart, and van Reenan, 1993) suggest that unionized

establishm ents suffered a significant prod uctivity disadvantage in earlier years.
                                                                                                              32

        These findings suggest that reforms linked to reductions in trade union power had some impact

on measured UK productivity. For example, if the 43 percent of private sector employees in 1979 that

were working in unionized establishments had 10 percent lower productivity than other workers, then the

elimination of the union productivity gap could contribute to a 4.3 percentage point gain in aggregate

productivity between 1979 and 1999. Some analysts have argued that the changed industrial relations

climate in the UK has led to a permanent shift in the prod uctivity gro wth rate (Bean and Crafts, 1996).

However, the em pirical analy sis on this is relatively limited (see Pencavel, 2002), and we regard the 4.3

percentage point gain over the entire period as a generous upper bound on the potential gains associated

with elimination of the negative prod uctivity effect of trade unions. 26

         What about the effect of privatization of industries on productivity? In 1979 12% of UK GDP

was produced in publicly owned co mp anies; in 19 97, just 2% of UK G DP was produced in publicly

owned co mpanies. W hile, as Haskell and Green (2002 ) show , productivity grow th was not the primary

imp etus fo r privatization in the early Thatcher years, the widespread belief that private businesses operate

more efficiently than state-run businesses suggests that privatization of this magnitude could have

contributed to the improvem ent in relative productivity in the 1970s-1990s. Their industry-level evidence

shows that privatization per se had no large effect on pro ductivity, but that in many cases prod uctivity

increased in the period before privatization as the governm ent sough t to improve operations in order to

make the business attractive to the private sector. Labor productivity between 1980 and 1992 went up for

plants that were public in 1980 and private in 1992, with the increase concentrated in the period


        26
          One way in which union s might in theory have reduced lab or produ ctivity is by causing firm s to
invest less through a “hold-up” effect: a unionized firm that invests in new equipment can expect to have
to pay higher wages in the future, thereby reducing the effective return on capital (Grout 1984). Our
evidence gives no indication that this occurred in the UK. Despite the decline in unionization rates in the
UK, and the apparent shift toward more co-operative relations with employers, the rate of growth of
capital per worker (o r capital per hour) did not accelerate in the U K relative to West Germany or France.
Either the under-investment effect was relatively small before the reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, or de-
unionization and an improved industrial relations climate have had little effect on the investment calculus
of British employers.

immediately preceding privatization. They, and other analysts, have stressed that increased competition

after privatization appears to be the key factor differentiating sectors where privatization was associated

with improved productivity and sectors w here it was associated with stagnation or declines in

productivity relative to private firms or international benchm arks.

        To get a rough estimate of how much this might have added to aggregate productivity growth, we

assume, as they do, that the process of privatization accounts for this improvement. Appendix Table 7

shows that 1.4% of the UK workforce was employed in nationalized industries in 1995 compared to 7.3%

of the UK w orkforce in 1975, which indicates that privatization shifted nearly 6% of the work force from

the public to private sector. While there is no single “best” estimate of the effect of privatization on

productivity, a generous estim ate based on Haskell and Green’s plant data (T able 6, labour prod uctivity

line) is that privatization induced a gain in labour productivity of nearly 20% above the private sector

increase. This would imply an increase in aggregate productivity of 1.1% between 1979 and 1999.27 W e

regard this as a generous upper boun d on the potential gains associated with privatization since it gives all

of the privatized sectors the 19% gain, w hereas productivity did not in fact improv e in some indu stries.

        Another area where the UK has made major micro market-oriented changes is in the introduction

of various “shared compensation” programs which give employees a stake in the firm performs, either

through profit-sharing or share ownership. Evidence in Conyon and Freeman (2001 ) shows that

productivity is higher in firms that have such programs compared to those that do not have such

programs. Not all of the programs that the UK government has favoured with tax relief have a positive

impact on productivity, but the most important programs -- the approved profit sharing scheme introduced

in the 1978 Finance Act, which the government replaced with an all-employee share plan in 2000 -- has

an estimated productivity effect in the area of 10% (Canyon and Freeman, 2002, Exhibit 5c, based on


        27
          Our 1.2% estimate comes from taking the 1992-1980 rate of prod uctivity gro wth in the plants
that moved from public to private of .44 log points, subtracting the 1992-1980 productivity growth of
private plants (.27 log points) to obtain a privatization boon of .17 log points, which is 19%. Multiplying
this by the 6 percentage point shift gives an estimate of 1.1%.

stock market returns) to 18% (exhibit 4, based on production function estimates). Millward, Bryson, and

Forth (2000, Table 6.13) show that there was an increase in the proportion of industry and comm erce

establishm ents w ith 25 or more emp loyees having profit-sharing plans from 19% in 1984 to 46% in 1998.

Inland Revenue data also show a large increase in the number of workers who received tax advantaged

payments under government approved profit-related schemes. In 1979 approximately one quarter as

many workers w ere likely to have been covered by plans. 28 On the basis of the establishment surveys and

Inland Revenue data, we estimate that the proportion of British workers covered by these plans increased

by approxim ately 2 0 percentage points. This implies a gain in productivity gain on the order of 2.0% to

as high as 3.8%.29

        The British reforms also encouraged workers to become self-employed. Appendix Table 6

shows that the proportion of the w ork force in the UK that w as self-emp loyed rose from 8.4% in 1980 to

13.1% in 1990, and then stabilized . Over the entire period, the prop ortion self-employ ed rose by 4.3

percentage points. In general, self-employed workers earn less than wage and salary workers, with about

a 10% differential between the tw o. Interpreting this differential as the result of differences in

productivity, the implication is that this reform reduced productivity by 0.4 percent. By contrast, the

percentage of workers who were self-employed in Germany and the US fell over this period, with the

decline in German self-employ ment due largely to the drop in agricultural em ploy ment.

and productivity (4.3% ) , privatization (1.1%), profit and share ow nership schem es (2.0% ) and self-

show a big trend but sm aller m agnitudes than in the establishm ent survey.

         We base this estimate by multiplying the 10% productivity effect by the 20 point increase in the

employ ment (-0.4% ), we estimate the micro-ev idence of the effect of particular reform s on prod uctivity

may have raised UK productivity on the order of 7% or approximately 0.35% per year, which is about

one quarter of the d ifference in growth rates betw een the p re-reform 1960-79 and the 1979-99 reform

period shown in part C of Table 10, and a potentially higher proportion of growth rates adjusted for the

improved quality of the work force. These estimates are, to be sure, crude. They are based solely on

changes in the UK rather than changes in the UK relative to other countries, though we have seen that the

UK reform s were considerably greater than those in France, Germany, and the U S. W hat w e con clude is

that the estimated effects of the micro-reforms cumulate to an order of magnitude that suggests that they

explain part of the acceleration in U K productivity gro wth com pared to G ermany or France.




b. Reforms in the Incentives for W ork

        Many important reform s have affected the econom ic incentives for w ork in the UK relative to

other advanced countries, including West Germany and France. These include changes that lowered the

generosity and availability of un employ ment benefits; taxation of v arious prev iously untaxed socially

provided benefits, elimination of the earnings-related supplem ent, suspen sion of indexing of b enefit

levels for several years in the 1980s, elimination of unemployment benefits for young people,

establishm ent of the R eStart and later New Deal program s to m onito r job search effort of benefit

claim ants (v an R eenan, 2002 ); lowering of marginal tax rates; and the introd uction of the Family Credit in

1988 and ensuing 1999 Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) to improve the work incentives for

families with low incomes (Hoynes and Blundell, 2002); reforms in pensions designed to increase labor

mobility. The Thatcher era reforms sought to increase the incentive to work (Blanchflower and Freeman,

1993) and ensuing reforms had a similar intent. If these reforms exceeded those in France and Germany,

they might help explain the improved employment rate in the UK versus those (and other) advanced

OE CD countries.

        Con sistent with the picture given by our indices on the labo r market (Tables 5 and 6), it appears
                                                                                                           36

that in som e dim ensions that might affect em ploy ment, the UK did indeed undertake greater m arket-

oriented changes than other advanced countries. Table 15 shows that from 1965-72 to 1988-95 the UK

reduced the average replacement rate of the unemployment benefit system (the ratio of unemployment

benefits to the previou s wage) by more than an y other country, so that by the 1990s it had the lowest rate

among covered countries. B ecause unemploy ed w orkers receive other benefits – housing subsidies, child

support, and so on – the reduction in support is arguably less than that indicated by the fall in the

replacement rate. Still, the table captures the greater effort by the UK than m ost other countries to reduce

the disincentive to work. Studies that look at the impact of changes in the replacement rate and other

measures of unemployment benefit on unemployment or employment show that reforms that lessen the

payoff and in particular the length of access to benefits tend to increase em ploy ment, though only

modestly.30

        Hoynes and Blundell (2002) have examined the shift in UK welfare support toward “in-work”

benefits. By shifting supp ort to w orking families, the W FTC reform should also increase em ploy ment.

They show, how ever, that any such effects are relatively sm all, in large part because U K in-wo rk benefits

are counted as income for other benefits, notably rent rebates under the Housing Benefit, so that the effect

of these reforms on incentives to work were relatively modest. In addition, the UK increased the

generosity of other welfare program s at the same time, further reducing the employm ent incentive in these

reforms. The result is that very little of the rise in the employm ent rate of women can be plausibly related

to these changes. Van Reenan’s (2002) analysis of the New Deal programme initiated by the Labour

Government gives a similar picture of modest impacts of reforms on employment. In this case, the

combination of assistance in job search, wage subsidies to employers, education and training coupled

with time limited benefits produced an estimated gain of 17,000 employed yo ung person s – a mod est

Deschenes (1999).
                                                                                                             37

        Some might argue that the decline in union power and increase in inequality that the various

labour market reforms helped bring about may have contributed to the expansion of employment. Since

unionisation fell rapidly in manufacturing, where employment was decimated, it is difficult to make any

sectoral link between changes in union power and growth of jobs. On the wage side, the fact that real

wages in the UK rose throughout the 1980s and 1990s makes it hard to tell a story in which declining

wages created em ploym ent. Similarly, the fact that groups and sectors where wages increased the most

had the biggest increase in employment also raises doubts about any simple micro reform-job creation

story. The biggest problem in assessing the contribution of the reform s on em ploym ent from micro

studies is, of course, that the macro-performance of the British economy dominates overall employment

patterns. In the 1980s through the early 1990s the UK had relatively high unemployment despite the

various economic reforms because of poor macro-economic policy and outcomes. The adverse effects of

high and rising unemp loyment masked any positive effects of micro-institutional changes on labor market

outcomes. From the mid 1990s to early 2000s the employment-creating effects of an extended boom

dominated any impacts of micro-reforms on outcomes. If the market-oriented policy reforms in the

labour m arket contributed to the length and extent of the econ om ic exp ansion they would indeed help

explain the good performance of the UK in employment in this period, but such a contribution cannot be

readily determined from micro-economic data.




c. An alternative approach

        There is an other way to assess the impact of the UK reform s on econ om ic perform ance. This is

to relate country-level economic performance to indicators of market-oriented institutions and policies

such as the Fraser Institute Index (FII), and then use the estimated coefficients to estimate how much the

UK reforms affected UK outcomes. As with other cross-country analyses, this procedure has some

advantages and disadvantages. O n the plus side, it provides a statistical assessment of purported effects
                                                                                                               38

of reforms, with an explicit counterfactual posed by the economic performance of countries that did not

change their regulatory stance. Using the Fraser Institute data from 1970 to 1995 w e can estimate m odels

that include country specific fixed effects, thus focusing on the effects of country-specific changes in the

regulations and institutional features summarized in the FII. On the negative side, this method does not

isolate the effects of reforms in the UK per se. Rather, the estimated coefficients will reflect the

comb ined experience of all the countries that undertook sub stantial free market reforms, including those

that have not done particularly well in recent decades, like New Zealand. Pro-market reforms may have

been the right medicine for the UK but not for New Zealand. Or, reforms in countries like New Zealand

may have been overpowered by other forces. Still, it is useful to examine what such an analysis shows

about the impact of reform s similar to those adop ted in the U K on advanced countries in general.

        Table 16 records the coefficients and standard errors for a set of cross-country regressions of the

level and grow th of various macro-econom ic outcom es on the Fraser In stitute Indexes reported in Table

1. Since the FII is reported every five years, the calculations relate to five year intervals starting in 1970.

When the dependent variable is the log of the level of an outcome, it refers to average over the same five

year period. Wh en the dependent variable is the log change in the outcome, it refers to the ensuing five

year period: thus, the FII for 1970 is related to the change from 1970 to 1975. For 1995, the change

relates to 1995-199 9, adjusted to allow for the fact that this change covers 4 rather than 5 years.

        Each line in the table comes from a separate regression. The odd numbered regressions include

unrestricted year effects, and are effectively pooled cross-sectional com pariso ns across coun tries with

different levels of the FII. The even numbered regressions include both y ear and country dumm ies: these

models relate changes in the dependent variable to changes in the FII within countries, while controlling

for average changes across countries that had no change in the value of the FII.

        The odd-num bered estim ates that hav e the dependent variable in levels show that countries with

greater market freedoms have higher GDP per capita, higher productivity per employee, and higher

employ ment per adu lt in the population. In part this reflects the fact that the countries with the highest
                                                                                                              39

FII scores include the US and Canada w hile those w ith the lowest scores include Portugal and Greece.

By com parison, the odd-numbered estimates with the dependent variable in differences suggest that

countries w ith higher values of the FII have slow er growth in GDP per capita an d GDP per w orker.

Again, this presumably reflects that growth rates have tended to be slowest in countries like the US and

Canada with higher values of the FII, and faster in countries like Portugal and Greece.

          Arguably, more weight should be given to the estimates in the even-number rows, which include

country dum mies, and therefore reflect the effects of reforms on the levels or gro wth rates of the m acro

outcom es, relative to past levels or growth rates in the same country. Examination of these estimates

suggests that reforms have moderate positive effects on the growth in employment per capita, but no

systematic effect on any of the other outcome variables. This is consistent with the evidence that the UK

reforms contributed to the country‘s improved employment record but raises some doubt about the impact

of the reforms on prod uctivity. Th e weakness o f the cross country evidence means that the case for a

linkage between market-oriented reform and prod uctivity gro wth must rest on the kinds of U K-specific

micro-level analyses conducted in Green and Haskell (2002), Conyon and Freeman (2002), and Pencavel

(2002).




4. Conclusion

          This paper has examined two main facets of recent British experience: the market-oreinted

reforms that the UK undertook in the 1980s and 1990s; and the relative econom ic progress of the country

compared to other advanced countries. The evidence shows that the UK made greater market reforms

than most other advanced countries and that it arrested the nearly century-long trend pattern of decline

relative to its historic competitors, Germany and F rance. It is difficult to link the reforms to the improved

economic performance relative to these other countries, but at the minimum our analysis has shown the

change in the UK economy cannot be readily explained by standard macro-economic changes in labor or

capital. Related studies present some of the more micro-based evidence that we used to judge the
                                                                                                     40

contribution of the reforms, and examine some of the accompanying costs. Absent a unequivocal

counterfactual of what would have happened had UK not proceeded with its reforms, we cannot

definitively judge the market reforms, though weighing the diverse evidence, they do seem to have played

a positive role in aggregate econo mic grow th.

* The three indices that we have selected are weighted in the Fraser Index as follows:
(II) Stru cture of the Econom y and Use of M arkets (14.2% ); (V) Legal Structure and Property Rights
(16.6%); (VII) Freedom of Exchange in Capital and Financial Markets (17.2%). Thus, they make up
approximately half of the overall index. Their weights are sufficiently similar that our treating the three
equally does not pro duce markedly different results than if we had used the Institutes’s weighting scheme.
