What Explains Differences in Smoking, Drinking and Other Health-Related Behaviors?

                                            ABSTRACT

We explore economic model of health behaviors. While the standard economic model of health as

an investment is generally supported empirically, the ability of this model to explain heterogeneity

across individuals is extremely limited. Most prominently, the correlation of different health

behaviors across people is virtually zero, suggest that standard factors such as variation in discount

rates or the value of life are not the drivers of behavior. We focus instead on two other factors:

genetics; and behavioral-specific situational factors. The first factor is empirically important, and we

suspect the second is as well.

       Unhealthy behaviors are a major part of the health profile in the United States and

other developed countries. A famous article by J. Michael McGinnis, and William H.

Foege (1993) estimated that half of all deaths in the United States are due to unhealthy

behaviors, most importantly tobacco use, poor diet and exercise, and excessive alcohol

consumption. Even this excludes many health-harming behaviors such as passing up

recommended screening tests, discontinuing medication usage, and not following up on

physician referrals. Why do people not do the right thing for their health?

       The prevailing economic paradigm for understanding these forms of behavior is

that health behaviors are investments, where foregone current pleasure leads to

improvements in future well-being (Michael Grossman, 1972).          As such, variations in

health behaviors will be explained by differences in discount rates or the value of life.

       If this theory is right, health behaviors will differ across people, but for a given

person, behaviors will be highly correlated: those who value their health highly and care

sufficiently about the future will have much better behaviors than those who do not.

Table 1 shows the correlation of five different health measures, drawn from the 1990

National Health Interview Survey (NHIS): current smoking; heavy drinking (3 or more

drinks per day); being obese (BMI 30); using hypertension medication when

recommended; and (for women) receiving a mammogram in the past 3 years. In each

case, we sample the population aged 45 and older, a group where the health consequences

of poor behavior should be salient. The correlations across behaviors are surprisingly

low. Smoking and drinking exhibit the largest correlation, but this is only 16 percent.1

Most correlations are below 10 percent.




                                              1
       The low correlation is not an artifact of this data set or time period. Appendix

Table 1 shows analysis of data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey in

2002. This survey includes measures of smoking, drinking, obesity, use of a seatbelt,

receipt of a flu shot in the past year, and screening for colorectal, breast, cervical, and

prostate cancer. Preventive service receipt is more correlated than is dietary behavior,

with roughly 20 percent correlations among these activities. But even 20 percent is not

very high, and preventive service use is virtually unrelated to dietary behavior. The

individual model of behavior is thus quantitatively not very important.

       Even if health behaviors differ generally, individuals might at some point in their

lives experience shocks to their discount rates, incomes, or beliefs about the future that

will result in large behavioral changes. Thus, year to year changes in health behaviors

could be more highly correlated than behavior at any point in time.       We examine this

proposition using data from the Health and Retirement Study, a sample of nearly 10,000

people nearing retirement age. There are six waves of data available to this point.

       Table 2 shows correlations of changes in behavior. In each case, the sample is

people who were not maximizing their health beforehand: smoking, drinking heavily,

being overweight, or not exercising. Even behavioral changes are not highly correlated;

the largest correlation in the table is less than .1.     The investment model is thus

incomplete along this dimension as well.

       What, then, are the alternatives? There are three possibilities: health behaviors

differ because of differing information; because of genetic differences; and because of

situational factors that are specific to the person and behavior. In the remainder of the

paper, we examine these different factors.




                                             2
I.          Framework

            To understand our analysis, we begin with a simple two-period model of

individual choices, where individual i chooses health related actions (denoted a j for

action j) to maximize expected discounted lifetime utility:


                                                            π~ ij a j β iVi ,
                                          2
            W =             (b ij a j − .5a j ) + π −                                         (1)
                        j                               j



where b ij reflects the individual-specific current return to the action (net of price),


 π−         π~ ij a j       is the probability of survival to the next period, and π~ ij is the self-
        j



perceived effect of action j on the survival probability.                       β i is the individual-specific

discount rate, and Vi is the value to surviving into the next period. The first order

condition for action j is: a j = b ij − π~ ij β iVi .

            We assume that b ij = b i + b j +ε ji , where b i is the individual tendency to engage

in these activities, b j is the average preference for this activity in society, and ε                  i
                                                                                                        j   is an

activity and person-specific idiosyncratic taste. We normalize b i and ε                      i
                                                                                              j   to mean zero

and assume they are independent of each other and b j . Similarly, π~ ij = π j + µ ij where

π j represents the society-wide average belief (which may or may not be correct) and µ ij

is an idiosyncratic individual factor with mean zero and no correlation with the other

variables. β V is the expectation of β iVi .

            The variance of the action across individuals is given by:




                                                                3
                          2
                                             (                   2
                                                                     )
         Var (a j ) = π jVar (β iVi ) + Var (β iVi ) + β V Var ( µ ij ) + Var (b i + ε ij )     (2)

The first term is the heterogeneity related to discount rates or the value of life. The

second term relates to the heterogeneity of beliefs about the impact of action j: when

people view the behavior in question differentially, this will influence the observed

variability in outcomes. The third term reflects heterogeneity in preferences, some of

which are common across behaviors and others of which are idiosyncratic.

         The correlation across people between observed actions j and k is

corr (a j , a k ) = (π j π k Var (β iVi ) + var(b i ))   stddev(a j ) stddev(a k ) .   The    numerator

consists of variability in standard investment effects (the first term) and variability in

individual preferences (the second term).

         The small correlation we observe between different behaviors implies that neither

variability in standard investment factors nor in cross-behavior personal preferences is

that large – the two together do not top 10 percent of total variability. Understanding the

heterogeneity in behaviors requires us instead to understand the variability in perceived

                                      2
health consequences, β V Var ( µ ij ) , and tastes, Var (ε ij ) .

         Since many of our health outcomes are discrete, rather than continuous, we extend

the model to address the continuous outcomes. We assume that there is remains a latent

variable a j , and to simplify the discussion, we assume that this latent variable equals

ε ij − π j β iVi , the idiosyncratic taste for the variable minus the expected health costs.

Individuals undertake the discrete action if and only if a j is positive. Our goal is to

           2                  2
                                  (                       )
assess π jVar ( β iVi ) / π j Var ( β iVi ) + Var (ε ij ) , that share of the variance that is accounted

for by heterogeneity in investment factors.



                                                         4
         To make progress, some assumption about the distribution of the factors is

necessary. For simplicity, we assume that both variables are uniform, and we normalize

so that β iVi is uniformly distributed across the population on the interval [0, 1]. The

variable ε ij is assumed to be uniformly distributed on the interval θ j − .5e j , θ j + .5e j     [                                  ]   .

                                                                                                                                  2
                                                                                                                              π

Straightforward algebra shows that π Var ( β iVi ) / π Var ( β iVi ) + Var (ε ) =
                                                                              j   (                             i

                                                                                                                                  j
                                                                                                                                          .
                                                                                                                          π j + e 2j

For discrete outcome k, we similarly assume a k = ε ki − π k β iVi , where ε ki is distributed

uniformly on the interval [θ k − .5ek , θ k + .5ek ] . Again, the action is undertaken if and

only if a k          is positive.           Finally, we assume the e j > 2Max θ j , π j − θ j               (                 )       and

             (                )
ek > 2Max θ k , π k − θ k so that for any value of β iVi , it is possible to have both outcomes.

         Denoting σ jk as the covariance between the two discrete outcomes, and p j and

pk      as       the        probability          of       the       two           outcomes,            it       follows               that

coefficient, the latter in [.]s below the correlation. In all cases, the procedure increases

                                                                    π jπ k

Again, these figures are low and suggest that the bulk of heterogeneity in behaviors

cannot be explained by variation in the common investment-related characteristics.



II.    Health Beliefs and Health Behaviors



       To examine the importance of differing health beliefs, we relate the behaviors

described above to survey response about what people believe are the consequences of

these actions. The 1990 NHIS asks a number of questions about the potential adverse

effects of different behaviors. A typical question is of the form: “Does cigarette smoking

increase the chance of developing lung cancer?,” with possible responses of: definitely

increases; probably increases; probably does not increase; and definitely does not

increase.   We demarcate people by whether they believe the behavior in question

definitely increases the risk or not.2 For smoking, questions are asked about the link to

cardiovascular disease, cancer, and respiratory problems. Questions are also asked about

the harmful effects of alcohol, being overweight, and having high blood pressure, but not

about failure to receive a mammogram.




                                             6
       In each case, the vast majority of people believe that these behaviors are harmful.

For example, 74 percent of people respond that cigarette smoking is definitely related to

cardiovascular disease, 86 percent believe it is definitely related to cancer, and 85 percent

believe it is definitely related to respiratory problems. For alcohol use, being overweight,

and having hypertension, the corresponding figures are 87 percent, 75 percent, and 69

percent. Beliefs are also generally related to demographics, as we would expect. Better

educated and higher income people are more likely to believe that most of the behaviors

are harmful to health. Racial effects are not very big.

       That is not to say that the belief measures are without problems. Clearly, they

measure true belief with error. More importantly, these beliefs may rationalize, rather

than cause behavior. But rationalization would tend to overstate the importance of beliefs.

       Table 3 shows the relation between beliefs, socioeconomic factors, and health

behaviors.3 For each of the behaviors described above, the first rows report the effect of

education and income on engaging in the behavior (also included in the regressions, but

not reported, are five year age-sex groups, dummy variables for blacks, other races, and

Hispanics, and a dummy variable for being married).

       People who invest more in education generally invest more in health as well;

there is a significant education effect in most regressions. Indeed, the education effect is

large; behaviors differ by as much as 10 percentage points between college graduates and

high school dropouts. Income is also generally associated with better health. However,

the explanatory power of these socioeconomic factors is low.               The R2’s from

socioeconomic factors alone are reported in the bottom of the table4 and range from 2

percent for using hypertension medication to 9 percent for receiving a mammogram on




                                             7
the recommended schedule. These results confirm the low correlations noted in table 1.

Once again, these results are not unique to the data or specific behaviors indicated.

Appendix table 2 shows that the same low R2 for socioeconomic factors is found in the

BRFSS data as well.

       The next rows report the coefficients on beliefs.        Beliefs are almost always

correlated with behavior in the expected way. People who think that smoking or drinking

poses a greater risk are unsurprisingly less likely to smoke or drink. The magnitude of

these effects ranges up to 15 percentage points for smoking, but is much weaker for the

other variables. But again, the ability of these variables to explain individual variation is

small. Including belief variables in the regressions increases the R2 by only 5 percent in

the case of smoking, and even less for the other behaviors. Even recognizing that beliefs

are measured with error, the very low explanatory power and possibility for ex post

rationalization makes it hard to accept that belief heterogeneity explains differences in

individual behaviors.



IV.    The Individual vs. the Situation

       There are two primary rivals to the economic view of health investments: the

genetic view that human heterogeneity is driven primarily by genetic differences, and the

psychological view that human choices are driven primarily by randomly-encountered

situational differences – a chance encounter with a particular peer group, perhaps, or a

random health shock that affects that individual and not others.

       Our first attempt to differentiate between these behaviors is to estimate the

importance of fixed individual effects in different forms of health behaviors. This is an




                                             8
upper bound on the importance of genetics or other behavior-specific factors. To do this,

we use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We gauge the importance of

individual effects using a random effects regression model, controlling in the model for

aggregate year effects.5

       The first column of Table 4 lists the partial-R2 of the individual effects. The R2

ranges from 38 percent for vigorous exercise, to nearly 90 percent for body mass index.

Smoking shows a high degree of permanence (79 percent R2) and drinking less (51

percent R2). The high R2’s for smoking and obesity can be explained by many different

theories. Genetics might be important, but so too might be addiction (rational or myopic)

or peer effects with relatively stable peer groups.

       We consider first the potential importance of neighborhoods. Neighborhoods

might matter for health behaviors because of peer effects, or because of correlated shocks

such as high or low tax rates on cigarettes. To gauge the importance of neighborhood

effects, we have estimated the added R2 in table 3 that comes from including geographic

controls at the Primary Sampling Unit (roughly MSA) level. Addition of the geographic

controls raises the R2 by two to seven percent.6 The relatively modest explanatory power

of area effects suggests that these gross measures of situation are not where the bulk of

the situational variation results from.

       We can say more about the impact of genetics on health behaviors.              The

Minnesota Twin Registry7 has data on many health behaviors among all twins born in

Minnesota between 1936 and 1955, nearly 4,000 individuals in total. Following the

standard literature on heritability, we compare the correlation of behavior between




                                              9
monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (fraternal) twins. The genetic contribution to any

behavior is twice the difference between the correlation in these groups.

       The second column of Table 4 reports the genetic contribution to variability in

health behaviors. The highest heritability estimate is for body mass index – 72 percent of

the variation across people in body mass is estimated to be the result of purely genetic

factors. The heritability for other variables is smaller: 26 percent for exercise, 30 percent

for smoking and 38 percent for heavy drinking. Comparing columns 1 and 2 of table 4,

about one-half of the individual variation in these behaviors results from a genetic

predisposition to engage in them.

       Our bottom line estimate is that variation in health behaviors results from two

primary factors: genetics, and behavior-specific situational influences. We have not to

date identified what the relevant situational influences are, but that is clearly a high

priority for future research.

1
    One might worry that smoking is metabolically associated with lower weight.            We have

experimented with adding up to 10 pounds to the weight of smokers, a rough estimate of weight

gain after smoking cessation. That does not materially affect the correlations reported in Table 1.
2
    Virtually everyone believes these behaviors are at least somewhat related to poor outcomes. In

many cases, multiple questions are asked. We denote a person as believing the activity is

definitely bad if they report it definitely causes at least one outcome.
3
    Area-level dummy variables are also included in the regressions, as discussed below.
4
    The incremental R2’s are calculated sequentially. The R2 for socioeconomics is based on a

regression with those variables only; the R2 for beliefs is the incremental explanatory power from

adding beliefs to the model with SES, and similarly for geography.
5
    We use random effects rather than fixed effects because of the short panel.
6
    A similar finding is true in the BRFSS data.
7
    These data were collected by Jere R. Behrman, Mark R. Rosenzweig, and Paul Taubman of the

Economics Department at the University of Pennsylvania with funds from the National Center on

the Educational Quality of the Workforce, the Economics Institute Research Fund, the Boettner

Research Fund, the Population Study Center NIA Supplement, and the University Research

Foundation -- all of the University of Pennsylvania. The survey instrument was designed in

collaboration with the Temple University Institute of Survey Research. The data were collected,

under the leadership of David T. Lykken, then Director of the Minnesota Twin/Family Registry

(MTR), by the staff of the MTR. The data are described in David T. Lykken, et al., (1990).
