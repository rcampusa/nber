                                              ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes current stresses in the two key areas that concerned the architects of the original
Bretton Woods system: international liquidity and exchange rate management. Despite radical changes
since World War II in the market context for liquidity and exchange rate concerns, they remain central
to discussions of international macroeconomic policy coordination. To take two prominent examples
of specific (and related) coordination problems, liquidity issues are paramount in strategies of national
self-insurance through foreign reserve accumulation, while recent attempts by emerging market economies
(EMEs) to limit real currency appreciation have relied heavily on nominal exchange rate management.
A central message is that a diverse set of potential asymmetries among sovereign member states provides
fertile ground for a variety of coordination failures. The paper goes on to discuss institutions and policies
that might mitigate some of these inefficiencies.

The global economic crisis of 2007-09 generated calls to re-think the international

monetary system, and indeed, the entire institutional framework within which

international financial integration has advanced since the fall of the Bretton Woods

regime four decades ago. Gaps in national and international structures of financial

regulation were an obvious factor in causing the most severe global crisis since the Great

Depression; another chapter of this book addresses that topic. Interactions between

national macroeconomic policies also played a role, however, and have continued to

generate rancor between countries as a geographically uneven recovery from the crisis

has unfolded. The crisis and its aftermath exposed stresses in the world’s monetary

system, stresses that continue to be felt.1

            This chapter analyzes current stresses in the two critical areas that concerned

the architects of the original Bretton Woods system: international liquidity and exchange

rate management.2 Despite radical changes since World War II in the market context for

liquidity and exchange rate concerns, they remain central to discussions of international

macroeconomic policy coordination. To take two prominent examples of specific (and

related) coordination problems, liquidity issues are paramount in strategies of national

self-insurance through foreign reserve accumulation, while recent attempts by emerging

market economies (EMEs) to limit real currency appreciation have relied heavily on

nominal exchange rate management. A key message – an obvious point, but one that

nonetheless is a basic starting place for predicting a range of tensions in any system of

  The crisis brought home vividly the strong two-way interaction between macroeconomic policies and
financial-sector stability, demonstrating the adverse consequences of viewing macro and prudential policy
as somehow orthogonal to each other. While my discussion thus will focus on macroeconomic policies, I
will inevitably touch upon financial-stability considerations at several points.
2
  In the present context, the relevant concept of “liquidity” is funding liquidity, in the sense of
Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009). For illuminating discussions of international coordination problems as
seen from the perspective of the IMF’s founding, look at Metzler, Triffin, and Haberler (1947).

international monetary arrangements – is that a diverse set of potential asymmetries

among sovereign member states provides fertile ground for a variety of coordination

failures.

        Despite the progress of technology, financial innovation, globalization, and

development, sharp international asymmetries remain and so coordination failures with

recognizable analogs in earlier historical eras have emerged. Earlier efforts at

international monetary reform attempted to reconcile individual nations’ demands for

domestic economic stability with a smooth international adjustment mechanism. Those

attempts had limited success and even the most ambitious and successful of them – the

Bretton Woods system – crumbled after a quarter century under the weight of its internal

contradictions. The recent global crisis has highlighted once again the twenty-first

century incarnations of a range of time-honored systemic strains. Some of the problems

have become more severe, or problematic in new ways. The resulting pressures on

international economic relations define the current reform agenda.

        The plan of this chapter is as follows. Section I sets out some dilemmas, old and

new, relating to the supply of international liquidity in settings where the demand for safe

foreign exchange reserves grows faster than the supply over the long term. The

discussion emphasizes the fiscal dimension of such “Triffin dilemmas.” Section II

describes how financial globalization has increased countries’ needs for international

liquidity, and sketches a structure for liquidity provision that would avoid negative

externalities inherent in self-insurance through large-scale reserve accumulation.

Section III turns to exchange rates and global imbalances, with emphasis on modern

versions of older coordination problems. Section IV concludes.

I. International Liquidity and Triffin Dilemmas



Like households and firms, governments need access to liquidity – readily salable assets

(including cash, of course) that may be spent on goods or (particularly in crisis situations)

on other assets. In a closed economy, the government (through its central bank) is always

capable, in principle, of providing for all liquidity needs. In the open economy this is no

longer the case. When the need is for a foreign currency, which the central bank cannot

print, gross holdings (reserves) and available foreign-currency credits constrain the

government’s powers, whether to provide liquidity to markets (as in a foreign exchange

intervention) or directly to market actors (as in an emergency loan to a bank).

           Throughout history, international reserves have been an important source of

liquidity. What properties characterize an attractive international reserve asset? In the

broadest terms, the asset should be widely acceptable as payment at a predictable value,

even when liquidated without notice. But in what numeraire should value be measured?

Merely asking the question reveals that “predictability of value” cannot be an absolute

norm, unless the numeraire is a particular money – such as the international vehicle

currency, which the American dollar overwhelmingly remains – or a particular

commodity such as gold. In a world of significant departures from purchasing power

parity, maintenance of real value (in terms of a comprehensive consumption basket)

necessarily depends on the beholder. In a global economy, however, it may be more

relevant to refer to “liquidities” than “liquidity.” If several currencies are widely used

internationally as medium of exchange and/or unit of account, then it may well be




                                              3
desirable for a country to hold liquidity in all of those currencies, regardless of moderate

changes in their relative values – a theme I explore further below.

         Changes in value, moreover, can arise in different ways (again depending on the

numeraire against which value is reckoned). Exchange rate and inflation risk are obvious

possibilities, but so are default risk, sovereign or private, and political risk. Foreign-

currency U.S. bonds issued by the Carter Administration inherited the minimal (at the

time) default risk of conventional dollar-denominated Treasury obligations. On the other

hand, liquid dollar liabilities of London eurobanks (typically counted in reserve measures

if owned by monetary authorities) carry counterparty risk (absent an official bailout) but

not currency risk vis-à-vis the dollar. Again, safety is in the eye of the beholder.

Countries experiencing or contemplating political tensions with the U.S. – think of cases

involving Iran, Iraq, Russia, Libya, or Syria – might prefer the counterparty risk intrinsic

to a lightly regulated offshore center to the risk of a retaliatory freeze on assets held in the

United States.3

             In the early post-World War II economy, with global capital markets dormant

and much of the industrial world in ruins, the main forms of international liquidity were

gross holdings of gold and U.S. dollars (and, to a lesser extent, sterling). Eichengreen

(2011) paints a vivid picture of this period of virtually unrivaled dollar dominance as a

reserve asset in the 1950s. That dominance persisted through the demise of the Bretton

Woods system in the early 1970s (and indeed far beyond), but not without increasing

tensions.


3
  The possibility of holding dollar reserves in banks outside the U.S. shows that it is not necessarily correct
to assert that U.S. balance of payments deficits govern the growth rate of world dollar reserves. Of course,
liquidation of such offshore reserves by the non-U.S. holder will ultimately have the same effect on the
U.S. balance of payments as if the reserve assets liquidated were themselves held in the U.S.


                                                       4
         Those tensions arose from one of a class of problems to which any reserve-asset

system is potentially susceptible: what may be called a Triffin dilemma. A Triffin

dilemma arises any time increasing demand for a reserve asset strains the ability of the

issuer to supply sufficient amounts while still credibly guaranteeing or stabilizing the

asset’s value in terms of an acceptable numeraire.



The Classic Triffin Dilemma: It’s Mostly Fiscal



Under the Bretton Woods arrangements, countries pegged their currencies to the U.S.

dollar, while the U.S. Treasury continued a longstanding commitment (dating from

January 31, 1934) to redeem dollars held by non-U.S. central banks and governments for

gold “for legitimate monetary purposes” at a price of $35 per ounce.4 While the Treasury

guarantee of the dollar gold link reassured foreign official dollar holders that their

reserves were “as good as gold,” it also led to at least two potential inconsistencies.

         The first inconsistency was familiar from the classical gold standard. If world

output growth outpaced world gold production, the relative price of gold would likely

have to rise, implying secular deflation assuming a fixed market gold price of $35 per

ounce. Countries outside the U.S. could maintain their internal price levels by devaluing

against the dollar, but the U.S. itself did not have this option. For a time in the 1950s and

1960s, various fortuitous developments held off the deflationary threat; for example, the

development of new South African mining capacity, along with Russian gold sales


4
 This commitment followed from the Gold Reserve Act of January 30, 1934 (Yeager 1976, p. 352). The
Act also gave licensed users in industry and the arts the right to buy gold at the official price. (The Treasury
added a ¼ percent transaction fee to the official price, and applied an identical discount to its gold
purchases.)


                                                       5
(which ended in 1966). Eventually, though, the conundrum was resolved in March 1968

through the two-tier gold market, which allowed the nonofficial gold price to float. It was

then that the U.S. currency, and currencies pegged to it, became fiat monies.5

            The second inconsistency persisted even after the start of the two-tier market.

The official tier (by design) left intact the U.S. obligation to redeem foreign dollar

reserves for gold at the old official price. Once again, however, world output growth, and

the concomitant growth in world dollar reserves, seemed likely to outpace world gold

production. Were the U.S. Treasury to maintain a $35 buying price for an ounce of gold,

therefore, U.S. monetary gold stocks could not possibly increase. As famously observed

by Triffin (1960), the United States eventually would not have enough gold to redeem all

the official dollar reserves at par, even if it used up the entirety of its holdings. The

reserve currency issuer would become vulnerable to a run by central banks. The problem

might have bee manageable had countries not expected their own currencies to appreciate

against the dollar – it may be easier for a central bank to forgo a gain than to take a loss –

but by the late 1960s the feeling was growing that the dollar would need to be realigned

downward, as eventually happened in the August 1971 Smithsonian accord.

            Figure 1 illustrates the trends. In 1948, the United States held most of the

world’s gold reserves. Through 1960, U.S. gold stocks shrank but remained above the

growing stock of dollar foreign reserves. And then the lines cross, seemingly making the

U.S. vulnerable to a Triffinesque run. (That event was marked by speculation in the



5
 This stratagem did not, by itself, resolve the (more serious) problem that the dollar itself could be
devalued only through a concerted revaluation of foreign currencies (as occurred in August 1971, when the
U.S. coincidentally suspended gold sales to foreign monetary authorities). One solution suggested for the
Triffin problem before the gold window was closed was to raise the official dollar price of gold. Apart from
other drawbacks, a gold-price change would not automatically have devalued the dollar against other
currencies.


                                                     6
London gold market, causing the formation of the gold pool; see Eichengreen 2011.) The

preceding trends continue as world monetary gold stocks fail to keep pace with growing

global foreign exchange reserves. Figure 2 shows that in 1966 – the year that Russian

gold sales ceased (Cooper 1969, p. 580) – world gold production leveled off. In

retrospect, the abandonment of the single-tier gold market soon thereafter is not

surprising. World dollar reserves began a steep upward ascent in 1970 as heavy

speculation against the dollar set in. To defend the dollar parities of stronger currencies

such as the deutsche mark and Swiss franc, the issuing central banks undertook massive

dollar purchases. Global dollar reserves exploded – without reducing U.S. reserves,

absent gold redemptions.

            On the surface, Triffin’s point seems obvious. But deeper reflection suggests

that the classic form of the Triffin dilemma was really a fiscal problem. After all, why

couldn’t the U.S. government have purchased more gold on the market, if need be, to pay

off foreign central banks? And what strain on the U.S. fiscal position would have

resulted?

            At the end of 1970, the year before U.S. President Richard Nixon suspended

official gold convertibility (August 1971), U.S. gold reserves stood at $11 billion dollars,

while world nongold reserves outside the U.S. stood at $53 billion, leaving the U.S. with

$42 billion in potential official claims that it could not cover with its existing gold

holdings. The sum of $42 billion, however, amounted to 4.2 percent of that year’s GDP,

at a time when the gross U.S. federal debt stood at 28 percent of GDP – a large, but not

insuperable, fiscal cost (especially by today’s standards).




                                              7
           The preceding calculation, however, assumes that the Treasury could have

purchased the gold it needed in the world market at $35 per ounce. But this is surely not

the case. World gold production in 1970 (at the $35 price) amounted to $1.8 billion,

whereas total world monetary gold stocks outside the U.S. were $29 billion. The sum of

the new flow and the existing stock, roughly $31 billion, falls far short of what the U.S.

needed to cover its total $53 billion obligation (an obligation that exploded in the

succeeding years). Even if the U.S. Treasury had been able to purchase all the world’s

monetary gold and all current production without bidding up the world price – an

impossibility – it still would have been $11 billion short. It is clearly unlikely that the

Treasury would have been able to buy all the necessary gold at any finite price. Any

Treasury attempt to buy gold in private markets on any substantial scale would likely

have resulted in a gold price so high as to make the resulting fiscal burden unbearable.

           This potential fiscal insolvency was the key danger inherent in the Triffin

problem. As Figure 1 shows, of course, the problem became even worse after 1970 as

speculative switches out of dollars into foreign currencies accelerated, and as even some

central banks exchanged dollars for U.S. gold. The result was the Nixon-Connally policy

package of August 1971, leading directly to the Smithsonian realignments in December

1971.



The Modern Triffin Dilemma



After the industrial countries moved to flexible exchange rates in 1973, world reserve

growth, surprisingly at the time, continued. Global nongold reserves have expanded (in




                                               8
nominal dollar terms) in all but three of the years after 1971. Starting in 2002, and

powered by the demand and growth of emerging economies, global reserves have grown

at double digit rates in every year but one (2008, when the yearly growth rate was 9.7

percent). But between 1972 and 1980, global reserves likewise grew at double-digit rates

in all but one year. Motivations for this continuing global demand for international

liquidity have been widely discussed in the academic literature. As I take up in the next

section, one can make a strong case that the evolution of world capital markets over

recent decades has made the potential need for swift and perhaps massive key currency

liquidity support – whether from reserves or some other source – much more pressing

today than it was even in the days of generalized fixed exchange rates.

            Nor has the basic Triffin paradox disappeared. The emergence of a modern

species of Triffin dilemma has been diagnosed most clearly by Farhi, Gourinchas, and

Rey (2011). It is a subtler problem than the Bretton Woods version, because there is no

longer a reserve-center promise to redeem liabilities at a fixed price in terms of some

scarce numeraire. It is a Triffin problem nonetheless because the underlying asymmetric

dynamics of global growth guarantee that eventually, the reserve system will become

unsustainable. Moreover, the problem remains even in a multipolar world with several

reserve currencies.6

        The problem is not simply that, under floating exchange rates, reserves are subject

to depreciation risk: reserve holders have proved willing to tolerate exchange-rate

fluctuations, provided there is not a continuing trend of sudden depreciations. Thus, for

example, foreign accumulation of dollar reserve claims on the U.S. does not inherently

6
  The general problem had already been discerned by some policymakers in connection with the
internationalization of the deutsche mark and yen (see Henning 1994, p. 317).



                                                  9
require large U.S. current account deficits, which might predict significant future dollar

devaluation. Dollar reserve growth may be primarily a result of gross capital outflows

from the U.S., as was true during the mid-1960s (when the U.S. had a sizable trade

surplus with trading partners and was still a net foreign creditor).

             The modern-day Triffin problem resides instead in the nature of the securities

central banks hold as reserves. A key feature of a reserve asset is that it is liquid and

predictable in value. True, exchange rate fluctuations are not predictable – but for a

country experiencing a localized crisis, any movement of the domestic currency against

major foreign reserve currencies is likely to be downward. And the dollar, at least, has

shown a safe-haven tendency to appreciate in global crises, which helps explain its

attractiveness as a reserve asset (Gourinchas, Rey, and Govillot 2010).7

             Thus, central banks have gravitated toward the government liabilities of highly

creditworthy countries – or other assets, such as U.S. agency securities, believed likely to

come under the protection of a government guarantee. Such assets could include certain

liabilities of systemically important financial institutions in the creditworthy advanced

countries.

        So global reserve growth requires the ongoing issuance of gross government debt.

This requires, in turn, that the government run continuing deficits, or that it issue debt to

acquire assets likely to be inherently riskier than the corresponding liabilities. Just as in

the classic Triffin dilemma, global reserve growth is largely driven by deficits – not

national balance of payments deficits, but government deficits.8

  For alternative models of the dollar’s international role, see Canzoneri, Cumby, Diba, and López-Salido
(2010) and Maggiori (2011).
8
  An analogous problem confronted Federal Reserve policymakers in 2000-01 as they contemplated the
possibility of a disappearing U.S. federal debt. As Greenspan (2007, p. 214) puts it:


                                                    10
        The additional dynamic element driving the modern-day dilemma is based on two

asymmetries. First, the emerging and developing world is growing more quickly than the

more credit-worthy industrial world. As Figure 3 shows, in 2009 the total GDP of the

emerging and developing world (measured at PPP, and including newly-industrialized

Asia) overtook that of the advanced economies, and the IMF predicts that the advanced

economies will fall farther behind over time. The second asymmetry is that the main

advanced countries remain more creditworthy on average than the poorer countries. The

traditionally rich countries have been able to borrow more easily on world capital

markets, and have therefore have had less need for international reserves than countries

that are vulnerable to sudden stops.9 Furthermore, they are less prone to undertake

foreign exchange intervention, and have less capacity to sterilize. Together, these

asymmetries imply that that the demand for rich-country government debt is likely to

outstrip what can be supplied in the way of safe government debt without bringing the



                  My colleagues at the FOMC seemed a bit disoriented too. In our late-January meeting,
        we spent hours trying to imagine how the Fed would operate in a brave new world of minimal
        federal debt. Of course, shedding the debt burden would be a happy development for our country,
        but it would nevertheless pose a big dilemma for the Fed. Our primary lever of monetary policy
        was buying and selling treasury securities -- Uncle Sam’s IOUs. But as the debt was paid down,
        those securities would grow scarce, leaving the Fed in need of a new set of assets to effect
        monetary policy. For nearly a year, senior Fed economists and traders had been exploring the
        issue of what other assets we might buy and sell.
            A result was a dense 380-page study that plopped on our desks in January [of 2001]. The good
        news was that we weren’t going out of business; the bad news was that nothing could really match
        the treasuries market in size, liquidity, and freedom from risk. To conduct monetary policy, the
        report concluded, the Fed would have to learn to manage a complex portfolio of municipal bonds,
        bonds issued by foreign governments, mortgage-backed securities, auctioned discount-window
        credits, and other debt instruments. It was a daunting prospect. “I feel kind of like Alice in
        Wonderland,” Cathy Minehan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, had said
        when the issue first came up, and we all knew what she meant. The very fact of the discussion
        showed how profoundly and rapidly we thought the economic landscape might change.

Alas, “the economic landscape” did “profoundly and rapidly” change, but in a way that produced the worst
of both worlds: huge U.S. deficits and debt, coupled with big holdings of exotic securities on the Fed’s
balance sheet.
9
  Of course, recent sovereign debt problems in some of the richer countries show the strains on even
advanced-country public finances following the 2007-09 crisis.


                                                  11
safety of that debt into question. Figure 4 gives a rough indication of the trend to date.

How will the demand for reserves be satisfied if the richer countries actually succeed in

the fiscal consolidation to which they currently aspire?10

        A number of developments could head off this unstable dynamic, but might not

come into effect soon enough. First, countries’ demand for reserves might level off, with

some national wealth shunted into sovereign wealth funds willing to invest in riskier

assets. To the extent that reserve demand is driven by the size of the financial system and

the latter’s growth rate is high, however, strong reserve growth is likely to continue.

Second, growth could decelerate in the emerging and developing world or accelerate in

the currently rich countries. That development seems unlikely in view of the fiscal and

other burdens that currently afflict much of the industrial world. Finally, some major and

swiftly growing emerging markets could graduate in terms of their creditworthiness,

reducing their demand for reserves and, potentially, making them suppliers of reserve

assets. China (currently lacking a fully convertible currency) is the most likely candidate,

but this very observation highlights the significant obstacles to such a development. Thus,

the new incarnation of the Triffin dilemma is likely to bedevil the current system of

international liquidity provision for some time, absent reforms. Danger signs are already

appearing. As the sovereign debts of richer countries have come under pressure, it is no

surprise to see the central banks of emerging economies increasing their gold purchases.




10
   Figure 4 graphs general gross government debt growth in the U.S. and euro area against world nongold
reserves. General government debt overstates the debt available for reserve growth, since central
government debt is preferred. In addition, much euro zone central government debt would be viewed as
riskier than, say, German debt lately, and therefore not ideal for reserve holders.


                                                   12
        The problem is still mostly fiscal. But then, so are the broader questions

concerning the adequacy of international liquidity in a world without a true outside

reserve asset such as gold. I now turn to those questions.



II. Reforming the Liquidity System



The demise of generalized fixed exchange rates in 1973 allowed a solution to the open-

economy macroeconomic trilemma based on flexible exchange rates, domestic monetary

autonomy, and financial-account liberalization (Obstfeld and Taylor 2004). The process

started in the 1970s in the industrial countries. With a lag, and with considerable

individual heterogeneity, the emerging market economies have started to follow down

this path. Domestic financial liberalization has gone hand in hand with the process of

external opening, with strong channels of two-way causation driving the overall freeing

of finance, domestic and international alike. Whether and how this process will continue

in light of the recent global crisis is a major open question.

           The main trend raising the level of financial fragility in the world economy,

and thereby liquidity needs, has been financial globalization, which has brought with it a

rapid expansion of gross international asset positions. The latter expansion has been

driven by a range of factors, including expanded risk sharing, financial deepening, and,

less benignly, regulatory and tax arbitrage. At a point in time, a country’s net

international investment position defines the gap that intertemporal solvency dictates

between the present values of expenditure and income. But it is the nature of a country’s

gross positions that determines its vulnerability to financial crisis – just as is the case for




                                              13
individual economic actors. Moreover, given the current magnitude of gross external

asset and liability positions, asymmetric valuation changes can easily imply changes in

net assets that overwhelm the smaller flow increments due to the current account balance.

          Figure 5 illustrates the trend in gross external assets for selected countries,

plotting the ratio (Assets + Liabilities)/GDP through 2007 (with data from the update of

Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2007). Particularly for relatively open industrial countries that

are also financial centers, the multiplication of gross external positions has been extreme.

In such cases, a current account deficit may be a consequence of financial excess, being

associated with a domestic credit boom, but it is not itself the prime locus of financial

vulnerability. The main threat is that of a balance-sheet crisis. Thus, while Ireland had an

external deficit in the run-up to the crisis, banks in surplus countries like Switzerland and

Germany landed in trouble – dragging their governments along with them – because of

toxic foreign assets on their balance sheets.

       Figure 6 shows that for emerging and developing countries, gross acquisitions of

claims on advanced countries, whether as reserves or as nonreserve (mainly private-

sector) claims, far exceed the net current account balance, a reflection of copious gross

inflows from the industrial world. These flows are cumulating to economically significant

shares of industrial country GDP: In 2007 alone, the annual flow amounted to 6 percent

of industrial country GDP. The rapid GDP growth of the poorer countries is not matched

by a commensurate importance in world financial markets, but the latter is certainly




                                                14
growing, and doing so relative to the shrinking relative scale of the advanced

economies.11

        Through their growing gross asset positions, emerging and developing countries,

especially the EMEs, are increasingly important players in financial globalization, and

their financial stability is becoming increasingly tied to that of the global financial

system. Yet they remain more vulnerable to sudden stops in foreign lending than are most

of the advanced countries – notwithstanding the sudden emergence of sovereign debt

problems in some of the latter. All the while, financial channels of contagious

transmission have expanded along with gross positions. If policymakers wish to

restructure the international liquidity system so as to enhance financial stability, these

facts are central considerations.



The Role of Global Last Resort Lending



In the late 1970s, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and Portugal all negotiated standby

arrangements with the IMF. Between Portugal’s last approach to the Fund in 1983 and

Iceland’s in 2008, no industrial country requested Fund resources for balance of

payments support – the Fund’s client base came to be viewed as consisting exclusively of

developing and emerging economies. By the 1990s and 2000s, the high-income countries

appeared to be quite creditworthy, unlikely ever to need Fund resources or even to need

to use large volumes of international reserves. At the same time, the central banks of



11
  The figure understates the trend, because the IMF definition of “advanced economies” includes Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Korea, and Singapore. This labeling both reduces the IMF’s measures of emerging and
developing country financial flows, and inflates its measure of advanced country GDP.


                                                  15
high-income countries were perceived to be well equipped, and willing, to act as last-

resort lenders if their home financial systems got into trouble.

            Events after August 2007 have changed the picture, highlighting the more

complex and in some respects more dangerous landscape that financial globalization has

produced. Banks throughout the world, and especially in rich Europe, faced urgent needs

for foreign-currency liquidity – liquidity that their home central banks could not create by

the stroke of a pen (or click of a mouse). The result was the creation of a complex

network of central bank swap lines, starting with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s lines to the

ECB and SNB in December 2007.12 Eventually that facility became unlimited in size.

Furthermore, following Iceland’s collapse, the Greek, Irish, and Portuguese governments

suffered funding crises that have been managed so far only with financial support from

the EU, ECB, and IMF. Both Spain and Italy are on the verge of needing such external

support as of this writing, and even France is under pressure. These advanced-country

crises reflected various prior problems, such as garden-variety fiscal improvidence (the

Greek scenario) and government bailout of a collapsed banking system (the primary

culprit for Ireland). But in all cases, globalized financial markets fueled easier access to

large volumes of foreign credit. Furthermore, globalization allowed the sovereign risks to

spread through the European and global banking and shadow banking networks, in some

cases increasing bailout risks and thereby weakening sovereigns further.

         What have we learned? There are at least two major lessons.



12
   The precedent for such arrangements is the network of reciprocal central bank credits set up in the early
1960s at the urging of U.S. Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon and Undersecretary for Monetary Affairs
Robert Roosa. The Dillon-Roosa swaps, however, were intended to support foreign exchange intervention
for purposes of maintaining par values against the U.S. dollar. See Hirsch (1969, Chapter 11).



                                                     16
       First, IMF facilities alone, even after being augmented in 2009, remain far below

the magnitudes that rich countries with large public debts might need to fend of self-

fulfilling bond-market attacks. Furthermore, the speed and flexibility of IMF remains

limited, given the openness of advanced countries to high-speed global financial markets.

The large gross asset liability positions of the advanced countries – think of the external

debts of Ireland, Iceland, or Switzerland, even though the last is a huge international

creditor – have the potential to infect the government balance sheet, resulting in fiscal

crisis. The assets of these countries’ banking systems are in a substantial number of cases

substantial multiples of GDP. While the Irish crisis has been called a crisis of the euro

zone – and adherence to a fixed exchange rate is indeed problematic for Ireland – the

Irish crisis is even more a crisis of globalized finance. Even in cases where sovereign

debt problems arise from garden-variety government profligacy, as in Greece, globalized

finance promotes a potentially wide exposure of financial institutions to the problem, as

noted earlier.

       Second, a key feature of a globalized multiple-currency world is that traditional

lenders of last resort (the central banks) are ill equipped to support the needs of their

swollen financial sectors, even when private-sector actors seek to maintain putative

hedges on their foreign-currency exposure. For example, European banks in 2007 and

2008 were big holders of U.S. mortgage-backed securities, these assets being funded by

short-term dollar borrowing. Credit market disruptions sharply raised the cost of rolling

over short-term dollar credits. At the same time, the costs of swapping euros for dollars to

repay dollar credits rose far beyond what covered interest parity would imply. While the

ECB, for example, could freely print euros and lend them to banks, its ability to supply




                                              17
dollars out of reserves was much more limited (although some national central banks did

so). The ECB itself could have borrowed dollars and intervened in spot and forward

exchange markets, at the risk of quasi-fiscal costs – costs that would be higher today,

now that the finances of even some larger euro zone governments are being questioned

by the bond markets. In the circumstances, it was much more expedient to be able to

borrow dollars directly from the Fed, which in any case needed to expand its balance

sheet to meet a heightened global demand for dollar liquidity.13 Effectively, the Fed

became an international last-resort lender in dollars – in the absence of which, European

banks might have had to unload hard-to-sell assets, worsening fire-sale dynamics and

weakening their own capital. Of course, the Fed also lent heavily, and directly, to the

U.S. affiliates of foreign banks when they had eligible collateral. At the same time, other

central banks – including the ECB, SNB, BOJ, Sveriges Riksbank – eventually stepped

up as global last-resort lenders in their own currencies.

         As of the start of the global crisis in 2007, the usefulness of foreign-currency last-

resort lending to financial institutions was familiar from the EME experience – see

Jeanne and Wyplosz (2003) and Calvo (2006) for insightful analyses. But it was less

obviously a first-order issue for mature economies, where the main use of foreign

exchange reserves (if any) was widely considered to be in cases of foreign exchange

intervention. The Fed has maintained swap facilities throughout the euro zone debt crisis

starting in the spring of 2010.



13
  The Fed was conveniently able to shift any credit risk of direct last-resort lending onto the ECB. On the
background for the swap network and its effects, see, for example, McGuire and von Peter (2009),
Goldberg, Kennedy, and Miu (2010), and Rose and Spiegel (2011). While controversy remains, most
empirical researchers have concluded that the swap arrangements were effective in reducing credit market
disruptions,


                                                    18
            The expansion of gross currency-denominated asset positions, given the

inevitable gaps in global as well as domestic prudential oversight, suggests a demand for

global lenders – to governments as well as central banks and, through them, to the private

financial sector – that is greater than ever before.



Self-Insurance through Reserve Accumulation



Of course, growing financial vulnerability is part of the reason that the emerging and

developing nations have accumulated high volumes of precautionary, hard-currency

foreign exchange reserves – a trend I noted above, and which shows no sign of abating.

Figure 7 illustrates that the resulting aggregate reserve stock, mostly U.S. dollars and

euros, has now reached the neighborhood of one-third of the holders’ collective GDP,

having risen from about 10 percent in 1990, when group GDP was much smaller than it is

today.

         This apparent security does not come without costs, both for individual reserve-

holding countries and for international monetary stability. For the holders, the great

attraction of reserves is that they provide instantaneous and unconditional liquidity. But

even at the level of the individual holder, there are downsides: reserves may come at a

high quasi-fiscal cost (costs also incurred if reserves should depreciate against domestic

currency), and these costs may be incurred even if the marginal liquidity value of the

reserves is illusory (because the process of reserve acquisition generated an equal short-

term private foreign-currency debt as an offsetting counterpart on the national balance

sheet). Sterilization of reserve flows may lead to financial repression costs.




                                              19
         Beyond these individual costs, however, national self-insurance through holdings

of gross foreign reserves carries significant potential systemic costs. Reserve

accumulation may influence interest rates in reserve centers – helping to fuel

international resentments about “exorbitant privilege” that often fail to recognize the root

of the problem in systemic congestion. Moreover, such interest-rate effects can

complicate the task of monetary policy in the reserve-center country. Similarly, official

portfolio shifts between different currencies, or between asset classes within currency

areas (think of Chinese transactions in euro zone sovereign debt), alter exchange rates

and bond prices, possibly in destabilizing ways.

         Individual countries’ reserve gains may be strategic complements, in the sense

that one country’s gains lower the relative perceived financial stability of its neighbors, in

turn raising their marginal benefit from reserve accumulation. In that case, a non-

cooperative equilibrium will entail excessive accumulation by all. A further coordination

problem arises when countries compete to keep their currencies weak and limit domestic

demand, so as to generate current account surpluses.14 Finally, in a global crisis, a

country may exacerbate problems elsewhere when it draws on its reserves. For example,

withdrawals of bank deposits in a foreign center may worsen liquidity problems there.

         A final negative systemic externality is related to the modern-day Triffin dilemma

of Farhi, Gourinchas, and Rey, which was described above. Each country’s purchase of

more reserves may push other demanders into purchasing marginally riskier assets, or

render their existing reserve holdings marginally more risky.




14
  Note, however, that countries need not have current account surpluses to gain reserves if they can attract
private financial inflows that exceed their current account deficits.


                                                    20
           The basic point is that actions that enhance the apparent financial resilience of the

individual country may well, at the same time, undermine that of the international

financial system as a whole. The fallacy of composition applies in the domain of

international liquidity, just as it does in discussions of the macroprudential approach to

domestic financial supervision.

           Notwithstanding these drawbacks, emerging and developing economies are likely

to continue accumulating reserves. And there is no doubt, despite the seeming ambiguity

of formal econometric evidence, that these countries found reserves to be useful in the

crisis.15 Yet the crisis also illustrated systemic problems of reserve accumulation, as

described earlier. Many countries were unwilling to run down their reserves sharply,

precisely because smaller reserves might signal financial weakness compared with

neighboring economies (see the related discussion of Aizenman and Sun 2009). Korea,

for example, was reluctant to let its reserves to fall too low, and thus drew on its $30

billion swap line from the Fed (which itself may have had an important signaling effect)

despite substantially larger remaining reserve holdings.

           To avoid losing too many reserves, EMEs found creative ways to stretch them.

Several engaged in nonstandard foreign exchange operations, which effectively targeted

specific financial vulnerabilities implied by private foreign exchange positions, while

allowing the general demand for foreign exchange by relatively nonsystemic agents to go

unsatisfied (see Ishi, Stone, and Yehoue 2009 and, on Brazil, Stone, Walker, and Yasui

2009). For example, rather than injecting reserves generally into the market to counteract

domestic capital flight and the resulting currency depreciation, some authorities provided

foreign exchange at bargain rates to strategic banks and corporations with short-term
15
     A recent study pointing to a positive role for reserves is Dominguez, Hashimoto, and Ito (2011).


                                                      21
foreign-currency debts. To return to the Korean example once again, the country was able

to tolerate extensive won depreciation during the global crisis without the widespread

financial distress characteristic of earlier crashes.16



The IMF and Global Liquidity



In principle, a world central bank, as envisioned by Keynes in his original blueprint for

an international “Clearing Union,” would be in a position to provide liquidity on a global

basis to troubled financial institutions throughout the world – as well as directly to

troubled sovereigns, were it not bound by statutory prohibitions against such lending, as

the ECB is. Indeed, there is no logical reason why a world central bank would be limited

to the issuance and management of a single currency. In an ideal world, an omniscient

and benevolent central bank could deal in a multiplicity of different national currencies,

allowing exchange rates to float or managing them to whatever degree was optimal. From

a political standpoint, of course, the idea is completely infeasible.

         The IMF is the version of Keynes’s ambitious plan that proved politically

feasible, and its capacities, while quite useful and arguably essential (see Fischer 1999

and Goodhart 1999), remain severely limited. Historically, the Fund has truly been the

last resort for sovereigns, typically when it is too late to fend off a crisis, and subject to

conditionality that sometimes strengthens a government’s hand against domestic

opposition, but that also may contribute to political and social unrest. The Fund lends


16
  The practice has an analog in the classic debate over whether lenders of last resort should lend into the
market or directly to individual institutions. The collateral benefit of the latter approach in the case of
foreign-currency operations is the benefit to exporters of a large depreciation. For conceptual discussions
see Jeanne and Wyplosz (2003) and Calvo (2006).


                                                     22
exclusively to governments, and not directly to central banks or financial institutions, so

as currently designed, it is completely unsuitable for undertaking the type of crisis

lending to banks and other financial actors that proved so important during the global

crisis. Nor can it mimic the ECB’s role in lending to euro zone banks during that

currency area’s crisis.

        True, the Fund’s resources increased significantly in 2009. Its flexibility to lend

them quickly based on ex ante qualification, and with relaxed conditionality, was

extended through the Flexible and Precautionary Credit Lines. But the FCL and PCL

have been little more successful than earlier related initiatives. Among other problems,

countries seem to fear stigmatization, both from approaching the Fund to request a credit

line and from the possibility that the IMF Executive Board fails to renew it down the

road. Thus, the uptake on these facilities has been very limited: Mexico, Poland, and

Colombia for the FCL, and only Macedonia for the PCL. In November 2011 the Fund

announced replacement of the PCL by a new facility, the Precautionary and Liquidity

Line (PLL), which extends the PCL in allowing a Fund member to apply for assistance

even if it has an actual crisis at the time the line is approved (rather than just a potential

crisis as the PCL required).

        One alternative proposal put forward by IMF staff is for a Global Stabilization

Mechanism (GSM), which could allow the Fund to respond proactively with aid offers

once a systemic event is identified by the Executive Board (see International Monetary

Fund 2010). However, this approach remains controversial – as do related proposals for

the domestic financial sphere that are based on a systemic trigger – and at this stage there

are several versions of GSM on the table, the details of which differ considerably. None




                                              23
seems likely to survive. An obvious problem area concerns the precise criteria under

which the Fund would call a systemic event, and the response of markets in anticipation

of such a declaration.

        A prominent mode through which the IMF can augment global liquidity is

through the issuance of the Special Drawing Right (SDR). But the SDR is not currently

used for private transactions, and considerable obstacles impede development of a private

SDR market (Eichengreen 2011). Notwithstanding the SDR’s non-currency status, some

(for example, Zhou 2009) have argued for an international reserve system centered

primarily on the SDR rather than the U.S. dollar. Such recent calls echo the Second

Amendment to the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, which in 1978 set the ambitious goal of

making the SDR the “principal reserve asset in the international monetary system.”

        The SDR was launched on January 1, 1970 after long international negotiations

motivated by two main concerns. First, policymakers feared that U.S. balance of

payments deficits might not, in the long run, provide sufficient international liquidity to

meet the demands of a growing world economy. Second, policymakers feared that the

dollar-based gold exchange standard would experience increasing instability because of

the Triffin dilemma. The SDR, characterized at the time as “paper gold,” was designed as

a limited form of unconditional liquidity, which governments could trade to other

governments in exchange for hard-currency reserves.17

        Until the recent big allocation of August and September 2009 following the onset

of the global crisis, SDR allocations were infrequent, taking place only over 1970-72 and

1979-81. None of these allocations, not even the most recent one, has pushed the total


17
  For accounts of the thinking behind the SDR’s birth, and its early history, see Cumby (1983), Solomon
(1996), and Boughton (2011).


                                                   24
stock of SDRs to be a large fraction of global foreign exchange reserves. Figure 8

illustrates the numbers, based on data in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics.

         The stock of SDRs has never exceeded about 6 percent of global reserves, and

that global figure declined steadily until 2009 following the 1979-81 allocation. On the

eve of the crisis SDRs were less than 0.5 percent of global reserves, and an even smaller

percentage of emerging and developing country reserves. In April 2009 the IMF allocated

USD 250 billion worth of SDRs as a response to the global crisis, and a further USD 34

billion in a September 2009 special allocation to endow members that had never received

allocations. Except for such extraordinary allocations, SDR allocations are proportional

to IMF quotas, so as to achieve an internationally balanced increase in world reserves.

Thus, the bulk goes to the advanced economies (which also hold much lower stocks of

foreign exchange reserves). Even the nominally large 2009 allocations restored the SDR

share in global and poorer-country reserves only to the levels of the late 1980s (about 2

percent for the latter group).

         The SDR framework is in principle a form of reserve pooling. Thus, the prospects

of replacing actual reserve currencies such as the dollar and euro with SDRs are

inherently limited: Because SDRs have no private use and function only as claims on the

reserve pool, they cannot themselves supplant the reserve pool. 18

         While the SDR therefore could not become the world’s principal reserve asset

under current arrangements, proposals for a “substitution account” are designed to



18
  As a technical matter, SDRs can be exchanged for dollars not only with non-U.S. dollar holders, but also
with the U.S. Treasury, which obtains the dollars from the Fed in exchange for dollar-denominated
Treasury obligations called SDR Certificates. (The Fed will routinely sterilize such money creation, and all
currency risk resides with the Treasury.) However, it is unlikely that the Treasury and Fed would be willing
to undertake such exchanges in the amounts that would be required were SDRs to become the dominant
international reserve asset.


                                                    25
replace currency reserves with SDRs on a large scale. Such ideas were debated in 1979-

80, ultimately to no avail, but they have resurfaced recently (for example, Kenen 2010).

Figure 8 shows that substitution would have to be on a huge scale to displace a

substantial portion of currency reserves.

       Under a substitution scheme, a country such as China might transfer some of its

dollar reserves to the IMF, receiving SDRs of equal current value in return. (These SDRs

would have to be created outside the usual allocation process, of course.) Two portfolio

shifts occur as a result. China is now long SDRS, and might (or might not) want to

readjust its portfolio in private markets. Presumably, its degree of participation in the

scheme will already reflect its diversification goals. More importantly, the IMF is short

SDRs and long on U.S. dollars, and the substitution account’s solvency is at risk if the

dollar depreciates. China has passed some of its substantial currency risk to the IMF.

       Which countries will compensate the IMF for portfolio losses if the dollar

declines against the SDR? How will the IMF finance “exorbitant privilege” discrepancies

between the interest earned on its dollars and that paid on its new SDR liabilities? In the

last discussions of 1979-80, some countries involved thought the U.S. should bear the

bulk of the costs, but the U.S. was unwilling and others refused to step in. Poorer

countries were reluctant to see the IMF use its gold holdings to support the account – they

hoped gold sales might instead subsidize borrowing by poorer countries. So the

negotiations failed. It is unlikely that the U.S. would be more willing today, and even less

so that the euro zone countries – which lack a centralized fiscal organ – would be willing

to underwrite a euro/SDR substitution account.




                                             26
           Once again, the fiscal dimension is central. The absence of a fiscal authority at the

global level creates a difficult coordination problem for a centralized and coordinated

move to an SDR-based system, even though that system might confer some stability

advantages (for example, by discouraging large official portfolio shifts).19



Globalized Last-Resort Lending



The IMF’s traditional function of lending to sovereign governments leaves it ill equipped

for the more direct financial-market interventions traditionally associated with domestic

lenders of last resort. Even the newer more flexible lending facilities, which could

channel the needed resources through governments in principle, are likely to involve time

delays and informational frictions. Furthermore, the known quantitative limits of such

facilities can be an obstacle to reassuring markets that the authorities are capable of

intervening with overwhelming force. It is no accident that the Federal Reserve found it

useful to remove the quantitative limits on some of its swap lines as the 2007-09 crisis

unfolded.

               A different approach would institutionalize the network of swap lines between

central banks that arose in an ad hoc way during the 2007-09 crisis Operationally,

national central banks could extend the swap lines to a central international institution

such as the IMF or (as some central bankers might prefer) the Bank for International

Settlements (BIS). Other central banks, when in need of foreign currency to support

stressed financial sectors, would then be able to draw on the swaps, just as the ECB

obtained dollars from the Fed under the recent arrangements. Such a system could be
19
     For an account of the 1979-80 negotiations over a substitution account, see Boughton (2001, pp. 936-43).


                                                      27
based on the SDR, though it need not be. Truman (2008, 2010) has proposed modifying

existing rules to allow countries directly to present SDRs to central banks in return for the

currencies the banks issue. Obstfeld (2009) and Farhi, Gourinchas, and Rey (2011)

suggest systems based on explicit credit lines.

           Unlike the recent improvised swap network, a permanent system would be

predictable rather than ad hoc and all countries, not just a select few, would have access.

But the system would avoid the externalities inherent in large-scale self-insurance

through reserve accumulation. For example, there would be no scope for official switches

between reserve currencies in order to manage currency risk. Nor would reserve demands

depress the interest rates of reserve issuers.

           The terms of access to the credit network could be conditional. For example,

participating central banks might be required to satisfy criteria of independence and

supervisory diligence. A variable participation fee might cover potential financial losses,

in analogy to the charge Prasad (2011) has suggested for his proposed liquidity insurance

pool. The fee could be structured so as to encourage sound macroeconomic and financial

policies – for example, rising in the face of an unusual and apparently unjustified credit

boom. Staff from the IMF, the BIS, or even from participating central banks could be

deployed to carry out the necessary surveillance. Credit limits might also be structured so

as to alter incentives.

           Both graduated participation terms and international surveillance offer partial

brakes on moral hazard – the risk that expanded liquidity facilities encourage key actors

in the financial system to behave more imprudently than they would in the absence of a




                                                 28
safety net. But moral hazard could be limited further by complementary reforms that

target government incentives.

          There are two main ways in which enhanced international liquidity could

encourage governments toward actions with negative global externalities: by promoting

excessive fiscal deficits (even outside of currency unions) and lax prudential oversight of

domestic private-sector finance. Governments would be better motivated to limit deficits

if any swap network participation fee depended on fiscal variables, as in Prasad’s (2011)

proposal. But more generally, and regardless of the state of international liquidity

arrangements, predictable means of restructuring sovereign debts, even the debts of

mature economies, can push private incentives into better alignment with society’s

interests. Such mechanisms can limit excessive government borrowing through rising

marginal costs, but, as Charles Goodhart stresses in his chapter, they also may improve

the incentives of the creditor-country governments whose financial institutions may be

bankrolling profligate governments (as well as those of the institutions themselves).

          If governments wish for institutionalized sovereign restructuring mechanisms

to be credible, however, they should complement them with limits on the banking

sector’s unhedged exposure to risky sovereign debts. Such limits remain difficult to

conceive in the euro zone in the absence of a common “safe” euro area bond, simply

because of the big role sovereign bonds play as collateral.

          Mandatory subscription to a set of common regulatory standards and

procedures would serve to limit individual governments’ discretion in prudential

oversight. These norms would more effectively limit private-sector risk seeking if they

encompassed guidelines on institutional size – so as to mitigate the “too big to fail”




                                             29
problem – as well as predictable and credible resolution procedures for systemically

important financial institutions, including resolutions involving multiple governments. As

noted above, implementation of these undertakings could be subject to international

surveillance, with transgressions resulting in higher participation fees.

               A general lesson of recent experience is that a system for counteracting

illiquidity needs to account for the possibility that the underlying cause of market panic is

insolvency. There is no uniquely defined dividing line between the two – in no small part

because market perceptions are a key driver of borrowing costs and, thus, of the ability to

service debt – but there will clearly be cases in which state or institutional bankruptcy

becomes inevitable.

               The possibility of insolvencies raises the potential fiscal cost any international

arrangements to enhance global liquidity. As Goodhart (1999) has stressed, the backing

for the lender of last resort in cases of insolvency comes from the fiscal authorities. Thus,

as has been painfully evident during the euro zone’s debt crisis, collective action to

promote financial stability must be financed through collective action in the fiscal

sphere.20 Unfortunately, in today’s world of huge banking sectors there also can come a

point at which insolvency problems become so big that they bring the creditworthiness

even of governments into question – at which point it may well be that the only

remaining resort is again the central bank’s printing press.

III. Exchange Rates and Global Imbalances



The final demise of the Bretton Woods system in 1973 took the form of a disorderly

retreat to floating exchange rates among the main industrial countries. Despite the

unplanned and indeed initially unintended nature of the regime change, a number of

eminent economists such as Milton Friedman and Harry G. Johnson had long espoused

floating rates as a means of reconciling national policy sovereignty with the benefits of

global economic integration. To a considerable degree floating exchange rates have been

successful, which explains why, in this century, even a growing number of EMEs have

been opting for greater exchange rate flexibility. Yet, most of the Friedman-Johnson

claims have not been borne out fully, and it is increasingly clear that floating rate have

left ample room for politically contentious spillovers in economic policy.

          Predictions that floating rates would remove the need for international liquidity

have clearly proven wrong, and the earlier part of this chapter discussed the reasons why.

As a group, the EMEs conducted massive foreign reserve accumulation even as many of

them were moving to more flexible exchange rate regimes.

          Also problematic, in light of experience, have been the claims that floating or

flexible exchange rates would painlessly facilitate the adjustment to real (output-market)

shocks or ensure the rapid adjustment of current account imbalances. Most

fundamentally, two countries share every bilateral exchange rate, and there is no

guarantee in general that both will take the same view of its optimal level. Due to

asymmetries in economic structure, the difficulties of adjusting to exchange rate changes

have proven greater for emerging and developing countries, igniting talk of “currency




                                             31
wars” and renewed policy attention to capital controls as a means of exchange-rate

management.



Exchange Rates, Resource Allocation, and Coordination in the Short Run



Sharp exchange rate movements driven by financial-market changes can have unwelcome

effects on resource allocation, effects that are especially painful for poorer countries.

These effects lead to “fear of floating” behavior in the mode of Calvo and Reinhart

(2002), and lie behind the recent attacks of some EME governments on the Federal

Reserve’s accommodative monetary response to recession.

           Figure 9 illustrates a configuration typical of many EMEs in the post-crisis

period. Assume that domestic nominal wages and nontraded goods prices are sticky,

whereas traded goods’ prices show a full pass-through to the exchange rate. Assume also

that traded goods are priced in world markets, and that the tradables sector is competitive.

Finally, imagine that capital and labor are sector-specific in the short run, that is, unable

to migrate between traded and nontraded goods industries.

           In the figure, the downward-sloping locus NN shows combinations of the

nominal exchange rate E (price of foreign currency) and total domestic spending Z such

that labor in the nontradable sector is fully (but not overly) employed. (A rise in Z at a

constant exchange rate would cause excess demand for nontradables, but currency

appreciation lowers tradables prices and shifts demand toward the latter goods.) The

horizontal schedule TT gives the exchange rate at which, given nominal wages, the

tradable sector’s labor supply is fully employed. The upward-sloping schedule XX shows




                                              32
combinations of spending and the exchange rate at which the current account is in

balance (however defined).

          The economy is initially at point A, with output above potential in nontradables

and a current account surplus. Because product wages are low in tradables, output is also

above potential there. There is upward cost pressure in both sectors and upward price

pressure in nontradables.

          Consider the impact, at a constant spending level, of a sharp nominal

appreciation that moves the economy to point B. Perhaps a large foreign country has

loosened monetary policy; perhaps markets are looking forward to and speculating on

tighter domestic monetary policy. In either case, output falls in both sectors and the

tradables sector experiences a particularly sharp decline in capital income. In the case

shown, inflationary pressures subside but at the cost of underemployment in both sectors.

The current account surplus shrinks as the economy moves closer to XX.

          These impacts are painful, so much so that many EMEs in positions like point

A have preferred to resist appreciation, accumulating substantial additional foreign

reserves in the process and sterilizing them in an attempt to avoid feeding domestic

inflation. Figure 10 illustrates the experience of a sample of EMEs with respect to real

appreciation (bilateral, against the U.S. dollar) and reserve accumulation in 2010. As

exchange market pressure rises, countries generally have allowed more appreciation but

also have intervened more heavily, and in some cases massively.

          When EMEs as a group face an expansionary global monetary shock

emanating from the industrial countries, the result is a coordination failure reminiscent of

the competitive depreciation of old – or at least, it is competitive nonappreciation. But




                                             33
unlike the currency competition of the Great Depression, more recent rounds have been

adding fuel to inflationary fires. The problem has gained quantitative importance through

the growth of intra-EME trade. How does the coordination failure come about?

            The Chinese yuan’s relative weakness against the U.S. dollar, for example,

makes Brazil even less willing to appreciate the real (and vice versa); so both countries

intervene more, and accumulate more dollar reserve claims, the latter being feasible in

unlimited amounts. To the extent that sterilization is imperfect, the latter process fuels

asset-price appreciation and inflation, in a manner reminiscent of the Bretton Woods

system’s collapse in the early 1970s. (Figure 1 showed the explosive growth in foreign

exchange reserves during those few years.)

            The problem can conveniently be formalized as a Prisoner’s Dilemma in a

stylized world with three currencies, the real (R), yuan (Y), and U.S. dollar (U).21 If α is

the share of intra-EME trade, then using triangular arbitrage in the foreign exchange

market we may express the (log) nominal effective exchange rates of the real and yuan in

terms of bilateral nominal exchange rates as:



           e Re ff = e R / $ + α e $ / Y ,


           e Ye ff = e Y / $ + α e $ / R .

            The payoffs in the game are determined as follows. Both countries face

medium-term inflationary pressures, which do not affect the price level adjusted

exchange rate in the short run but are counted as costs with present value –0.9 in both

21
  In a related strategic analysis, Ogawa and Ito (2002) analyze the interdependence of two neighboring
countries’ choices of optimal basket pegs for their respective currencies.


                                                   34
countries. Figure 11 shows the game between Brazil and China in normal form, and it

includes the information (upper left corner) that if both countries fix to the U.S. dollar,

the payoffs are –0.9 for Brazil (first entry) and –0.9 for China (second entry). I will

assume that if a country appreciates by 1 payoff unit, its payoff from that action is the

change in the (log) nominal effective exchange rate (given by the equations above), but

domestic inflation pressures are eliminated. Thus, in the lower left corner of the payoff

matrix, where Brazil appreciates but China continues to peg the yuan, Brazil pays an

effective appreciation cost of –1 (as the cost of future inflation drops to 0) but China pays

a cost of only –(0.9–α), since its inflation cost (equal to –0.9) is partially offset by an

effective nominal depreciation due to the real’s nominal appreciation against the dollar (a

gain equal to α as a result of the rise in e$/R by 1 unit). Critical to the example, of course,

is my assumption that policymakers view appreciation today as being more costly than

inflation tomorrow.

           Assuming further that α > 0.1, we see that the efficient solution is for both

countries to appreciate jointly against the dollar, thereby reducing their losses from

inflation as shown in the lower right corner of Figure 11. But this is not a Nash

equilibrium: each country has an incentive to defect so as to free ride on the other’s

appreciation. The sole Nash equilibrium – the noncooperative solution – is where both

countries fix to the dollar and suffer inflation later as a result.

           Notice that EMEs lose no matter what (in this simplified game). But even if

there is nothing they can do to change U.S. monetary policy, they can limit their losses

more effectively if they can coordinate amongst each other. The gains to cooperation are

greater the greater is the extent of intra-EME trade (or competition in third markets), as




                                               35
roughly measured by α in the example above. As a coordination mechanism, the IMF

could deploy its staff’s analytical firepower so as to quantify and advertise the

availability to such cooperation gains among EMEs. If policymakers want the Fund to be

more effective in promoting global cooperation, they should encourage it to provide very

concrete illustrations of the gains such cooperation would provide for individual member

countries. The Fund is ideally positioned to explain how the pieces of the global economy

fit together.

           The costs of allowing currency appreciation (and larger currency fluctuations

in general) appear somewhat lower for the mature industrial economies (with Japan a

possible exception). These economies have larger domestic markets for their tradable

goods and more ability to price to market so as to cushion exchange-rate effects on

domestic prices.



Capital Inflow Controls



In the example just discussed, countries face a tradeoff: appreciation would lower

domestic inflation pressure, but at the cost of lower employment. Domestic monetary

tightening would dampen inflation, but at the cost of even sharper currency appreciation.

This is a classic instance of the trilemma.

           Some EMEs have turned increasingly to capital inflow controls as a way out,

with apparently limited success. (For the moment no mature economy – not even the

ultimate safe haven, Switzerland – appears likely to embrace controls, although

Switzerland has placed a ceiling on its franc’s value.) The IMF has moved increasingly to




                                              36
acceptance that capital inflow controls are a legitimate policy tool in some circumstances,

turning from what once was fairly monolithic opposition to discussions of the appropriate

use of controls (see Ostry and others, 2010, 2011).

            In principle there are two (often correlated in practice but conceptually

distinct) motivations for inflow controls. First, there is the macroeconomic motivation of

reducing exchange market pressure in the form of the volume of capital inflows –

basically, escape from the trilemma. Second, there is the macroprudential motivation,

which certainly includes changing the composition of capital flows but might also target

the volume if the capacity of the financial sector safely to intermediate funds is limited.

Available evidence suggests that controls have been more successful in influencing the

composition of flows – for example, inducing a lengthening of debt maturities (Chile) or

a shift from external debt to equity (India) – than in moderating volumes or real

appreciation pressures.22

            From a macroprudential standpoint, however, capital inflow controls would

often appear to be a second-best tool, the first best being a response that more directly

targets the relevant financial distortion. For example, a country concerned about banks’

currency mismatch should restrict or tax all foreign-currency liabilities, not just those

contracted with nonresidents. In theory, however, one can certainly devise cases in which

the optimal feasible policy intervention, from a nationalistic or even global welfare

standpoint (Korinek 2011), is to tax foreign borrowing or debt.23 Ostry and others (2011)

suggest that capital inflow controls be deployed in preference to macroprudential

22
  See Magud, Reinhart, and Rogoff (2011) for a recent survey.
23
  I would conjecture that in cases where global rather than just national efficiency is impaired, the second-
best intervention could involve not only taxation of capital inflows, but also taxation of outflows on the part
of source countries. If true, this result would furnish a formal case for symmetric adjustment on the part of
lending and borrowing countries (see below).


                                                     37
instruments mainly when financial inflows enter the economy through nonbank entities

such as large nonfinancial corporations. Some countries, of course, have used putative

macroprudential tools in attempts to escape the constraints of the trilemma.

           If capital inflow controls were to become generally accepted as part of the

policy toolkit, however, transparency would be enhanced if the international community

were to develop guidelines as to which instruments are admissible and the circumstances

in which they will be used. A regime based on rules, rather than discretion, seems more

likely to enhance predictability and thereby avoid financial-market volatility. It should

also be recognized that inflow controls entail possible negative international spillovers. A

country imposing them unilaterally may simply divert financial inflows to neighboring

economies. Capital inflow controls, as in China’s case, give a country more latitude to

maintain an artificially competitive exchange rate and thereby contribute to larger global

imbalances. Thus, if policymakers wish to reduce global externalities from the use of

controls, internationally coordinated surveillance, most plausibly conducted by the IMF,

is likely to be helpful.



Global Imbalances



Current account imbalances have not become smaller and less persistent in the era of

floating exchange rates. Instead, increasing financial capital mobility (in part supported

by floating rates, as suggested by Obstfeld and Taylor 2004) has eased the financing of

deficits and allowed easier disposition of excess national savings. Moreover, the “long

run” in which the real exchange rate should reflect the requirement of external balance




                                            38
has become considerably more distant. (Figure 12 shows the aggregates of measured

world current account surpluses and deficits after 1980, which both peaked at about 3

percent of world output just before the crisis broke in 2006.) The time-honored problem

of asymmetric adjustment pressure on surplus and deficit countries remains as intractable

as ever, as Charles Goodhart emphasizes in his chapter.

            In the mid-2000s, Dooley, Folkerts-Landau, and Garber (2008, 2009) advanced

a “Bretton Woods II” paradigm according to which the big global imbalances of the

period, driven in part by the Chinese authorities’ desire and capacity to industrialize on

the back of exports, might be sustainable for a decade or more. That hypothesis led to a

lively debate. For examples of the critiques see Roubini (2006), Obstfeld and Rogoff

(2007), Wolf (2008), and Hall and Tavlas (2011).

            The global imbalance configuration of the mid-2000s appears in retrospect to

have been problematic, which should not be too surprising because it bears a resemblance

to several other episodes that ended in tears (and perhaps also to the current configuration

of imbalances). Asia in general (outside of Japan) was growing at a rate exceeding that of

the mature economies, with China in particular pursuing a “vent for surplus” growth

model (Caves 1965).24 Several mature economies, but most notably the United States,

were absorbing Asian exports through growing consumption and indebtedness (not

through growing productive investment, much of which was taking place anyway in

residential housing).

            While a soft landing is theoretically possible in this scenario, the rapid increase

in U.S. household debt that made America the world’s spending locomotive relied on the


24
  There are analogies in the early postwar experiences in Western Europe and Japan. On Europe, see
Kindleberger (1967).


                                                  39
collateral of rising and inflated home values, which were bound to collapse and did

starting in 2006. Given actual and prospective U.S. income growth in the middle 2000s,

there was no way that China could maintain its own more rapid export-led growth for

much longer on the back of growing U.S. household debt, without U.S. households

becoming insolvent. The virulence of the resulting financial meltdown, of course,

reflected the gross positions that financial actors in the U.S. and Europe had unwisely

assumed prior to the start of the U.S. housing collapse.

            In analyzing potential perils due to global imbalances, it is once again

important to ask how the pieces fit together. When large surplus countries grow more

rapidly than deficit countries, consumption growth in the latter is necessarily increasing

faster than income, a process that is very likely to end in crisis unless the debtor’s income

growth catches up. Indeed, just this problem underlies the sovereign debt crisis within the

euro zone; see the insightful analysis by Giavazzi and Spaventa (2010). Similarly, the

current account deficit of the U.S. in the early 2010s, while diminished compared to

2006, is underpinned by large fiscal deficits that are unsustainable over the longer term.

            In such situations, a main brake on the behavior of surplus countries is the fear

that the assets they are accumulating (whether held by the public sector – Chinese dollar

reserves – or the private sector – German banks’ holdings of Greek sovereign debt) might

be devalued. (Another is the threat of protection.) If policymakers wish international

lenders to be cognizant of risks they are running, then it is important that the international

financial system be structured so as to make such fears rational, as Goodhart stresses in

his chapter.25 But we should not expect such a system substantially to reduce the


25
  Keynes (1924) may have been the first to observe that the risk of default on foreign investments might
render their level excessive from a purely nationalistic perspective. The fact that nowadays, default losses


                                                     40
adjustment burdens of deficit countries, which will still suffer more tightly constrained or

more expensive credit as they appear riskier.

            The IMF has the standing to speak out when, in its view, large and persistent

external imbalances threaten to result in a solvency crisis, whether in the public or private

sectors. The IMF also is in a position to urge cooperative policy scenarios that can make

the process of reducing global imbalances easier for all participants. If policymakers wish

to raise the weight of the IMF’s advice in the international community, they should

support reforms of IMF governance that make such pronouncements politically feasible

and credible regardless of the countries involved.

            A system of liquidity credit lines, as described in the last section, could

discourage precautionary reserve accumulation, although the latter can occur even in the

absence of current account surpluses.26 Proposals to formally tax large reserve holders,

either in an SDR-based reserve system or one based on currencies, are unlikely to gain

any traction, just as Keynes’s similar proposal failed in the 1940s.



IV. Conclusion


Problems of international liquidity and exchange rate management – staple fare in the

international monetary reform literature over many decades – remain painfully relevant

today, but in forms that sometimes differ from past incarnations. At bottom, many of the


may imperil entire domestic financial systems greatly reinforces Keynes’s insight. Subsequent literature has
reiterated the point (for example, Kemp 1962 and Krugman and Obstfeld 1988, p. 504) but perhaps not
often enough. In today’s world of large two-way capital flows, which may be highly unbalanced between
bilateral partners even when overall current account imbalances are small, one must recognize that the issue
really concerns gross rather than net international investment flows per se. In practice, however, current
account surplus countries can reduce their exposure over time by reducing their surpluses.
26
   Recall the much discussed “capital inflows problem” of disinflating developing countries. See Borio and
Disyatat (2011) for a reminder on the potential decoupling of the current account and balance of payments.


                                                    41
coordination problems that arise stem from asymmetries in the structures, growth rates,

and cyclical positions of the mature economies and the developing world. These two

segments of the global economy are fast approaching (and on some measures have

reached) equal size, as measured by real GDP.

           Many years ago, Richard Cooper (1969, p. 600) drew an intriguing connection

between the extent of policy cooperation over macroeconomic policies and the need for

international liquidity. I believe that his point remains valid:



       The degree of … international cooperation … influences the amount of liquidity
       needed to finance imbalances in the face of temporarily divergent and conflicting
       national policies. The more cooperation, the more carefully coordinated national
       policies are in timing and nature, the lower the need for international liquidity to
       finance imbalances.


           I have argued that, in addition, there is considerable scope for a cooperative

approach to global liquidity provision today. A collateral benefit of such cooperation is

that it can mitigate other coordination failures in national economic policies.

Unfortunately, these continue to cause tensions between governments, and there are no

easy solutions in a world of sovereign nations.
