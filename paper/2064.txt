                The Economic Consequences of the Franc Poincare




                                   ABSTRACT



     In this paper we reassess the cyclical performance of the French
economy in the 1920s, focusing in particular on the period 1926—1931 and on
France's resistance to the Great Depression. France expanded rapidly after
1926 and, unlike the other leading industrial economies, resisted the onset
of the Depression until 1931. We find strikingly little support for the
conventional explanation for these events, which emphasizes an undervalued
French franc and an export—led boom. While French exports as a share of GDP
turned down as early as 1928, the economy continued to expand for several
subsequent years. Investment, not exports, emerges as the proximate source
of the French economy's resistance to the Great Depression. And fiscal
policy emerges as the major determinant of the surge in French investment
spending. Previous accounts have emphasized the role of monetary policy in
determining the real and nominal exchange rates ostensibly responsible for
French economic fluctuations in the decade after 1921. In contrast, we argue
here for a more balanced view of the roles of monetary and fiscal policies

    I. Introduction


         The macroeconomic performance of the French economy in the 1920s
    contrasts sharply with cyclical experience in the rest of the industrialized
    world.    French gross domestic product and industrial output grew with
                                                                        1
    exceptional vigor over the first half of the 1920s (see Table 1).        After a
    recession in 1926—27 and despite a noticeable deceleration in the rate of
    economic growth, through the end of the decade the French economy continued to
    expand at a rate significantly in excess of the international average.      Well
    into calendar year 1930, France remained immune to the effects of the Great
    Depression, and even in 1931 the downturn remained moderate compared to other
    parts of the world. But once the full effects of the Depression were felt, its
    impact in France was exceptionally severe; as late as 1938 gross domestic
    product had not recovered to 1931 levels.


         Accounts of the interwar period attach more weight to the exchange rate
    than to any other variable affecting the French economy's macroeconomic
    performance. Histories of the period 1919—1926 are dominated by "the battle
    of the franc," when financial difficulties culminating in the loss of 80 per
    cent of the currency's external value greatly stimulated the export industries
    and macroeconomy. The period 1926—1931 is characterized as the golden era of
    the "franc Poincaré," when exchange—rate stabilization at an undervalued
    parity enhanced the competitiveness of French exports, stimulating growth
    through the end of the decade and insulating the economy from the onset of the
    Great Depression.   Then successive devaluations of other major currencies
    starting in 1931 rendred the franc overvalued and greatly exacerbated the
    impact of the slump on French industry and trade, largely accounting for the
    singular depth and long duration of the French Depression.


         Typically monetary policy is credited with driving the exchange rate and
    the French economy over the decade ending in 1930. Fiscal policy plays a role
    only insofar as it influences money supply. In conventional accounts, the
-
    period through the summer of 1926 is marked by real and nominal exchange rate
    depreciation due to excessive money creation. Real depreciation stimulated
    -the French economy for reasons related to both aggregate demand and aggregate
    supply.    On the supply side, the rise in producer prices exceeded the rate of
    wage inflation, reducing unit labor costs and thereby encouraging firms to

increase employment and production. On the demand side, the rate of exchange—
rate depreciation exceeded the rate of domestic inflation, enhancing the
competitiveness of exports and switching expenditure toward French goods. The
period after 1926 is marked by stabilization of the franc at an undervalued
rate.      Stabilization, by eliminating inflation and reducing nominal interest
rates, increased the demand for money, which, under France's gold standard
rules, could only         be obtained by running a balance—of-payments surplus and
                      2
importing reserves.       Hence the franc's undervaluation continued to stimulate
exports after 1926.       In this conventional view, the French economy's expansion
in the decade ending in 1930 is a classic instance of export—led growth.


        In this paper we reassess the cyclical performance of the French economy
in the 1920s, focusing particularly on the period 1926-1931 and on France's
resistance to the Great Depression.           Our analysis of French macroeconomic
performance differs from the conventional view.       We find strikingly little
support for the export—based explanation of French economic growth after 1926.
While French exports as a share of GDP turn down as early as 1928, the economy
continues to expand for several subsequent years. Investment, not exports,
emerges as the proximate source of the French economy's resistance to the
Great Depression.         And fiscal policy energes as the major determinant of
French investment spending. In effect, we argue for a more balanced view of
the roles of monetary and fiscal policies in French macroeconomic fluctuations
over the decade 1921—1930.


        Throughout the     paper, our discussion of the links between French fiscal
policy and investment      stresses the resource flow or classic crowding—in
effects of observed reductions in the budget deficit. Eliminating the fiscal
deficit and moving the budget into successively larger surpluses made
available to private investors an increasing proportion of domestic savings.
There exists an alternative explanation which emphasizes instead Poincaré's
reputation for financial orthodoxy, according to which Poincaré's return to
power removed the spectre of financial uncertainty, prospective future budget
-deficits, and large—scale capital levies, igniting a massive capital inflow
 that reduced the required rate of return on capital and stimulated investment.
In fact, the two hypotheses are     -
                                          compatible, as we explain below. Our
empirical analysis suggests, however, that classic crowding in due to current
budgetary measures, rather than confidence—induced capital inflows due in part

French investment boom.


     In the course of challenging the traditional interpretation of French
macroeconomic trends in the 1920s, we touch on several issues of more general
interest relevant to contemporary experiences with fiscal stabilization.                      We
provide an explicit analysis of the effects of a fiscal contraction in a
perfect—foresight model of an open economy in which the government budget is
linked to stocks of productive capital and foreign debt, and in which fiscal
policy has an impact on employment due to inertia in labor markets.                    Previous
investigators have studied fiscal policy in the presence of wage and price

constraints     (Mundell, 1963; Fleming, 1962; Sachs, 1980). Dynamic models have
been developed but without capital accumulation (Branson and Buiter, 1983;
Sachs and Wyplosz, 1985; Cuddington and Vifials, 1986a, 1986b). Investigators
working in the disequilibrium tradition combine wage and price rigidities with
capital accumulation, but only under extremely restrictive assumptions about
dynamics (Neary and Stiglitz, 1983). In this paper, we integrate the essential
features of these models into a more general analytical framework.


II. French Economic Performance, 1921—1931


     Historical accounts of the French economy in the years 1921—30 typically
divide the decade into three segments: the period of inflation from 1921
through mid-1926, the period of stabilization from Poincaré's return to power
in July 1926 through the 1927 recession, and the period of renewed growth
through the end of 1930. The decline of the franc in the first half of the
twenties is credited with subsidizing exports and promoting investment by
lightening the burden of fixed charges (Kemp, 1972, p.97; Bernard, 1975, p.
180; Jackson, 1985, p. 11). Establishment of the franc Poincaré in the second
half of the decade, "by slightly undervaluing the currency," is credited with
stimulating "an export—led boom to round off the period of postwar prosperity"
(Kemp, 1972, p.84).              The Great Depression has relatively little impact on
France as late as 1930 chiefly because of exchange—rate undervaluation (Kemp,
1971, p. 89; 1972, p. 100).


     To assess the role of the exchange rate in these developments, it is
first necessary to have an adequate measure of its movement. We therefore

contruct quarterly time series for the real and nominal effective exchange
rates for the period 1922—1937. The nominal effective exchange rate is a
weighted average of bilateral rates against France's trading partners, with
trade shares serving as weights. The real effective exchange rate is the
product of the nominal effective rate and the ratio of foreign to domestic
prices. Both effective exchange rates are displayed in Chart


     Chart 2, where exports in constant 1929 prices are plotted along with the
real effective exchange rate, confirms that the real exchange rate had
powerful demand—side effects.6 But although persistent real depreciation was
accompanied by steady export growth through 1926, post—1927 experience is
inconsistent with the export—based interpretation of the French economy's
subsequent expansion.    Despite the real exchange rate's maintenance at its
peak level through 1930, export volume fell in 1929, reflecting the decline in
world incomes due to the onset of the Depression and the imposition of trade
restrictions abroad..7 The export share of GDP fell even earlier, in calendar
year 1928.   While exchange—rate depreciation may have prevented exports from
declining even more rapidly than this, the extent and even the very fact of
their decline suggests that the impact of real depreciation on export demand
cannot by itself account for the persistence of French economic growth after
1928.8


     To see whether these demand-side effects were accompanied by supply—side
stimuli, we consider in Chart 3 two measures of real labor costs: the nominal
wage deflated by wholesale and retail price indices, respectively labelled the
real producer and real consumer wage. While each index includes both traded
and nontraded goods, the wholesale price index places a heavier weight on
traded—goods prices.9 Since the profitability of traded goods production is
particularly relevant to the export—led interpretation of the French economy's
growth, we focus initially on money wages relative to wholesale prices as a
measure of the real wage. Although Chart 3 confirms that nominal wages lagged
wholesale prices during the 1922—26 inflation, it indicates also that much of
this reduction in real producer wages was eroded within a            year   of
stabilization.10 Once inflation was halted in 1926, the franc appreciated over
-the second half of the year and prices declined, albeit more slowly than the
exchange rate recovered.     As prices fell, money wages lagged behind, and by
1927—111 the relationship between wager and wholesale prices had been restored
to 1923 levels. By 1928 the franc rio longer provided the producers of traded

goods an incentive to expand export supplies. Thus, it does not appear that
the franc's depreciation had long-lived supply—side effects.


     This emphasis on supply—side considerations is predicated on the notion
that the real producer wage influenced the level of employment, because
employers adjusted hiring to equate the cost of labor and the value of its
marginal product. As evidence on this relationship, Chart 4 presents Calenson
and Zeilner's (1957) estimate of French unemployment along with our proxy for
the real producer wage. While this estimate of the unemployment rate is far
from definitive, even with a generous margin for error it would appear that
the real producer wage and unemployment tended to move in the same direction.
Although the 1927 recession, when firms apparently were demand constrained, is
a notable exception, the correspondence between the real producer wage and
unemployment is generally consistent with our interpretation.


     The finding that the franc's depreciation failed to have long—lived
supply—side effects contrasts with experience elsewhere in Europe both in the
first half of the 1920s and after 1931.          In both instances, nominal
depreciation tended to reduce real wages and have a sustained impact on unit
labor costs.11    Only in France in the mid-1920s was the impact of nominal
depreciation on real wages not sustained. The reason for the contrast, Chart
3 suggests, is not necessarily any exceptional flexibility of the French labor
market, but that the Poincard stabilization initiated a large fall in the
nominal exchange rate and in prices which largely neutralized the implications
for aggregate supply of the preceding depreciation.


     Thus, if the franc Poincaré insulated France from the initial effects of
the Great Depression, it must have worked through different channels than
those emphasized in simple aggregate-supply-aggregate--demand analyses. One
possibility is that it had major sectoral effects.  It is true that all
sectors of the economy did not share equally in France's initial immunity to
the Great Depression.        Textiles and autos did relatively poorly while
engineering machinery did relatively well.12 The general pattern seems to
favor investment—goods over consumer-goods industries.         Existing accounts
provide no guidance, however, as to why exchange-rate changes should have had
such differential effects.

        To shed further light on the behavior of investment—goods industries,
Chart 5 and Table 2 decompose GNP into consumption, investment, government
spending and the current account of the balance of payments. The share of
investment in GNP rises rapidly toward the end of the 1920s, from 14 per cent
in 1927 to nearly 21 per cent in 1930 and 19 per cent in 1931. In comparison,
the current account moves only slightly, from a surplus of three per cent of
GNP in 1926 to balance in 1930. The direction of its movement is in fact
inconsistent with the hypothesis that the growth of net exports provided the
stimulus for expansion. Clearly, the "French boom" of the second half of the
1920s was investment-led expansion, not export-led growth. Insofar as France
resisted the onset of the Depression, credit lies with the buoyancy of
         men      hj...-

        Chart 6 depicts the government budget balance as a percentage of GNP. The
budget moves from substantial deficit in the immediate postwar years to
balance by 1925—26 and then into surplus which peaks as a share of GNP in
1929. The correspondence between the budget surplus, the real effective
exchange rate and the share of investment in GNP indicates the need to explore
    the links between these variables.


        These shifts in the composition of demand between exports, investment and
government spending should have been promoted by the changes in relative
prices underlying the time series in Chart 3. As noted above, the rise in the
ratio of retail to wholesale prices after 1927 (shown explicitly in Chart 7)
implies an increase in the relative price of nontraded goods which should have
shifted resources out of the production of exportables and into the home goods
sector. This relative price appears to explain how the French economy
aceomodated the fall in export demand associated  with the onset of the
Depression abroad without significantly reducing the level of economic
activity. At approximately the same time the onset of the Depression was
reducing foreign demands for French exports, the rise in the relative price of
nontraded goods at home was transfering resources out         of the production of
exportables and into the production of nontradables.

-
        This   reallocation of resources cannot be viewed as a passive response to
the Depression, however.             Were this the case, one would expect the traded—
nontraded goods price to move concurrently with or to follow the decline in
export demand. In fact, the fall in the relative price of traded goods led by

a year the decline in the export share of French GNP. This suggests the need
to analyze supply conditions at a more disaggregated level.


    This review of French economic performance in the 1920s identifies two
central questions. First, why did the price and production of French exports
fall after 1927 despite the maintenance of a depreciated exchange rate?
Second, what accounts for the current surge in domestic investment? We take up
these questions one at a time in the next two sections.


III. Export Growth and Stabilization: A Franco-Scandinavian Model


     The relative price of traded and nontraded goods better tracks the path
of French exports than does the real exchange rate (the relative price of
imports and exports). Clearly, a one—sector model that fails to distinguish
between the production of traded and nontraded goods is incapable of capturing
key aspects of French economic performance in this period.'3


     The distinction between traded and nontraded goods has been popularized
by Scandinavian economists (e.g. Aukrust, 1977; Edgren, Faxen and Odhner,
1969).  In the Scandinavian model, wages are tied to the prices of traded
goods.14 Chart 3 suggests, however, that in the l920s French wages were more
closely linked to the cost of living inclusive of the prices of nontraded
goods. Our model therefore departs from the Scandinavian approach in its
specification of wage determination, and in addition by allowing the overall
level of employment to be endogenously determined)5


     We start with the small country assumption, which implies that rest—of—
world prices of traded goods P* together with the exchange rate determine the
domestic price of traded goods T (We relax the assumption of parametric
export prices in the next section.)


                 = eP                                                (1)


where the exchange rate e is the dommestic price of one unit of foreign

currency.   In what follows, P is normalized to unity. Throughout, T and N
subscripts denote traded and nontraded goods, respectively.

    We assume that the production of nontraded goods is less capital
intensive than the production of tradeables. For simplicity, nontraded goods
are characterized as Ricardian commodities, requiring inputs of labor alone.
(All our conclusions carry over to the general case, so long as nontraded
goods remain relatively labor intensive.)     Perfect competition, constant
returns to scale and marginal cost pricing together imply that the price of
nontraded goods is proportional to the wage W. Normalizing labor productivity
to unity:


                                                                       (2)


     Traded goods, in contrast, are Heckscher—Ohlin commodities, produced
using both labor and an exogenously fixed stock of capital. (We relax the
assumption of a fixed capital stock in the next section.) Given a production
function f(L,K) and the assumption of perfect competition, employment in the
traded goods sector is adjusted to equate the wage with the value marginal
product of labor (VMPLT):


              W =
                    T   fL(L) =   efL(L)                               (3)


where FL =    af/aL.     Inverting (3) yields the derived demand for labor in the
traded goods sector:


              LT =   f(W/e)                    f'<O                    (4)


     Under the small country assumption, domestic producers of traded goods
are never constrained in the quantities they sell: while domestic demand
depends on relative prices and income, any excess of domestic supply over
demand is exported to foreign markets. Domestic producers adjust production
and hiring to be on their labor demand curves. In Figure 1, employment in the
production of traded goods is the distance PLT. This distance is determined
by the intersection of the employment schedule VMPLT with the wage.


     In contrast to the demand for traded goods, which is perfectly elastic at
world prices, the demand for nontraded goods depends on domestic income (which
is proportional to total employment LT and LN) and on their relative price
        The (uncompensated) price elasticity of demand for nontraded goods
appears in Figure 1 as the DN schedule, which (under the Ricardian assumption)
                                                                                             —9—
is also the derived demand for labor in the nontraded goods sector.
Employment in the production of nontraded goods is the distance OLN:


                                                                                (5)
                  LN =   g(PIP)        g(W/e)            g'<O


     Aggregate labor supply is constant and represented in Figure 1 by the
length OP. Unemployment is the distance to LTLN. Taking the exchange rate as
exogenous, the model is closed by a wage determination rule. We assume that
labor mobility equates wages across sectors and, as suggested by Chart 3,
that economy—wide wages respond with a lag to the cost of living:16


                  Wt =   yei—I   +   (l—r))   P                                 (6)


     We     can     use this model to analyze the effects of a permanent,
unanticipated depreciation of the exchange rate.'7              Depreciation raises the
VMPTL schedule in Figure 1. Given the lagged response of nominal wages to the
cost of living, the real producer wage in the traded goods sector falls                 (

d(W/e)<O    ),    and employment in that sector expands to OL'T. Since W/e =
(from eqs. 1 and 2), depreciation switches domestic demand toward nontraded
goods.   Both the relative price and the income effects shift the DN schedule
upwards, increasing the demand for labor in the nontraded goods sector.    In
the period of the depreciation, unemployment falls from LTLN to L4 L'N. In
the subsequent period, wages respond to the initial rise in the cost of
living, restoring the equality V =                =T   = e and returning employment to its
initial level. In Figure 1 this is shown as an upward shift in the W =
schedule.

     These dynamics are depicted in Figure 2. A one—time depreciation moves
the system from  to 1; with the economy to the right of the 45 degree line,
the real wage has been reduced and the level of employment has been
correspondingly increased.              With no further change in the exchange rate, the
wage rises in the next period to ',               restoring employment to its initial
level.


     The model can be used to interpret several macroeconomic features of the
1920s. According to leading accounts of the period (e.g. Sauvy, 1984), the
years 1921—26 were dominated by a series of unanticipated depreciations)8
Each time the exchange rate depreciated, domestic prices initially lagged

behind.     Prices and wages subsequently responded, however, to increases in the
exchange rate.      In Figure 2, the path a—l-2—3—4—5 is meant to capture these
aspects of French experience. As in Chart 3,     the real wage (nominal wage
deflated by the cost of living) initially falls but remains stable in the face
of successive depreciations. (In contrast, the path ct-1'--2'—3'-4'—5' shows
the effects of accelerating depreciation.)         As in Chart 7, the CPI falls
relative to the WPI, since nontraded goods, whose prices depend heavily on the
now lower real wage, are more heavily represented in the CPI. As in Chart 4,
depreciation is associated with a decline in unemployment.      As in Chart 2,
depreciation is accompanied by a rise in exports.


      The effects of terminating inflation and pemitting the exchange rate to
appreciate before returning the franc to the gold standard (the policy
followed between Poincaré's return to power in the Summer of 1926 and the de
facto stabilization at the end of the year) are depicted in Figure 2 by the
path 5'—6'—&'. Due to the response of wages to lagged prices, real wages rise
above their initial level following stabilization, and employment temporarily
falls. As in Chart 4, stabilization is associated              with   transitional
unemployment, and, as in Chart 2, the volume of exports tends to decline.


      Thus, a simple model provides a coherent explanation for many of the
dominant macroeconomic characteristics of the French economy in the 1920s,
including the declining role of exports in French economy following the
Poincaré stabilization. What remains to be explained is the buoyancy of
investment in the post—stabilization era. In the next section, we therefore
imbed this Franco-Scandinavian framework in a dynamic, forward—looking model
of investment in the open economy.


IV.   Investment   and Fiscal Stabilization: A Dynamic Model


      In this section, we explore the links between the 1926 stabilization, the
subsequent decline in the export share of GNP, and the surge in investment
spending which was the proximate source of the French economy's resistance to
the onset of the Great Depression. The previous section explains the decline
in the export share as a delayed effect of exchange—rate stabilization.        In
this section, we integrate that explanation with an analysis of the investment
response.
                                                                                              — 11 —

       The   model providing the basis for the analysis is summarized in Table 3.
As in the Franco—Scandinavian model of the previous section, the domestic
economy produces both traded and nontraded goods, traded goods using capital
and labor, nontraded goods using labor alone. As in the previous section, the
price of nontraded goods is proportional to the wage. But in contrast to the
previous section, three distinct commodities are consumed: importables,
exportables and nontraded goods (with the domestic economy specialized in the
production of the last two). Demands depend on two relative prices, the price
of nontradables relative to exports                        and the price of imports relative
to exports (eP*IPE). Exportables are the numeraire throughout. We adopt the
semi—small—country assumption, that the world price of imports is given

of    influencing the world price of exports. We define the real exchange rate
as:


                      X =                                                               (7)
                                eP/PE

and the relative price of nontraded goods as:


                            =                                                           (8)

      In contrast to the Franco—Scandinavian model, the real exchange rate,
investment and the adjustment of government spending are now endogenously
determined.


      Real GDP, in units of exportables, is given by eq. 9 in Table 3. Real
expenditure, given by eq. 10, is a function of real disposable income and real
wealth Q. Disposable income as a determinant of expenditure can be jusitified
on the basis of liquidity constraints; thus, our expenditure function
incorporates both Keynesian and permanent income features.


      As in the previous section, the supply of traded goods is perfectly
elastic at the prevailing wage (eq. 12), with the wage adjusting gradually
over time to eliminate excess supply or demand in the labor market (eq.15).
Domestic expenditure is the sum of the demands of the private (eq. 13) and
public (eq. 14) sectors, whose allocations across commodities are derived from
instantaneous Cobb—Douglas utility functions.

     The real exchange rate X adjusts instantaneously to clear the market for
exportables (eq. 17). The demand for exportables is the sum of private (eq.
18), public (eq. 19) and foreign (eq. 20) consumption plus domestic investment
(eq. 17). Capital accumulation is a function of Tobin's q (eq. 21). Gross
investment spending differs from capital accumulation by an allowance for
capital depreciation at rate 8 (eq. 22).


     Domestic debt and equity are assumed to be perfect substitutes for one
another but imperfect substitutes for foreign assets. Foreigners do not hold
domestic assets. These assumptions highlight the role of the (exchange) risk
premium in rendering domestic residents willing to hold increasing quantities
of domestic assets. They are designed to capture the idea that increases in
public debt raise the danger of a capital levy on all domestic assets, a
policy option much discussed in France in the 1920s.


     Portfolio balance determines the relationship between the domestic real
interest rate, foreign real interest rate and real exchange rate:

where       is the real value of public debt (in units of exportables) and B*t
the net real value of foreign assets held by domestic residents. (Eq. 24 in
Table 3 is the inverted version of eq. 24'.) The right—hand side of eq. 24' is
the yield differential between domestic and foreign assets (denoted z))9 We
assume perfect foresight regarding the evolution of the real exchange rate, so


txt+1 =


        The perfect substitutability of domestic debt and equity implies that the
real yield on one period bonds r equals dividends plus capital gains on
shares. This arbitrage condition is given by eq. 23. We assume perfect
foresight regarding the equity prices              q which determine capital gains.
Dividends are assumed to equal the marginal productivity of capital.


        Eq. 25 is the government budget constraint. The growth of public debt
equals the excess of government spending G over the sum of net taxes T and
                                                                              — 13 —

debt   service rB (all in units of exportables). Changes in fiscal policy take
the form of changes in government spending, holding taxes constant.


       Our neglect of the monetary sector in general, and of money financing of
the deficit in particular, in our analysis of the post—1926 situation can be
justified on two grounds. First, under the gold standard the supply of money
was in principle determined exclusively by money demand.    Given a credibly
pegged exchange rate, nominal interest rates were determined exclusively by
interest rates in the rest of the world. Changes in the domestic credit
component of the monetary base therefore should have had no implications for
total money supply. Second, after 1926 the Bank of France functioned under
new     regulations which prohibited it from monetizing government budget
deficits.


       To analyze the post—1926 situation in France, we perform the following
experiment. Starting from steady—state equilibrium in period zero, we cut
government spending so as to reduce the steady state value of public debt from
B0 to L The real debt is assumed to evolve according to:


                Bt =   B1   +   — Bi)                                 (26)


Since taxes are held constant, eqs. 25 and 26 together determine the path of
public spending.2°


       Given its size, the model in Table 3 cannot be solved analytically.
Instead, we calibrate it using data for the l920s, linearize it around the
steady state, and simulate it under the assumption of perfect foresight.
Parameter values and initial conditions for endogenous variables are given in
Tables 3 and 4. While we have attempted to use historical data to guide the
selection of parameter values, any attempt at calibration can only approximate
the properties of the economy being modeled. We therefore urge caution in
interpreting the simulation results; they are meant only to illustrate the
properties of the simulation model and indicate the general orders of
magnitude of the result of our fiscal policy experiment.


       Our discussion emphasizes three aspects of the simulation results in
Table 4: the impact of the change in fiscal policy on investment, on the real
exchange rate, and on the relative price of nontraded goods.            We are

interested    in whether the simulation captures the surge in investment after
1927, the maintenance of the real exchange rate at low levels, and the early
rise in the relative price of nontraded goods.


     The simulation generates a real depreciation on impact followed by a
relatively flat real exchange rate path. As the fiscal contraction reduces
domestic demand, an incipient excess supply of exportables develops and is
eliminated through a fall in their relative price, which increases export
sales. The brevity of the 1927 recession may be explicable in part on the
basis of this expenditure—switching effect.


     Thus, we find that not only monetary policy but fiscal policy as well are
critical for understanding the post—1926 real exchange rate path. Had the
real depreciation of the period 1922—26, so prominent in Chart 2, resulted
simply from nominal exchange rate overshooting in response to monetary
expansion and inflation prior to the Poincaré stabilization (the Dornbusch
(1976) mechanism), one would expect the real exchange rate to recover
following monetary stabilization; instead, the real exchange rate remains at
its new higher level, suggesting that the domestic expenditure effects of
fiscal contraction played a dominant role in its post—1926 path. (The
correlation between the government budget deficit and the real exchange rate
is also evident in Chart 6.) Thus, the real depreciation of the franc, rather
than a clever ploy by French monetary policy makers, should be seen as a
consequence of the fiscal reforms which eliminated the budget deficit.


     The simulation also generates a surge in investment like that observed in
France after stabilization. Investment rises as a result of a jump in Tobin's
q.21 Following its initial rise, q declines continuously toward its steady
state level, and investment falls gradually. The behavior of q is a
consequence of the impact of public debt reduction on interest rates and
arbitrage among financial assets.    The real exchange rate depreciates on
impact, after which it rises slowly; so long as it is rising the domestic
interest rate must fall relative to the yield on foreign assets. Over time, a
fall in the outstanding stock of domestic debt reduces the interest rate
domestic residents require in order to hold that debt, reinforcing this
effect.      Since arbitrage equalizes the rates of return on domestic debt and
equity, the lower interest rate on debt implies capital losses on equity,
causing q to fall over time. For q to fall over time, it must rise on impact,

providing    the initial stimulus to investment. While the contractionary fiscal
initiative results in crowding in of investment as in simple income—
expenditure models, in our framework it results indirectly            from   the
relationship between real interest rates, real exchange rates, and Tobin's q.


     The one aspect of the simulation that does not conform to historical
experience is the simulated decline in the price of nontraded goods relative
to the price of exports. The reason for this result is our assumption that
investment spending falls exclusively on exportables while government spending
is distributed among exportables, importables and nontraded goods.       In the
simulation, as government spending falls and investment rises, expenditure
tends to be switched away from nontraded goods, resulting in a modest decline
in   their     relative price.    It would be straightforward to alter the
specification to better track this aspect of historical experience.


     Finally, note the simulated path of GDP in the final column of Table 4.
The reduction of government spending is contractionary on impact, but output
immediately begins to recover.   In the long run, the larger capital stock
which results from cumulated investment sustains an increased volume of
production.     The fiscal multiplier is positive in the short run, negative in
the long run. Over the span of time of concern to us here, 1926 to 1931, the
reduction in government spending probably remained contractionary, reducing
the rate of growth of the French economy.    This is consistent with the
deceleration in the rate of French economic growth between 1921—1926 and 1927—
1930 (see the first two rows of Table 1). At the same time, the fiscal
contraction switched demand toward domestic sources, namely investment,
reducing the economy's dependence on foreign demand and insulating the economy
from the initial effects of the Great Depression.


V. Further Evidence


     The model of Section IV, while successfully replicating the critical
features of French macroeconomic experience after 1926, incorporates various
restrictive assumptions.      In this section we provide further evidence in
support of the specification.


     Our specification of investment highlights the role of Tobin's q. Chart 8

interwar   years, but suggests that investment depended not on current but on
lagged real share prices.22 This is inconsistent with the early formulations
of the q theory of investment, as proposed by Tobin (1969) and developed by
Abel (1979) and Hayashi (1982), in which investment depends solely on current
q, which incapsulates all relevant information about the current and expected
future profitability of additions to the capital stock. However, a variety of
studies of the postwar period have found, as in Chart 8, that lagged q has
more explanatory Dover than current q, leading Fischer (1983), Kydland •and
Prescott   (1982)   and Ueda and Yoshikawa (1986) to incorporate order and
delivery lags into the q theory of investment and to derive estimating
equations in which current investment depends on lagged q.


     Empirical versions of our investment equation appear in Table 5.        The
results confirm that lagged q dominates current q as a determinant of
investment.23 The role of lagged q in determining investment plays a central
role in our interpretation of French macroeconomic performance on the eve of
the Great Depression. The buoyancy of the French economy in calendar year
1930 is primarily a buoyancy of investment spending, which remains high in
1930 because q was high in 1929.      In other words, the investment boom
continued into 1930 because of lags in the ability of firms to order, receive
delivery and install capital goods and equipment that they would have wished
to obtain in 1929 when stock prices peaked.         The French economy was
exceptionally resistant to the onset of the Depression because demand had been
switched toward this domestic source — investment      —   and away from foreign
sources precisely when foreign markets collapsed.


     How general was this surge in investment spending? Table 6 displays
investment trends in agriculture, three leading manufacturing industries,
construction, transportation, services and commerce. Investment rose in all
sectors but transportation in 1927 and across the board in 1928 and 1929.     In
1930 investment fell significantly only in the textile industry (which
produced luxury goods for export and therefore was overwhelmed by the onset of
Depression abroad), declining marginally in agriculture and commerce as well.
In 1931, in contrast, there was a dramatic fall in investment in every sector
except transportation, where developments reflect the relative stability of
government spending. Thus, the investment surge highlighted in our account of
post—1926 French macroeconomic trends is impossible to explain in terms of

shocks     to particular sectors, and surely     resulted    from   economy—wide
developments such as changes in the stance of fiscal policy.


     In our model, fiscal policy is linked to investment via Tobin's q. Table
7 documents the influence of fiscal policy on q. In the first two equations,
q (and, according to Table 5, investment) responds positively to the budget
surplus.     Evidence of serial correlation led us to add additional regressors
to the equation. Neither the money supply nor its rate of growth (whether
measured in real or nominal terms) significantly influenced real share prices
or reduced the extent of autocorrelation. In contrast, the real exchange rate
was statistically significant, reduced the extent of autocorrelation, and
dominated the fiscal policy measure, as shown in the third line of Table 7.
This is evidence against the fiscal policy—q relationship only if the real
exchange rate is not itself a function of fiscal variables.     Our model
predicts that Tobin's q and the real exchange rate should be jointly
determined by fiscal policy. Table 8 confirms that this was the case
empirically.    According to the coefficient on the budget surplus, fiscal
contraction led to real exchange rate depreciation. We enter as additional
regressors the rate of real money growth and the rate of real money growth
interacted with a dummy variable for the fixed exchange rate period to allow
the real exchange rate to respond to both monetary and fiscal policy. Adding
monetary policy confirms that both monetary and fiscal policies influenced the
path of the real exchange rate, as argued above, but does nothing to undermine
the real exchange rate's dependence on the budget surplus.


     Finally, we attempt to test our explanation for the post—1926 investment
surge against a competing interpretation.     While our explanation for the
investment boom stresses observed reductions in the budget deficit and the
classic crowding—in effects of contractionary fiscal policy, the alternative
emphasizes the impact on confidence of Poincard's reputation for financial
orthodoxy. According to the reputational argument, Poincaré's return to power
removed the spectre of continued financial uncertainty, prospective future
budget deficits, and large—scale capital levies. This interpretation holds
that once confidence was restored, capital flight came to end, reducing the
required rate of return on capital and stimulating investment.         Thus,
confidence (and in particular confidence-induced capital inflows) rather than
the resource flow or classic crowding in effects of contractionary fiscal
policy supposedly explains the investment boom. Since Tobin's q captures

market expectations, the confidence interpretation is not incompatible with
our's; it simply differs in asserting that the rise in stock prices cannot be
explained solely by contemporary observable policy measures.


     Attempts to test the confidence argument fail to turn up evidence in its
support. Capital inflows, under the alternative view, should be comprised of
both a component reflecting observed policy measures and a residual component
reflecting confidence. Since the equation includes both observed policy
measures and actual capital inflows, the confidence argument can be tested by
examining the coefficient on the capital inflows variable.241n the last
regressions in both Tables 7 and 8, the capital inflows proxy uniformly enters
insignificantly. Thus, we find no support for the alternative view.


VI. Conclusion


     In this paper we have assembled evidence which contradicts the standard
view that the undervalued Franc Poincaré, by boosting exports, succeeded
initially in insulating France from the Great Depression. Our own explanation
emphasizes instead the role of investment growth as the proximate source of
France's resistance to the onset of the slump. The traditional interpretation
of this period has also tended to stress monetary factors, attributing
undervaluation of the franc even after 1929 to a sustained period of inflation
terminated by an abrupt monetary stabilization. We consider such a long—
lasting monetary non-neutrality unplausible and focus instead on fiscal
stabilization, which transformed the government budget from large deficit in
the early 1920s to surplus after 1926. Real depreciation, the surge in stock
prices and the attendant crowding in of investment spending are all shown to
be consequences of such a fiscal stabilization. We do not wish to belittle the
role either of monetary factors in the nominal depreciation or of monetary
finance of the budget deficits. But we wish to emphasize that the independent
effects of fiscal policy have not been adequately acknowledged.


    These effects are analyzed here using a model with some relevance to
current policy discussions in countries attempting to curb their government
deficits and reduce their public debts. While we have not estimated the model,
its key assumptions are supported by the data. In particular, the links
between fiscal policy, the real exchange rate and Tobin's q are sufficiently
well established that we see no need to involve the purely psychological
                                                                           — 19 —

effects of Poincaré return to power when attempting to understand the
macroeconomic sequel to that event. What mattered were Poiricaré's policies,
not merely his reputation.

1. Data sources and variable definitions are provided in appendix A. The
    country data and weights used to construct "world GDP" in Table 1 are the
    same as in the effective exchange rate calculations described below.


2. Domestic credit creation was effectively precluded by prohibiting the Bank
    of France from engaging in expansionary open market operations or
    monetizing government budget deficits. See Eichengreen (1986).


3. These conclusions are representative of an extensive          and   growing
    literature.   Surveys of the period, such as Fohien (1966) and Ambrosi et.
    al. (1984), convey the same impression of the exchange   rate's central
    role.    Kindleberger (1973, p.63) argues that what he refers to as the
    "French boom" of the second half of the 1920s — an   upswing which raised
    production to impressive levels compared to previous business cycle peaks
    and did not turn down until the second half of 1931 — was fed by
    undervaluation of the franc.   Even Sargent (1983), not one normally
    inclined toward nominal variables as explanations for real economic
    trends, suggests that France remained prosperous in the wake of the
    Poincaré stabilization partially because of the undervaluation of the
    franc.


4. This is not the first nominal effective rate calculated for the interwar
   years.    Redmond (1980) has constructed a nominal effective exchange rate
    for sterling in the 1930s, while Redmond (1981) presents nominal effective
   rates for several currencies, including the franc, for the period from
   1929. However, his series for the franc is annual rather than quarterly
   and does not cover the portion of the twenties of particular interest
   here. We know of no previous attempt to calculate a real effective
   exchange rate for this period.


5. Detailed descriptions of the data are in appendix A. In
                                                         appendix B we
   present the effective exchange rate series. Note that the nominal
   effective rate continues to vary even after France's return to gold
   because of further exchange—rate changes abroad. While small at first,
                                                                                 — 21 —

    these variations increase in size with sterling's devaluation in 1931 and
    the dollar's devaluation in 1933.


6. Both series are measured on an annual average basis.      An ordinary least
    squares regression corrected for first—order serial correlation yields:


    EXPORTS = —2.17 +   0.74   REER +   0.62 Y*    =0•48      0.83   DV = 1.60
               (3.89) (3.12)            (3.68)     (1.63)


   where EXPORTS is Commerce Special (in millions of tons) from Sauvy (1884),
    p.338, col. 8, REER is the real effective exchange rate (calculated as in
    Chart 1, so that a rise denotes real depreciation), and Y* is the index of
    world industrial production (from London and Cambridge Economic Service,
    1970), shown in Table 1. The data are annual and the estimation period is
    1922—38.   In the regression, all variables are entered in logs, vith t—
    statistics in parentheses.           p   is the first order   autocorrelation
    coefficient.


7. The pattern we describe in the text holds for exports of foodstuffs, raw
    materials and manufactured goods alike, except that raw materials exports
    fall in 1928, foodstuffs in 1929 and manufactures in 1930.        The early
    downturn in exports of materials reflects the worldwide slump in primary
    commodity markets (Levis, 1949), which even an "undervalued franc" was
    apparently unable to overcome.


8. Another channel through which the exchange rate concei'ab1y might have
    influenced demand was import substitution. Even if the volume of exports
    fell after 1928 and the export/GNP ratio fell after 1927 depreciation
    could have stimulated domestic demand had expenditure oi imports been
    switched toward home goods at an even faster rate.      In fact, the trade
    balance deteriorates rather than improving over the period, indicating
    that imports declined less quickly than exports, which casts doubt on the
    import—substitution hypothesis.


9. For example, such nontraded goods as housing, the prices of which moved n
    a very different fashion due to rent control (Hawtrey, 1931), are included
    only in the retail price index. On the construction of these indices, see
    INSEE (1966).
                                                                                   — 22 —

10. The one exception to the general erosion of real wages during the
    inflationary era — the rise in real wages between the first and second
    quarters of 1924 — is itself explicable in terms of wage lag:      the
   exceptional real wage increase of early 1924 took place in a period when
    the authorities succeeded in temporarily stabilizing the franc and
   actually engineering a price decline.


11. On the early 1920s in Europe, North America, Japan and the Antipodes, see
   Eichengreen (1986b). On European experience in the 1930s, see Eichengreen
   and Sachs (1985).


12. We have drawn disaggregated industrial production indices from League of
   Nations (various issues).


13. The importance of this distinction did not escape contemporary French
   economists such as Dessirier (1935),          who   calculated   indices   of
   profitability separately for industries producing traded and nontraded
   goods. In addition, Dessirier distinguished a third sector comprised of
    firms engaged in the provision of public services.


14. It is this focus on wage formation that leads us to emphasize our model's
    resemblance to the Scandinavian Model rather than the Dependent Economy
   Model of Salter (1959) and Swan (1960), which also distinguishes traded
    and nontraded goods.


15. To our knowledge, no previous model incorporates both these features,
    although the framework developed below bears some resemblance to those of
    Dornbusch (1974), Dornbusch (1980, pp.97—115) and Frenkel and Rodriguez
    (1982).      Dornbusch's Dependent Economy Model implicitly the maintains the
    assumption of full employment however, while in Frenkel and Rodriguez
    (1982) output depends only on relative commodity prices.


16. Eq. (6) is a linear approximation around an initial position in which W, e
    and       all equal unity and y is the share of traded goods in consumption.


17. A limitation of this framework is the absence of explicit treatment of the
    monetary sector.       Depreciation of the exchange rate therefore must be
    taken as exogenous.
                                                                                — 23 —

18. The lack of foresight regarding the evolution of the exchange rate,
    inflation and the money supply is justified on the grounds that changes in
    the rate of money growth were related to unanticipated changes in
    governments and Ministers of Finance.   There were 11 cabinets in the
    period 1921—26 (Sauvy, 1984, Vol. I, pp.388—392).


19. In the limiting case of perfect substitutability, db/dz =   . Theanalysis
    which follows is based on the general case of imperfect substitutability.
    In the interest of simplicity, we suppress the Laursen—Metzler effect.
    However, permitting saving to be positively related to X would have no
    effect on our simulation results.


20. Alternative deficit closing rules are discussed in Sachs and Wyplosz
    (1984). Nothing of importance hinges on particular specification adopted
    here since it is assumed that government spending falls on exportables,
    nontradables and imported goods in the same proportions as private
    spending.


21. By specifying investment solely as a function of q and eliminating any
    accelerator mechanism, we reduce the danger that an investment response to
    an autonomous recovery could be misconstrued as a cause of that recovery.


22. Note that the dependence of investment on real equity prices needs not
    suggest that the stock market was a significant source of liquidity for
    firms wishing to fund investment. (In fact, this was generally not the
    case in interwar France.) Rather, it reflects the impact on investment of
    assessments of the current and future profitability of additions to the
    capital stock relative to the cost of those additions, assuming only that
    the expectations of stock market participants are positively correlated if
    not necessarily representative of the expectations of investors as a
   whole.


23. Our preferred specification, eq. 2, provides supporr for a hybrid
    investment equation which combines the q theory with he accelerator.
    Such equations are sometimes justified on the grounds that some firms are
    liquidity constrained and are able to increase inveriment only when
    profits rise as a result of increased output.

24. Alternatively, we included a dummy variable for the years of Poincaré's
   government as another proxy for confidence effects. This variable failed
   to undermine the significance of the fiscal policy measure, was itself
   statistically insignificant, and generally entered with a negative sign.

                                 Data Sources




1) Effective Exchange Rates


     The effective exchange rates ware calculated as weighted averages of the
exchange rates against France's major trading partners. The weights were based
on the aggregate percentage of trade, including exports and Imports but
excluding reiniports (Commerce Special) in the years 1923, 1927, 1932, 1935,
1938 of the major trading partners.' Major partners were defined as countries
accounting for at least 1% of total French trade during the above five years,
with the following exceptions:


               1. Trade with French colonies was excluded (21.98% of total
          trade) because of the dominance of non—price factors and owing to the
          lack of reliable wholesale price indices for the colonies.


               2. Trade with Brazil (1.26 % of total trade) was excluded
           because of lack of a reliable wholesale price index.


               3. Trade with Sweden (0.87 % of total trade) was included
           because of its rapid growth over the period.


Trade weights for the intervening years were interpolated on a moving average
basis.2


2) Exchange Rates


     Where data are from the Statistique Gdndrale de la France (1951),
exchange rate quotations are the average monthly exchange rate in Paris. Where
data are from the League of Nations Statistical Yearbooks,3 the exchange rate
was calculated as follows:


               a) Pre 1931: Exchange rates against the dollar were converted to
           French francs by the dollar/franc rate in Paris.
                                                                                  — 26 —

                b)   1932—Sept. 1936: Exchange rates quoted as a percentage of
            1929 gold parities were converted into current nominal rates,
            multiplying by the 1929 gold parity of foreign currencies.


                c) Post Oct. 1936: Exchange rates, as a percentage of 1929 gold
            parities, were converted by multiplying both the franc and foreign
            currency prices by their 1929 gold parities.


                d) Exceptions: Egypt: exchange rate is quoted in terms of the
            pound sterling (El = .975 units of local currency).


3) Prices


     To calculate the real effective exchange rate, the nominal effective
exchange rate described above was multiplied by the ratio of foreign wholesale
prices to French wholesale prices. Sources of the wholesale price data are
described in (6) below. Foreign prices were weighted by the trade shares
described above.


     Owing to large relative price movements at the time of German monetary
stabilization in 1924 and the dominant influence of political factors in
France—Germany trade, the weight of the German exchange rate was set to zero
for the period 1922—24. We recalculated the weights for the years before 1925
excluding Germany (which accounted for 4.2 percent of total French trade in
1924), and then included Germany in the weights for the period from 1925.


4) World Demand


     Sources and methods of calculation are shown in Table 1. Of the original
set of countries, Australia, Egypt, India and Argentina were omitted for lack
of reliable data and weights were adjusted accordingly.


5) Trade
