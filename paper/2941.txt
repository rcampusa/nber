                 MARKUP BEHAVIOR IN DURABLE MD NONDURABLE
                MANUFACTURING: A PRODUCTION THEORY APPROACH


                                  ABSTRACT




      In this paper I provide a production theory-based framework for

measuring markups of price over marginal coat, and the effecta of cost and

demand characteristics on these markups. Price to marginal coat ratios are

measured for various Canadian manufacturing industries, and the impacts of

capacity utilization, scale economies, changing prices of variable inputs,

import competition, unemployment and other cost and demand determinants are

evaluated using adjusted markup indexes and elasticities of the markup ratios.

The measured price margins are within a reasonable range and tend to be

countercyclical. Moreover, these measures suggest that profitability stemming

from the potential to increase price over marginal cost appears primarily to

arise from cost characteristics determining scale economies.

 I. The Production Framework and Questions to Consider

       In the past few years researchers dealing with macroeconomic,

 international trade and industrial organization issues have begun to refocus

 attention on the importance of market power, and the resulting markups of

 price over marginal cost. Hall [1988a], for example, based on a model with a

macroeconomic perspective, measured markups of price over marginal cost in

U.S. manufacturing using a Solow productivity equation approach. He found

 these markups to be significant and suggested that capacity utilization

fluctuations were closely linked to markup levels; labor hoarding and returns

to scale did not seem to have an impact on these levels. Schembri [1988]

considered the relationship between markup behavior and exchange rate

fluctuations in a Canadian export industry, and found evidence that markups

cushion the impact of exchange rate variations by allowing firms to absorb

short run decreases in prices. Qther researchers such as Rotemberg and

Saloner [1986], Bils [1985,1987] and Domowitz, Hubbard and Petersen [1987,

1988], using more industrial organization based models, have studied the

behavior of the markup over the business cycle. Several of these researchers

have found that markups are countercyclical because in booms marginal cost

increases more rapidly than price with the expansion of production, while the

reverse occurs during downturna.

      Domowitz, Hubbard and Peterson [1988] in particular have focused on

these patterns of markup behavior. They have estimated markup trends by

expanding the Hall [1988a] model to include time varying parameters and

intermediate material inputs, using disaggregated data for various

manufacturing industries. They conclude that with theae adaptations to the
                                      -2-




framework markups appear lower than Hall found, and that when     durable and

nondurable goods are distinguished1 nondurable goods appear to have

procyclical markups. In terms of the correlation between capacity utilization

and the markup, this has a strong enough impact to cause the overall tendency

to be procyclical.
                                                                          the
      Domowitz jj [1987, 1988] pursued this further and considered
                                                           fixed labor (union
impact on markups of import competition, unemployment,

contracts), industry concentration, and noncapital fixed costs (overhead labor

and advertising) and found that these characteristics of the demand and

production structure have important effects on the time trends of markups.

Among others, Shapiro [1988] has noted2 that these results suggest economies
                                                                           tb the
of scale and other cost characteristics might affect markups, contrary

position taken by Hall.

      Although these studies have been very important for focusing attention

 on patterns of markup behavior and their differences across    industries, they

                                                                                of
 have not taken advantage of the theoretical basis for the representation

 technology - and thus markup behavior - -   provided   by duality theory-based

 production models. Such models are based on cost and demand functions facing

 a profit-maximizing firm, where the functions characterize the pattern of

 demand and supply responses of the firm. Since in this framework the cost and

   2Bils [1987] has incorporated returns to stale and suggested the importance
                                                           Other researchers such
   of this characteristic of the production technology.
   as Romer [1986] have also pointed out its importance   in the aggregate.
   Shapiro emphasized this more in the context of the current markup model when
   he outlined the treatment of markup behavior in Appelbauflh [1982] and
                                                                  estimated to

                                      -3-




demand curves can be measured, the dependence of the firms' optimal markup

behavior on these functions and their changes in response to varying economic

conditions can be assessed directly. These models allow explicit

incorporation of many characteristics of the production structure of firms,

like slow adjustment of capital and labor inputs, intermediate input demand

and economies of scale. They also allow varying demand conditions across

industries to be specified, and the impacts of such factors as import

competition and unemployment on demand behavior to be incorporated explicitly.

They therefore permit consideration of moat markup determinants found to be

important by Domowitz .si, and are rich in their potential for

interpretation of markup behavior.

      More specifically, in a model based on a restricted cost function

explicit representation of short and long run marginal and average cost curves

is possible. This is important for imputing the patterns of markups since

direct meaaures of the differences between marginal and average coats and

their differential responses to exogenous changes are difficult if not

impossible to capture in a nonparametric form.3 Price determination may be

incorporated in this type of theoretical structure by including the firm's

output demand function in the optimization model as in Appelbaum [1979, 1982]

and Morrison [1982, 1988d[. In this framework the price-setting behavior of




3See Domowitz, Hubbard and Petersen [1987] for further discussion. If
constant returns exist, these measures will coincide. However, evidence
from a number of researchers, including Morrison [1988d], Romer [1986], Hall
[l988b], Berndt and Khaled [1979] and Shapiro [1988] suggest that this is
not the case and that the assumption of constant unit costa in fact causes
distortions in markup measures. Domowitz et ml also show that even if price
cost margins estimated using average costs are procyclical, measures based
on marginal coats could be countercyclical depending on the relationship
between marginal and average costs during the cycle.
                                      -4-




the firm may be modeled from the first order conditions for profit

maximization. Since both output price (Py) and marginal cost (MC) components

of the markup or price ratio py/MC (PRAT) are therefore independently

represented, the markup may be calculated directly.

      The impact of market fluctuations on the markup measure may also be

determined empirically since this ratio, through its dependence on the cost

and demand functions, is a function of the supply and demand parameters of the

model. By measuring the sensitivity of price and marginal cost to forces

affecting output demand or costs in terms of elasticities, this allows

consideration of the relative importance of the impact of various exogenous

changes that may be thought of as demand or supply "shocks" or cyclical

effects. Second order elasticities which indicate the change in the

elasticity of demand with changes in cyclical demand side variables may also

provide useful information.4

      In subsequent sections the use of a production theory-oriented

structural model of firm behavior for assessment and interpretation of markup

behavior is evaluated theoretically and empirically. The theoretical

structure is based on a generalized Leontief (GL) production technology

approach to specification of restricted cost and expenditure functions. This

framework permits assessment of the effects of fixed factors such as capital

 and labor and nonconstant returns to scale. The empirically implementable

 framework is then applied to measurement of the demand and supply structure

 for a number of manufacturing industries in Canada from 1960 through 1982.




  4This allows testing of a hypothesis mentioned, for example, by Bus [1985],
  that the elasticity of demand is procyclical.
                                        -5-




The resulting estimated indexes of markup levels, capacity utilization and

returna to scale, and elasticities of changes in these indexes in response to

fluctuations in exogenous variables, facilitate the interpretation of markup

behavior in these industries.



II. The Model and its Role in Assessina the Issues

      The theoretical model for this study is a dynamic profit-maximizing

factor demand model with imperfect competition based on a nonconstant

restricted cost function, C. C is assumed to be a function of two variable

input prices, PR' the price of energy (E) and PM' the price of intermediate

materials (M), two quasi-fixed inputs with the degree of fixity endogenous to

the model, capital (K with investment AK) and labor (L with adjustment in

employment AL), output (Y), and the state of technology (t);

C—C(pE,PM,K,L,Y,t,AK,AL). This function is dual to a production function

Y—Y(E,M,K,AK,L,AL,t). The firm is also assumed to face a downward sloping

demand curve for its output, which is represented by the demand function

Y-D(py,pIM,r,EXP,pcpI,UN), where IM is the price of imports (representing the

motivation to consume domestically produced goods), r is the interest rate

(affecting the desirability of durable goods), EXP is expenditure,

(representing the overall consumption level), PcpI is the cost of living

(prices of other products), and UN is the unemployment rate. Thus the

specification includes both prices of alternative goods and shift or "state of

the world" variables such as unemployment. It can also be represented by the

inverse demand function Py =    D(Y,pIM,r,EXP,pCpI,UN).
      In the short run the stocks of capital and labor, as well as technology

and variable input prices are assumed to be given to the firm, although output
                                      -6-




or output price and adjustment of the stocks of capital and labor are

endogenous due to the incorporation of the demand equation and internal

adjustment costs. Adjustment costs are built into the cost function through

incorporation of AK and AL as arguments of the function, and are interpreted

as representing the reduced potential for output production with the existing

variable inputs when changes in these stocks occur.

      This specification accommodates numerous characteristics which have been

postulated to be important in the literature. For example, it allows for

labor fixity, which may arise from labor hoarding, unionization or overhead

labor, and for its adjustment to be endogenous. It also intludea fixity of

capital, which, with labor fixity, determines the amount of available

capacity. The potential for excess capacity due to slow adjuatment of inputa

can therefore be directly analyzed. The importance of both energy and non-

energy intermediate materisla ia also recognized in this apecification.    A

sloped marginal cost function is not ruled out, which may be particularly

important for modeling nonconatant markupa. Also, since these marginal coats

tan directly be measured as the derivative ØG/BY, the difference between

marginal and average coats can explicitly be determined, which is a great

advantage over traditional methods outlined by Domowitz t.gi which

approximate marginal cost by average variable coat. Finally, the

spetification of the demand function explicitly recognizes the importance of

import competition and unemployment on demand for manufactured products.

      Given these functions and relationships, the firm's intertemporal profit

maximization problem is

where      is the depreciation rate for capital, aK is the initial purchase or

asset price of capital, and ZK-AK+5K is gross investment in capital; treatment

of labor is symmetric except that 8L is assumed to be zero.

        Optimization over the variable inputs is reflected in the normalized

restricted variable cost function C;5 by definition this function captures

minimum variable coata conditional on K, AK, L, AL and Y. C is assumed to be

approximated by a nonconstant returns to scale (NCRTS) generalized Leontief

(CL) restricted coat function developed by Morrison [1988b].6




5The process of constructing this dual cost function is outlined in Berndt,
Fuss and Waverman [l980J and Morrison and Berndt [1981].
6The properties of this function are outlined in greater detail in Morrison
[1988b] . Note that specifying nonconatant returns for a function that will
be estimated in the aggregate is ambiguous. In particular, unless there are
proportional movements in relative sectoral growth, the computation of a
level of returns to scale for an entire industry using this function does
not reflect a level of returns for any particular firm. Although constant
returns ia often aaaumed to circumvent this problem (if all firma are
subject to constant returns it may be assumed that a constant returns
function reasonably characterizes the industry), this seems too limiting.
Preliminary empirical investigation of the data, as well as previous studies
such as Berndt and Khaled [1979], suggest that the assumption of nonconatant
returna to scale is important for generating reasonable estimates. Berndt
and Khaled, in fact, find returns to scale for the U.S. similar to those
found in this study for Canada. In addition, studies of markupa such aa
Hall [1988a] imply that returns to scale may be important for correctly
considering the markup. Therefore, the nonconatant returns to scale
function will be utilized even though aggregation difficulties imply that
interpretation of the resulting returns to scale estimates is unclear.

where p and Pj index the prices of variable inpucs E and M, 5m' 5n denoce Y,

      Given this function, optimal short run input demand levels can be

specified as aC/apE=E=vE and aC/apM—M=vM by Hotelling's lemma:

        The next step of the optimization process is to choose the profit

maximizing output conditional on the levels of K, AK, L, and AL. This

requires maximizing D(.)Y-C(.) with respect to Y, similarly to Appelbaum

[l979J. The solution to this problem can be characterized by the standard

equality of marginal revenue (MR) and MC

    p — -Y.8D1/3Y      + OC/BY


        Constructing this expression requires an additional functional form

assumption for the inverse demand equation Dl(Y,PIM,r,EXP,PCPI,UN). This

equation is based on the demand function7


  7see Morrison [1988d] for further discussion.

where h indexes the variables contained in the vector of shift parameters p

except UN which is not normalized in the demand function. This functional

form has the desirable property that it guarantees homogeneity of degree zero

in prices and expenditure, which is required for consistency with a utility

maximization problem; it is structurally similar to the factor demand

equations used as a basis for analysis.

      Solving for Py in terms of Y generates the inverse demand function,

taking the derivative of this with respect to Y yields 8D1/ÔY, and

computation of 8G/ÔY can be accomplished using (2). These expressions can

then be substituted into (4) to generate the optimal output price equation

Note that since 3G/ÔY is a function of all arguments of C, any supply or cost

shock captured by the cost function will have an explicit impact on MC and

therefore on the markup. In addition, since Y(py) is nonlinear in Py all

shift parameters representing demand shocks affect the elasticity of demand

for produced output and therefore the markup.

      The final step in the maximization process involves choosing the paths

of the fixed inputs to optimize the present value of total net receipts. This

requires solving (1) with the optimized values for output price and variable

input quantities substituted and expressing the solution to this problem in

         The system of equations (3), (5), (6), and (8) represents optimal

solution to the overall profit maximizstion problem. Estimation of this

system generates parameter estimates that represent all input and output

decisions of the firm, and therefore also reflects markup behavior, capacity

utilization (CU) and economies of scale or returns to scale (RTS).

      In particular, measuring the markup simply requires computing the price

determination equation (6) and dividing it by the implied expression for

aC/ÔY—MC to obtain PRATpy/MC.8 This measure depends on the inverse demand

elasticity, since p/MC—p/(Y8py/8Y+py)—l/(l+cpy) with profit maximization,

where Cpy represents the inverse demand elasticity with respect to output.

      The size and significance of this elasticity is therefore important for

consideration of markups. The size can easily be determined by computing the

elasticity directly from the inverse demand function as py —   äln D/3ln Y,
and its statistical significance can be tested by constructing a standard

error for the measure.9 Using these values the null hypotheais of no markup

behavior can he tested by determining if the inverse demand elasticity is

zero. In addition, these relationships imply that the atandard demand

elasticity Dln Y/aln Py   typ —   l/Cpy   can be computed as   -PRAT/(l-PRAT).

      The impact on the markup level of technological characteristics and

other exogenous economic factora can be computed in various ways. The implied




 8Note that markups may also be expressed in alternative ways which generally
 contain the same information. For example, common measures of market power
 are Lerner-type indexes which reflect markup behavior as (py-MC)/py or,
 alternatively, (py-MC)/MC. These measures clearly contain the same
 inforaation as PRAT because they can be written as l-(l/PRAT) and PRAT-l,
 respectively.
 9Since thia elasticity represents the demand function, its elasticities with
 respect to arguments of the demand function can in turn be computed to show
 how the function will change with demand shocks. These second-order
 elasticities are analogous to those discussed aa biases in Morrison [l988c]
 and show how the demand elasticity changes as ahifta in the demand function
 occur over the cycle. Although they provide useful information, they will
 not be discussed here due to apace constraints.

markup level if constant returns to scale or instantaneous adjustment existed,

for example, can be inferred simply by multiplying the markup measure by l/RTS

and CU indexes. The effect of exogenous changes, such as input price or

technical change variations (supply shocks) or unemployment or import price

fluctuations (demand shocks) can be measured using elasticities of the markup

measure with respect to these argumenta of the function. I will now outline

these computations in turn.

      First, note that RTS and CU are both reflected in the coat elasticity

with respect to output, ecy.-alnC/BlnY—MCSY/C, where C is total costa,

G+pKK+pLL. In the special case of constant returna to scale and no fixity of

inputs this measure will be equal to one. Otherwise its value will be a

multiplicative combination of indexes representing these two characteristics

of the technology. Specifically, Morrison [1986, 1988a,d,e] has shown that

Ccrccy CU0, where CC? repreaenta the long run coat elasticity with respect

to output10 (the inverse of long run returns to scale), CUc is the coat-aide

CU measure C*/C, and C* is shadow costs, G+kZkxk. Note that when fixity is

not an issue, ao Zk=pk, CCrECYL-'l/RTS only represents returns to scale, and

when constant returns exist so cCy'=l, €CYCUc captures only the fixity of

inputs.

      Using these measures to determine the impact on markups of the

corresponding characteristics of the technology is somewhat more complex to

motivate and interpret. It is useful to envisage the profitability of the

firm from the deviation of Py from average cost (AC)11 as being composed of




 10See Morrison [1988a) for further development of thia meaaure and
 discussion of more complex nonhomotheticity results.
 11This decomposition is developed more completely in terms of the difference
 between revenues (pyY) and total costs (C) in Morrison [1988e]

three parts:    (i) the difference between C*/Y and C/Y-'AC, reflecting

subequilibriun; (ii) the difference between AC and MC, arising from the

existence of scale economies; and (iii) the difference between py and MC due

to market power.12     This is equivalent to the decomposition of the deviation

between revenues (pyY) and costs (C) in Morrison [1988e1 as

Py'1C[Ch3cECy"(Py/MC)JflCyC(l/(l+Epy), or py/MC—pyY/cC. Therefore to obtain

a measure of true profitability without the impacts of subequilibrium and

returns to scale, py/AC, the py/MC measure must be multiplied by c; to

identify the independent contributions of scale economies and fixity this

multiplication can be carried out by only one of the two components of CY'

either CUc or

      This development can be reinterpreted in terms of the cyclical behavior

of the markup. The adjustment for the impact on the markup of CpLl is

equivalent to considering both whether CU fluctuations and RTS deternine

markup behavior, and whether procyclicslity exists.

      More specifically, Hall [l9SSa, 1988b] suggested that excess capacity

utilization and returns to scale (captured in CCY) will counteract

profitability from market power (picked up in         so profits would

approximate zero even with markups; (py/MC)c(l/(l+epy))El. This is

equivalent to carrying out the adjustment suggested above and determining

whether real profitability from market power is attenuated by excess capacity




       distinction can be made more concrete by drawing a diagram of the
firm's output choice and dividing the vertical distance between Py and MC
into the distance between the long and short run MC curves (i), the distance
between the long run MC curve and the long run AC curve (ii), and the
difference between the long run AC curve and the demand curve (iii), where
the last measure is the true measure of "profitability" arising only from
market structure.

or potential economiea of scale. Although such an argument is specified in

terms of levels, it also suggests in terms of trends that if an exogenous

shock causes markups to increase, it should also cause additional excess

capacity or returns to scale. Markups and the (individual or combined)       CU and

eCY measures must in this scenario, therefore, move in opposite directions.

      This can be linked to cyclical behavior by reference to the the test for

cyclical markup behavior in Domowitz ag]; they assess cyclicality by

comparing markups with CU indicators. Their argument for procyclicality rests

primarily on evidence that capacity utilization (perhaps adjusted for

concentration ratios) and markups tend to go in the gj       direction,   except in

durable goods industries     The capacity utilization measures they use for

comparison are standard published measures rather than economic theoretic

measures. Since the Domowitz etal interpretation of the relationship

between py/MC and CUc is the reverse of that for Hall, and both depend on the

relative impacts of capacity utilization and scale economies on the markup,

these issues can be considered in the same framework.

       Elasticities of the markup indexes with respect to exogenous variables

provide additional information about the determinants of markups and their

 trends. The impact of a change in the price of energy, for example, can be

 shown to affect the marginal cost curve and therefore the output level chosen,

 and, finally, PEAT. This mechanism is reflected in the expression for PEAT in

 (6). The dependence of the price ratio elasticity on both price and marginal

 cost can be stated using the definition py/MC—PRAT as:


      dln PEAT     p    3D1 3D3/3p           p   OMC 34/3p

for an elasticity with respect to a demand shock, where O—(Y,p,-y) is the

implicit function for the solved value of Y from (4)).3 This solved value is

necessary to incorporate in this elasticity because the simultaneous

determination of both price and output must be taken into account to allow for

adjustment of output along the supply or demand curve in response to demand or

supply shocks.

      These elasticities provide important information about the

responsiveness of the firm. For example, the hypothesis by some researchers

that costs dominate price fixing behevior14 may be assessed by determining if

elasticities with respect to cost variables are larger than those for demand

variables.

      In addition, these measures provide information about elasticities of

the output demand elssticity cyp with respect to demand shocks. For example,

it can be shown from the relationship PR.AT—l/(l+ey)and the definition

                                                                          —

information if, ss has been asserted by Rotemberg and Ssloner [1986), for

example, the cyclical path of markups is driven by an increased elasticity of

demand when demand is strong, indicating a more competitive structure.

      Perhaps even more importantly, the responsiveness of the cost elasticity

    and its components ccy" and CUc can be computed. These measures provide

information about whether exogenoua ahotka have a direct or inverse impact on

the markup level and       This allows additional interpretation about

cyclical interrelationships among the PRAT, CUc and       measures. For

exsmple, since the impact of demand or supply shocks on PRAT, CUc and CCYL may

be explicitly modeled, the relative impact of energy price changes or

technological developments on these measures and therefore their effect on

profitability, may be considered.



III. Empirical Implications of the Model

      For estimation, data for various durable and nondurable manufacturing

industries in Canada were generously provided by CC. Watkins of Datalfetrics

in Calgary, Alberta. These data were used to estimate factor demand, price

setting and inveatment behavior using equations (3), (5), (6) and (8). The

industries considered are Total Manufacturing (MAN), Food and Beverages (FOO),

Textiles (TEX), Paper and Allied Products (PAP), Chemicals and Chemical

Products (Cl-IN), Iron and Steel (IS), Transportation Equipment (TRQ), and Non

Metal Mineral Products (NMP). FOO, TEX, PAP and CHM were combined using

Divisia index procedures to generate data for aggregate nondurable

manufacturing, and the remaining sectors similarly were combined for durable

manufacturing. The industries were estimated separately so a common

production function was not imposed on the data. The Euler equation itself,

rather than the analytical solution to the condition, was used for estimation,

which was carried out by iterative three stage least squares using lagged

values of the arguments as instruments, as suggested by Pindyck and Rotemberg

[1983]. Tn this sense, therefore, the model allows for rational expectations.

        Although this dsts is more disaggregated thsn that for
                                                                    many studies, the

  individual demand and cost curves for firms within the
                                                             industries, but
  important implications can be obtained from their
                                                        deviation from competitive
  and constant returns to scale values.
                                           Clearly even more information can be
  gsined by applying these methods to more disaggregated data.

       The price ratio (PRAT) estimates
                                           py/MC for each industry, representing
 the markup, are presented in Table 1. Note that the indexes tend to increase

 over time, as has been found by Morrison [1988d] for
                                                           the U.S. and Japan and by
 Schembri [1988] for U.S. exported and Canadian
                                                     domestic goods. In addition to
 the secular trend, cyclical fluctuations exist; from a first glance the

 indexes appear procyclica]., with declines in the post-1973 and 1979-80 periods

 and increases in the l960s. The various
                                            industries, however, have experienced
 somewhat different markup patterns. Although sectoral detailed analysis is

beyond the scope of this paper, it is useful
                                                  briefly to consider the

comparative information generated by these indexes.

      The total manufacturing industry markups are in the 7% to 28% range,

very similar to those found for U.S. manufacturing in Morrison
                                                                    [l988dJ. They
are largest in 1977, although 1973 is also quite
                                                      high. The 23% markups found
in 1973 drop to 18% in 1974, they catch
                                          up again by 1977 and drop in 1979-81.
A partial recovery appears to commence in
                                            1982, although the markup only
reaches its 1969 value. Similar patterns
                                            are found for the textiles industry
(with an 8% to 25% range), and the iron and
                                                 steel industry (11-22%). Although
analogous overall trends also appear in the chemicals

which experienced the smallest markups, implying the least market power.

Markups increased from 2 to 10% by 1965, reached their largest value (19%) in

1970, and then stayed fairly large until 1975 when a decline set in, which

caused a drop to 12% in 1977. Although cycles do exist, there is little

evidence of an increase over time after the late 1960s. The competitiveness

implied by this is reflected in the implied elasticity of demand of up to -50

(2% markup), and approximately -10 (PRAT—l.ll) on average.

      Finally, the mineral products industry had large markups over this time

period but less time trend than most, starting at 19%, reaching 37%, and then

declining to 24% at the end of the sample. Like the food industry, the

markups are fairly constant at first, increasing in 1968-70 to about 23% and

again more dramatically in 1971-73 to their highest levels, with lower levels

from that point except for a temporary "snap-back" in 1978. The typical

markup of about 20-25% implies a demand elasticity of -6 to -5.

      Overall, these measures are lower than those estimated by Hall [l988a},

although this would be expected since they are based on gross output rather

than value added. The values are, however, reasonably consistent with the

U.S. measures found by Domowitz, Hubbard and Peterson [1987, 1988] .    With the

more fully structured model of this paper, however, it is possible to

undertake a more complete assessment of the impacts of different technical and

market characteristics on the markup level and its cyclicality.

      The influence on these markups of fixity of capital and labor inputs and

returns to scale can be ascertained from the adjusted measures presented in

Tables 2 and 3. The adjustments for fixity of factors, reflected in the

capacity utilization messure CUc, is captured in the measures in Table 2.
                                      -20-




These measures are quite similar to the unadjusted markup measures in Table 1,

and, in fact, often are further from one rather than closer. This arises

because the capacity utilization measures tend to exceed rather than fall

short of one. In most industries the only years for which CUc is less than

one are the poor performance years such as post-1973 and 1980-82 and often the

first few years of the sample. This augments the cycles found in the markup

ratios, which already were lower for these years, since the adjustment simply

take the multiplicative form (py/MC)CU. This suggests that if there were

instantaneous instead of slow adjustment, markups would tend to be larger and

have a stronger cyclical component.

      The impact of returns to scale, reflected in the measures in Table 3, is

very different. These measures are consistent with the suggestion in Hall

[l988b} that the profitability implied by markups arises from potential

returns to scale. When the adjustment for scale is made, the adapted markup

measures are much closer to one. If constant returns to scale existed,

therefore, the measured markup would appear much closer to one, and sometimes,

especially in the textile and paper industries, profitability might be so low

as to be negative for some years. Since large markups appeared in the paper

industry initially, this suggests substantial returns to scale in this

industry, which is intuitively reasonably. For the auto industry virtually

all observed profits arise from returns to scale; the adjusted measures

approximate one to two digits.16 For most industries and years the

approximation is correct to one digit.




 16Fuss and Waverman [1986) also found scale economies to be important in the
 U.S. and Japanese automobile industries.
                                      -21-




      If the measure of profitability were to be decomposed, therefore, the

cost components reflected in     would tend to compensate for measured profit

margins. The most important component of the measure causing this result

would, however, be scale economies. Scale economies thus appear to be a good

"explanation" of the existence of profit margins when profits appear close to

normal - - much better than fixity, or, equivalently, capacity utilization.

      These results have important implications for interpreting the work by

Hall and DHP. In particular, Hall's [1988b] hypothesis about scale economies

attenuating profitability is consistent with these results, but his hypothesis

in Hall [1988s] about capacity utilization accomplishing this is not

supported. This conclusion suggests that the DHP conjecture that capacity

utilization and price margins might be positively correlated, so markups are

procyclical, might instead be suggested by the data. However, that turns out

not to be the case. In fact, if procyclicality arises in these industries, it

appears to occur for the durable rather than nondurable industries, reversing

the tendency found by DHP. This can be shown be computing the correlations

between the price ratio and these components of 'a' as presented in Table 4.

      These values highlight the important inverse relationship between ECYL

(representing scale economies) and PRAT suggested by the adjuatments in Table

3. They also show that a similar relationship holds between the overall cost

elasticity, Cy' and PRAT, although it is not as strong. The somewhat

surprising implication from these numbers, however, is the countercyclical

nature of the price margin (as defined by DHP) from the negative correlation

between PRAT and CTJc. The industries for which this does not hold are food,

iron and steel, and transportation equipment, suggesting that it is more

likely for durable than nondurable industries to experience procyclical

markups. Aggregation may mask this tendency, however, as seen by the FlOUR and

OUR columns, where divisia indexes of the individual industries were used for

estimation; less countercyclicality appears in the nondurable manufacturing

industries according to this measure.

      The elasticities of the markup PRAT and cost elasticity components scyL

and CUc provide additional information to facilitate assessment of the

determinants of the markup level and cycles. These elasticities tend to be

quite robust over time in terms of sign and usually size. This is especially

true for total manufacturing, textiles, transportation equipment, iron and

steel and mineral products. PAP, CMI'! and FOO are more variable, as might be

expected by the large levels and trends in the markups and the variations in

results (and sometimes strange results) found for these industries compared to

others by researchers such as Hall and DHP.

      The impacts of fixity of capital and labor individually on the markup

can be expressed in terms of the pRAT,K and 5PRAT,L measures presented in

Table 5. The elasticity of PRAT with respect to K changes is greater than

zero for all industries except CHM. This suggests that for most industries

increasing capital supports larger markups. This is consistent with the

finding in Morrison [1988dJ that the more substantial capital investment in

the Japanese manufacturing sector has allowed higher markups than in the U.S.

Such a result is robust (does not fluctuate in sign or very much in value over

time) for all industries except PAP. This, and the negative values for the

chemical industry, which imply that additional capital is not effective at

generating profits, could possibly be a result of pollution abatement capital

regulations that stimulate capital investment that is not "productive" in the

sense of producing measured output and therefore profit. The elssticities are

not very large, however, ranging between .02 and .13, and there is no clear

durable - nondurable pattern.

      The evidence is similar for labor, where the elasticities are all

positive except for PAP (which is negative for the entire sample). Increasing
                                       -24-




the labor force, possibly from relaxing constrainta on adjustment, therefore

also supports larger markups, except in the paper industry where labor may not

be very important for production. These values also tend to be larger than

those for capital.

      As DHP suggest, therefore, fixity of both capital and labor has an

important impact on the markup through the utilization of the fixed inputs,

and it appears that the potential to invest in either capital or labor

increases the potential markup over marginal costs. It follows that

flexibility of adjustment may augment markups; fixity of K and L constrains

profitability. The markup would tend to be larger with instantaneous

adjustment, but could potentially have greater fluctuations because in

downturns the excess inputs would be costly for the firm, as suggested by the

adjustment by CUc above.

      Other "supply shocks" or shifts in the cost curves that affect the

markup include fluctuations in input prices and technical change. For input

prices, it would seem plausible that     or PM increases would cause costs to

increase and PRAT to decrease. This is confirmed by the estimates; the

elasticities are all negative and large, which would be expected with the

large share of materials in costs, and the PE elasticities are negative except

in the food industry, where they are not robust over time, and iron and steel,

where they are robust but small. In the latter case, for this energy

incensive industry, large cost expansions from energy price increases seems to

stimulate output changes sufficient to move firms to a point of more inelastic

demand. This, plus the reduced elasticity for transportation equipment

compared to the norm, suggests a weaker impact on the price margin for durable
                                      -25-




compared to nondurable goods industries.     The technical change (or time)

impact is positive in all industries except FOO (for which it is not robust)

and PAP, which may suggest increasing competition over time in these

industries.

      Demand "shocks", or changes in the arguments of the demand function,

also have important impacts on the price ratio. For example, the effect of

import competition can be assessed through the PTPIM elasticity. This

elasticity is very robust, and is positive and large for all industries except

NMP, for which it is positive and small, and PAP, which is negative and small.

There is no discernable durable-nondurable pattern. The numbers imply that in

general when import prices increase, Canadian markups increase. One might

think that this impact would be largest for those products which have the most

international markets. This appears a reasonable interpretation of the

results found; the market for paper products is not particularly competitive

internationally, which is also reflected in the large fluctuations in flAT

discussed above. An alternative interpretation of thia is consistent with the

analysis of the export market in Schembri [1988] ,   where that market did not

meet changes in exchange rates with corresponding changes in export prices but

instead absorbed the changes. Since the Canadian paper market serves most

Canadian needs and also exports heavily to the U.S., and import price changes

could refect changes in the U.S. -Canada exchange rate, the small elasticity

might be evidence of such a a stable domestic price. Finally, note that these

elasticities imply that, for example, for total manufacturing in 1978

eyppS.SS26; the elasticity of demand increases substantially (toward zero)

when PIM increases, so demand becomes more inelastic.
                                     -26-




      Another demand variable which is focused on by DHP is unemployment.

Here is appears than unemployment fluctuations have a limited impact on price

margins; the value is negative for most industries, especially the nondurable

industries, but is negligible. Small positive values occur for PAP and two of

the three durable industries, IS and NMP. The interest rate pattern on

markups is similar; no clear pattern emerges and the values are quite small.

      The impact of CPI and EXP on price margins is more similar to that for

the import price. The elasticities with respect to both of these variables

are positive and quite large everywhere (especially for nondurable industries)

except IS for CPI and TEX for EXP, both of which are robust. These measures

imply, as for PIM, that the demand function becomes significantly more

inelastic when these srguments of the demand function increase.

      No clear durable-nondurable pattern appears from these elasticities.

This is somewhat surprising since industries in these categories may have very

different production structures. In the durable industries, (especially IS)

the firm does not really shut down, often different shifts are used, and

production is very capital and energy intensive. One would think this would

elicit a different type of price response to exogenous shocks than for firms

in the more labor intensive food or textiles industries. Instead the impacts

are reasonably consistent across industries; demand variables such as CPI,

EXP, and PIM and one cost determinant, PM' have a large robust effect on the

price margin, and r, UN, and t have a small and indeterminate impact.

      A clearer picture of what stimulates counter- or pro-cyclicality can be

obtained by looking at the PRAT ss compared to the CUc and ECyL elasticities.

For example, with changes in E' PRAT and CUc tend to move in the same
                                     -27-




direction (down with an increase in PE For FOO, CHM and TRQ this works in

the opposite direction but the values are not robust and tend to be small.

The only industry for which robust opposite impacts on PRAT and CU are

observed is the iron and steel industry. This is not the case for yL; these

move in the same direction as for PRAT, except for FOO, which is not robust,

and TRQ. There does not appear to be any strong durable-nondurable trend,

and, in fact, no clear correspondence occurs with correlations between CUc and

PRAT above.

      The tendency for the PRAT and CU elasticities to be the same sign is

quite pervasive. This implies that the overall tendency given an exogenous

shock is procyclical variations in PRAT and CUB. In most industries, however,

this trend is overwhelmed by the few variables which push PRAT and CU in

opposite directions, resulting in observations of an inverse relationship

between these indicators. For example, for total manufacturing, the inverse

responses to changes in the labor force appear to have had a large enough

impact to generate overall countercyclicality. By contrast, in the iron and

steel industry the reversed responses to changes in energy prices and

technical change are not sufficient to counteract the overall procyclical

nature of relationship between PRAT and CU; this may Stem from the large

positive changes in response to fluctuations in PM' capital investment, CPI,

EXP, and PIM.

      In terms of demand as compared to supply (cost) shocks, changes in

arguments of the demand function almost always cause parallel movements in CUc

and PRAT. Except for the impact of unemployment on the food industry, which

is very small, the only exception to this is for the paper industry. In this
                                     -28-




industry virtually all demand shocks have opposite, although small, impacts.

Countercyclicality therefore appears to arise primarily from cost rather than

demand shifts. For example, for total manufacturing, labor force changes

appear to have been the driving force toward countercyclical price margins. A

similar impact exists for the, TRQ and NMP industries. Moreover, capital stock

changes seem to have had an important countercyclical effect on the food,

textiles and mineral products industries, since the impact of capital

increases is to increase PRAT but decrease CUc. The combined capital and

labor effect is sufficient to cause countercyclicality to be observed for the

mineral products industryJ7 In reverse, although for the chemical industry K

and L changes work in the same direction for PRAT and CUc, t and Pg changes

are sufficient to counteract this.

      For returns to scale the reverse is found. In particular, the cyL

response to changes in exogenous variables generally is opposite to the PRAT

changes, causing the strong inverse reaponses discussed in terms of the

correlations above. This association between PRAT and ccyL is quite

pervasive; very few exogenous changes counteract this tendency.



IV. Concluding Comments

      This paper has provided an integrated framework for measuring markup

levels and their deviations in response to demand and cost (supply) changes

facing the firm, and has used it to assess the levels of and impacts on

markups for various Canadian durable and nondurable manufacturing industries.




 17Note that for fixed output and labor stock levels CUc must decline with
 increases in K. However, positive values of ECU K do arise because of the
 short run profit maximizing changes in output imlied in the elasticity.

      A variety of important demand and cost considerations have been

incorporated into this markup model. As suggested by Domowitz, Hubbard and

Peterson [1987, 1988) in the U.S. context, intermediate inputs are

significant, for energy and materials prices have a strong impact on the

markup ratio. In addition, fixity of both capital and labor contribute

important insight for explaining observed cyclical behavior of the markup. On

the demand side, the emphasis by DHP on import competition is supported; this

seems an important determinant of the ability to establish high markups since

when import prices increase markups rise. Unemployment, however, does not

appear to have a large effect on the markup.

      Estimated markups are within a reasonable range, generally between 10%

and 25% but increasing to up to 85% in the paper industry in 1972. These

markups tend to increase over time and appear cyclical; most industries

experienced the greatest markups in 1971-73 end 1977-79, with significant

downturns in 1974-75. The overall cyclical tendency, in terms of correlation

with capacity utilization measures, is that the markup ratio is

countercyclical, especially in the individual nondurable goods industries.

Aggregated data, however, suggests more strong countercyclicsl behavior in

durable good manufacturing. In addition, most exogenous shocks drive the

price margin and capacity utilization in the aame direction, so procyclical

behavior is clearly possible for any of these industries, depending on the

exogenous shock stimulating the cyclical change.

      The results also suggest that perceived profitability from markups

appears to arise primarily from scale economies, in the sense that when the

markup ratio is adjusted by scale economies the ratio closely approximates
                                     -30-




one. This is consistent with lower markup measures found in studies that

assume constant returns to scale. Scale economies, therefore appear to be the

most important cost characteristic to take into account to "explain" markups,

as suggested by Hall [l988b]. In particular, fluctuations in capacity

utilization do not absorb the! profits implied by positive price margins; they

may in fact augment the difference. This is consistent with the potential for

procyclical markups. Appropriate cost conditions therefore are important for

inelastic demand to generate profits; cost characteristics captured in our

measure of scale economies counteract potential profitability. These cost

conditions may also have substantial implications for the impacts of trade

policy such as the recently enacted free trade agreement between the U.S. and

Canada, as Rao [1988] has noted. In addition, cost characteristics appear

more important than demand determinants for generating observed

countercyclical markups. Changes in arguments of the demand function instead

appear to induce procyclicality.
