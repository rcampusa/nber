1. Introduction

        Data from a number of countries indicate that both the level of alcohol related problems and the

level of alcohol advertising are substantial. For example, Lehto (1995) reports that in Europe, six percent

of all mortality among people under 75, and 20 percent of all acute hospital admissions are related to

alcohol use. Data from Advertising Age (1999) show that in 1998 five alcohol companies ranked in the

top 100 advertisers worldwide. Also, Competitive Media Reporting (1999) estimates that in the US,

alcohol advertising exceeded $1.2 billion in 1998, with three brewers ranking among the top 100

advertisers in the US.

         The appropriateness of alcohol advertising has been publicly debated for some time.

The central issue in these discussions is whether advertising affects total alcohol consumption or whether its

effects are limited to brand choice. Although media portrayals of alcohol generally reflect social

conventions about alcohol, some public health advocates claim that these large expenditures may also affect

social conventions and increase alcohol abuse. The alcohol industry claims that alcohol advertising only

affects brand choice. The issue of continuing or eliminating restrictions on alcohol advertising has been

repeatedly scrutinized at the highest levels of government. In the US, the Surgeon General and various

congressional committees have questioned the continued use of broadcast advertising by the beer and wine

industries. However, the introduction of spirits advertising on cable TV, in 1996, was not opposed. In

France, in 1993 stringent new limits on alcohol advertising were enacted. These new limits have been

supported by the Directorate General of the EC as consistent with the single market of the European

Union. Alternatively, in 1992, New Zealand, and in 1995, Finland, Denmark and Canada eliminated bans

on alcohol advertising.




                                                                                                              1
        The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the relationship between alcohol advertising

bans and alcohol consumption. The focus on advertising bans is important because bans are a likely choice

of public policy for the control of alcohol advertising. The data set used in this study is a pooled time series

of data from 20 countries over 26 years. Farley and Lehmann (1994) find that cross-national differences in

the response to advertising are relatively small. The use of international data is an effective method for

measuring the effect of a ban on alcohol advertising. Data from one country are not as useful since

changes in alcohol advertising bans within countries are rare and the imposition of a ban may require an

extended period for consumption to adjust. There is, however, considerable variation in the use of

advertising bans across countries.




2. Prior Studies

        Over the past 25 years, there have been a number of econometric studies which have examined the

effects of alcohol advertising on total alcohol consumption. These studies have measured the effect of

advertising expenditures and advertising bans. Most of these studies used aggregated national expenditures

as the advertising variable and have provided little evidence that alcohol advertising increases alcohol

consumption. However, studies that have used cross sectional advertising data and studies of alcohol

advertising bans have found effects on alcohol consumption.

        These seemingly contradictory results can be explained by a simple economic model of advertising.

This model is based on the assumption that the industry level advertising response function is subject to

diminishing marginal product. An advertising response function relates consumption or sales revenue to

advertising messages or expenditures. Advertising response functions are generally studied at the firm level

since almost all advertising is done at the firm level (i.e. Rao and Miller 1975, Stewart 1989, Lodish et al.


                                                                                                                2
1995). The consensus of firm level research is that advertising increases sales and that these increases are

subject to diminishing marginal product. Firm level advertising response functions hold constant all other

determinants of firm level sales including advertising by rivals and product price. For the firm, new sales

induced by advertising come from two sources. First, new sales come from consumers who would have

purchased from rival firms, i.e. increasing market share. Second, new sales come from consumers who

would not have purchased the product at all or who purchased less of the product, i.e. increasing the

market size. An industry level response function is derived by aggregating the firm level response functions.

At the industry level, advertising can increase sales only by increasing market size.

        The industry advertising response function is illustrated in Figure 1 and assumes that the advertising

of all the firms in the industry increases industry level sales and that the increases are subject to diminishing

marginal product. The industry advertising response function holds constant all other determinants of

industry level sales including advertising by other industries and industry price. The results from prior

econometric studies of alcohol advertising are consistent with the industry level advertising response

function. These studies can be classified by the definition of the advertising variable into three categories.

        The first category includes studies which measure advertising with annual national data. Highly

aggregated measures such as annual national data have two problems. First, since alcohol is among the

most heavily advertised consumer goods, it is likely that highly aggregated advertising data are in the range

of zero marginal product. The range of zero marginal product corresponds to a range around A1 in figure

1. Second, this level of aggregation eliminates the variance in advertising needed to find any correlation

with consumption. Empirical studies which use annual national alcohol advertising as an independent

variable are thus not likely to find that advertising has any relationship to consumption. The studies of this

type reported in table 1 generally find no effect of alcohol advertising.


                                                                                                                    3
         The second category includes studies which use cross sectional data as the measure of alcohol

advertising. This type of data would typically be local level, such as a Metropolitan Statistical Area, for

periods of less than a year. Local level data can have greater variation than national level data for several

reasons. One reason for the variation in this type of data is pulsing.1 The pattern of these pulses varies

over local areas. Another reason for variation in advertising levels is that the cost of advertising varies

across local areas. This is illustrated in Figure la by the three data points Am1, Am2 and Am3. An

econometric study which uses monthly or quarterly local level data would have potentially larger variation in

advertising levels and in consumption. When the data are measured over a relatively larger range, there is a

greater probability of being in an upward sloping portion of the response function. Local level advertising

data are thus more likely to find a positive relationship between advertising and consumption. The two

studies of this type listed in Table 1 find evidence that alcohol advertising has a positive and significant

effect on consumption.

         The third category includes studies of advertising bans on consumption. The potential effect of a

ban on certain media is shown as a downward shift of the response function in Figure 1. An advertising

ban may not reduce the total level of advertising but will reduce the effectiveness of the remaining

non-banned media. The reason for this is that a ban on the use of a specific media will result in substitution

to the remaining non-banned media. However, each media is subject to diminishing marginal product. The

increased use of the non-banned media will result in a lower average product for these media. This shifts

the response function downward. Firms may or may not respond to this decrease in effectiveness of their

advertising expenditures. Firms may try to compensate with more advertising which would be illustrated by

value of the lingering effects of advertising.



                                                                                                                         4
moving to a higher level of advertising on a lower advertising response function.2 Firms might also increase

the use of other marketing techniques such as promotional allowances to retailers. The effects of

advertising bans have been studied with interrupted time series techniques and in regression models.

        Studies of alcohol advertising bans using interrupted time series techniques listed in Table 1 found

that advertising bans had no effect on alcohol consumption. However, interrupted time series cannot

account for other factors such as cross-border alcohol advertising coming from the US. These results may

also indicate that in a single province or country study, a long time period is necessary before there is any

observable change in alcohol consumption. These provincial bans may not have resulted in much of a

reduction in total advertising exposure since these provinces receive a considerable amount of television

programming from the US.

        The two prior ban studies listed in Table 1 which are most relevant for this paper are Saffer (1991)

and Young (1993). Saffer (1991) examines the effect of banning broadcast advertising of alcoholic

beverages on alcohol abuse. The data used in this study are a pooled time series from 17 countries for the

period 1970 to 1990. The empirical results show that alcohol advertising bans have a significant effect in

reducing alcohol consumption. Young (1993), in an alcohol industry supported study, comments on Saffer

(1991). Young undertakes the re-analysis of the data used in Saffer (1991) and is successful in recreating

the results found in Saffer (1991). Two points raised by Young (1993) are the potential for serial

correlation and the problem of endogeneity of advertising bans. As described in Saffer (1993), Young fails

to correctly apply the serial correction procedure. Young also fails to provide any correction for

endogeneity bias. The analysis presented below seeks to address these problems.

 In a simple model, the decrease in marginal product would reduce the use of the input. However in an oligopoly model,
with response to rivals, one reaction to reduced sales is to increase advertising.



                                                                                                                     5
3. Empirical Framework

        Endogeneity between advertising bans and consumption is possible since the level of consumption

and associated social ills may be factors in precipitating new bans. Falling alcohol consumption might also

undermine the continuance of existing bans. This problem is addressed with a two equation structural

model estimated with TSLS. Also, due to the time series nature of the data set serial correlation might be

present. Serial correlation can be addressed with Huber standard errors.

        The first structural equation is an alcohol demand function which relates price, income and other

variables to alcohol consumption. The demand function for alcohol can be represented as:

A = A(PA, Z, B)                             (1)

Demand theory predicts that the price of alcohol (PA ) will have a negative effect on alcohol consumption.

Other factors (Z) such as income and culture will also affect alcohol consumption. Alcohol advertising bans

(B) enter the demand curve as a measure of alcohol advertising. If advertising increases consumption, and

if a set of bans on certain media reduces total advertising, then advertising bans will have a negative effect

on alcohol consumption.

        The second structural equation assumes that the legislation of alcohol advertising bans is a function

of public attitudes about alcohol. This equation is based on the theory of public choice as defined by

Deacon and Shapiro (1975) and Saffer and Grossman (1987). The theory suggests that the legislation of

alcohol advertising bans reflects public attitudes towards alcohol related problems:

B = B(A, X, E )                          (2)

Public attitudes can be affected by the level of excessive alcohol consumption, highway fatality rates, liver

cirrhosis mortality and other social dysfunctions resulting from alcohol abuse. These problems have been

found to correlate with alcohol consumption (A). Exogenous attitudes (X), including attitudes towards


                                                                                                                 6
government in the economy, attitudes towards government in the health sector, attitudes towards alcohol in

social custom, and attitudes towards restricting advertising, can also affect the passage of alcohol

advertising bans. The economic importance of alcohol (E), resulting from alcohol production related

employment and income, can also affect attitudes toward the passage of alcohol advertising bans.

         The data set used in this study is a time series of cross sections consisting of 20 countries for the

years 1970 through 1995. An international data set provides more changes in ban status than a single

country data set. An international data set also provides time variation which is not available in an

individual level cross sectional data set. The 20 countries included in the data set are all members of the

OECD. The OECD countries were chosen because they have attempted to maintain a data base of

comparable economic and social data since 1960. The data set was limited to 20 countries since four

OECD countries do not report the necessary data. Table 2 contains summary definitions and mean values

for all the variables.

         The dependent variable used in the alcohol regressions is the natural logarithm of per capita annual

consumption of pure alcohol in liters. The variable is computed by adding together the per capita

consumption of pure alcohol in beer, wine and spirits and then taking the natural logarithm of the sum.

These data come from the Brewers Association of Canada (BAC, various years).

         The second dependent variable measures the number of alcohol advertising bans enacted in each

country. All advertising ban legislation group beer and wine into one category with spirits treated as a

separate category. This generality applies to all countries included in this study.3 Some countries have

restrictions on the times that alcohol advertising can be broadcast or on the content of the advertisements.


3
 The beer and wine category includes all alcoholic beverages with 23 percent or less alcohol (with the exception of light
beer in Scandinavia which is exempt from advertising bans). Spirits is everything above 23 percent. Advertising bans
include both voluntary and mandatory prohibition of all advertisements by alcohol beverage category.


                                                                                                                        7
In defining the ban variables, these limited restrictions have been coded as zero. The reason for this is that

the advertising industry has demonstrated skill in circumventing limited restrictions. There is no evidence

that limited restrictions have any impact on the level of advertising. In defining the advertising bans, if only

spirits are banned in a media, then the ban is defined as partial, and if all alcohol advertising is banned in a

media, then the ban is considered total. The first alcohol advertising ban is defined as the number of partial

alcohol advertising bans. This ban variable counts the number of advertising bans on beer and wine or on

spirits, by media. Since there are three media included, and two beverage groups, this variable can take on

values from zero to six. In defining this variable, if a country bans both spirits advertising and beer and

wine advertising, in a media, then this would be counted as two bans. The second alcohol advertising ban

is defined as a total ban since it measures the number of media that ban spirits and ban beer and wine

advertising. The ban data come primarily from the BAC (various years).

         The alcohol price variable was computed by dividing private final alcohol expenditures by pure

alcohol consumption in liters.4 The data were divided by the gross domestic product deflator using 1985 as

the base year. The data were converted to United States dollars by dividing by the purchasing power

parity.5 Alcohol expenditures, the deflator and purchasing power parities were taken from the




4
  The price of alcohol is assumed to be exogenous. This assumption is based on the competitive international market in
alcoholic beverages which creates a very elastic supply function. This leaves the variation in price across countries
largely the result of variation in taxes. Taxes could be endogenous, but are a relatively limited percent of the price. This
price variable has two problems. First, the price variable may be correlated with the equation error term if alcohol
consumption is measured with error. Second, changes in the percentages of alcohol consumed in the form of beer, wine
and spirits will result in changes in the price variable even when the underlying beverage prices are constant.

5
 Price and income are reported in units of national currency and must be standardized using purchasing power parities.
The OECD reports purchasing power parities for the member countries based on 1980 survey data. Although reliability
diminishes with distance from the sample year, purchasing power parities can be estimated for earlier years using
inflation rates. The first year of the data set used in this study is 1970 since 1970 is as far back as the OECD estimates
purchasing power parities.



                                                                                                                             8
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) National Accounts (various years).

Alcohol consumption data come from the BAC (various years).

           Real income was computed by first dividing gross domestic product by population. This was then

divided by the gross domestic product deflator and the purchasing power parity. The data are in thousands

of US dollars and come from the OECD National Accounts (various years).

           The economic value of alcohol production can affect the passage of legislation which might reduce

alcohol consumption. A reduction in alcohol consumption would cause economic harm to those who

derive their incomes from alcohol production. To account for this, the annual production of beer and the

annual production of wine is included in the data set. Both variables are measured in hectoliters and are

divided by population. The beer production data come mostly from the UN Industrial Commodity

Statistics Yearbooks (various years) and the wine production data come mostly from FAO Production

Yearbooks (various years).6

           Several measures of public attitudes towards intervention to promote public health are included in

the ban demand equation. The number of media from which cigarette advertising is banned is included in

the data set. Cigarette advertising bans are included since the public attitudes which are causal in the

legislation of cigarette advertising bans may also influence the legislation of alcohol advertising bans.7 The

cigarette advertising ban data come from Health New Zealand (1995) and World Health Organization

(1997). Another measure of public attitudes is the percentage of total health spending that is paid for by

government. These data come from the OECD Health Data, 1998. Finally, the percentage of GDP which




6
    Spirits production was not included because there were too many missing values.

7
 Since the legislation of cigarette advertising bans could also be a function of alcohol advertising bans, the cigarette ban
variable could be correlated with the error term in the alcohol advertising ban equation.


                                                                                                                          9
is spent by the government is included as a measure of attitudes towards government intervention. These

data also come from OECD Health Data, 1998.

        The data set includes a complete set of country and time dummy variables. The country dummy

variables are included as a control for all unobserved time invariant country specific factors which affect

alcohol consumption and the legislation of alcohol advertising bans. Similarly, the time dummy variables

are included as a control for country invariant time specific changes in alcohol consumption and alcohol

advertising bans.

        The country dummy variables are important in an international data set due to the limited availability

of country specific control variables. However, since the advertising ban variables have limited time

variation, the inclusion of country dummy variables in the alcohol consumption structural model creates

colinearity with these ban variables. One solution to this problem is the use of an alcohol culture variable in

place of the country dummy variables in the alcohol consumption equation. The country dummy variables

can still be retained in the advertising ban equation and therefore also retained in both reduced form

equations.

        According to a review of several studies by the BAC (1997), the alcohol culture of a country can

be defined by the intended outcome of consumption. Alcohol consumed with meals, or during traditional

events, family and community gatherings and other social gatherings is generally not intended to result in

intoxication but rather to enhance the social aspect of these situations. Beer and wine tend to be the

alcoholic beverage choice for these situations. Alcohol is also consumed in circumstances, social or

otherwise, where the intention is intoxication. Spirits tend to be the beverage choice when intoxication is

primarily the intended outcome. Countries vary with respect to the intention of alcohol use. The alcohol

culture variable is defined as the percent of total alcohol which is consumed in the form of beer and wine.


                                                                                                              10
Countries with larger values for this variable consume a greater percent of alcohol in the form of beer and

wine and, given the above assumptions, are more likely to consume alcohol as an enhancement to

traditional life rather than for intoxication. This variable also has time variation, since over time spirits have

lost market share to beer and wine.




4. The Regression Results

         Before proceeding to the estimation it is important to examine the data for serial correlation. A

Durbin Watson test for each country time series resulted in an average value of .71 which indicates possible

serial correlation. Huber standard errors, using country as the cluster variable, were estimated for all

coefficients to correct for serial correlation.

         Another important econometric issue is to test the assumption of endogeneity between alcohol

advertising bans and alcohol consumption. Wu-Hausman endogeneity tests were performed for both the

partial and total ban variables and for models which both include and exclude the country dummy variables

from the structural alcohol consumption equation.8 The Wu-Hausman tests indicate that bans are

endogenous in the alcohol consumption structural equations with country dummies excluded. These tests

do not indicate endogeneity of alcohol consumption in the ban equations. However, when the advertising

ban equations are estimated as OLS equations, alcohol consumption has a significant positive effect. These

results, taken together, provide enough evidence to conclude that the two variables are endogenous.




8
 These tests were performed by predicting the potentially endogenous variable with the reduced form equation and then
including the predicted value along with the actual value in the structural equation. A statistically significant coefficient,
at the 10 percent level, for the predicted endogenous variable is considered evidence of endogeneity.



                                                                                                                          11
           Another econometric concern is the normality of the ban variables. Inspection of the ban data

reveals both ban variables are equal to zero for over 40 percent of the sample. That is, for a number of

countries, or time periods within countries, there were no alcohol advertising bans at all. The large number

of zeros makes the ban variable non-normal which can affect the standard errors in the equations which use

the ban as the dependent variable. The negative binomial procedure can be used for estimation when the

dependent variable has a large number of zeros. To judge the severity of this problem, negative binomial

estimates and OLS estimates of the ban equations, assuming exogeneity of alcohol consumption were

compared. Negative binomial estimates were substantially the same as the OLS estimates. Therefore, the

non-normality of the ban variable does not appear to be an important problem.

           Table 3 presents results for TSLS estimates of the structural model. The first three regressions

employ the partial advertising ban variable. Equation 1 shows that, at the 10 percent level, partial alcohol

advertising bans reduce alcohol consumption. This equation excludes country dummy variables but

includes the alcohol culture variable, which is significant.9 Alcohol price is negative and significant. The

price elasticity is estimated at .19, which is somewhat lower than other studies. Income has a positive

effect on alcohol consumption, which has also been found in other studies. In equation 2, the country

dummy variables are included. The alcohol culture variable becomes insignificant as does the partial

advertising ban variable, since these variables are collinear with the country dummy variables. Alcohol

price and income remain significant. Equation 3 is the partial advertising ban equation. The only significant

variable is government spending as a share of GDP. The implication from equation 3 is that alcohol

consumption does not affect the number of partial bans.



9
    The country dummy variables are included in both reduced form equations and in the advertising ban equations.



                                                                                                                    12
         Table 3 also presents results for TSLS estimates of the structural model with the total advertising

ban variable. Equation 4 is similar to equation 1. Again, at the 10 percent level, total bans reduce alcohol

consumption. Alcohol price is again negative and significant while income is again positive and significant as

is alcohol culture. Equation 5 is also similar to equation 2. The alcohol culture variable becomes

insignificant as does the advertising ban variable due to colinearity with the country dummy variables.

Equation 6, however, is different from equation 3. Alcohol consumption is found to have a significant

positive effect on total advertising bans.10 This suggests that higher alcohol consumption will result in more

total advertising bans. In equation 6, the alcohol culture variable, cigarette advertising bans and

government spending are also positive and significant. These results suggest that more total bans will be

enacted in countries were the alcohol culture is more social, where there are more cigarette advertising

bans and where government is more involved in the economy.




6. Conclusions

         The primary conclusion of this study is that alcohol advertising bans decrease alcohol consumption.

         The effect of bans may increase as the number of bans increases due to non-linearities in the

relationship between bans and consumption. Although there have been many econometric studies of

alcohol advertising policy, there are few prior studies of the effect of advertising bans on alcohol

consumption. Advertising bans are, however, a likely choice of public policy for the control of alcohol

advertising. One prior study of advertising bans is Saffer (1991). The present study updates Saffer (1991)

by adding additional years and countries and by correcting for serial correlation and endogeneity of


10
  An alternative set of regressions which excluded the beer and wine production variables was also estimated since
these variables have missing data for over 60 observations. The results were substantially the same as those reported in




                                                                                                                     13
advertising bans. The results from Saffer (1991) suggested that an added advertising ban could reduce

alcohol consumption by about five to eight percent. The results in this study are very similar to Saffer

(1991). These results indicate that one more ban on beer and wine or on spirits would reduce

consumption by about five percent and one more ban on all alcohol advertising in a media would reduce

consumption by about eight percent.

         There is also evidence that alcohol consumption has a positive effect on total advertising bans.

That is, an increase in alcohol consumption can increase the probability of legislation of an advertising ban

on all forms of alcohol in a particular media. However, alcohol consumption has been trending downward

in a number of countries since around 1988. These decreases may reflect changes in exogenous factors

such as increases in the demand for health. This downward trend in alcohol consumption could result in a

decrease in the number of advertising bans. Canada, Denmark, New Zealand and Finland recently

decreased the number of total advertising bans in effect. These decreases maybe examples of the difficulty

in maintaining alcohol advertising restrictions when alcohol consumption is on a downward trend. Alcohol

consumption in these countries may increase or decrease at a slower rate than would have occurred had

the advertising bans remained in place.

the 11.5 percent level for a two-tailed test.
