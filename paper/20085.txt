                                             ABSTRACT

21 states and the District of Columbia currently have laws that permit marijuana use for medical purposes,
often termed medical marijuana laws (MMLs). We tested the effects of MMLs adopted in seven states
between 2004 and 2011 on adolescent and adult marijuana, alcohol, and hard drug use. We employed
a restricted-access version of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) micro-level
data with geographic identifiers. For those 21 and older, we found that MMLs led to a relative increase
in the probability of marijuana use of 16 percent, an increase in marijuana use frequency of 12-17
percent, and an increase in the probability of marijuana abuse/dependence of 15-27 percent. For those
12-20 years old, we found a relative increase in marijuana use initiation of 5-6 percent. Among those
aged 21 or above, MMLs increased the frequency of binge drinking by 6-9 percent, but MMLs did
not affect drinking behavior among those 12-20 years old. MMLs had no discernible impact on hard
drug use in either age group. Taken together, MML implementation increases marijuana use mainly
among those over 21, where there is also a spillover effect of increased binge drinking, but there is
no evidence of spillovers to other substance use.

1. INTRODUCTION

       As of April, 2014, 21 states and the District of Columbia have implemented medical

marijuana laws (MMLs) which permit marijuana use for medical purposes. An additional twelve

states1 are considering similar legislation. Medical marijuana bills are also likely to land on the

legislative agenda in many of the remaining states. Understanding the behavioral and public

health implications of this evolving regulatory environment is critical for the ongoing

implementation of the MMLs and future iterations of marijuana policy reform. Despite the

growing consensus about the relief medical marijuana can bring for a range of serious illnesses,

concerns have been voiced that MMLs may give rise to increased marijuana use in the general

population and increased use of other substances. Legislative and public attention have focused

on these issues, but the empirical evidence is limited.

       We contribute to the literature on the effects of marijuana liberalization policies by

examining effect of the implementation of MMLs in seven states between 2004 and 2011 on

marijuana, excessive alcohol use, and hard drug use. To examine the effects of MML

implementation, we exploited the geographic identifiers in a restricted-access version of the

National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) micro-level data and estimated two-way

fixed effects models with state-specific linear time trends.

       With respect to marijuana use itself, we found that MML implementation led to a 1.4

percentage point or a 16 percent relative increase in the probability of past-month marijuana use

for adults aged 21 or above, and a 12-17 percent increase in the frequency of past-month

marijuana use for this age group. In this age group, MML implementation also resulted in a 15-

27 percent increase in the probability of marijuana abuse/dependence. Among adolescents and

young adults aged 12-20, we found a 0.3-0.5 percentage point or a 5-6 percent relative increase

in the probability of marijuana use initiation attributable to MML implementation.

 12 states with pending medical marijuana bills include Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri,
New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

                                                   1
       In addition to the increases in marijuana use, MML implementation also increased the

frequency of binge drinking among those aged 21 or above, partially through the increase in

simultaneous use of the two substances. In contrast, MML implementation did not affect

underage drinking among those aged 12-20. Hard drug use among both age groups was

unaffected.

       Overall, our findings indicate that MML implementation increased marijuana use, but

had limited impacts on other types of substance use (i.e., underage drinking, cocaine use, and

heroin use), except for binge drinking among adults of legal drinking age.

       The article proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background information on medical

marijuana and state MMLs, and outlines the theoretical framework. Section 3 summarizes the

existing literature. Section 4 describes the data sources, variable measurement, and identification

strategy. Section 5 presents the estimated policy effects, and the robustness checks. Concluding

remarks are given in the last section of the article.


2. BACKGROUND

2.1. Prevalence & Risks of Marijuana Use, & Federal Prohibition

       Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug in the United States. In 2011, 18 million

Americans were current (i.e., past-month) marijuana users. The prevalence of current marijuana

use has increased over time from 5.8% in 2004 to 7.0% in 2011 (SAMHSA 2012). Marijuana use

has been associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment, respiratory and

cardiovascular problems, immune deficiency, psychotic symptoms, and the development of

marijuana abuse/dependence (See Hall and Degenhardt (2009) for a comprehensive review).

Marijuana use is also shown to have temporary negative effects on driving ability (Asbridge,

Hayden, and Cartwright, 2012), memory and learning (Riedel and Davies, 2005), as well as

school and work performance (Lynskey and Hall, 2000; Wadsworth, et al., 2006). Furthermore,

studies also suggest a positive correlation between marijuana use and other substance use such as

                                                   2
binge drinking and cocaine use (Wagner and Anthony, 2002a). Considering the high prevalence

and potential risks of marijuana use, the federal government continues to classify marijuana as a

schedule I controlled substance and prohibits marijuana use for any purpose.

2.2. Medical Value of Marijuana, & State MMLs

       By classifying marijuana as a schedule I controlled substance, the federal government has

concluded that marijuana has “no currently accepted medical value”. However, a growing body

of evidence supports to the efficacy and safety of marijuana as medical therapy to alleviate

symptoms and treat diseases. Marijuana can effectively and safely serve as an antiemetic and

appetite stimulant to relieve nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy and anorexia

associated with HIV/AIDS, as an analgesic to ease chronic pain caused by neuropathy and

fibromyalgia, and as an antispasmodic to help combat multiple sclerosis (See Ben Amar (2006)

for a comprehensive review). Other medical applications of marijuana such as treating epilepsy

(Pertwee, 2012), dementia (Campbell and Gowran, 2007), and Tourette’s (Singer, 2005) have

also been studied and shown promise (See, for instance, Krishnan, Cairns, and Howard, 2009;

Gloss and Vickrey, 2012).

       In the last two decades, this growing scientific evidence on marijuana’s medicinal value

propelled many states toward a more tolerant legal approach to medical marijuana. Since 1996,

when California signed the Compassionate Use Act into law (Proposition 215) and became the

first state in the U.S. to permit the medical use of marijuana, a total of 21 states and the District

of Columbia passed MMLs (Table 1). These laws protect patients from state prosecution for their

use of marijuana in treatment recommended by a qualified doctor for an eligible condition

(Hoffmann and Weber, 2010).

       In contrast to the state MMLs, federal law prohibits marijuana use for any purpose under

the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970. A 2005 Supreme Court decision (Gonzales v.

Raich) reaffirmed that federal law enforcement has the authority to prosecute patients for

                                                   3
medical marijuana use in accordance with state laws (Gostin, 2005). It is only recently that the

Obama administration and the Department of Justice clarified the position that federal law

enforcement resources should not be dedicated to prosecuting persons whose actions comply

with their states’ permission of medical marijuana (Hoffmann and Weber, 2010). This change in

the prosecutorial stance strengthened the legitimacy of existing MMLs and paved the way for the

passage of new MMLs.

2.3. Potential Spillover Effect of MML

        In principle, an MML should only provide protection for medical marijuana patients. In

practice however, the legal protection intended for the patients may have a spillover effect on

marijuana use in the non-patient population. The spillover effect may arise from three key

dimensions of the existing MMLs that create a de facto legalized environment for marijuana use

in the general population. First, although the MMLs typically specify a list of conditions that are

eligible for medical marijuana2, most MMLs include in their list a generic term “chronic pain”,

rather than specific diseases causing the pain (e.g., neuropathy, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid

arthritis, etc.) (Pacula, et al., 2013). The interpretation of “chronic pain” can extend the medical

marijuana patients beyond the original legislative intent to those to whom research evidence has

demonstrated a therapeutic benefit, analogous to the practice of off-label prescribing of other

medications. The concern with this spillover effect is similar to that of prescription opioid

medications. Namely pain can often be non-descript and difficult to verify medically, and lack of

vigilance on the part of prescribers can effectively lead to recreational use of drugs intended to

be used as medicine.




2
 California is the only exception that allows medical marijuana for any condition “for which marijuana
provides relief” and leaves the interpretation almost entirely to the discretion of doctors.

                                                   4
        Second, some MMLs do not mandate a patient registry and renewal system. This,

coupled with the loosely-defined eligibility criteria, further blurs the boundary between the

targeted patients and the non-patient population (Cohen, 2010).

        Third, MMLs provide medical marijuana patients with access to the drug by allowing

regulated dispensaries and/or home cultivation. These supply channels exist in a legal grey area

and may proliferate as a result of the reduced threat of prosecution under the protection of the

MMLs (Pacula, et al., 2014).3 In particular, Andersen, Hansen, and Rees (2013) provided

empirical evidence that MMLs have led to a substantial increase in the supply of high-grade

marijuana. As the medical marijuana supply rises, the non-patient population may also gain

access to the drug, akin to how prescription opioids eventually find their way into the street drug

market. This is most likely to occur in places where marijuana possession is decriminalized,

prosecution of a marijuana offense is local law enforcement’s “lowest priority”, and federal

interference in marijuana regulation is limited (Sekhon, 2009). In addition to those specific

provisions of the laws, MMLs symbolize liberalization of marijuana policy, which in turn, may

give rise to normalization of marijuana use behavior in society (Hathaway, Comeau, and

Erickson, 2011).

        On top of the spillover of marijuana use from medical marijuana patients to the non-

patient population, the potential interdependence of substance use may lead to a further spillover

from marijuana use to the use of other psychoactive substances.4 A “joint intoxication model”

derived from Marshallian demand functions assumes that an individual with the goal of

intoxication chooses from a range of intoxicants (i.e., both licit and illicit substances including

3
 Anderson and Rees (2014), however, found discrepancies between the time when states passed their
MMLs and the time when states explicitly allowed dispensaries, which Pacula and colleagues (2014) did
not make a clear distinction. They also found potential measurement errors in counting the number of the
dispensaries that actually operated. Data on the medical marijuana retail sales and marijuana-related
emergency department (ED) visits in the Denver area did not provide evidence that dispensaries were an
important contributor to the increase in marijuana use among Coloradans (Anderson and Rees, 2014).
4
 However, if the increased marijuana use arising from an MML is not for recreational purpose (i.e.,
“intoxication”) but for medical purpose only, the use of other substance is unlikely to be affected.

                                                    5
alcohol, “soft drugs” like marijuana, and “hard drugs” such as cocaine and heroin), each

differing in their anticipated effects on the individual’s intoxication experience and in their

expected costs comprised of both market prices and non-market consequences (e.g., health risks,

legal penalties, social sanctions, etc.). An exogenous shock to the cost of one intoxicant,

therefore, may shift the individual demand for other intoxicants, through the interaction between

the intoxicants in the individual’s utility function under one’s budget constraint (Chaloupka and

Laixuthai, 1997; Pacula, 1998).

       Assuming marijuana has a downward sloping demand, the effect of an MML on

marijuana use should be unequivocally positive. The effect on other substance use, however, can

be positive or negative, depending on the relative magnitude of the income and substitution

effects (Chaloupka and Laixuthai, 1997; Pacula, 1998). Specifically, contemporaneous

substitution of marijuana for another substance in response to the implementation of an MML is

most likely to occur for substances whose pharmacological effect is the most similar to that of

marijuana; whereas a complementary relationship is most likely to occur between marijuana and

another substance if their combined use produces a synergistic interaction (Moore, 2010). In

addition to the contemporaneous relationship between marijuana use and other substance use,

there may also be a progression from the demand for marijuana to the craving and thus future

demand for a more powerful substance with more intense and longer-lasting effects (Kandel,

1975; Kandel, 2002).

2.4. Pharmacologic Evidence on the Relationship between Marijuana & Other Substances

       Marijuana and alcohol target many common neural pathways in human brains

(Maldonado, Valverde, and Berrendero, 2006). On the one hand, marijuana use produces

rewarding and sedative effects that are comparable to the effect of alcohol use (Boys, Marsden,

and Strang, 2001; Heishman, Arasteh, and Stitzer, 1997), especially low-dose alcohol




                                                6
consumption5 (King, et al., 2011). In this case, when MML lowers the cost of marijuana use, an

individual may substitute marijuana for alcohol to achieve a similar experience of euphoria and

relaxation, perhaps with fewer immediate negative physical symptoms (e.g. hangovers).

        Conversely, the overall intoxication experience may be enhanced by the simultaneous use

of marijuana and alcohol together (Boys, Marsden, and Strang, 2001). Evidence from one

randomized control trial (RCT) suggests that ethanol facilitates the absorption of delta 9-

tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which in turn, leads to more episodes and a longer duration of

euphoria reported by human subjects. Higher doses of ethanol can expedite euphoria and

lengthen its duration (Lukas and Orozco, 2001). This scenario points towards a competing

hypothesis that marijuana and alcohol are complements rather than substitutes, and MMLs

should increase the use of both substances.

        Marijuana is also widely portrayed as a “gateway” drug, essentially inducing the use of

drugs with more serious health, legal and social consequences (Kandel, 1975; Kandel, 2002).

One hypothesized pathway is through pharmacological mechanisms: once users tolerate the

psychoactive effects of marijuana use, they may crave and seek out more powerful drugs with

more intense and longer-lasting effects. This pharmacological mechanism would thus predict a

positive effect of MML implementation on the subsequent use of hard drugs.

        Nonetheless, the pharmacological account of the gateway hypothesis is difficult to

identify empirically in the absence of controlled experiments on humans6 (Caulkins, et al., 2012;

Anthony, 2012). An alternative to this pharmacological mechanism is that the observed

hierarchical sequence from marijuana use to hard drug use may simply reflect common


5
 High-dose alcohol consumption, in contrast, tends to lower sedation and heighten stimulation (King, et
al., 2011).
6
  Although converging lines of evidence from experimental animal models suggest interactions between
the cannabinoid and opioid system, they are insufficient and inconclusive to date (see, for instance,
Ledent, et al., 1999; Cadoni, et al, 2001; Klein, 2001; Navarro, et al., 2001; Solinas, Panlilio, and
Goldberg, 2004; Ellgren, Spano, and Hurd, 2007; Cadoni, Valentini, and Di Chiara, 2008; DiNieri and
Hurd, 2012; Cadoni, et al., 2014).

                                                   7
predisposing factors rooted in genetic or environmental factors coupled with an exposure

opportunity mechanism through which marijuana users may be introduced to a shared market or

subculture of hard drugs (Morral, et al., 2002; Wagner and Anthony, 2002a). If predisposing

factors and exposure opportunities are the primary mechanisms that lead to transition from

marijuana use to hard drug use, then an MML should not result in an increase in hard drug use

because the predisposing factors and exposure opportunities7 for hard drug use remain

unaffected.


3. PREVIOUS LITERATURE

3.1. Literature on MMLs & Marijuana Use

         Empirical evidence is inconclusive with respect to the effect of MMLs on marijuana use

in the general population. The cross-sectional correlation found in earlier studies (e.g., Cerdá, et

al., 2011) largely comes from the underlying high prevalence of marijuana use in MML states

prior to the laws (Wall, et al., 2011). Later studies that addressed state heterogeneity generally

found no within-state variation in marijuana use attributable to an MML (Harper, et al., 2012;

Lynne-Landsman, et al., 2013; Anderson, Hansen, and Rees, 2012). Nonetheless, these previous

studies focused on youth marijuana use and on measures of current marijuana use. The adult

population, with different underlying risk attitudes, budget constraints, and exposures to drug

markets and subculture, is likely to respond differently to an MML. Furthermore, an MML may

have consequences for other previously overlooked dimensions of marijuana use. And such

dimensions as initiation and abuse/dependence may have differential elasticities8 and expected

harms.


7
 The existing MMLs help marijuana users gain access to the drug through medical marijuana
dispensaries and home cultivation, which are unlikely to expose the marijuana users to the market or
subculture of hard drugs.
8
 Although the literature on differential elasticities of marijuana demand is thin, Manning, Blumberg, and
Moulton (1995) provided evidence for differential responses to alcohol prices between light, moderate,
and heavy drinkers.
                                                    8
3.2. Literature on Marijuana & Other Substances

       Through the increased marijuana use, a further consequence of an MML could also be the

spillover to the use of other psychoactive substances (e.g., excessive alcohol use and hard drug

use). Identification of the spillover effect in an observational study hinges on the isolation of the

exogenous variation in substance use arising from policy/price shocks from the endogenous

variation due to “common factors” or “exposure opportunities.”

       Epidemiological studies have attempted to rule out the common genetic and

environmental factors through a discordant twin design or panel data analysis (Lynskey, et al.,

2003; Fergusson, Boden, and Horwood, 2006). Lynskey and colleagues (2003) compared

substance use between monozygotic twins in the Austrian Twin Register to remove their shared

genetic and environmental influence. Fergusson, Boden, and Horwood (2005) analyzed 25-year

longitudinal substance use data of a birth cohort in the New Zealand Christchurch Health and

Development Study, and included individual fixed effects to control, statistically, for the

heterogeneity in genetic and environmental factors that do not change over time. According to

these studies, the estimated effect of marijuana use on excessive alcohol use and hard drug use

shrinks, but remains significant even when through the study design. However, a major

limitation of the monozygotic twin comparison is that it cannot remove the unshared

environmental influence that contributes to different decisions about substance use in identical

twins. A limitation of the fixed effects method is that it cannot control for the time-variant

environmental factors evolving with age or specific to a life stage that contribute to the substance

use progression in individuals.

       Another limitation of the literature is that the prior studies have not examined the effect

of marijuana use on the use of other substances within the context of an MML. Even if marijuana

use, in general, does lead to excessive alcohol use and hard drug use, those who use marijuana in

response to the implementation of an MML may differ from a typical marijuana user in drinking


                                                 9
behavior and other substance use. Thus, we cannot draw any inference about the effect of an

MML from what is observed among those who use marijuana regardless of the law.

       Economic studies rely on the exogenous shocks in policy/price related to one substance

to estimate a joint demand function for the target substance itself (e.g., alcohol and cocaine) and

its potential complements/substitutes (e.g., marijuana). Previous studies have exploited changes

in state excise taxes on beer (Pacula, 1998), the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) (DiNardo

and Lemieux, 2001; Yörük and Yörük, 2011, 2012; Crost and Guerrero, 2012) composite market

prices of alcohol (Saffer and Chaloupka, 1999) and market prices of cocaine (Saffer and

Chaloupka, 1999; DeSimone and Farrelly, 2003). Although they generally found a direct

policy/price effect on the use of the target substance itself that follows a downward sloping

demand curve, the downstream effect on marijuana use is mixed. Chaloupka and Laixuthai

(1997), DiNardo and Lemieux (2001), Crost and Guerrero (2012), and Crost and Rees (2013)

found evidence for a substitution between marijuana and alcohol, whereas Pacula (1998), Saffer

and Chaloupka (1999), and Yörük and Yörük (2011, 2013) found evidence supporting the

complementarity hypothesis. Moreover, evidence from Saffer and Chaloupka (1999) and

DeSimone and Farrelly (2003) suggests a complementary relationship between marijuana and

cocaine.

       Not only is there a lack of consistent evidence, it is also difficult to extrapolate the effect

of an MML on alcohol use/cocaine use from the estimated reduced-form effect of alcohol- or

cocaine-related policy/price on marijuana use or the implied structural relationship between

marijuana use and alcohol use. This difficulty arises out of the nature of the underlying

Marshallian demand function, which does not require symmetric relationships between

substances (i.e., from substance A to B vs. from substance B to A), nor does it require symmetric

responses to policy/price changes (i.e., permissive policy/lower price vs. restrictive policy/higher

price). Thus it is possible for marijuana to be a substitute for alcohol when alcohol regulations


                                                 10
become more restrictive (e.g., blue laws that ban Sunday sales of alcohol for off-premises

consumption) but for alcohol be a complement to marijuana following a shift towards more

permissive marijuana policies (e.g., MMLs).9

3.3. Significance of Our Study

        To inform the current debate on MMLs, we examine the effect of state implementation of

MMLs between 2004 and 2011 on marijuana, alcohol, and hard drug use for both adolescent and

adult populations. Our study advances the existing literature by: (i) providing the first estimates

of the effect of MML implementation on adult marijuana use using micro-level data; (ii)

estimating directly a reduced-form effect of MML implementation on alcohol use and hard drug

use, rather than an implied contemporaneous relationship induced by alcohol- or hard drug-

related policies/price; and (iii) estimating the effect of MML implementation on a full range of

substance use outcomes with differential elasticities and expected harms, including current use

and frequency, initiation, and abuse/dependence.


4. METHODS

4.1. Data Sources

        Eight years of cross-sectional data were pooled from a restricted version of the National

Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) 2004-2011 (CBHSQ, 2013). NSDUH is a nationally

and state-representative10 survey sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services

Administration (SAMHSA), and the primary source of information on substance use behavior by
9
  Anderson, Hansen, and Rees (2013) provided one of the most direct evidence within the context of
MMLs that states with MMLs saw a reduction in alcohol-related traffic fatalities. However, due to the
ambiguity in the policy effect on marijuana use in the first place, this finding does not necessarily imply
that alcohol is a substitute for (or a complement to) marijuana. In fact, when taking into account the key
components of MMLs, Pacula and colleagues (2013) concluded that the finding from traffic fatalities are
more consistent with a complementarity hypothesis.
10
  The NSDUH sampling is designed as state-based with an independent, multistage area probability
sample within each state and the District of Columbia. The eight states with the largest population (i.e.,
California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas)10 have an annual
sample size of about 3,600 each. For the remaining 42 states and the District of Columbia, each has a
sample size of about 900 annually.

the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized11 population aged 12 or above. Adolescents and young

adults aged 12 to 25 are oversampled in the survey.

        The majority of the NSDUH interview is conducted by self-administrated audio

computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI), a highly private and confidential mode that

encourages honest reporting of substance use and other sensitive behaviors (Johnson, Fendrich,

and Mackesy-Amiti, 2010). The response rates range from 73% to 76% between 2004 and 2011.

4.2. Variable Measurement

4.2.1. Dependent Variables

Marijuana Use Outcomes:

        NSDUH provides information on the recency and frequency of the use of each substance,

the timing of the first use of each substance, and the assessment of substance abuse/dependence

based on DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (APA, 2000). This information allows us to examine the

effect of MML implementation on a full range of marijuana use outcomes with differential

elasticities and expected harms, including current marijuana use and frequency, marijuana use

initiation, and marijuana abuse/dependence. Four measures of marijuana use outcomes were

created accordingly: (i) a dichotomous indicator assessing whether a respondent used marijuana

during the past month prior to the interview; (ii) the number of days during the past month that a

respondent used marijuana, which is an unconditional frequency ranging from 0 to 30; (iii) a

dichotomous indicator for using marijuana for the first time during the past year; (vi) a

dichotomous indicator for being classified as abuse of or dependence on marijuana during the

past year according to DSM-IV criteria.

Alcohol Use Outcomes:




11
  Institutionalized individuals (e.g. in jails/prisons or hospitals), homeless or transient persons not in
shelters, and military personnel on active duty were excluded from the NSDUH sample.

                                                      12
        As noted above, empirical support exists both for a substitution and for a complementary

relationship between marijuana use and alcohol use. An explanation for this contradiction, as we

mentioned in Section 2.4., is related to the dose of alcohol consumption: lower-dose alcohol

consumption is hypothesized to be replaced by marijuana use (King, et al., 2011), whereas

higher-dose alcohol consumption is hypothesized to be accompanied by marijuana use (Lukas

and Orozco, 2001).

        Therefore, for alcohol use outcomes, we examined any alcohol use as well as binge

drinking. By doing so, we accounted for the differences in the elasticity of demand for alcohol

and consequent effect of MML implementation across different levels of drinking intensity.

Binge drinking, in the NSDUH, is defined as having five or more drinks on the same occasion on

at least one day during the past month12. We created the following measures for alcohol use: (i)

the total amount of drinks consumed during the past month, (ii) the unconditional frequency of

alcohol use counting the number of days alcohol was consumed during the past month, (iii) the

unconditional frequency of binge drinking days,13 and (iv) the probability of being classified as

having alcohol abuse/dependence during the past year.

        We also created a dichotomous indicator to assess whether a respondent used marijuana

while drinking alcohol during the past month.14 This measure of simultaneous use of marijuana

and alcohol can provide further insight into the contemporaneous complementarity between the

two substances.

Hard Drug Use Outcomes:


12
  A commonly used alternative defines “binge drinking” as five or more drinks for men and four or more
drinks for women consumed on one occasion (Wechsler, et al., 1995). Our estimates are robust to this
gender-specific definition (not shown).
13
  Carpenter and Dobkin (2009), for instance, find evidence for the differential elasticity of alcohol
demand along the distribution of drinking intensity and frequency.
14
  The question about simultaneous use of marijuana and alcohol is not included in NSDUH 2004 and
2005 surveys, while the MMLs in Vermont and Montana both came into effective in 2004. Thus we
cannot estimate the effect of these two states’ implementation of the MMLs on this outcome.

                                                     13
        We focus our analysis of hard drugs on cocaine and heroin, not only because they are

widely prevalent15 and highly dangerous16, but also because these are the two substances most

often linked to the potential gateway effect of marijuana use (Kandel, 2002). We created

dichotomous indicators for: (i) past-month cocaine use and heroin use, and (ii) past-year

initiation of the two drugs.

4.2.2. Independence Variables

MML-Implementation Indicator:

        The recent launch of the Data Portal system by the CBHSQ provides us with access to

state identifiers in micro-level NSDUH data, allowing us to create a dichotomous indicator for

the implementation of a MML in a given state during a given year. As summarized in Table 1,

during 2004-2010, MMLs came into effect in seven states in various years. The MML-

implementation indicator was assigned a value of 1 for each full year subsequent to the effective

date of the laws17, and a value of 0 for the remaining years and for the control states. Control

states include those that did not have any MML by the end of 2010 (i.e., “no MML states”). Note

that we excluded eight states that had an MML in place prior to 2004 (i.e., “always MML




15
  The prevalence rates of past-month use of cocaine and heroin are 0.6% and 0.1%, respectively. The
combined total of past-month cocaine users and heroin users accounts for 19% of the illicit drug users
who use substances other than marijuana during the past month. When we further exclude the non-
medical use of psychotherapeutic drugs, 55% of the remaining past-month illicit drug users (i.e., who use
substances other than marijuana and psychotherapeutic drugs) used cocaine or heroin or both during the
past month.
16
  For instance, the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs (ISCD) in the U.K., led by the former
chief government drugs adviser, assessed the individual and societal harmfulness of 20 substances
including tobacco, alcohol and 18 commonly used illicit drugs, and concluded that heroin, cocaine, and
methamphetamine were the most harmful drugs to individuals, whereas alcohol, heroin, and cocaine were
the most harmful to others (Nutt, King, and Phillips, 2010).
17
  The effective date of the MMLs cannot be matched precisely with the survey date of the NSDUH,
which raises concerns about measurement error: the years during which MMLs came into effective and
the first full years after the effective date of MMLs may capture a mixture of pre-MML and post-MML
behaviors. Nonetheless, this potential misclassification is unlikely to bias our findings because the
estimates are consistent when we excluded these years and when we reclassified the pre-/post-MML
periods.

                                                   14
states”), because all but Hawaii amended their laws during the study period.18 We also excluded

Maryland, Arizona, and Delaware, which fall short of being classified as “MML states” during

the study period: Maryland passed two laws in 2003 and in 2011 favorable to medical marijuana,

albeit not legalizing it; Arizona and Delaware did not begin to implement MMLs until 2011. Our

main analyses, therefore, excluded these states from the control group.

Covariates:

       We controlled for individual-level and state-level factors that are correlated with both the

individual choice to use substances and with state decisions about MMLs. Individual-level

covariates for adolescents and adults include: (i) age (linear and squared terms), (ii) gender, (iii)

race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, non-Hispanic African/Black, non-Hispanic Asian,

or other racial/ethnic origins), (iv) self-reported health (excellent, very good, good, or fair/poor

health), (v) past-month cigarette smoking (daily smoker, non-daily smoker, or non-smoker), (vi)

urban residence (living in a metropolitan, micropolitan, or non-core-based statistical area), (vii)

family income relative to federal poverty level (living below 100% FPL, 100%-200% FPL, or

above 200% FPL). For adults, we also included measures of: (i) marital status (never married,

married, divorced/separated, or widowed), (ii) educational attainment (less than high school,

high school graduate, some college, or college graduate), (iii) college enrollment (full-time

enrolled, part-time enrolled, or non-student), and (iv) employment status (full-time employed,

part-time employed, unemployed, or not in labor force).

       In addition to the individual-level demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, we

also controlled for the time-variant state-level economic and policy environment. State-level

economic measurements include: (i) unemployment rate, (ii) average personal income, and (iii)
18
  We concerned that when including the “always MMLs states” in our control states, the estimated effect
of MML implementation may be clouded by the effect of the policy tweaking and amendment of the
existing MMLs. Therefore, we decided to exclude those “always MML states” from main analyses. We
included those states in a set of sensitivity analyses and added an indicator for the amendment of the
existing MMLs in a given “always MML states” during a given year. Our main findings were robust to
the inclusion of “always MML states” in the model specification (Table 7 & 8).

                                                  15
median household income of the state. Three additional continuous measures were created to

capture relevant changes in the state policy environment concerning beer taxes between 2004

and 2011: (i) specific excise taxes levied per gallon at the wholesale or retail; (ii) ad valorem

excise taxes levied as a percentage of the retail price for on-premises sales (e.g., bars,

restaurants); and (iii) ad valorem excise taxes for off-premises sales.19 Another major policy

change that occurred during the study period was related to marijuana decriminalization:

Massachusetts, California, and several cities and counties in other states relaxed penalties for

recreational marijuana use or placed it “the lowest law enforcement priority.” We excluded these

decriminalization areas from the analytic sample.20

        Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for the marijuana, alcohol, and hard drug use

outcomes in 2004 and 2011, separately for “no MML states” vs. “MML states”. For most of the

outcomes, the 2004 and 2011 statistics in the “MML states” mirrored those in the “no MML

states”. For the outcomes including the probability of past-month marijuana use, the number of

marijuana use days, the number of binge drinking days, and the probability of simultaneous use

of marijuana and alcohol among adults aged 21 or above, as well as the probability of marijuana

initiation among adolescents and young adults aged 12-20, we observed slightly higher

probabilities/counts in the “MML states” than those in the “no MML states” in 2004. By 2011,

however, these probabilities and counts diverged markedly.21



19
  We did not control for the market price of cocaine or heroin. The most commonly used source is the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s System to Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence (STRIDE)
dataset. Empirical studies often find that STRIDE prices are not predictive or only weakly predictive of
drug use (Horowitz, 2001). As French and Popovici (2009) pointed out, “part of difficulty here is that
conventional prices for illicit drug are not readily available and alternative measures are not yet found.”
Nonetheless, fluctuations in cocaine prices and heroin prices are unlikely to be correlated with the MML
implementation, thus omitting these variables is unlikely to bias our results.
20
  The estimated effects of MML implementation are robust to the alternative specifications in which we
included the decriminalization areas in our sample and included as a covariate an indicator for the
implementation of marijuana decriminalization in these areas (not shown).
21
  A more rigorous regression approach that we discuss in the next section can help identify to what extent
this observed divergence can be attributed to the MML implementation during 2004-2011.

                                                    16
        Table 3 reports the descriptive statistics for the individual-level and state-level covariates

we included in the regressions for the entire analytic sample.

4.3. Identification Strategy

        To identify the effect of MML implementation on individual marijuana, alcohol, and hard

drug use, we estimated the following two-way fixed effects models:

        Yi,s,t = f(β0 + β1 MMLs,t + β2 X1 i,s,t + β3 X2 s,t + ρs + τt + ρs t + εi,s,t)

        where i denotes an/the individual, s denotes the state, and t denotes the year. Yi,s,t

represents the four marijuana use outcomes, the six alcohol use outcomes, and the four hard drug

use outcomes discussed above. MMLs,t is the policy indicator for the implementation of an MML

in a state s during a year t. X1 i,s,t is the full vector of individual-level covariates. X2 s,t includes the

state-level economic indicators and beer tax rates. The two-way fixed effects are captured in our

models by ρs and τt to account for the time-invariant state heterogeneity as well as the national

secular trend and common shocks related to substance use. We also added state-specific linear

time trends ρs t to account for the unobserved state-level factors that evolve over time at a

constant rate (e.g., social norms and sentiments towards substance use).

        This two-way fixed effects method can be viewed as an extension of the difference-in-

differences (DD) framework to fit multi-unit and multi-time models that go beyond the

traditional two groups (i.e., treatment vs. control) and two periods (i.e., pre vs. post)

(Wooldridge, 2001). It can produce consistent estimates unless there were concurrent shocks to

substance use that affected the outcomes only in the “MML states”. To our knowledge, no such

concurrent shocks existed.

        Standard errors were clustered at the state level to correct for the serial correlation. The

clustered standard errors allow for arbitrary within-state correlation in error terms but assume

independence across the states (Bertrand, et al., 2004).




                                                        17
          We stratified the sample into two age groups, adolescents and young adults aged 12-20

(N ≈ 183,600) and adults aged 21 or above (N ≈ 219,400). We chose age-21 as the cutoff point in

light of the previous evidence of an age-21 discontinuity in both alcohol use and marijuana use

(Crost and Guerrero, 2012; Yörük and Yörük, 2011, 2012).22 We tested four cut-off points in our

analyses, age-18, age-21, age-25 and age-30. Only the age-21 stratification, which also coincides

with the legal drinking age, produced significant and meaningful differences in the estimated

policy effect between age groups.

          We estimated Probit regressions for the dichotomous dependent variables in our study.

The other four discrete dependent variables we studied (i.e., the unconditional number and

frequency measures) possess “excess zeroes” and positive skewness compared to a standard

normal distribution, which requires a more flexible estimation approach than an ordinary least

squares (OLS) estimation. A generalized linear model (GLM) with gamma distribution and log

link23 was estimated for the total amount of drinks during the past month among those aged 21 or

above. For the total amount of drinks among those aged 12-20, on the other hand, we estimated a

two-part model with Probit in the first part and GLM (gamma distribution and log link) in the

second part. Because there is an explicit decision process regarding legality of alcohol

consumption among those under 21, we use the TPM to model the decision to engage in

underage drinking and the quantity consumed conditional upon deciding to engage in underage

drinking as separate processes. We followed the same logic when estimating the frequency

variables. Considering the underlying decision processes and the proportions of zero values, we

estimated a negative binomial regression24 for the number of alcohol use days among those aged


22
  The age-21 discontinuity may be created by minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) as the studies
suggest. It may also be related to other shocks to cognitive development, risk preference, legal
responsibility and social environment.
23
     The selection of distribution family under the GLM was made based on the modified Park test results.
24
  The likelihood ratio test for overdispersion rejects the Poisson distribution in favor of the binomial
distribution.

21 or above and a zero-inflated negative binomial regression25 for the number of alcohol use

days among those aged 12-20.26 Zero-inflated negative binomial regressions were also estimated

for the number of marijuana use days and the number of binge drinking days in both age groups.

        For ease of interpretation, we converted the coefficient of MMLs,t in each of the

estimations to the average marginal effect calculated at MMLs,t = 0 and the observed values of

other covariates.

5. RESULTS

5.1. Estimated Effect of MML Implementation on Marijuana Use

        In Table 4 we first present the marginal effect of MML implementation on the four

marijuana use outcomes (Panel A). Among adults aged 21 or above, the implementation of an

MML increased the probability of using marijuana during the past month by 1.37-1.40

percentage points (Row 1 Column 3 & 4), which is robust to the inclusion of the state-specific

linear time trends. This percentage point change can be translated into a 16 percent relative

increase from a baseline predicted marijuana use probability of 8.60 percentage points.

        The NSDUH data do not allow us to distinguish between medical marijuana patients and

the non-patient population. Nonetheless, according to the registry data (Anderson, Hansen and

Rees. 2013), the number of registered medical marijuana patients accounts for an average of 0.8

percent of the population across the five “MML states” on which the registry information is



25
  The likelihood ratio tests for overdispersion reject the zero-inflated Poisson regression in favor of a
zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Furthermore, the Vuong tests for zero-inflation confirm our
choice of zero-inflated regressions instead of ordinary negative binomial regressions.
26
  An alternative to a zero-inflated regression is a hurdle model (i.e., “TPM” for counts). A practical
challenge, however, is that cluster-adjusted standard errors from the combined marginal effects (i.e.,
combining the first- and second-part estimates) from the hurdle model (Belotti, et al., 2014). Nonetheless,
the point estimates for the combined effects we obtained from the hurdle models with first-part Probit and
second-part zero-truncated negative binomial (not shown) were very similar to the zero-inflated negative
binomial estimates from our main analyses. In another set of sensitivity analyses, we also treated the
count variables as continuous and estimated the combined marginal effects and their cluster-adjusted
standard errors using the STATA command “TPM” (Belotti, et al., 2014). The TPM estimates (not
shown) were slightly larger and more significant than the zero-inflated negative binomial estimates.

                                                    19
available27. Therefore, the 1.4 percentage point increase in the probability of marijuana use we

found among adults aged 21 or above is not likely to come exclusively from an increase in use

among registered patients. Though we cannot test this directly, it suggests that there may also be

a considerable increase in recreational marijuana use or self-medication by the non-patient

population associated with MML implementation.

       Among adults aged 21 or above, we also found a 0.14-0.21 day or a 12-17 percent

increase in the number of marijuana use days (Row 2 Column 3 & 4) arising from MML

implementation. Among adolescents and young adults aged 12-20, in contrast, no change in the

probability or frequency of past-month marijuana use can be attributed to MML implementation

(Row 1 & 2 Column 1 & 2).

       With regard to marijuana use initiation in the preceding year, MML implementation led

to 0.32-0.46 percentage point or a 5-6 percent increase in the probability of first-time marijuana

use among adolescents and young adults aged 12-20 (Row 3 Column 1 & 2). Yet, the lack of a

positive policy effect on the probability and frequency of past-month marijuana use among this

age group suggests that many of these individuals are engaging in experimental use with

relatively low health, behavioral, and social consequences. In other words, these findings are

consistent with a scenario in which adolescents and young adults who experiment with marijuana

use because of the potentially increased availability and social acceptance and reduced penalties

brought about by an MML are not transitioning to regular use, at least in the short term.

       Among those aged 21 or above, we also found a 0.22 percentage point increase in

marijuana use initiation (Row 3 Column 3). However, this was largely offset by the inclusion of

the state-specific linear time trends (Row 3 Column 4). This insignificant increase in initiation

suggests that the significant increases in the probability and frequency of past-month use we

found earlier come largely from the adults who first tried marijuana long before its medical use
27
  The registry information is not available for the two most recent “MML states”, namely New Jersey
and the District of Columbia, despite that both states mandate patient registry in their laws.

                                                  20
was permitted by law. After the introduction of an MML that helped reduce costs of marijuana

use (i.e., market prices as well as non-market health, legal and social consequences), those with

prior marijuana use experience would likely reinitiate or increase their marijuana use.

       The effect arguably most salient to the public health implications of MMLs is the effect

on marijuana abuse/dependence among adults aged 21 or above, as this occurs even for other

legal pharmaceuticals such as prescription opioid medications. We found a 15-27 percent

increase in the probability of marijuana abuse/dependence (Row 4 Column 3 & 4), which is

higher than the relative increase in the probability and frequency of marijuana use in this age

group. This finding suggests that those who used marijuana in response to MML implementation

had a higher risk of progressing to abuse/dependence than those who used marijuana regardless

of the law.

5.2. Estimated Effect of MML Implementation on Alcohol Use

       To the extent that alcohol is a complement or substitute to marijuana, the significant

effect of MML implementation on marijuana use may spread to alcohol use (Table 4 Panel B).

Our estimates indicate that, among adults aged 21 or above, MML implementation was not

associated with either the total number of drinks or the number of drinking days (Row 1 & 2

Column 3 & 4). The implementation of an MML was, however, positively associated with the

frequency of binge drinking, with an effect size of 0.10-0.14 binge drinking days or a relative

increase of 6-9 percent (Row 3 Column 3 & 4). The spillover increase in binge drinking implies

a complementarity between marijuana use and high-dose alcohol consumption among adults

aged 21 or above. Not only was this contemporaneous complementarity reflected in the

independent measures of marijuana use and binge drinking, it was further confirmed by the

measure of simultaneous use of the two substances: among adults aged 21 or above we found a

0.62-0.89 percentage point or a 15-22 percent increase in the probability of marijuana use while

drinking as a result of MML implementation (Row 4 Column 3 & 4).

                                                21
       However, we found no significant change in any measure of alcohol use among

adolescents and young adults aged 12-20, which suggests that the increased marijuana use

initiation we reported previously is unlikely to spread to underage drinking.

5.3. Immediate & Delayed Effect of MML Implementation on Alcohol Abuse/Dependence

& on Hard Drug Use

       In addition to increased marijuana use and binge drinking, MML implementation may

have a spillover effect on alcohol abuse/dependence and the use of hard drugs such as cocaine

and heroin. Given that the progression from marijuana use and binge drinking to these

downstream outcomes may be a gradual transition (Wagner & Anthony, 2002b), we estimated

not only the contemporaneous policy effect but also the one-year and two-year lagged policy

effect. For both age groups, we found neither an immediate effect nor a delayed effect of MML

implementation on alcohol abuse/dependence, past-month cocaine use, cocaine use initiation,

past-month heroin use, and heroin use initiation (Table 5).

5.4. Policy Endogeneity of MML Adoption

       There is a geographic concentration of MMLs: states that have adopted MMLs are all in

the West and Northeast. This geographic similarity raises concern that there may be some past

shocks to marijuana use in these regions leading to their adoption of MMLs and not accounted

for by the state fixed effects and the state-specific linear trends. In other words, MML adoption

could be endogenous to marijuana use. To check for this potential policy endogeneity,

specifications with a series of lagged and leading indicators for adopting an MML were

estimated for key marijuana use outcomes (Table 6). We found that only the contemporaneous

and lagged policy indicators had significant effects, while all the leads had small and statistically

insignificant effects. These estimates suggest that it is in fact the policy shocks from adopting an




                                                 22
MML that drive the changes in marijuana use, rather than some past disturbances in marijuana

use that drive the adoption of an MML.28

5.5. State-Aggregate Effect of MML Implementation

        To further check the robustness of our individual-level estimates with regard to serial

correlation, we aggregated the data to the state level and estimated the effect of MML

implementation on state-level prevalence rates of our key individual-level findings.29 The

previously highlighted policy effects on past-month marijuana use, marijuana use initiation,

marijuana abuse/dependence, past-month binge drinking, and simultaneous use of marijuana and

alcohol remain significant in these state-level specifications (Table 9 Panel A & B). The policy

effects on the other downstream outcomes remain insignificant (Table 9 Panel C), with the only

exception being a one-year lagged policy effect on the state-level prevalence of alcohol

abuse/dependence among adults aged 21 or above (Panel C Row 1 Column 3 & 4).

5.6. State Heterogeneity of the Effect of MML Implementation

        By examining the implementation of MMLs between 2004 and 2011 in seven states

collectively, our estimates capture the average policy effect across all seven “MML states”.

However, the policy effects for each of these states may not necessarily have the same magnitude

or even the same direction (Pacula, et al., 2013). From a statistical standpoint, a substantial

policy effect from one or two states could potentially account for the overall finding. To test for

heterogeneity of the estimated policy effect, we replaced the single indicator for MML

28
  As another set of sensitivity analyses, we also included the “always MML states” in our control states,
which enables us to account for the past disturbances that “MML states” shared with “always MML
states”. Our main findings were robust to the inclusion of “always MML states” in the model
specification (Table 7 & 8).
29
   In Column 1 and 3 (Table 9) we clustered the standard errors at the state level; while in Column 2 and
4, we removed the time-series information from the standard errors by averaging the pre-MML data and
the post-MML data (Donald and Lang, 2007). We followed a two-step procedure described in Bertrand,
Duflo, and Mullainathan (2001, pp. 267) to accommodate staggered adoption of the MMLs across states.
As a result, the data were collapsed into pre- and post-MML two periods across 7 “MML states”. The
standard errors were adjusted to take into account the smaller number of “MML states” (Donald and
Lang, 2007).

                                                    23
implementation with seven separate indicators for MML implementation in each of the seven

“MML states”. We found, in most cases, across-the-board significant policy effects in the same

direction, although states vary in the magnitude of the effect (Table 10). Pacula and colleagues

(2013) note that key components of MMLs, such as the ambiguity in “chronic pain”, the

allowance for dispensaries and/or home cultivation, and (the absence of) mandatory registry and

renewal may help explain the heterogeneity of the policy effect across these seven states.

However, we do not have sufficient policy variation during the study period to elucidate which

of these components may have accounted for the heterogeneity in the effect size of MML

implementation.


6. DISCUSSION

        Three main pieces of evidence from our study inform the policy discussions of MMLs.

First, we found a significant effect of MML implementation on increasing marijuana use.

Estimates suggest that the populations responsive to MMLs were adolescents and young adults

aged 12-20 who experimented with marijuana for the first time and adults aged 21 or above who

had tried marijuana prior to the implementation of the law. This latter group had an increased

risk of progression to marijuana abuse/dependence.30 The effect of MML implementation on

marijuana abuse/dependence constitutes a potential public health concern similar to that of

prescription drug abuse/dependence (CDC, 2012): even if we assume that the increases in

marijuana use we observed come from those who use the drug for validated medical purposes,

there may still be possibility that marijuana abuse/dependence would increase as a result of

MML implementation.



30
  A diagnosis of substance abuse/dependence, by definition, indicates that an individual is experiencing a
cluster of psychological, physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms associated with substance use. The
DSM-IV considers marijuana abuse and marijuana dependence to be valid psychiatric disorders, and
marijuana abuse/dependence as experienced in clinical population and general population appears very
similar to other substance abuse/dependence disorders (Budney, et al., 2007).

                                                   24
       Second, among those aged 21 or above, we found a spillover effect of MML

implementation on the increasing frequency of binge drinking, possibly through increased use of

the two substances simultaneously. The complementarity between marijuana use and binge

drinking among adults of legal drinking age could magnify the expected harms of an MML. As

Pacula and Sevigny (2014) commented, “even if consumption (of marijuana) were assumed to

rise by 100 percent, the savings of liberalization policies would dwarf the known health costs

associated with using marijuana. However, all potential savings … could be entirely erased, and

tremendous losses incurred, if alcohol and marijuana turn out to be economic complements.” The

6-9 percent increase in the frequency of binge drinking and the 15-22 percent increase in the

probability of simultaneous marijuana and alcohol use31 that we estimated may result in

considerable economic and social costs from downstream health care expenditures and

productivity loss (Naimi, et al., 2003).

       Third, neither underage drinking among those aged 12-20 nor hard drug use in both age

groups was affected by MML implementation. In this regard, the often-voiced concerns about

the potential gateway effect of marijuana is not supported by our findings. We caution that our

study is not intended to refute the gateway hypothesis. Rather it suggests that the gateway effect

is not likely to occur in the context of an MML: for those who respond to MML implementation

and use marijuana, their marijuana use is not likely to act as a gateway to more dangerous

substance use through the pharmacological properties of marijuana.32

       Taken together, our study findings provide evidence for a significant effect of MML

implementation on increasing marijuana use, and a spillover effect among adults of legal

drinking age from increased marijuana use to increased binge drinking. The findings do not,
31
  The interaction between marijuana and alcohol may magnify the risks posed by the two substances
individually (Liguori, Gatto, and Jarrett, 2002; Medina, et al., 2007).
32
  Nonetheless marijuana may still be a gateway drug for other marijuana users through other pathways
For instance, those who use marijuana regardless of the laws or those who use marijuana in response to
decriminalization may progress to hard drug use because marijuana introduces them to a shared market or
subculture of hard drugs.

                                                  25
however, provide evidence to support other types of substance use spillovers (i.e., underage

drinking, cocaine use, and heroin use).

‡ As what we did in the individual-level analyses, we excluded the 8 states which had MMLs in place
prior to 2004 (i.e., “always MML states”), exclude Arizona and Delaware whose MMLs came into effect
during 2011, exclude Maryland which passed two laws in 2003 and in 2011 favorable to medical

marijuana, and exclude California (already excluded as one of the “always MML states”) and
Massachusetts which relaxed penalties for recreational marijuana use during the study period. The
exclusion left us with 39 states across 8 years in the state-aggregate analyses;
§ We further averaged the pre-MML data and the post-MML data (Donald and Lang, 2007) following a
two-step procedure described in Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2001, pp. 267). The second-step
equation is estimated based on pre- and post-MML two-period panels of 7 “MML states”. The standard
errors were adjusted to take into account the smaller number of “MML states” (Donald and Lang, 2007).
