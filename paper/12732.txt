Taxing Sales Under the FairTax: What Rate Works?

                                           ABSTRACT


As specified in Congressional bill H.R. 25/S. 25, the FairTax is a proposal to replace the federal
personal income tax, corporate income tax, payroll (FICA) tax, capital gains, alternative minimum,
self-employment, and estate and gifts taxes with a single-rate federal retail sales tax. The FairTax
also provides a prebate to each household based on its demographic composition. The prebate is
set to ensure that households pay no taxes net on spending up to the poverty level.

Bill Gale (2005) and the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform (2005) suggest that the
effective (tax inclusive) tax rate needed to implement H.R. 25 is far higher than the proposed 23%
rate. This study, which builds on Gale's (2005) analysis, shows that a 23% rate is eminently feasible
and suggests why Gale and the Tax Panel reached the opposite conclusion.

This paper begins by projecting the FairTax's 2007 tax base net of its rebate. Next it calculates the
tax rate needed to maintain the real levels of federal and state spending under the FairTax. It then
determines if an effective rate of 23% would be sufficient to fund 2007 estimated spending or if not,
the amount by which non-Social Security federal expenditures would need to be reduced. Finally,
it shows that the FairTax imposes no additional real fiscal burdens on state and local government,
notwithstanding the requirement that such governments pay the FairTax when they purchase goods
and services.

Implementing the FairTax rate of 23% would produce $2,586 billion in federal tax revenues which
is $358 billion more than the $2,228 billion in tax revenues generated by the taxes it repeals.
Adjusting the base for the prebate and the administrative credit paid to businesses and states for
collecting the tax results in a net tax base of $9,355 billion. In 2007, spending at current levels is
projected to be $3,285 billion. Revenues from the FairTax at a 23% tax rate, plus other federal
revenues, are estimated to yield $3,209 billion which is $76 billion less than current CBO spending
projections for 2007. The $76 billion amounts to only 2.73% of non-Social Security spending
($2,177 - $2,101). This is a remarkably small adjustment when set against the more than 30% rise
in the real value of these expenditures since 2000.

Ensuring real revenue neutrality at the federal level, given the net base of $9,355 billion, implies a
rate of 23.82% on a tax-inclusive basis and 31.27% on a tax-exclusive basis. These and other
calculations presented here ignore a) general equilibrium feedback (supply-side and demand-side)
effects that could significantly raise the FairTax base (see, for example, Kotlikoff and Jokisch,
2005), b) the possibility that tax evasion would exceed the considerable amount automatically
incorporated here via the use of NIPA data, which undercount consumption expenditures due to
evasion under the current tax system, and c) the roughly $1 trillion real capital gain the federal
government would secure on its outstanding nominal debt, were consumer prices to rise by the full
amount of the FairTax.

The FairTax redistributes real purchasing power from state and local governments to their state and
local income-tax taxpayers. It does so by reducing factor prices relative to consumer prices and,
thereby, reducing the real value (measured at consumer prices) of state and local income tax
payments, which are assessed on factor incomes (namely, factor supplies times factor prices). Gale
(2005) and the Tax Panel (2005) recognized this loss in real state and local government revenues
in claiming that these governments need to be compensated for having to pay the FairTax. But what
they apparently missed is that this loss to these governments is exactly offset by a gain to their
taxpayers. Were state and local governments to maintain their real income tax collections -- the
assumption made here -- by increasing their tax rates appropriately, their taxpayers' real tax burdens
would remain unchanged and there would be no need for the federal government to compensate state
and local governments for having to pay the FairTax on their purchases. The second is that H.R. 25
does not preclude state and local governments from levying their sales taxes on the
FairTax-inclusive price of consumer goods and services. This produces significantly more revenue
compared to levying their sales taxes on producer prices. Moreover, Gale (2005) and the Tax Panel
(2005) arrived at a higher tax rate because they did not estimate the Fairtax rate, but instead
estimated a sales tax of their own design which had a substantially narrower base.

1. Introduction

The FairTax plan, as specified in Congressional bill H.R. 25/S.25 – The Fair Tax Act of 2005 –
proposes to replace most of the existing federal taxes with a comprehensive consumption tax in
the form of a national retail sales tax, effective January 1, 2007. The Act would repeal the
federal income tax (including the capital gains tax and the alternative minimum tax), the
corporate income tax, federal payroll taxes, the self-employment tax, and the estate and gift tax.
The Act is intended to be revenue neutral, and would replace lost federal revenue with a national
retail consumption tax (the “FairTax”) levied at a tax-inclusive rate of 23 percent.

H.R. 25 calls for revenue, rather than spending, neutrality. Revenue neutrality commonly means
using different taxes to generate the same number of nominal dollars. But most tax changes have
little potential to change prices, so nominal revenue neutrality generally equates to real revenue
neutrality, which, in turn, equates to real spending neutrality. The FairTax has the potential to
significantly change both the prices paid by consumers and those received by producers.
Consequently, focusing on nominal revenue neutrality would beg the question of what would
happen to these prices and, thus, to real spending levels.

In this paper, we focus on real revenue/real spending neutrality. To be precise, we determine
what FairTax rate is needed, not only for the federal government but also for state and local
governments, to maintain their real spending levels after the switch to the FairTax. Focusing on
real rather than nominal neutrality has the decided advantage that one can determine the revenue-
neutral FairTax tax rate without having to pin down what happens to the price level. As Gale
(2005) pointed out and as our math confirms, the formula for the FairTax rate needed to achieve
real revenue/real spending neutrality on a flow basis is independent of the price level.

Some critics of the FairTax argue that the rate needed for this purpose would be far greater than
23 percent; Gale (2005) argues that it would be at least 31 percent.1 The most important finding
of this report is that only a 2.73 percent cut in non-Social Security federal expenditures would be
needed to accommodate a 23 percent rate.2 Indeed, the requisite 23.82 percent rate is so close to
23.0 percent that only a 2.73 percent cut in non-Social Security federal expenditures from the
CBO projected spending level for 2007 is needed to accommodate a 23.0 percent rate. This is a
remarkably small adjustment when set against the more than 30 percent rise in the real value of
these expenditures since 2000. It is important to note that theses calculations are based on the
“static” assumption that implementation of the FairTax would have no effect on the tax base; in
so doing, they ignore the expansive effect that the FairTax could be expected to exert on the base
as it eliminates the bias against saving inherent in the existing tax system.

These calculations ignore a) general equilibrium feedback (supply-side and demand-side) effects
that could significantly raise the FairTax base (see, for example, Kotlikoff and Jokisch, 2005, or
Tuerck et al., 2006b), b) the possibility that tax evasion would exceed the considerable amount of
evasion automatically incorporated in our calculations given our use of NIPA data, which
undercount consumption expenditures due to evasion under the current tax system, and c) the

Retail Sales Tax: What Would the Rate Have to Be?” 889-91.

  The different findings stem, in part, from the mistaken assumption by Gale and, we presume, by the President’s
Tax Panel (which has not disclosed its methodology) that state and local governments need to be compensated for
having to pay the FairTax, in part from our use of updated data, in part from the focus on different years, in part
from other methodological refinements and choices, and, in part, from our decision in this study to ignore (modulo
some passing remarks) issues of tax evasion, expansion of the tax base due to general equilibrium effects, and
capital gains on outstanding government debt.
roughly $1 trillion real capital gain the federal government would secure on its outstanding
nominal debt, were consumer prices to rise by the full amount of the FairTax.

The next section measures the size of the FairTax tax base. Section 3 determines the tax rate
required to maintain the level of real non-Social Security federal spending under the FairTax.
Section 4 considers the level of real non-Social Security federal spending cut needed to
accommodate a 23 percent FairTax rate. Section 5 indicates that if state and local governments
continue to collect the same real revenues from their taxpayers, they will be able to maintain
their real spending levels, notwithstanding the requirement that they pay the FairTax on their
purchases. Section 6 concludes with brief discussions of general equilibrium feedback effects,
tax evasion, the huge potential capital gain accruing to the federal government from
implementing the FairTax, and what may be the FairTax’s most significant feature – its potential
to enhance budgetary discipline.

2. The FairTax Tax Base

H.R. 25/S. 25 calls for a tax on “all consumption of goods and services in the United States.”
This consists, for the most part, of what the National Income and Product Accounts defines as
“personal consumption expenditures” and “government consumption expenditures.” Table 1
shows that consumption, so measured, comprised approximately 86 percent of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) in 2005.3

Note: * Totals may not add due to rounding.

Although Table 1 provides a rough sense of the base on which the FairTax would be levied, a
number of further adjustments are required. As indicated in Table 2, the most important of these
have to do with the treatment of housing and educational expenditures.

2.1 Personal Consumption Expenditures

The FairTax has special provisions when it comes to taxing housing, education, financial
intermediation services, and travel. We also need to make an adjustment for state and local sales
taxes.

 The remaining 14 percent consisted of gross private domestic investment and net exports, neither of which are part
of the FairTax base. The FairTax treats exports and imports on a destination tax basis. It exempts exports and taxes
imports.

2.1.1 Housing
Explicit rental payments are subject to taxation under the FairTax. Implicit rents on existing
owner-occupied housing and farms are not. However, the FairTax implicitly taxes imputed rent
on newly constructed housing via a pre-payment approach that levies the FairTax on their initial
sale.4 Thus, we remove the value of imputed rent for housing and farm dwellings from the base.
Because purchases of new homes are counted as investment in new structures in the NIPA
accounts, we add these figures to the base.

Under the FairTax improvements to single-family homes, and realtors’ fees, which represent
payments for services provided, are also taxable. These expenditures are counted as investment
and not consumption in the NIPA tables, and they are added to the FairTax base. It should be
noted that, under the FairTax, there is no tax on the resale of houses or any other property that
was previously subject to the FairTax or that was owned by a consumer on the changeover date.

2.1.2 Education
Tuition and job training expenditures are treated as an investment in human capital and, as such,
are excluded from the FairTax base.

2.1.3 Financial Intermediation
The FairTax calls for the taxation of both explicit and implicit financial intermediation services
that consumers pay to financial services firms. Explicit financial intermediation services include
fees for brokerage, banking, loan origination, mutual fund management and other financial
services, and are counted in personal consumption expenditures in the NIPA tables.

Implicit financial intermediation services are defined by H.R. 25 as the difference between the
basic interest rate (as defined in section 805) and the rate paid on an investment, account, or debt.
The difference between actual interest payments (for example, new home mortgage interest) and
basic interest payments (the 10-year bond yield) is taxable. Thus, for example, a taxpayer with a
mortgage rate of 7% would have 29% of the mortgage interest payment subject to tax if the
Treasury rate were 5 percent. Implicit financial intermediation services are not included in the
accounting of personal consumption expenditures in NIPA. Consequently, we have calculated
our own values for implicit financial intermediation services for home mortgage, non-profit and
personal borrowing.5

4
   According to the National Association of Realtors, approximately 23 percent of newly constructed homes are
purchased for investment purposes. These homes would not be subject to the FairTax when they are newly built, but
the payments made by the renters of these units would be subject to the FairTax. We make an adjustment to account
for these purchases. If the houses are later sold by the business to a consumer (i.e., converted from a business or
investment purpose to a consumption purpose) these sales would be taxed under the FairTax. We do not attempt to
estimate the revenue from this provision. It could, however, be substantial over time.
5
  In Table 2, line 9, implicit fees are imputed as follows: the excess of the basic interest rate (as defined in section
805 of H.R. 25) over the rate paid on such investment. The value for implicit fees for home mortgages is derived by
estimating the principal ($6.4819 trillion in 2007) by dividing the total interest payments listed in NIPA Table 7.11,
line 16 ($465.4 billion in 2007) by the new-home mortgage interest rate listed in table B-73 of the 2006 Economic
Report of the President (EROP), which was 7.18% in 2007. We apply the basic interest rate defined as the 10-year
bond rate listed in Table B-73 of the Economic Report of the President (EROP) to the principle ($6.4819 trillion x
5.20% = $337.1 billion). The difference between total home mortgage payments and the basic interest payments
($465.4 billion - $337.1 billion = $128.3 billion) is the taxable implicit financial intermediation fee. This calculation
is repeated for nonprofit interest using the new-home mortgage rate.
The implicit fee for personal interest paid is calculated by applying the basic interest rate (three-year U.S. Treasury
securities rate) from Table B-73, EROP to the Federal Reserve estimate for total outstanding consumer credit (for
2007: $2,414.9 billion x 3.7% = $89.35 billion). This figure is subtracted from the total interest paid by persons
listed in NIPA Table 7.11, line 17 ($244 billion in 2007) to arrive at our estimate of the implicit financial

                                                                                                              Page 5 of 34
2.1.4 Travel
As a destination principle sales tax, the FairTax applies to all retail purchases within the United
States regardless of the nationality of the purchaser or the origin of the goods. Adjustments to
the accounts are necessary to capture purchases made by nonresidents visiting the United States
and to subtract overseas purchases made by U.S. residents.6

2.1.5 Adjusting for State and Local Taxes
The portion of state and local sales taxes that applies to sales at the retail level is deducted in
order to avoid cascading or levying the FairTax on top of state and local sales taxes. Because the
FairTax does not apply to intermediate transactions (businesses-to-business sales), the state and
local sales taxes that apply to these transactions are automatically excluded from the base. We
have adjusted our calculations to reflect an estimate that 40% of state and local sales taxes apply
to business transactions.7

2.1.6 Other Adjustments

Food produced and consumed on farms never reaches retail markets and is not subject to the
FairTax. We subtract this figure from the base.

Finally, nonprofit institutions are treated as persons by the NIPA tables, and thus their
consumption expenditures are included in the private tax base. The consumption expenditures of
nonprofit institutions comprise of their operating expenditures, including wages and salaries of
nonprofit workers, but do not include their sales of goods and services to individuals. The
FairTax taxes non-profits’ sales of goods and services to individuals and their purchases of goods
and services that are not sold on to individuals, including capital goods. However, the FairTax
does not tax the salaries and wages of nonprofit workers, and thus an adjustment is needed. We
remove those salaries and wages of nonprofit workers that are not involved in the production of
goods and services sold to individuals.8 We also remove the capital consumption allowance,
since it is impractical to tax the consumption of capital.




intermediation service for personal credit that is subject to the FairTax (for 2007: $244 billion – $89.35 billion =
$154.6 billion).

  The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) within the NIPA accounts includes the final consumption of
nonprofit institutions serving households (NIPA Table 2.9, line 57, $183.7 billion) and their sales to households
(NIPA Table 2.9, line 64, $676.8 billion). We estimate and remove the wage and salary portion of the final
consumption expenditures of nonprofit institutions. First, we remove the portion of nonprofit final consumption
expenditures that is attributable to educational nonprofit institutions, since they have already been removed from the
base institutions (NIPA Table 2.9, line 61 minus line 67, $52 billion). This leaves the final consumption
expenditures at $131.7 billion. Next we estimate the ratio of wages and salaries to total expenditures of non-profits
by taking NIPA Table 1.13, line 51 and dividing it by the sum of NIPA Table 2.9, lines 58 and 70; the result equals
51.65%. We apply this ratio to the $131.7 billion to get $68 billion. This represents our estimate of the salaries and
wages of nonprofit employees that are not involved in the production of goods and services that are sold to
households.

2.2 Government Consumption Spending

Government consumption is included in the FairTax base in order to put personal and
government consumption expenditures on an equal footing.9 Government consumption
expenditures currently include payroll taxes paid by government and income taxes and payroll
taxes paid by its employees with respect to government wages. They also reflect payroll and
income taxes paid in the course of producing consumption goods bought by government from
private-sector firms. The intent of the FairTax is to substitute a sales tax for all of these taxes.
Failing to tax government consumption, while taxing only private consumption, would make
government consumption expenditures artificially cheap in comparison to private consumption
expenditures, and could cause the provision of some goods and services to migrate from the
private sector to the government sector. Activities such as trash collection and transportation
services are taxed under the FairTax, whether provided by government or the private sector.

2.3 The Size of the FairTax Base

Since the effective date of H.R. 25/S. 25 is January 1, 2007, we estimate the tax base for the
FairTax and the federal tax revenues that would be replaced by these proposals for calendar year
2007. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provides estimates of several important
economic statistics and tax revenues for the major federal taxes (see Table 3).10 As detailed in
Appendix B, we use the latest available CBO data to form 2007 projections of tax-base
components.

We find the 2007 FairTax base to be $11,244 billion. Starting with personal consumption
expenditures of $9,772 billion, we make adjustments for housing by adding the purchase of new
homes and the improvement of existing homes. The imputed rent for owner-occupied housing
and farm dwellings is removed since the tax due on the imputed rent will become prepaid when
the property is sold as a new dwelling.11

We also adjust for education tuition (excluded under the FairTax), taxable interest and financial
intermediation, foreign travel, and other items.12 The net effect of these adjustments is to reduce
the private consumption base to $9,235 billion, as Table 2 shows.

Next, we add government consumption at the state, local and federal levels to the base. We
subtract wages paid to government employees who provide education and training, and we
subtract capital consumption allowance (since it is impractical to tax the consumption of

consumption of fixed capital) by nonprofit research organizations and by grant-making foundations for education
and research. Gale (1999) includes it while Burton and Mastromarco (1997) exclude it. We have chosen to include
half of its value.

equals $916 billion. These amounts sum to $11,244 billion dollars, representing 81% of 2007

   According to BEA, government consumption expenditures include the consumption of fixed capital; given the
impracticality of collecting tax on the consumption of capital, we have removed it from the base in the form of the
capital consumption allowance.

We note that when calculating the FairTax rate we do not discount the amount we estimate that
federal government would save because of the reduced tax administration and enforcement
duties that it would have under the FairTax. This reduced spending would imply a lower tax
burden on the private sector as well as state and local government, which would then increase
their respective consumption levels leaving the FairTax base unchanged.

3. The FairTax Rate

Given the base, we can calculate the rate at which the FairTax must be levied once we know how
much tax revenue needs to be raised. Two main items need to be computed, namely the 2007
revenue to be replaced and the revenue needed to cover the prebate.

3.1 Replacing Tax Revenue

Table 3 details the amount of revenue currently raised by individual and corporation income
taxes, social insurance and retirement contributions, and estate and gift taxes on a calendar year
basis – taxes that would be repealed and replaced by the FairTax.15 In calendar year 2005, these
taxes yielded $2,059 billion or 16.5% of GDP. In 2007 these taxes are expected to yield $2,288
billion or 16.4% of GDP. These figures are based on CBO estimates that assume that all tax
provisions scheduled to expire before 2016, including the tax cuts enacted between 2001 and
2004, do not expire.16

It is worth considering what the FairTax rate would be if it were not for the prebate. To calculate
the rate before the prebate is included, we would divide the gross FairTax base (line 31 in Table

below that called for in H.R. 25.


3.2 The Prebate

As discussed in Kotlikoff and Rapson (2005) and Tuerck et al. (2006a), the FairTax’s prebate
makes the FairTax highly progressive when measured relative to the economically meaningful
basis of lifetime income. The prebate is based on the federal poverty guidelines adjusted to
remove any marriage penalty. The prebate may be thought of as a rebate, except that it is paid at
the beginning of each month in advance of that month’s consumption expenditures. The size of
the monthly prebate provided to a given household is set at the amount of FairTax that household
would pay over the course of the month, were it consuming at the federal poverty line.

More precisely, the prebate equals the FairTax tax rate multiplied by the family consumption
allowance divided by 12, where the family consumption allowance is based on the size of the
household.17 An additional adjustment is made in the case of married couples to prevent a
marriage penalty since the poverty level for a family of two is not twice the poverty level of a
single person living alone.

  The family consumption allowance is the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services poverty level guideline
plus and additional amount to eliminate a marriage penalty.

                                                                                                     Page 10 of 34
Take, as an example, a family of four. Its 2007 family consumption allowance is projected to be
$26,981, resulting in an annual prebate of $6,205 (0.23 times $26,981). The total family
consumption allowance or prebate base was estimated by using the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services Poverty Level Guidelines for 2006 and U.S. Census Bureau estimates for
the number and size of households in the United States. The family consumption allowance
computed for each family size/marital status combination was multiplied by the number of
households in each size category to compute the total value of the prebate for that category.
These totals were summed to arrive at the base on which the prebate would be calculated.

3.3 Tax-Inclusive versus Tax-Exclusive Rates

At this point, we need to clarify the difference between tax-inclusive and tax-exclusive sales tax
rates. An example will help. Suppose a worker named Joe earns $125 and spends all of his
earnings. Suppose further that he pays a tax of $25. If he were subject to an income tax, he
would earn $125 before tax, $100 after tax and spend $100 at the store. Thus, he would need to
earn $125 to spend $100. In the case of a sales tax, he would earn $125 and pay $125 at the
store. Of the $125 paid by Joe at the store, the store would remit $25 in sales tax, meaning that
Joe ends up with just $100 worth of goods and services.

We may think of the tax rate as $25/$100 = 25%, which is the tax-exclusive rate (te);
alternatively we may report the tax rate as $25/$125 = 20%, which is the tax-inclusive rate (ti).
The 23% FairTax rate set out in H.R. 25/S. 25 is a tax-inclusive rate, as is the current personal
income tax, whereas most state-level sales taxes are quoted on a tax-exclusive basis. For ease of
comparison, we report tax rates in both ways in Table 5.

3.4 Determining the FairTax Tax Rate

In this section we determine the rate at which the FairTax would need to be levied in 2007. To
repeat, we assume that the FairTax would be neutral in the sense that it would permit the same
real expenditures by federal, state, and local government as well as cover the costs of the prebate.

Under current law, the federal budget balance for 2007 may be written as

       (1)     R107 + R 207 + DEF07 ≡ G07 + TR07 + GN 07 .
Here

       R107    is the revenue from taxes to be eliminated under the FairTax (including income
               and payroll taxes);
       R207    is the revenue from federal excise and other taxes that will continue to be levied
               after the FairTax is enacted;
       DEF07 is the federal budget deficit;
       G07     is taxable federal government spending on goods and services;
       TR07    measures federal transfer payments to individuals, including most Social Security
               payments, Medicaid and Medicare subsidies, and social programs such as food
               stamps, for which the recipients are not taxed under current law; and
       GN07 represents federal spending and transfers for which the recipients would not be

        C07 :    Personal consumption at market value in 2007.
        GS07 : Taxable state and local government consumption at market value in 2007.


Now consider what happens with the introduction of the FairTax. Under the FairTax, equation
(1) becomes:

        (2)      RFT + R 2 FT + DEFFT = G FT + TRFT + GN FT + PRE FT + AC FT .
In equation (2) the FT subscript indicates values under the FairTax, and the components that
have the same basic names as in equation (1) – R2, DEF, G, TR and GN – represent the same
revenue or expenditure components as in equation (1). The three new terms in equation (2) are:

        RFT          the tax revenue to be raised by the FairTax in 2007;
        PREFT        the prebate. This is a new expenditure to be financed by new tax revenue
                     raised by the FairTax; and
        ACFT         the administrative credit that the Federal government will pay vendors and
                     states for collecting the FairTax.

Unlike the terms in equation (1), the terms in equation (2) are not directly measurable. Two
issues arising in the determination of the FairTax values are (1) the reaction of monetary
authorities to the switch to the FairTax and (2) the amount of revenue needed for the FairTax to
cover the real expenditures that had previously been financed by the existing federal taxes.

Because the FairTax falls on consumption, there is a question of how its imposition would affect
the prices of consumer goods.

3.4.1 Accounting for Changes in Consumer and Producer Prices
At a macroeconomic level, prices depend on how the monetary authorities react to changes in tax
policy, macroeconomic conditions and other variables affecting prices. In simple terms, the
overall price level must be consistent with the “quantity theory” equation, whereby MV = PY.
Here M is the money supply, V is the velocity at which money circulates, P is the price level, and
Y is real income. For the purpose of this analysis, we assume that under the FairTax, V and Y
would remain unchanged. Therefore a rise in the price level would be possible only if
accommodated by an increase in the money supply.18 Put another way, without monetary
accommodation, prices faced by consumers under the FairTax would not rise. Any changes to
the level of monetary accommodation, i.e. increase in the money supply, would cause prices to
increase in the same proportion.

Let us designate α as the percentage (which could be zero) by which market prices under the
FairTax would exceed expected prices in 2007 under current law. Assuming that the monetary
authorities adjust only to the FairTax in setting policy for 2007, α can take values between 0 and
te, so that 0 ≤ α ≤ te , where te is the tax-exclusive FairTax rate. With no change in real income or

18
   In fact, Y would not remain constant, but would rise, owing to the “dynamic” effects that would arise from
replacing the existing tax system with the FairTax. We discuss this further below in connection with the evasion
issue.

                                                                                                     Page 12 of 34
the velocity of money, the maximum amount that prices could increase when the FairTax is
imposed is the amount of the tax, so the price would go up by a factor of te when there is full
monetary accommodation. In general the relationship between pre- and post-FairTax consumer
prices, P07, and PFT, is given by

            (3)       PFT = P07 (1 + α ) .

The current consumer price level, P07, has two components:

       1. Producer prices (PP) -- the prices producers receive. This component incorporates all
          unit costs of production, including unit profit margins.
       2. Other federal commodity taxes (PR2) -- import duties, excise taxes and the like.
          Revenues from these taxes form the R2 component of the federal government revenue
          mentioned above.
Under current law this means that consumer prices are

            (4)       P07 = PP07 + PR 2 07 .

Since the FairTax is levied on producer prices as well as on top of other federal commodity
taxes, consumer prices under the FairTax satisfy

            (5)       PFT = (PPFT + PR 2 FT )(1 + t e ) .

Now consider how producer prices pre and post imposition of the FairTax are related. This
relation is given by

            (6)       PPFT = PP07 (1 − T )(1 + α ) ,

where T is the rate by which producer prices under current law would fall without any monetary
accommodation. Note that this rate is not necessarily equal to the FairTax rate due to the
presence of other commodity taxes.19 Assuming the government adjusts the level of these other
commodity taxes to maintain their real purchasing power, we have

            (7)       PR 2 FT = PR 2 07 (1 + α ) .

Letting ti be the FairTax inclusive rate
                            1
        (8)      1 + te =        .
                          1 − ti

Now, substituting (3), (6) and (7) in (5):

                      P07 (1 + α ) = [PP07 (1 − T ) + PR 2 07 ](1 + t e )(1 + α )
                      P07 = [PP07 (1 − T ) + PR 2 07 ](1 + t e )
                      P07 (1 − t i ) = PP07 (1 − T ) + PR 2 07
                      P07 (1 − t i ) = PP07 + PR 2 07 − PP07T

19
     As we see later, the fact that PR2 is also taxed causes T to be greater than the tax-inclusive FairTax rate, ti.

                                                                                                                 Page 13 of 34
                  P07 (1 − t i ) = P07 − PP07T
                  PP07T = P07t i ,

we get
                        P07
         (9)      T=        ti .
                       PP07

                P07
Letting γ =          we have:
                PP07

         (10)     T = γ ti .

To calculate γ we use consumption and R2, which we estimate at $147 billion in 2007. Hence,
we have

                           C07 + G07 + GS07        11, 244
                  γ=                           =              = 1.0132 .
                       C07 + G07 + GS07 − R 207 11, 244 − 147
Thus (10) becomes

         (11)     T = 1.0132 t i .


3.4.2 Dealing with Government Purchases of Goods and Services
Let us now consider the individual components of equation (2). We start with nominal
government expenditures G (on the right-hand side of the equation) of goods and services.
These expenditures must buy the same real goods and services under the FairTax as they would
under current law, except for those services of the IRS that would no longer be needed because
of the removal of different taxes valid under current law. Calling these IRS real savings IRSS,

         (12)     GFT = ( G07 − IRSS )(1 + α ) .

Nominal federal transfer payments TR that are not taxed under current law must remain high
enough to command the same goods and services under the FairTax as they do under current law.
Thus,

         (13)     TRFT = TR07 (1 + α ) .

3.4.3 Treatment of Taxable Transfer Payments and FairTax Tax-Favored Purchases
Now consider transfer payments to individuals that are subject to income taxes under current
law. Examples here include government interest payments and Social Security benefits.
Maintaining the real purchasing power of these transfer payments before and after the FairTax
requires taking into account that these payments will no longer be subject to income taxation.

A similar issue arises in the case of government purchase of educational services and other
commodities that would not be subject to the FairTax. Assuming the tax break is passed on to


                                                                                     Page 14 of 34
purchasers of these commodities, the government’s required real spending on such goods and
services will be reduced.

Denote by GN the sum of taxable transfer payments plus federal purchases of goods and services
not subject to the FairTax, then:

       (14)    GN FT = GN 07 (1 − T )(1 + α ) .


Substituting (11) we can write

       (15)    GN FT = GN 07 (1 − 1.0132 t fr ) (1 + α ) .


It is possible that some elements of GN would not undergo the once-and-for-all adjustment
assumed by equation (15). For example, H.R. 25/S. 25 requires the indexation of Social Security
benefits, which might be interpreted to mean that the portion of those benefits falling into GN
would, in practice, be adjusted upward by α but not downward by T. For our purpose of
maintaining government overall spending constant in real terms, the indexing of the Social
Security payments included in GN would cause the real value of G and/or TR to decrease
correspondingly. Since we are interested in the FairTax rate and not the actual values of G, GN
and TR we consider this approach to be valid.


3.4.4 The Prebate
Nominal prebate expenditures are calculated by multiplying the total family consumption
allowance or prebate base, denoted B07, by the tax-inclusive rate (ti) and the increase in the price
level. Hence,

       (16)    PREFT = B07ti (1 + α ) .

3.4.5 The FairTax’s Administrative Credit

The administrative credit that will be paid to vendors and state government for collecting the
FairTax, ACFT, is set in H.R. 25/S. 25 at a quarter of 1% (0.25%) of the revenue collected by the
retailer, and another quarter of 1% of the revenue collected by the state and local government.
The federal government gets no administrative credit for collecting any FairTax revenue. In
order to calculate the administrative credit, we must identify the sources of collection, and for
this purpose we separate purchases done at the vendor level, predominately retailers and
professionals, from those done at the government level. The latter are wages paid by the
different governments to their employees.

Sales tax revenue collected at the vendor level includes all private and government retail
purchases. This comprises private consumption, C07, and the non-wage portion of G07 and GS07.
This revenue is first collected by the vendors, who claim a credit equal to 0.25% of revenues
collected and send the remaining 99.75% (= 100% - 0.25%) to the state government. The state
government then takes its 0.25% of the amount remitted by the vendor, sending the remainder to
the federal government. The total administrative credit for this type of revenue, as a portion of
the revenue, is therefore 0.499375% (= 0.25% + 0.25% × (1 – 0.25%) ≈ .50% ). It is important
to consider that federal wages comprise 32% of federal government purchases, and state and
                                                                                          Page 15 of 34
local government wages are 41% of state and local government purchases. This means that the
non-wage portion of government purchases relevant to this type of revenue is 68% of G07 and
59% of GS07 respectively. 20

The FairTax on state and local government wages is only collected at the state government level,
and therefore would “earn” a credit of only 0.25%. This means that for the administrative credit
we also have to apply a 0.25% factor to 41% of GS07.

At the same time, because the federal government will not claim an administrative credit for
collecting the FairTax on its own wage payments, we do not include an administrative credit for
this portion of FairTax revenues.

Finally, the private sector increases its consumption by IRSS on the assumption that this
reduction in federal government spending is passed on to taxpayers in the form of a reduced tax
burden:

         (17)              {                                                                           }
                   ACFT = 0.50% C07 + IRSS + 0.68 ( G07 − IRSS ) + 0.59GS07 + 0.25% × 0.41GS07 ti (1 + α ) .



3.4.6 Revenue Collection Under the FairTax
We now consider the revenue side of equation (2), and begin with RFT, the revenue raised by the
FairTax. We know that the tax is levied on consumption: personal consumption and the
consumption of federal, state and local governments. Therefore:

         (18)      RFT = ( CFT + GFT + GS FT ) ti .

In the above equation we have two new terms:

         CFT :    Personal consumption at market value in 2007 under the FairTax.
         GSFT : Taxable state and local government consumption at market value in 2007 under
                the FairTax.

Assume that there is no monetary accommodation. The FairTax would cause producer prices
and, therefore, the tax base for state and local governments to fall. Unless some measure is
taken, state and local government revenue would fall. That would be the equivalent of state and
local governments’ providing a tax cut to their taxpayers. We assume that state and local
governments take the necessary measures to maintain the real value of their revenues, which, in
this setting means raising their tax rates or expanding their state sales tax bases by conforming to
the FairTax base.21 And this assumption implies that these governments will maintain the real
value of their consumption purchases.



20
   For the federal government, NIPA Table 6.2D, line 87 (salary and wages) is divided by the federal government
tax base (G)to give the portion of the tax base that comprises wages and salaries. This percentage is subtracted from
100% to obtain the value of non-wages is the tax base. The process is repeated for state and local governments,
NIPA 6.2D, line 92, except that wages and salaries for education, line 94, ($403) are subtracted from total wages
and salaries since this is subtracted from the state and local government tax base.
21
   States will have an incentive to conform their state sales tax base to the FairTax base because H.R. 25 provides
that conforming states are allowed to collect state sales taxes on internet and remote sales to residents of their state.
Other studies have estimated this to be a potential revenue gain of between $21.5 billion and $33.7 billion for 2008.

                                                                                                             Page 16 of 34
We extend this assumption to the cost saving enjoyed by the federal government in the form of
reduced expenditures on the IRS: the cost saving is passed fully on to consumers.

Therefore,

       (19)    CFT = ( C07 + IRSS )(1 + α ) ,

       (20)    GS FT = GS07 (1 + α ) .

Substituting the relationships in equations (12), (19) and (20) into equation (18):

               RFT = ( C07 + IRSS + G07 − IRSS + GS07 ) ti (1 + α )

       (21)    RFT = ( C07 + G07 + GS07 ) ti (1 + α ) .

Now consider R2FT. The revenue in this category is raised by excise taxes, import duties and the
like. As we have mentioned previously, this revenue must buy the same goods and services for
the government as it did previously. Therefore the real revenue from these sources under the
FairTax must be the same as it would be under the current law. Hence

       (22)    R 2 FT = R 2 07 (1 + α ) .

Let us now consider the deficit. We assume the deficit to be financed by private saving. We
continue to assume that household purchasing power remains fixed. In particular, we assume
that wages will adjust to keep purchasing power constant in real terms. Therefore, we further
assume saving to be constant in real terms. This means that the deficit in 2007 will be the same
under the FairTax, without monetary accommodation, as it would be under the current law. Thus

       (23)    DEFFT = DEF07 (1 + α ) .


3.4.7 The FairTax Tax Rate Formula
Substituting expressions (12), (13), (15), (16), (17), (21), (22) and (23) in equation (2) give the
equation for budget balance under the FairTax:

               ( C07 + G07 + GS07 ) ti (1 + α ) + R 207 (1 + α ) + DEF07 (1 + α ) =
       (24)    ( G07 − IRSS )(1 + α ) + TR07 (1 + α ) + GN 07 (1 − 1.0132 ti )(1 + α ) + B07ti (1 + α ) +
               {0.50% C07 + IRSS + 0.68 ( G07 − IRSS ) + 0.59GS07 + 0.25% × 0.41GS07 } ti (1 + α ).
We note that (1 + α ) accompanies every term in equation (24), so it drops from the equation.
This is important since it implies that the FairTax rate is independent of the level of monetary
accommodation. Simplifying equation (24):

               [0.9950C07 − 0.0016 IRSS + 0.9966G07 + 0.9960GS07 ] ti + R 207 + DEF07 =
       (25)
                      G07 + TR07 + GN 07 (1 − 1.0132 ti ) + B07ti − IRSS .


                                                                                                    Page 17 of 34
We now group the terms that are multiplied by ti to get:

                 [0.9950C07 − 0.0016 IRSS + 0.9966G07 + 0.9960GS07 + 1.0132GN 07 − B07 ] ti =
                           G07 + TR07 + GN 07 − R 207 − DEF07 − IRSS .

                                       G07 + TR07 + GN 07 − R 207 − DEF07 − IRSS
                 ti =                                                                        .
                        0.9950C07 − 0.0016 IRSS + 0.9966G07 + 0.9960GS07 + 1.0132GN 07 − B07

Using (1),

                                                     R107 − IRSS
        (26)     ti =                                                                        .
                        0.9950C07 − 0.0016 IRSS + 0.9966G07 + 0.9960GS07 + 1.0132GN 07 − B07

Inserting values from Table 5 and solving gives

                                         2, 228
        (27)     ti =                                             = 23.82%.
                        9,189 − 0.01 + 913 + 1, 089 + 276 − 2,112


The information required to determine the FairTax rate is set out in Table 5. The FairTax calls
for the replacement of federal taxes on personal and corporate income, the gift and estate taxes;
and the payroll tax. We estimate that the revenues raised by these taxes would be $2,288 billion
in 2007 under the current law. We subtract the cost of the Earned Income Tax and the Child Tax
Credits, which the federal government counts as spending, and represents revenue that would not
be raised under the FairTax. H.R. 25/S. 25 also calls for abolishing the Internal Revenue
Service, since the states would administer the FairTax. The federal agency that would take
responsibility for working with the states to coordinate FairTax collections would need far fewer
resources than the IRS today. Therefore, we estimate that the federal government would be able
to cut $8 billion from the FY 2007 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) budget of $11.01 billion
budget.22 These adjustments reduce the revenues replaced by the FairTax to $2,228 billion.

Tax-exclusive rate(te) is 2,228/(9,355-2,228), which equals                              31.27%

As set out in Table 5, the FairTax base needs some adjustments in order to match equation (26).
We have to adjust personal, state and local government and federal government consumptions by
the deduction of the administrative credit fees. We must add the base for the reduction in GN.
We reduce the base by the net effect of the IRSS in the administration credit. Finally we must
deduct the prebate base. We, thus, calculate the adjusted base to be $9,355 billion. To raise
revenue of $2,228 billion from a base of $9,355 billion, the rate that must be imposed is 23.82%
in tax-inclusive terms, or 31.27% in tax-exclusive terms.


4. Federal Spending with a 23% Rate

In the previous section, we showed that the FairTax rate required to keep existing federal
government spending constant in real terms is 23.82%. However, H.R. 25/S. 25 calls for a rate
of 23%. Although there is only a small difference between the two rates, it would be necessary
for the federal government to undergo a reduction in real spending were the 23% rate to be
implemented. Alternatively, the FairTax could enhance economic growth enough to increase the
FairTax base three percent, in which case 23% would be sufficient to avoid any spending
reduction. (As previously explained, this paper provides a purely “static” analysis, which
ignores the expansive effect that the FairTax could be expected to exert on economic activity as
it eliminates the existing bias against saving. In practice, therefore, it would probably be
possible to implement the FairTax at the 23% rate without any reduction in federal spending. In
the absence of this expansive effect, however, some reduction in spending would be necessary.)

While this reduction is also necessarily small, there is a question of just how large a reduction
would be required. The answer is in part political, inasmuch as every government program has
some constituency that would resist even small budget cuts.


                                                                                       Page 19 of 34
Here we estimate the percentage reduction in federal government spending that would be
required under a 23% rate; given that all spending, except that for Social Security benefits, is
available for reduction.

We must take into account a number of complexities that arise in making this calculation. First,
we must recognize that the available pool of spending depends partly on the rate itself. Some
spending (expenditures that fall under the categories of GN, AC and PRE) would be different
under a 23% rate than under a 23.82% rate. Second, we must recall that Social Security
spending falls under the TR as well as the GN category. Social Security payments would make
up 24.12% of TR and 47.96% of GN in 2007.

We define:

         NSSFT: the amount of non-Social Security spending that would be in place under the
                FairTax; and
         δ:                                                                           ′ ) under a
                the percentage of the non-Social Security spending (identified as NSS FT
                23% rate that would need to be cut.

We let
         (28)   NSS FT = GFT + .7588TRFT + .5204GN FT + ACFT + PREFT .

Substituting this definition in equation (2):

         (29)   RFT + R 2 FT + DEFFT = NSS FT + .2412TRFT + .4796GN FT .

From section 3.4 we know this equality will hold only when a rate of 23.82% is imposed. Note
that RFT, NSSFT and GNFT are all a function of the tax-inclusive rate. These values will be
different when we impose a 23.82% rate than when we impose a 23.0% rate. Calling the values
                                       ′ , NSS FT
of these categories under a 23% rate RFT        ′ and GN FT′ respectively, the corresponding
equation to (29) under a 23% rate is:

         (30)    ′ + R 2 FT + DEFFT = (1 − δ ) NSS FT
                RFT                                ′ + .2412TRFT + .4796GN FT
                                                                           ′ .

In equation (30) we introduce δ because we know that the imposition of the 23.0% rate will bring
in less revenue than would be needed, and we want to know what share of NSS FT  ′ that is. We
now solve for δ

                          ′ + R 2 FT + DEFFT − .2412TRFT − .4796GN FT
                         RFT                                       ′
         (31)   δ = 1−                                                .
                                                 ′
                                            NSS FT

Using the appropriate values from Table 6 in equation (31):


                         2,586 + 147 + 476 − 403 − 100
         (32)   δ = 1−                                 = .0273 .
                                    2, 782

Table 6 shows the values of the different revenue and spending categories that would be in place
under the FairTax with a rate of 23%. It also estimates the necessary spending cut to be $64
billion, which is simply the difference between the spending that would be necessary with a

the non-Social Security spending that would be in place if no cut were needed with a 23.0% rate.

To put this “cut” in perspective, Table 7 displays non-Social Security spending from the CBO for
calendar years 2003 to 2007.23 The CBO expects that non-Social Security spending will increase
by 3.1%, or $65 billion, between calendar year 2006 and 2007. Therefore, the “cut” in this
spending necessary to implement a 23% FairTax rate can be achieved by simply holding nominal
non-Social Security spending almost at its 2006 level.

5. Effect of the FairTax on State and Local Government

One critic of the FairTax has argued that it is unrealistic politically to design the FairTax base to
include a portion of state and local government spending. According to this critic,


23
     Congressional Budget Office, “Budget and Economic Outlook for Fiscal Years 2007 to 2016,” 105.

                                                                                                              Page 21 of 34
        There are several reasons why state and local purchases may not end up in a
        national retail sales tax base. First, although including state and local government
        purchases reduces the required federal tax rate, it does not reduce the overall
        burden on taxpayers. After all, state and local government purchases (and the
        federal sales taxes that would have to be paid on them) are financed by state and
        local government taxes. The tax on state and local purchases may also raise
        constitutional issues. It would certainly be fiercely opposed by the states.24

This reasoning strongly implies that the FairTax simultaneously maintains the real value of
federal government spending and of consumer spending while reducing the real value of state
and local government spending. After all, why else would the states “fiercely resist” the
FairTax? That this reasoning is muddled can be seen in the fact that the real value of state and
local government spending cannot fall unless (1) the real value of federal government and
consumer spending rises or (2) the FairTax brings about a fall in real national income. Because
the author eliminates (1) as a possibility and because there is no reason to expect (2), there is
clearly a slip in logic here. As for constitutional issues, any burden imposed by the FairTax on
state and local government would not differ materially from the burden already imposed under
current law.

An important economic question must be addressed, however: “Would the FairTax impose a
burden on state and local government that would create a political or philosophical barrier to its
adoption?”

In approaching this question, we make three simplifying assumptions. The first is that the
FairTax is adopted without monetary accommodation. This assumption should raise no
objection inasmuch as we have already shown that the degree of monetary accommodation is
irrelevant to the calculation of the FairTax rate or of the real burden that it imposes on consumer
spending; which is to say, on federal government spending, state and local government spending
and on individual spending.

As long as state and local governments raise the same revenue, in real dollars, under the FairTax
as under current law, they will be able to maintain the real value of current spending. The
question is whether that real revenue necessarily falls.

Second, as throughout this article, we assume a purely “static” world, in which adoption of the
FairTax has no effect on economic behavior. In particular, and contrary to what a dynamic
analysis would show, there is no effect on saving.

The third assumption is that the federal government imposes only an income tax and that state
and local governments impose both income and sales taxes. Taxpayers deduct state income
taxes when computing their federal income tax liability. As usual, we use the “07” subscript to
denote baseline values, that are the values given that current law remains in effect, and the “FT”
subscript to denote values under the FairTax. All variables are expressed in terms of constant
dollars.

        C07     personal consumption expenditures;
        G07     federal government purchases; and
        GS07    state and local government purchases.

Let ti designate the effective federal income tax rate, so that ti = ft (1 − sit ) , reflecting the
assumption that the state income tax is deductible from federal income tax. We adopt the
balanced-budget equations for federal government and for state and local government. Then

        (33)    G07 = Y07 ti .

Since after-tax income is fully devoted to gross consumption, C07 (1 + sst ) = Y07 (1 − ti − sit ) ,

which gives
                            1 − ti − sit
        (34)    C07 = Y07                ,
                              1 + sst

                                                 1 − ti − sit
        (35)    GS07 = C07 sst + Y07 sit = Y07                sst + sit ,
                                                   1 + sst
and

        (36)    Y07 = C07 + G07 + GS07 .

We assume that the monetary authorities do not accommodate the adoption of the FairTax,
which is to say that they restrain the growth of the money supply sufficiently to prevent market
prices from rising. As mentioned, this is merely a simplifying assumption. We could just as
well have allowed for monetary accommodation, so that there would be no fall in producer prices
under the FairTax. Doing so, however, would merely have made the algebra more complicated
without changing the results.

Under above-specified assumptions, national income (in both nominal and real terms) under the
FairTax equals national income in 2007:

        (37)    YFT = Y07

and

        (38)    CFT + GFT + GS FT = C07 + G07 + GS07 .

The federal government sets the FairTax rate just high enough to maintain the real value of its
expenditures under current law. Because we have shown that under our assumptions the tax base
for the FairTax would be equal to total consumption under current law, this implies that the (tax-
inclusive) FairTax rate would be ti. Then federal government purchases are

        (39)    GFT = YFT ti = Y07ti = G07 .

Private consumers would receive lower (gross) wages under the FairTax, because producer
prices fall. Since there is no R2 component in this example, the rate by which producer prices fall

                                                                                                Page 23 of 34
is ti. Prices faced by private consumers are also affected, since the state and local sales tax is
imposed on the reduced producer prices.25 Here real consumption equals disposable income
divided by price:

                          Y07 (1 − sit )(1 − ti )
         (40)     CFT =                               ,
                          (1 − ti )(1 + te + sst )
which, after canceling and substituting for te, becomes

                           Y07 (1 − sit )
         (41)     CFT =                   .
                                ti
                          1+        + sst
                             1 − ti
Simplifying,


         (42)     CFT = Y07
                                (1 − sit )
                                1
                                     + sst
                              1 − ti
or


         (43)     CFT = Y07
                              (1 − sit )(1 − ti ) .
                               1 + sst (1 − ti )

State and local government purchases, then, are

         (44)     GS FT = ( CFT sst + Y07 sit )(1 − ti ) .

The (1-ti) term adjusts for the fall in gross income and in consumer prices (net of the FairTax),
given the assumption of no monetary accommodation; with full monetary accommodation this
term would drop out. Substituting equation (43) in (44), we can write

                                  (1 − sit )(1 − ti ) sst + sit 1 − t .
         (45)     GS FT = Y07                                   ( i)
                                   1 + sst (1 − ti )


We now compare state and local government purchases under the FairTax with the same
purchases under current law. Using equations (35) and (45),

                                  (1 − sit )(1 − ti ) sst + sit 1 − t
                            Y07                                 ( i)
                  GS FT            1 + sst (1 − ti )
         (46)           =
                  GS07                    1 − ti − sit
                                    Y07                sst + sit
                                            1 + sst

   Note that in section 3.4 we did not include state and local sales taxes as components of the prices. The reason for
this is that the FairTax is not imposed on top of the state and local sales tax and that for the determination of the
FairTax rate those taxes are not included in the base.

                                    1 + sst (1 − ti )

           Further simplifying,

                     GS FT             ti
           (47)            = 1−                   .
                     GS07       1 + sst (1 − ti )

                                 GS FT
In equation (47) we find that          < 1 , which implies that GS FT < GS07 , and which in turn
                                  GS07
implies that real state and local government spending would decrease under the FairTax, given
that state and local government passively accommodates a transfer of purchasing power to
consumers. Because GFT = G07 , it follows from equation (38) that CFT > C07, which means that
personal consumption increases. Assuming passive accommodation by state and local
government, the decrease in real state and local government spending must be matched by an
equal increase in real personal consumption:

           (48)     CFT − C07 = − ( GS FT − GS07 ) .
or

           (49)     ∆C = −∆GS .26

Thus, although ∆GS is negative, it is matched exactly by ∆C , which is positive. Suppose, for
example, that the federal income tax rate is 20% and that state and local government imposes a
5% sales tax and a 5% income tax, so that ti = 0.19 and sst = 0.05. Then the real value of state
and local government spending will fall by 18.26%. If GS07 = $1 trillion, and the fall in state
and local government spending will equal $182.6 billion, it is matched by an equal rise in
consumer purchasing power. Note that purchasing power is fully transferred to state and local
taxpayers from state and local government.

     Appendix A provides a more detailed proof of this equality.

                                                                                                        Page 25 of 34
To return to the question posed above, the FairTax does not necessarily impose a burden on state
and local government. It would be up to state and local government, under the FairTax, to
decide whether to permit the transfer identified here to take place or to recapture the lost revenue
by raising tax rates or otherwise changing their tax laws. A partial solution would be to take the
simple step of imposing state and local sales taxes on the FairTax-inclusive price of consumer
goods.

At any rate, it is wrong to suggest that the FairTax is a kind of negative-sum game in which at
least one constituency, in this case state and local government, has to lose. It should come as no
surprise that a major restructuring of taxes at the federal level would require state and local
government to make some accommodating restructuring of tax policy at that level, as well. With
that restructuring, all parties – federal, state and local and individual – would remain whole at the
end of the day.

For the determination of the rate in section 3.4 we assume that either: (1) state and local
government accepts this loss in real revenue and the corresponding reduction in real spending
while consumers increase their spending by ∆C or (2) state and local governments keep the real
burden on their taxpayers unchanged by increasing effective tax rates sufficiently to recover the
lost revenue and then use the revenue thus recaptured to maintain their real spending. Although
it makes no difference to our results which assumption holds true, it also follows, as we have
shown, that implementation of the FairTax does not necessarily impose a burden on state and
local government. Only if state and local governments passively accept a real transfer from their
coffers to those of their taxpayers is there a burden.


6. Conclusion
As calculated here, the effective (tax-inclusive) FairTax tax rate that would permit the federal
government to maintain its real expenditures is 23.82%. This real revenue- and real spending-
neutral rate is only slightly higher than the 23.0% rate stipulated in the FairTax legislation.
Indeed, implementing the FairTax at a 23.0% rate would require a modest 2.73% reduction in
real non-Social Security federal spending.
Notwithstanding suggestions to the contrary, implementation of the FairTax, including the
requirement that state and local governments pay the FairTax on their purchases, entails no
reduction in state and local real spending, provided these governments adjust their revenue
collection so as to continue to collect the same real revenues.
Our analysis has made no direct mention of tax evasion, an issue of considerable concern to
FairTax critics notwithstanding (a) the fact that the overwhelming majority of purchases of
goods and services occur in major retail outlets that will surely comply with the FairTax and (b)
the fact that the federal government would be able to concentrate its entire tax enforcement
efforts on a single tax – the FairTax.
But the fact that we have not explicitly considered tax evasion does not mean that we have
ignored it. On the contrary, we have implicitly incorporated a significant degree of tax evasion
in our calculations simply by using National Income and Product Account-based projections of
household consumption expenditures in forming the FairTax tax base (Easton, 2001).
The National Accounts already understate total household consumption because they make no
adjustment for either underground income or the underground consumption it supports. For
example, the National Accounts do not impute the income earned by drug dealers and include it
as part of national income. But the income earned by drug dealers comes by way of an
unrecorded retail commodity sale, which is omitted from the National Accounts measure of
household consumption.
                                                                                           Page 26 of 34
To state the point differently, if our FairTax rate calculations are biased downward due to failure
to incorporate tax evasion, it is not because we are leaving out retail sales that are now
unreported or that we are leaving out other sales that would go unreported, but rather because the
National Accounts recorded sales we assume would be reported will, in fact, not be reported.
This seems highly unlikely given that large retailers would most surely continue to account for
the vast majority of retail sales.27
The extent of potential tax evasion under the FairTax and its implications of the FairTax tax
certainly deserve careful study. However, concern about the omission of tax evasion regarding
this study’s findings must be set against two other omissions that militate in the opposite
direction.
The first is the major capital gain that the federal government stands to accrue if, as seems likely,
the Federal Reserve fully accommodates the introduction of the FairTax and permits consumer
prices to rise by roughly 30%. This would reduce the real value of nominal U.S. government
debt in the hands of the public (many of whom are foreigners) by about $1 trillion. Although
this is a one-time windfall, it is a very large one and could certainly offset a significant amount
of revenue loss from tax evasion, were such losses actually to occur.
The second omission that biases upward our estimate of the real revenue-neutral FairTax tax rate
arises from the partial equilibrium nature of our analysis. Because we have considered no
economic feedback (general equilibrium) effects, we have failed to incorporate the significant
expansion of the FairTax tax base that would, over time, likely arise. Kotlikoff and Rapson
(2006), Kotlikoff and Jokisch (2005), and Tuerck et al. (2006b) document the major
improvement in work and saving incentives and the major potential for enhanced economic
growth associated with the FairTax. These interrelated findings suggest the potential for
significant reductions in the FairTax rate over time for a fixed scale of federal expenditures.
The scale of federal expenditures is, of course, projected to rise sharply over time as the baby
boomers retire and as government-provided healthcare benefits continue to soar. Permitting
federal expenditures to grow at their projected rates spells much higher tax rates regardless of the
tax system in place. But, as documented in Kotlikoff (2005) and many others, it will surely also
spell fiscal insolvency and economic collapse.
The FairTax may be uniquely equipped to restrain the pending explosion in federal spending by
making the fiscal system dramatically more transparent. In particular, the FairTax would focus
national attention on a single tax rate and the proposition that more spending over time means
ever higher values of that tax rate. Thus, anyone in the public or in public service who advocates
higher spending will clearly also be advocating higher taxes, and not for a subset of society, but
for all members of society.

identical in absolute value but with opposite signs. We start with consumption. Using equations

Appendix B: Methodology Used to Estimate 2007 Baseline

Inflating the Base to 2007

 All calculations were completed using the year in which the most recent data were available, in
most cases 2004 or 2005. For those data series for which 2004 data were not available the
numbers were inflated to 2004 using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), or the average growth rate
over the preceding 3 years.

Forecasts from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), “Budget and Economic Outlook for
Fiscal Years 2007 to 2017” were used to obtain estimates for the year 2007. This CBO
publication provides forecasts of several economic indicators and their growth rates from 2005
through 2016, and the growth rates of the CBO projections were used to estimate our data series
from 2004 to 2007.

The CBO estimates of wages and salaries were adjusted down slightly (by 5% in 2005 and 4% in
2006 and 2007) to reflect the negative influence of higher short-term interest rates that already
exist today and should persist through 2007. The CBO estimated that the 3-month Treasury Bill
rate would be 2.8% in 2005 and 4.0% in 2006, while the rate as of November 18, 2005 had
already reached 4%, according to Bloomberg.com.28

The CBO projected growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) served as the default to
estimate each component of the tax bases, unless a CBO forecast of another series proved more
appropriate, or if the behavior of the GDP and the data series indicated an inappropriate match.
In the absence of an appropriate series for estimating the tax base component, the component’s
own growth for the proceeding three to five years was used to forecast to 2007. The table below
contains the components of the four tax bases and the variable or other method used to inflate the
component to 2007. The CBO projections for the 2007 components of federal tax revenue
collections were used to calculate the tax rates for each proposal. The revenue figures were
adjusted to reflect the CBO estimates of total revenue if the 2001 and 2003 tax relief packages do
not expire as scheduled.

Inflating the Rebate, Allowance and Deduction
The prebate for the FairTax was inflated to 2007 using the CBO estimate of CPI to inflate the
Health and Human Services 2004 Poverty level guideline figures. The number of households
was inflated using the United States Census Bureau estimate of population growth from 2004 to
2007 (2.77%). The increase was distributed evenly across all households, assuming that the
composition of households will remain constant between 2004 and 2007.
