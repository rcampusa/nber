Effects of Index-Fund Investing on Commodity Futures Prices

                                              ABSTRACT

The last decade brought substantial increased participation in commodity markets by index funds that
maintain long positions in the near futures contracts. Policy makers and academic studies have reached
sharply different conclusions about the effects of these funds on commodity futures prices. This paper
proposes a unifying framework for examining this question, noting that according to a simple model
of futures arbitrage, if index-fund buying influences prices by changing the risk premium, then the
notional positions of the index investors should help predict excess returns in these contracts. We
find no evidence that the positions of traders in agricultural contracts identified by the CFTC as following
an index strategy can help predict returns on the near futures contracts. We review evidence that these
positions might help predict changes in oil futures prices, and find that while there is some support
for this in the earlier data, this appears to be driven by some of the dramatic features of the 2007-2009
recession, with the relation breaking down out of sample.

1     Introduction

The last decade has seen a phenomenal increased participation by financial investors in com-

modity futures markets. A typical strategy is to take a long position in a near futures contract,

and as the contract nears maturity, sell the position and assume a new long position in the

next contract, with the goal being to create an artificial asset that tracks price changes in the

underlying commodity. Barclays Capital estimated that exchange traded financial products

following such strategies grew from negligible amounts in 2003 to a quarter trillion dollars

by 2008 (Irwin and Sanders (2011)).      Stoll and Whaley (2010) found that in recent years

up to half of the open interest in outstanding agricultural commodity futures contracts was

held by institutions characterized by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)

as commodity index traders.

    This trend has been accompanied by a broad public perception that increased participation

by financial institutions in commodity futures markets has made an important contribution

to the increase in commodity prices observed since 2004. This position has been championed,

for example, by hedge fund manager Michael Masters in testimony before the U.S. Congress

(Masters (2008)) and former Congressional Representative Joseph Kennedy (Kennedy (2012)).

    Surveys of previous academic studies by Irwin and Sanders (2011) and Fattouh, Kilian,

and Mahadeva (forthcoming), as well as our own review in Section 2 below, failed to find much

empirical support for these claims. What accounts for their continued prominence in policy

discussions? Masters (2009) saw the case as simple and clear-cut:


      Buying pressure from Index Speculators overwhelmed selling pressure from pro-



                                               2
     ducers and the result was skyrocketing commodity prices.


   This claim involves two separate links: first, that increased volume on the buy side drives

up the price of a futures contract, and second, that higher futures prices would be sufficient on

their own to produce an increase in spot prices. Possible channels for the second link have been

discussed by Hamilton (2009), Kilian and Murphy (forthcoming), Knittel and Pindyck (2013),

and Sockin and Xiong (2013). In this paper we focus on the first link– by what mechanism

could increased index-fund buying affect the equilibrium price of a futures contract, and how

would we look for evidence of such an effect?

   After reviewing the previous literature in Section 2, we sketch in Section 3 a simple model in

which an increased volume of buy orders could affect futures prices by changing the equilibrium

risk premium. We show that an implication of this framework is that regressions similar to

those run by previous researchers can be a useful way to measure the impact of index-fund

investing on commodity futures prices. We note that according to our theoretical formulation,

it would be the notional positions of the index-fund investors rather than the number of

contracts or related measures that would help predict log returns if index investing were

having a significant effect. In Section 4, we use data on the 12 commodities covered by the

Supplemental Commitment of Traders, and find, consistent with most of the earlier literature,

that index-fund investing seems to have had little impact on futures prices in these markets.

Section 5 examines the evidence on oil markets. We first reproduce some of the findings in

Singleton (forthcoming) that are consistent with the claim that index-fund buying affected

oil futures prices. We then review the criticisms raised by Irwin and Sanders (2012) about

Singleton’s method for inferring the crude oil positions of index-fund traders, and generalize

                                                3
the method to mitigate some of these criticisms. We find that while such measures still fit in

sample, their out-of-sample performance is poor. Our conclusions are summarized in Section

6.




2      Previous literature on the effects of index-fund in-

       vesting on commodity futures prices.

One piece of evidence sometimes viewed as supportive of the view that financial speculation

has played a role in recent commodity price movements is the observation that the correlation

between commodity price changes and other financial returns has increased substantially in

recent years. Tang and Xiong (2012) found this correlation is stronger among commodities

included in the main index funds than for commodities not included, and Buyuksahin and

Robe (2010) and Buyuksahin and Robe (2011) related these correlations specifically to micro

data on positions of different types of commodity traders.      However, as Fattouh, Kilian,

and Mahadeva (forthcoming) noted, the increasing correlation could also be attributed to

an increasing importance of common factors, such as the growing importance of emerging

markets in both commodity markets and global economic activity and the global character of

the financial crisis in 2007-2009, factors to which commodity traders would logically respond.

     Another approach uses structural vector autoregressions.    One common strategy is to

interpret a simultaneous unanticipated rise in prices and commodity inventories as reflecting

speculative demand pressure. Kilian and Murphy (forthcoming) and Kilian and Lee (forth-

coming) concluded that such a model rules out speculative trading as a possible cause of the


                                              4
2003-2008 surge in oil prices. In related work, Lombardi and van Robays (2011) and Juvenal

and Petrella (2011) found only a small role for speculation using alternative specifications. In

addition to sensitivity to specification, there is a fundamental identification challenge in using

these strategies to distinguish a rise in prices and inventories that results from destabilizing

speculation from one that represents a socially optimal response to rationally perceived future

market tightness.1

      A third strand in the literature examines whether changes in commodity futures prices

could be predicted on the basis of the positions of different types of commodity traders. Here

again, the evidence is mostly negative. Brunetti, Buyuksahin, and Harris (2011) used propri-

etary CFTC data over 2005-2009 on daily positions of traders disaggregated into merchants,

manufacturers, floor brokers, swap dealers, and hedge funds. They found that changes in net

positions of any of the groups did not help to predict changes in the prices of futures contracts

for the three commodities they studied (crude oil, natural gas, and corn). Sanders and Irwin

(2011a) used the CFTC’s publicly available Disaggregated Commitment of Traders Report on

weekly net positions of swap dealers, and found these were no help in predicting returns on

14 different commodity futures contracts over 2006-2009.              Sanders and Irwin (2011b) used

proprietary CFTC data to extend the public Supplemental Commitment of Traders (SCOT),

which categorizes certain participants as commodity index traders, back to 2004. They found

that changes in the positions of index traders did not help predict weekly returns for corn

or wheat but found some predictability for soybeans under some specifications.                  Stoll and

Whaley (2010) used the public SCOT for 12 agricultural commodities over 2006-2009 and

                                                     5
found that changes in the long positions of commodity index traders predicted weekly returns

for cotton contracts but none of the other 11 commodities. Alquist and Gervais (2011) used

the public CFTC Commitment of Traders Report to measure net positions of commercial and

non-commercial traders, and found that changes in either category could not predict monthly

changes in oil prices or the futures-spot spread over 2003-2010, though there was statistically

significant predictability when the sample was extended back to 1993.      Irwin and Sanders

(2012) used the CFTC’s Index Investment Data on quarterly positions in 19 commodities

held by commodity index funds. They found in a pooled regression that changes in these po-

sitions did not predict futures returns over 2008-2011. They also separately analyzed whether

changes in futures positions of a particular oil- or gas-specific exchange traded fund could

predict daily returns on those contracts over 2006-2011, and again found no predictability.

Buyuksahin and Harris (2011) used proprietary CFTC data on daily positions broken down

by non-commercials, commercials, swap dealers, hedge funds, and floor broker-dealers. They

found the last category could help predict changes in oil futures prices one day ahead, but

no predictability for any of the other categories or other horizons.   By contrast, Singleton

(forthcoming) found that a variety of measures, including a 13-week change in index-fund

holdings imputed from the SCOT, could help predict weekly and monthly returns on crude

oil futures contracts over September 2006 to January 2010.

   As we will see in Section 3 below, it is possible to motivate regressions similar to these

from a simple model of risk premia in commodity futures contracts. Keynes (1930) proposed

that risk premia in commodity futures prices could arise from the desire of producers of the

physical commodity to hedge their price risk by selling futures contracts. In order to persuade


                                              6
a counterparty to take the other side, the equilibrium price of a futures contract might be

pushed below the expected future spot price to produce a situation sometimes described as

“normal backwardation.” Evidence on backwardation is mixed. Carter, Rausser, and Schmitz

(1983), Chang (1985), Bessembinder (1992), and De Roon, Nijman, and Veld (2000) provided

empirical support for such an interpretation of the risk premium in commodity futures, while

Marcus (1984), Hartzmark (1987), and Kolb (1992) concluded that it does not hold as a

general characterization.

   Cootner (1960) argued more generally that hedging pressure (of which the desire by

Keynes’s producers to sell forward is one example) could lead to expected returns for po-

sitions in futures contracts as a necessary inducement to potential counterparties to take the

other side of the contract from the hedgers.       Applying this idea to recent developments in

commodity futures markets, Brunetti and Reiffen (2011), Acharya, Lochstoer, and Ramado-

rai (forthcoming), Cheng, Kirilenko, and Xiong (2012), and Hamilton and Wu (forthcoming)

proposed that the growing volume of commodity index investors could produce hedging price

pressure on the buy side, with Hamilton and Wu (forthcoming) finding that the average com-

pensation to the long position in oil futures contracts has decreased but become substantially

more volatile since 2005. Etula (forthcoming), Acharya, Lochstoer, and Ramadorai (forth-

coming), Danielsson, Shin, and Zigrand (2011), and Cheng, Kirilenko, and Xiong (2012) have

stressed the role of limited working capital on the part of potential arbitrageurs as the key

factor determining how much the futures price might deviate from the expected future spot

price. In the following section, we follow Hamilton and Wu (forthcoming) in using a simple

quadratic objective function as an approximation to a more detailed model of the capital limi-


                                               7
tations of potential arbitrageurs. Hamilton and Wu (forthcoming) used this framework to infer

risk prices from the predictability of futures returns based on their own lagged values. By

contrast, in this paper we study the relation between futures returns and lagged observations

on the contract positions of commodity-index traders, and show how the framework can be

used to motivate and interpret some simple regression tests of the hypothesis that index-fund

investing has an independent effect on commodity futures prices.




3     Index-fund investors and the price of risk.

Let Fnt denote the price of a commodity associated with an n-period futures contract agreed

upon at date t. Entering such a contract requires maintaining a margin account, to which

funds must be added if the market moves against the trader and from which funds can be

withdrawn if the market moves in the trader’s favor. Following (Duffie, 1992, p. 39), one can

think of the initial margin deposit as funds the trader would have held in that form in any

case. From that perspective, each unit of the commodity purchased through a long position

in the contract is associated with zero initial cost and a cash flow at t + 1 of Fn−1,t+1 − Fnt . If

index-fund buyers want to take the long side of the contract, somebody else must be persuaded

to take the short side. We will refer to the index fund’s counterparty as an “arbitrageur”, and

assume that what the arbitrageur cares about is the mean and variance of their composite

portfolio.   Let znt denote a representative arbitrageur’s notional exposure (with znt > 0

denoting a long position and znt < 0 a short); thus for example znt /Fnt is the number of

barrels of oil purchased through an n-period contract. An arbitrageur who takes a position



                                                 8
znt would experience a cash flow at time t + 1 given by


                                                                  
                                                    Fn−1,t+1 − Fnt
                                          znt                        .                          (1)
                                                          Fnt


In addition to potential positions in a variety of futures contracts, we presume that the arbi-

trageur also invests amounts qjt in assets j = 0, 1, ..., J (where asset j = 0 is presumed to be

risk free). If the gross return for asset j between t and t + 1 is represented as exp(rj,t+1 ), then

the arbitrageur’s wealth at t + 1 will be

                         Wt+1 =         qjt exp(rj,t+1 ) +          znt                  .

We assume that the arbitrageur chooses {q0t , ..., qJt , z1t , ..., znt } so as to maximize



                                    Et (Wt+1 ) − (γ/2)Vart (Wt+1 )                              (2)

commodity futures prices are affine functions of a vector of factors xt ,

                                   rjt = ξ j + ψ 0j xt        j = 1, ..., J,


where the factors themselves can be described using a Gaussian vector autoregression:

Under these assumptions, Hamilton and Wu (forthcoming) showed that

The arbitrageur’s first-order condition associated with the choice of znt is then characterized

by

              αn−1 + β 0n−1 (c + ρxt ) − αn − β 0n xt + (1/2)β 0n−1 ΣΣ0 β n−1 = β 0n−1 λt                                   (7)


where λt depends on the positions that arbitrageurs take in the various contracts according

to
                                                     J                 N
                                                                                         !
                                                     X                 X
                                 λt = γΣΣ0                 qjt ψ j +         z`t β `−1       .                              (8)
                                                     j=1               `=1


If we further conjecture that in equilibrium these positions are also affine functions of the

underlying factors,

                                                    λt = λ + Λxt ,                                                          (9)


then equations (7) and (9) turn out to imply a recursion that the commodity-futures loadings

αn and β n would satisfy that are very similar to those used in affine models of the term



                                                            10
structure of interest rates (e.g., Ang and Piazzesi (2003)).

   The term λt allows the possibility of nonzero expected returns in equilibrium and is often

referred to as the price of risk. If arbitrageurs are risk neutral, then γ and λt in (8) are both 0

and (7) implies that the expected net gain from any futures position (1) is always zero. More

generally, with nonzero γ, equation (8) describes how changes in arbitrageurs’ risk exposure

coming from changes in qjt or z`t would be associated with changes in expected returns. In

particular, consider the effects of an exogenous increase in index-fund buying pressure on the

nth contract.    In equilibrium, prices must be such as to persuade arbitrageurs to take the

opposite side, that is, the values of αn and β n, must be such that (7) holds for znt given by

the necessary negative magnitude.      Higher buying must be matched by more negative values

for znt which change the risk premium in (7) through (8).

   Hamilton and Wu (forthcoming) estimated values of the structural parameters of this

system (c, ρ, Σ, λ, Λ) by inferring factors indirectly from the observed time-series properties of

oil futures prices.   By contrast, in this paper we propose to use direct observations on the

positions of index-fund investors.     Note that we can substitute (4), (3) and (9) into (7) to

deduce

                            fn−1,t+1 − fnt = κn−1 + π 0n−1 xt + εn−1,t+1                        (10)


where the theory predicts κn−1 = β 0n−1 λ − (1/2)β 0n−1 ΣΣ0 β n−1 , π 0n−1 = β 0n−1 Λ, and εn−1,t+1 =

β 0n−1 Σut+1 . Thus a core implication of this model of risk aversion is a linear relation between

the expected log returns and the notional positions znt of arbitrageurs in commodity futures

contracts. Note that if arbitrageurs are risk neutral (γ = 0), then we should find π n−1 = 0. On

the other hand, risk-averse arbitrageurs would require compensation for taking the opposite

                                                 11
position from index-fund buyers. If index funds are long, arbitrageurs are short, and expect

subsequently to close their futures positions at a lower price than the initial contract. This

would imply a negative coefficient on the element of xt corresponding to a measure of the

level of index-fund buying– if index buying makes the price of a futures contract higher than

it would otherwise be, the expected excess return for a long position on that contract would

be negative.   The framework thus provides a motivation and interpretation for regressions

similar to those reviewed in Section 2.

   As a simple example, suppose that t represents months and index-fund investors always

desire a long position with notional exposure Kt in the 2-month contract, selling their position

as the month comes to a close in order to take a position Kt+1 in the new 2-month contract.

Then prices must be such that in equilibrium,

                                           
                                           
                                            −Kt
                                                       if n = 2
                                   znt =                            .
                                           
                                           
                                              0        otherwise


In the absence of other risk factors, we would then from (8) have the following simple expression

determining the price of commodity-futures risk:



                                        λt = −γΣΣ0 β 1 Kt .                                   (11)



If we postulate an additional vector of factors x∗t that matter for commodity price fundamentals

in determining the value of f0t , then the complete vector of factors is given by xt = (Kt , x∗t )0

and we have that fnt = αn + β 0n xt , with futures prices a function of both fundamentals x∗t and



                                                   12
index-fund buying Kt .2 If we were to rule out feedback from futures prices to fundamentals

through mechanisms investigated by Knittel and Pindyck (2013), and Sockin and Xiong (2013),

the first element of β 0 would be zero but the first element of β n would generally be nonzero

for all n > 0.3

       In principle, performing the regression (10) would require observation on the demands for

futures contracts coming from all the arbitrageurs’ counterparties, which would include not

just index-fund traders but also commercial hedgers, as well as all other factors influencing

risk of any other assets held by arbitrageurs.              There is nonetheless a robust implication of

the reduced-form equation (10). Unless the positions of commercial hedgers and index-fund

traders are perfectly negatively correlated, the positions of index-fund traders will be correlated

with the net buying pressure facing arbitrageurs. If the latter is exerting a significant effect

on the pricing of futures contracts, we should find a nonzero coefficient on π n−1 in (10) when

xt is based on observable measures of the notional positions taken by index-fund traders. We

look for empirical evidence of such an effect in the next section.
   2
       In the particular example (11) as well as many instances of the general model (7)-(9), the factors xt would
be spanned by the set of commodity futures and asset prices. However, our empirical specification (10) is also
appropriate for the more general case of unspanned factors. The regression (12) looks for a relation between
an excess return between dates t and t + 1 and an observable variable at date t that is not constructed directly
from date t prices.
     3
       In the above example in which index funds want only the 2-month contract at time t, an arbitrageur who
shorts this contract is exposed to the complete vector of factor risks associated with this contract through
β 01 xt+1 , including for example fundamentals uncertainty about the price of the underlying commodity. As-
suming these fundamentals are positively serially correlated, if there was zero expected return associated with
a 1-period contract purchased at t, an arbitrageur would want to be long this contract to hedge some of the
risk associated with being short the 2-period contract. Since there is no one to take the other side of this
1-period contract, equilibrium then requires a negative expected return on a 1-period contract purchased at t
just as on a 2-period contract purchased at t. For details see Hamilton and Wu (forthcoming).

4         Predicting futures returns for agricultural commodi-

          ties.

For 12 agricultural commodities, since 2006 the CFTC has been providing through its Sup-

plemental Commitments of Traders Report weekly positions for traders it characterizes as

“replicating a commodity index by establishing long futures positions in the component mar-

kets and then rolling those positions forward from future to future using a fixed methodology”

(CFTC (2012)). While some of these index traders are pension funds or other managed funds

taking a direct position in futures contracts, the majority represent positions by swap deal-

ers, who offer their clients an over-the-counter product that mimics some futures-based index

(Stoll and Whaley (2010)). The swap dealers are thus implicitly short in futures agreements

arranged over-the-counter, and hedge with an offsetting long position on organized exchanges

that get reported to the CFTC. While the CFTC designations are not without some problems

(Cheng, Kirilenko, and Xiong (2012), Stoll and Whaley (2010)), these appear to be the best

high-frequency data that are publicly available for our purposes.

        The SCOT is released on a Friday and reflects positions as of the preceding Tuesday. Let t

denote a week ending on a particular Tuesday and Xt the long positions (measured in number

of contracts) being held by commodity index traders as identified by SCOT. Let Ft denote

the price of the near contract as of the market close on the day for which SCOT reports Xt .4
    4
     Daily     futures    prices     were       purchased      from      Norma’s       Historical      Data
(http://www.normashistoricaldata.com/).     For a few days in our sample, SCOT data are reported for
days on which we have no closing futures prices. For these observations, we used the futures price as of the
following day.




                                                    14
If this is the contract being held by a typical index trader, then



                                           x̃t = 100(ln Xt + ln Ft )



would correspond to the log of index traders’ notional exposure.5

       Our interest centers on the predictability of rt , the weekly return of a given contract.6

The first two rows within each block of Table 1 report coefficients and standard errors for the

following regression estimated for t running from April 11, 2006 to January 3, 2012:



                                      rt = α1 + φ1 rt−1 + π 1 x̃t−1 + ε1t .                                   (12)



The coefficient estimates φ̂1 and π̂ 1 are not statistically significantly different from zero for

any of the 12 commodities for which index trader positions are reported, and adjusted R2

for these regressions are usually negative. This result is consistent with the large number of

previous studies discussed in Section 2 that have found limited predictability of commodity

futures returns using related regressions.

       Equations (4) and (10) can be viewed as the central implications of the model of risk pricing

sketched in Section 3. Given observed data on futures prices and xt , it is straightforward

to estimate the unrestricted reduced form implications of these models using ordinary least
   5
      Note that Xt is measured in number of contracts, so that the true measure of notional exposure would
further multiply Xt by the number of barrels of oil in a single contract. This would simply add a constant to
x̃t and would have no effect on the slope coefficients in any of the regressions reported in this section, so we
have always used the simpler expression given in the text.
    6
      For most weeks, rt is just 100(ft − ft−1 ) where ft = ln(Ft ) the log of the price of the nearest contract. In
other words, rt is the percent change in price of the near contract. In the case when the near contract as of
date t − 1 had expired as of date t, we took rt to be 100 times the change between ft and the log of the price
of that same contract as of t − 1 (at which date it was the second available contract).



                                                        15
squares. These coefficients could then be used to infer values for the parameters (c, ρ, Σ, λ, Λ)

of the structural model using methods described by Hamilton and Wu (2012) and Hamilton

and Wu (forthcoming), and in fact this simple, intuitive approach to estimation turns out to

be asymptotically equivalent to full information maximum likelihood estimation of the model.

However, when the key reduced-form parameters φ and π are statistically indistinguishable

from zero, one would have little confidence in any values for the risk-pricing parameters in

Λ that one might infer from the data, and for this reason we have chosen not to try to go

beyond the simple reduced-form estimates reported here.             Our conclusion is that although

in principle index-fund buying of commodity futures could influence pricing of risk, we do

not find confirmation of that in the week-to-week variability of the notional value of reported

commodity index trader positions.

   If the factors governing the price of risk are stationary, the dependent variable in (12)

would be stationary, in which case one might prefer to use the weekly change in index-trader

notional positions rather than the level as the explanatory variable.          The third and fourth

rows of each block in Table 1 report OLS coefficient estimates and standard errors for the

regression

                            rt = α2 + φ2 rt−1 + π 2 (x̃t−1 − x̃t−2 ) + ε2t .                   (13)


The coefficients on the change in index notional positions turn out to be statistically signif-

icant at the 5% level for cotton and almost statistically significant for sugar. However, the

coefficients are of opposite signs, and neither φ̂ nor π̂ are statistically significantly different

from zero for any of the other 10 commodities. We again conclude that there appears to be

very little indication in the data that changes in positions of index traders can help explain

                                                  16
risk premia in commodity futures prices.

   Singleton (forthcoming) has recently suggested that investment flows may matter over

longer periods than a week, and instead bases his analysis of crude oil futures returns on the

change in notional positions over a 3-month period. The fifth and sixth rows of each block in

Table 1 report coefficient estimates and standard errors for our 12 agricultural commodities in

which the predictive variable is the lagged 13-week change in the commodity index notional

position:

                          rt = α3 + φ3 rt−1 + π 3 (x̃t−1 − x̃t−14 ) + ε3t .               (14)


None of the 24 estimated slope coefficients is statistically distinguishable from zero.     To

summarize, we find no persuasive evidence that either the level, weekly change, or 13-week

change in index-trader positions is related to the risk premium in agricultural commodities.

   Finally, we report some simple evidence that is robust with respect to any problems in

measuring the volume of index buying itself and makes use of higher-frequency features of

the data.   The two main indexes that buyers seek to track are the S&P-Goldman Sachs

Commodity Index and the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index. Each of these has a defined

calendar schedule at which a near contract is sold and the next contract is purchased. The

Goldman strategy begins the roll into the next contract on the 5th business day of the month

and is completed on the 9th, whereas the Dow Jones strategy begins the roll on the 6th and

ends on the 10th. It is simple enough to ask whether there is anything special about price

movements on these particular days.

   We calculated the daily return on the near contract rτ = 100(fτ − fτ −1 ) where τ now




                                                 17
indexes business days, and estimated the OLS regression



                                         rτ = α4 + π 4 Sτ + ε4τ .                          (15)



Here Sτ = 1 if both (1) τ is the 5th through the 10th business day of the month and (2)

the Goldman and Dow Jones strategies would be selling the near contract during that period;

otherwise, Sτ = 0. In the case of crude oil, for which a new contract exists every month, Sτ is

a simple calendar dummy tracking the 5th through 10th business days of the month. For all

other commodities, some months are not traded; for example, there is no February contract

in soybeans. Thus as of the beginning of January, the near soybean contract would be the

March contract. The index funds would not be selling their soybean position during January,

so Sτ would remain zero for soybeans throughout the month of January. Note that the OLS

estimate π̂ 4 is thus numerically equal to the difference between the average daily return from

a long position on the near contract that is sold on days when the index funds are selling that

contract compared to the return on the near contract on non-roll days. Moreover, because

the average return over 6 days is numerically identical to (1/6) times the 6-day return,


                                       N
                                       X
                                  −1
                              N              rτ +n = (100/N )(fτ +N − fτ ),
                                       n=1



one can equivalently interpret regression (15) as indicating the average result if one buys the

near contract on the day before the index funds begin to sell and sells on the day when the

funds are finished selling their positions.

   Columns 1 and 2 of Table 2 report coefficient estimates and standard errors for (15) fit to

                                                      18
daily returns on the near contract for the commodities we analyze.          We find a statistically

significantly value for π̂ 4 for only 1 of the 12 agricultural commodities (soybeans), and this is

of the opposite sign predicted by the simple price impact hypothesis– if index-fund selling is

depressing the price on roll days, one would expect the price of the near contract to fall rather

than rise on those days.

   Columns 3 and 4 of Table 2 report results for the analogous regressions using the next

contract. Here only 2 of the estimated coefficients (namely, those for soybeans and hogs) are

statistically significantly different from zero.    And while these are of the predicted sign (a

positive coefficient consistent with the claim that index buying of the next contract is pushing

the price of the contract up), note that for beans a statistically significant positive coefficient

was found for both the near contract that funds are selling (column 2) as well as the next

contract that funds are buying (column 4).

   Finally, in columns 5 and 6 we report results when the dependent variable is the return on

the next contract minus the return on the near. Here π 4 can be interpreted as the average

excess returns for someone who is simultaneously buying the next contract and selling the

near. For soybean oil and cotton we find a statistically significant negative value for π 4 and

for hogs we find a statistically significant positive value.

   Aulerich, Irwin, and Garcia (2013) suggested that the roll period itself might be too narrow

to capture all the effects. In Table 3 we repeat the analysis in which Sτ = 1 if both (1) τ

is the 1st through the 10th business day of the month and (2) the Goldman and Dow Jones

strategies would be selling the near contract during that period. For this specification, none of

the coefficients on Sτ are statistically significant for any of the individual agricultural contracts


                                                   19
(columns 2 and 4 of Table 3), and there is only one statistically significant difference between

the coefficients on the first two contracts (cotton in column 6).

    Other studies have also looked for price patterns associated with the roll window, and have

reported mixed results. Mou (2010) used a window beginning 5 to 10 days before the roll and

pooled across commodities to find statistically significant results.   Bessembinder, Carrion,

Tuttle, and Venkataraman (2012) found price effects that were usually reversed within 15

minutes, while Stoll and Whaley (2010) found little impact of the roll. Brunetti and Reiffen

(2011) reported that higher index-fund positions raised the return on the second versus the

near contract during the roll periods, while Aulerich, Irwin, and Garcia (2013) found the

opposite effect.

    We conclude that for our sample period and data set, any effects associated with the roll

window are too small to show up in simple summary regressions. Our overall conclusion seems

to be a robust summary of this data set– changes in the futures positions of commodity-index

funds are not associated with significant changes in the expected returns for their counterpar-

ties.




5       Predicting returns for crude oil contracts.

Although there appears to be limited relation between commodity index positions and agricul-

tural futures returns, Singleton (forthcoming) reported that a number of interesting variables

appear to help predict returns on crude oil futures contracts. Our interest in this paper is

the strong predictive power he found for a measure of holdings by index-fund traders in crude



                                              20
oil futures contracts.

       The CFTC does not report a weekly estimate of index-fund positions in crude oil. Single-

ton’s approach was to use an idea suggested by Masters (2008).                 Masters claimed that the

vast majority of index-fund buyers were following one of two strategies, trying to track either

the S&P-Goldman Sachs Commodity Index or the Dow Jones-UBS (formerly Dow Jones-AIG)

Commodity Index. Each of these would take positions in a particular set of commodities and

roll them over according to a prespecified calendar schedule. Let X̃it be the notional value

of contracts in agricultural commodity i reported by SCOT to have been held by index-fund

traders on date t, that is, X̃it = Xit Fit Qi for Xit the number of contracts held by index-fund

traders, Fit the futures price, and Qi the number of units of the commodity held by a single

contract.7 Suppose we assume that this is composed entirely of either traders following the

Goldman strategy, whose notional holdings we denote by X̃itG , or traders following the Dow

Jones strategy (X̃itD ):

                                            X̃it = X̃itG + X̃itD .


Masters (2008) noted that while the Dow Jones index holds soybean oil, the Goldman index

does not, in which case

                                                          D
                                         X̃bean oil,t = X̃bean oil,t .



We further know that the total notional exposure X̃tD of funds replicating the Dow Jones

index would be allocated across the commodities according to known weights δ D   8
                                                                             it , so that

   7
     Note that this is a slight change in notation from the previous sections, where we instead measured X̃it
as just Xit Fit . As noted in footnote 5, the slope coefficients in the previous section would be numerically
identical regardless of which convention is used, but the added term Qi needs to be included for the Masters-
type calculations used in this section.

     We thank Dow Jones for providing us with historical values for the weights δ Dit .



                                                     21
X̃itD = δ D    D
          it X̃t . Hence one could use the SCOT bean oil figures to infer the total notional


holdings of Dow Jones investors, X̃tD = X̃bean oil,t /δ D
                                                        bean oil,t ,and from this impute holdings of


Dow Jones investors in crude oil contracts on the basis of SCOT reported holdings of soybean

oil:
                                     D,[bean oil]
                                  X̃crude oil,t = δ D                           D
                                                    crude oil,t X̃bean oil,t /δ bean oil,t .



 We have added the superscript [bean oil] to this estimate of crude oil notional holdings to

clarify that the underlying SCOT data from which it is derived in fact describe soybean

oil holdings rather than crude oil.                 Similarly, the Goldman index holds Kansas City wheat

whereas Dow Jones does not, giving an estimate of Goldman holdings of crude oil contracts:9


                                  G,[KC wheat]
                               X̃crude oil,t       = δG                           G
                                                      crude oil,t X̃KC wheat,t /δ KC wheat,t .            (16)



The Goldman index also holds feeder cattle which Dow Jones does not, affording an alternative

estimate
                              G,[feeder cattle]
                            X̃crude oil,t         = δG                                G
                                                     crude oil,t X̃feeder cattle,t /δ feeder cattle,t .   (17)


Masters proposed to use the average of (16) and (17) as an estimate of Goldman crude oil

contract holdings. The sum of the oil holdings imputed to these two funds is then his estimate

of total index-fund holdings of crude oil contracts:

   Figure 1 plots the number of contracts associated with this value for X̃crude oil,t against the

price of crude oil based on the near contract, updating similar figures in Masters (2008) and

Singleton (forthcoming). The figure suggests a strong connection between these two series,

particularly during 2008 and 2009.

   We repeated our basic regressions (12)-(14) for rt now the weekly return on the near
                                                  [Masters]
crude oil futures contract and x̃t = 100 ln X̃crude oil,t . These results are reported in the first

block of Table 4.     Both the levels and weekly-difference regression results are similar to
                                                                  2
those for agricultural commodities, with negative values for R and statistically insignificant

coefficients.

   We also find using daily data (last rows of Table 2) no evidence of excess returns from

buying the near or next crude oil contract during the period in which many index traders are

rolling contracts.   We do find statistically significant coefficients when a 10-day window is

used (last rows of Table 3), though the fact that there is the same negative coefficient on the

first and second contracts is again inconsistent with the claim that this correlation arises as a

consequence of index funds selling the near contract and buying the next.

   In contrast to the broad lack of evidence of an effect of commodity-index investing based

on the tests reported so far, the last row of the first block of Table 4 reproduces Singleton’s
                                      [Masters]
finding that the 13-week change in X̃crude oil,t appears to be quite helpful for predicting changes

in crude oil futures prices. Since the use of a 13-week window appears to increase the variable’s

predictive power for oil returns but not for any of the other 12 commodities, we were curious




                                                  23
to look at the performance of the oil regression across all possible window choices:



                             rt = αn + φn rt−1 + π n (x̃t−1 − x̃t−1−n ) + εnt .

Figure 2 plots the adjusted R2 for each possible choice of n between 1 and 26. The biggest R

turns out to be obtained by setting n = 12, close to the value n = 13 proposed by Singleton.

   Irwin and Sanders (2012) have recently raised several strong criticisms of using X̃crude oil,t

as a measure of index-fund positions in crude oil futures. Irwin and Sanders noted first that
                                                           G,[KC wheat]               G,[feeder cattle]
although for some dates the two measures X̃crude oil,t                         and X̃crude oil,t          are reasonably close,

for other dates they can differ greatly. In terms of this concern, we would point out that in

fact there is no need to restrict the inference as Masters did only to commodities that appear

in one of the indexes but not the other. Note that the central claim is that



                                                X̃it = δ G    G     D D

where X̃it , δ G          D

modities i and j, one can use the two equations in (19) to solve for the implied total holdings

of the two indexes, X̃tG and X̃tD . Hence for any two arbitrary agricultural commodities i and

j there exists a Masters-type estimate of crude oil holdings:

   To illustrate the variability of such measures, we calculated (20) where j = soybean oil

indeed appear to be fairly sensitive to the choice of i.

   One way to deal with this issue is to generalize Masters’ averaging idea.                                           There’s no

reason in fact not to use all 12 agricultural commodities together, choosing X̃tG and X̃tD so

as to minimize the sum of squared discrepancies in predicting the SCOT reported value for

X̃it across the 12 commodities. This amounts to treating the collection of equations (19) for

i = 1, ..., 12 and for a given t as a sample of size 12 in which the dependent variable is X̃it and

   We repeated our predictive regressions using X̃crude oil,t in place of X̃crude oil,t in the second

but there is significant predictability from the 13-week change in X̃crude oil,t . Interestingly, we

found the same is true for every one of the bivariate estimates plotted in Figure 3: the 13-week

change in crude oil index-trader positions, inferred from soybean oil and any other arbitrary

agricultural commodity, appear to help predict crude oil returns.

   A second concern that Irwin and Sanders (2012) raised about Masters’ methodology is that

the index oil holdings as imputed from agricultural commodity positions are quite different


                                                                      25
from direct estimates of crude oil positions that the CFTC reports in its new Index Investment

Data report. Unfortunately, the Index Investment Data report is only available at a quarterly

frequency and for a shorter period than SCOT, so is not usable for the kind of regressions

we’re interested in here.   However, it is puzzling that agricultural positions cannot predict

agricultural prices but do predict crude oil prices, and that a direct measure of crude oil

index holding would do a poorer job at predicting oil prices than does an index imputed from

agricultural holdings.

   One way to shed further light on these issues is to investigate whether the in-sample success

of the oil regression (14) translates into useful out-of-sample forecasts.      Since Singleton’s

paper was first circulated we have obtained an additional 2 years of data, which allow us to

see whether the 13-week change has predictive power outside of the sample for which it was

originally proposed.     We estimated regression (14) for a sample ending January 12, 2010,

which was the end date for Singleton’s analysis.       If we use those coefficients to predict oil

returns over January 17, 2010 through January 3, 2012, the out-of-sample mean squared error

is 24.01. That compares with an out-of-sample MSE of 21.97 if we had instead simply always

forecast rt = 0 (see the first row of Table 5).

   Note that the above calculations represent a true out-of-sample evaluation, namely, a

calculation of how well a proposed empirical relation describes data that came in after the

initial study has been released.     It is in this sense a more meaningful exercise than the

pseudo out-of-sample evaluations that are popularly reported.         Hansen and Timmermann

(2013) demonstrate that the popular practice of calculating an “out-of-sample” MSE of a

set of recursive regressions that end at all points between some sample dates T0 and T is


                                                  26
asymptotically equivalent to looking at the difference between two simple Wald tests, the first

statistic using just the subsample of observations from 1 to T0 and the second statistic using

all data from 1 to T. If our goal is to evaluate whether a variable belongs in a forecasting

relation or to test whether the regression relation is stable, there are a number of alternative

tests that are much more appropriate than these artificial “out-of-sample” forecast evaluation

exercises. For example, making efficient use of the full sample of data from April 11, 2006

to January 3, 2012, the Bai and Perron (1998) test leads to the conclusion that there are two

structural breaks10 in the oil return regression (14) dated at September 30, 2008 and January

13, 2009– both inside the original Singleton sample of data. The coefficient on x̃t−1 − x̃t−14 is

positive over the 2006-2008 subsample, as it was found to be in Singleton’s regressions and in

our regressions using the full sample of observations from 2006 to 2012 as well as the 2006-2010

regression in row 1 of Table 5. However, when estimated with the two indicated break points,

the coefficient turns out to be negative over both the second and third subsamples, with a t

statistic of −0.75 for data from January 30, 2009 through January 3, 2012. The correlation

identified by Singleton thus has no success at describing data since his paper was written, and

indeed seems not to have captured a stable predictive relation even within the sample that he

analyzed.

       Returning to Figure 1, the striking feature of the Masters indicator is that it collapses

as the recession worsened in 2008 but began to rebound sharply before the recovery began,

key movements that precede equally dramatic parallel moves in oil prices. The close fit over
  10
    This is based on evaluation of the sequential F test in Bai and Perron (1998) Table II imposing the
restriction that breaks must be separated by at least 5% of the sample size (in this case, 15 observations) and
that the maximum number of breaks is m = 4. The identical conclusion of 2 structural breaks emerges from
application of the Schwarz (1978) criterion.

Singleton’s original sample period thus seems to result from the broad comovement of the

series during the first phase of the Great Recession. It’s interesting to note that if we replace

rt in expression (14) with the weekly return on the U.S. S&P500 stock price index, but with

the second explanatory variable still 100[ln X̃crude oil,t−1 − X̃crude oil,t−14 ], for a sample that ends

at Singleton’s January 2010 endpoint, the Masters variable would also appear to be positive

and statistically significant (see the last rows of Table 5). In other words, if we used only data

from the recession, we would conclude that index-trader positions in soybean oil, Kansas City

wheat, and feeder cattle could also be used to predict stock prices. Once again, however, a

relation estimated over this period has a bigger out-of-sample MSE than the simple no-change

forecast.11




6      Conclusion.

The increased participation by financial investors in commodity futures markets over the last

decade has been quite substantial. In principle this could have influenced the risk premium,

and Hamilton and Wu (forthcoming) found significant changes in the behavior of the risk

premium on oil futures contracts before and after 2005.                  In this paper we studied data

since 2006 to look for a systematic relation between the notional value of commodity futures

contracts held on behalf of index-fund investors and expected returns on futures contracts.

We found essentially no relation for the 12 agricultural commodities for which the CFTC
  11
    A referee notes that if x̃t − x̃t−13 were indeed capturing the market pricing kernel, then according to the
theory sketched in Section 3 it should also help predict returns on all assets. To us a more natural reading of
the above results is that the magnitude never had any true ability to predict returns on oil contracts or any
other asset, but instead is just a constructed variable whose movements for a brief period turned out to be in
the same direction as other important market developments.



                                                      28
reports such positions. We reviewed evidence that positions in crude oil contracts imputed

from the reported agricultural holdings could help predict crude oil futures returns, and noted

that the methodology for such imputation could be generalized to make use of all the available

data. We confirmed that these imputed holdings appear to help predict crude oil returns over

2006-2009, though this is closely related to the dynamics of index investing during the Great

Recession, and indeed the same imputed holdings also appear to predict stock returns over

that period. We found, however, that both relations broke down when trying to describe the

data since 2009.

   Our overall conclusion is thus consistent with most of the previous literature– there seems

to be little evidence that index-fund investing is exerting a measurable effect on commodity

futures prices. As noted in the introduction, even if one could demonstrate an effect of index-

fund buying on commodity futures prices, it would be a separate challenge to explain how

this could also end up changing the equilibrium spot price. We conclude that it is difficult

to find much empirical foundation for a view that continues to have a significant impact on

policy decisions.
