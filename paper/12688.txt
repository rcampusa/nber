                                              ABSTRACT

We explore the proposition that expected longevity affects retirement decisions and accumulated wealth
using micro data drawn from the Health and Retirement Study for the United States. We use data on
a person's subjective probability of survival to age 75 as a proxy for their prospective lifespan. In order
to control for the presence of measurement error and focal points in responses, as well as reverse causality,
we instrument subjective survival probabilities using information on current age, or age at death, of
the respondent's parents. Our estimates indicate that increased subjective probabilities of survival result
in increased household wealth among couples, with no effect on the length of the working life. These
findings are consistent with the view that retirement decisions are driven by institutional constraints
and incentives and that a longer expected lifespan leads to increased wealth accumulation.

                  The Effect of Subjective Survival Probabilities
                  on Retirement and Wealth in the United States


         David E. Bloom, David Canning, Michael Moore, and Younghwan Song




The lifecycle model of savings is among the best-established constructs in the field of

economics. According to this model, people save during their prime working years to

finance their consumption during retirement. Although the main predictions of this theory

are well-supported empirically, pure lifecycle models are not naturally suited to

explaining sharp increases in savings rates at all ages, such as those observed in East Asia

between 1950 and 1990 (see Deaton 1992 for Thailand and Deaton and Paxson 1994,

1997, 2000 for Taiwan).2

       Lee, Mason and Miller (1998, 2000) hypothesize that the need to finance a longer

period of retirement can account for an upward shift in the age-savings profile. They

simulate for Taiwan a lifecycle model with a fixed retirement age to demonstrate that

rapidly improving life expectancy can account for a rise in savings at all ages and a

concomitant surge in the rate of national savings. Tsai, Chu and Chung (2000) show that

the timing of the rise in household savings in Taiwan coincides closely with the increases

in life expectancy of the population.

       Bloom, Canning and Graham (2003) construct a model of aggregate savings that

includes life expectancy as an argument and estimate the parameters of the model using

over 20 percent in the 1980s and 1990s.
cross-country panel data. Their findings suggest that increases in life expectancy play a

large role in savings behavior and can account for the observed savings boom in East

Asia. Although such an effect is plausible given strong disincentives for the delay of

retirement, Deaton and Paxson (2000) argue that in a flexible economy, without

mandatory retirement, a rise in longevity will primarily affect the span of the working

life, not the rate of savings. Bloom, Canning and Moore (2004) formalize this argument

to show that under reasonable assumptions the optimal response to an improvement in

health and a rise in life expectancy is to increase the length of working life, though less

than proportionately, with no need to raise savings rates at all (due to the gains derived

from compound interest over a longer life span).3 This result implies that the institutional

features of retirement systems, such as mandatory retirement that prevents workers from

lengthening their working lives, drive the positive effect of longevity on savings found in

cross-country studies.4 To examine this issue, Bloom et al. (2007) construct a model in

which retirement and savings decisions are jointly determined and in which variations in

health status, expected longevity, and features of the Social Security system are allowed

to influence retirement and savings behavior. Their empirical results indicate that longer

   Kalemli-Ozcan and Weil (2005) develop a model that examines the effect of declining
uncertainty about age at death on the number of years spent in retirement at the end of the
lifecycle. For an overlapping-generations model that highlights the effect of longevity on
retirement and the accumulation of cohort-specific schooling capital, see Boucekkine, de la Croix
and Licandro (2002). For a general-equilibrium overlapping-generations model that highlights the
effect of longevity on both retirement and savings, see Kulish, Smith and Kent (2006).
4
  According to Gruber and Wise (1998) and Blondal and Scarpetta (1997), social security systems
in many countries offer individuals strong financial incentives to retire at particular ages. These
studies also provide evidence that workers respond by retiring earlier than they would in the
absence of these incentives.

life expectancy increases savings in countries with mandatory retirement, but has little

effect on savings in countries where incentives for retirement are close to age-neutral.5

        This paper examines these ideas using microdata drawn from the Health and

Retirement Study (HRS) for the United States. The HRS provides data on labor supply

and household wealth and a rich set of controls for a large representative sample of

individuals aged 51–61 in 1992 who were followed through 2004. The HRS is ideally

suited to our study because it includes information on respondents’ subjective

probabilities of survival. We analyze the validity of this variable as a proxy for life

expectancy and use information on the current ages or the ages at death of respondents’

parents as instruments to correct for the presence of classical measurement error, focal

points in responses and possible reverse causality.

        In the following section we describe the nature and configuration of the HRS data

and summarize previous studies of the information content of key HRS variables. Next

we motivate our instrumental-variables estimators by focusing on the validity of the

subjective survival probabilities. Then we report and discuss our IV probit estimates of

the determinants of retirement and our IV estimates of the determinants of wealth, with

the subjective survival probability being the main determinant of interest. In the final

section we summarize our results and discuss their policy implications.




5
  There is one other potential explanation for an effect of longer life expectancy on wealth
accumulation but not age at retirement: if the years of life gained are not healthy ones, age at
retirement will tend to be stable and an increase in lifecycle savings will be needed to finance
consumption during a longer period of ‘physiologically forced’ retirement. Recent evidence for
the US tends to counter this explanation, supporting the Fries (1980) conjecture of a ‘compression
of morbidity’ whereby the duration of time spent in chronic ill health toward the end of life has
declined—in relative, and possibly also absolute—terms (see Fries 1989; Crimmins, Saito and
Ingegneri 1997; Costa 2002; Crimmins 2004; and Mor 2005).


                                                3
                                              Data

To investigate the effects of expected longevity on retirement and wealth, we use data

drawn from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS is a nationally

representative panel survey of noninstitutionalized individuals aged 51–61 in 1992 and

their spouses or partners, whose ages can fall outside this range. The first wave of the

HRS consists of 12,652 individuals. The HRS collects extensive information about the

retirement, health and economic well-being of the respondents. After the initial wave of

interviews in 1992, subsequent waves of interviews were fielded biennially. We use the

RAND HRS data file, which is a cleaned and streamlined version of the HRS that

includes some additional derived variables.

        As a proxy for expected longevity, we use the subjective survival probability

available in the HRS.6 In the first wave of interviews in 1992, 12 questions in the HRS

asked for subjective probabilities about future events. They include the following two

questions about surviving to the target ages of 75 and 85: ‘Using any number from zero

to ten where 0 equals absolutely no chance and 10 equals absolutely certain, what do you

think are the chances you will live to be 75 or more?’ ‘85 or more?’7 At the aggregate




6
  In an early economic study of the information content of subjective survival probabilities,
Hamermesh (1985) reports evidence that individuals’ subjective survival probabilities are
reasonably consistent with actuarial evidence on those probabilities and strongly correlated with
the longevity of their parents and grandparents. Hamermesh derives evidence from two survey
data sets: one consisting of 411 male economists ranging in age from 26 to 65, and the other
consisting of 363 males between ages 20 and 70 who resided in a medium-sized standard
metropolitan statistical area in the Midwestern part of the US. In another analysis of the same
data sets, Hamermesh and Hamermesh (1983) report that subjective survival probabilities are
reflective of individual-specific information on smoking and obesity, but not exercise.
7
  The other questions involving subjective probabilities were as follows: ‘What do you think are
the chances that housing prices in your neighborhood will go up faster than prices in general over
the next 10 years?’, ‘What do you think are the chances that the U.S. economy will experience a
major depression sometime during the next 10 years or so?’, ‘What do you think are the chances


                                                4
level, the answers to these questions about subjective survival probabilities have been

found to measure mortality risk fairly reasonably: they aggregate well to averages that are

close to corresponding figures based on age-specific survival probabilities calculated

from cross-sectional life tables, and they vary plausibly with income, wealth, schooling,

and risk factors such as smoking (Hurd and McGarry 1995). In panel analysis the

subjective survival probabilities to age 75 at wave 1, independent of self-assessed health

status, are reasonably predictive of actual mortality during the two years between waves 1

and 2 (Hurd and McGarry 2002). If one controls for self-assessed health status, however,

subjective survival probabilities to age 75 from the HRS are poor predictors of mortality

during the three years after wave 1 (Siegel, Bradley and Kasl 2003).

        At the individual level the quality of subjective survival probabilities as predictors

of respondents’ life expectancy seems to suffer from the presence of classical

measurement error and focal points in responses (Hurd and McGarry 1995; Hurd,

McFadden and Gan 1998; Bassett and Lumsdaine 2001). Hurd and McGarry (1995)

present clear evidence of response error by showing that 2.5 percent of the respondents

reported larger values for the survival probability to age 85 than for the survival

probability to age 75. Hurd, McFadden and Gan (1998) show that due to cognition and

response error many respondents systematically provided focal-point answers (0, 0.5 or



that the U.S. economy will experience double-digit inflation sometime during the next 10 years or
so?’, ‘What do you think are the chances that you [or your (husband/wife/partner)] will have to
give major financial help to family members during the next 10 years?’, ‘Thinking about work
generally and not just your present job, what do you think are the chances that you will be
working full-time after your reach age 62?’, ‘And what about the chances that you will be
working full-time after you reach age 65?’, ‘How likely is it that you will lose your job during the
next year?’, ‘What about the chances that your health will limit your work activity during the next
10 years?’, ‘And what are the chances that Congress will change the Social Security law to make
the system more generous than it is now?’, and ‘How about the chances that Congress will
change Social Security so that it becomes less generous than now?’

1) to the questions on subjective survival probabilities in the sample of older individuals

(aged 70 and over in 1993) in the Study of Assets and Health Dynamics among the

Oldest Old (AHEAD). Unlike the younger generation of respondents in the HRS,

however, the older respondents in the AHEAD study reported average subjective survival

probabilities that were substantially higher than those from life tables. Thus the problem

of focal points in responses may be a less severe one in the HRS than in the AHEAD

study. Bassett and Lumsdaine (2001) demonstrate the possibility of systematic response

error, showing that respondents who gave probabilistically inconsistent answers to the

two questions regarding Social Security in the HRS also reported higher values for

subjective survival probabilities.8

        To improve the information content of responses to the subjective survival

probabilities in the AHEAD study, Hurd, McFadden and Gan (1998) transform the error-

ridden survival probabilities with focal points into continuous probabilities. They show

that savings is positively associated with their new survival probabilities among couples,

though not among singles.9 But they do not validate their new survival probabilities—for

instance, by using actual mortality information from panel data. Bassett and Lumsdaine

(2001) try to validate their measures for other subjective probabilities in the HRS. Their

analysis of patterns in the minimum, maximum, mean and range of the entire set of


8
  According to Bassett and Lumsdaine (2001) the sum of the probabilities given for each of the
two questions about Social Security—Congress will change the Social Security law to make the
system more generous or less generous?—should be less than or equal to 100; but they report that
1492 respondents (about 18 percent of their sample) gave answers that summed to more than 100.
The initial assumption is problematic, however, as there is no reason to think that Social Security
benefits could not become more generous at some point in the future and less generous at some
other point.
9
  Hurd, McFadden, and Gan (1998) used a simple ordered probit analysis in which the dependent
variable was the categorical information on whether each respondent was a net saver, a zero
saver, or a net dissaver.


                                                6
responses to the subjective probability questions in the first wave of the HRS suggests the

presence of unobserved individual heterogeneity. To adjust for this individual fixed

effect, they create five benchmark measures by renormalizing the location or scale of

reported subjective probabilities. The result is inconclusive. In predicting the actual

outcomes observed by the third wave of the HRS, their benchmark measures for the

subjective probability of working full-time past age 62 and for the subjective probability

of making a gift to family members perform poorly relative to the reported responses.

        We control for these measurement errors in the HRS by instrumenting the

subjective survival probabilities of respondents using information on the mortality

experience of their parents. The instrumental-variables estimator also addresses the

potential endogeneity of subjective survival probabilities, a problem that would arise if

the subjective survival probabilities were affected by wealth and retirement decisions.

        Hurd and McGarry (1995) show that parents’ ages or ages at death are

substantially correlated with the subjective survival probabilities of respondents, and the

relationships between parents’ ages at death and the subjective survival probabilities are

nonmonotonic: the subjective survival probabilities of respondents are higher if the

parents are alive than if the parents have died; but if the parents died before age 51, the

subjective survival probabilities of respondents are higher than if the parents died

between ages 51 and 65, presumably because accidental deaths are more likely among

deaths that occur at younger ages; and if the parents died at an age greater than 65, the

subjective survival probabilities of respondents increase with the parents’ ages at death.10



10
  Hurd, McFadden and Gan (1998) also use the parental mortality experience to correct for errors
in subjective survival probabilities in their sample from the AHEAD study. They too find that
greater parental longevity is in general associated with greater subjective probability of survival,


                                                 7
In their analysis of HRS panel data, Hurd and McGarry (2002) report that respondents

modify their subjective survival probabilities in response to the death of a parent.


                                          Validation

Using the sample of respondents whose actual mortality is known by wave 6 of the HRS,

completed in 2002, we test how well the instrumented survival probability to age 75

predicts actual mortality in the subsequent waves, relative to the reported survival

probability from the first wave. Our validation process is similar to that in Hurd and

McGarry (2002). Details of the validation results are reported in the Appendix. We find

that the instrumented survival probability, which corrects for measurement error,

performs substantially better than the reported survival probability as a predictor of long-

term mortality. In the next two sections we employ this instrumented subjective survival

probability to investigate the effects of subjective survival probabilities on retirement and

wealth.


                                       Empirical results

          In this section we estimate the effect of subjective survival probabilities on wealth

accumulation and retirement. We find that higher subjective survival probabilities lead to

greater household wealth among couples, but not among singles, and no significant

differences in the probability of retirement for individuals in either demographic group.



but the relationship is statistically significant only for females when the father’s longevity is
higher. In addition to the differences in data, two other differences make the results by Hurd,
McFadden and Gan (1998) not directly comparable to those by Hurd and McGarry (1995). First,
according to Hurd and McGarry (1995), the effects of parental longevity on the subjective
survival probability of the respondents are not linear. Hurd, McFadden and Gan (1998) employed
a linear specification. Second, Hurd and McGarry (1995) create dummy indicators for surviving
parents, whereas Hurd, McFadden and Gan (1998) use the expected age at death conditional on
the age attained, calculated from life tables.


                                               8
Retirement analysis

Using the summary labor force status variable in the RAND HRS data, we define

individuals as in the labor force if they are working full-time, working part-time, or are

unemployed. Respondents who are not in the labor force—retired, partially retired,

disabled, or not in the labor force in the summary labor force status variable—are defined

as retired in our analysis.11

        The sample we use in our cross-sectional analysis of retirement consists of

individuals aged 50–70 in 1992 who were not represented by a proxy respondent. We

exclude those with missing data on subjective survival probabilities and on parental

mortality (3 percent of the initial sample). Our sample includes respondents outside the

51–61 age range because we include spouses of the age-eligible respondents. Of the 9388

observations in the final sample used for our cross-sectional analyses, 8235 (88 percent)

were born between 1931 and 1941 and 1153 (12 percent) were born either before 1931 or

after 1941. We present the results using the subjective survival probabilities to age 75 as

our measure of subjective survival probabilities.12

        Figure 1 reports the retirement rate by age for the whole sample. The proportion

of respondents retired rises with age, with sharp jumps between 61 and 62 and again




11
   The summary labor force status variable in the RAND HRS data is based on the following
information: working for pay, employment status, retired, looking for work, usual hours worked
per week, usual weeks worked per year, and information on second job. Hurd, Smith and
Zissimopoulos (2004) use the same definition of retirement. According to Gustman and
Steinmeier (2000), there are alternative definitions of retirement in the HRS. We plan to conduct
further analyses based on these alternative definitions of retirement.
12
   The results do not substantially change when the subjective survival probabilities to age 85 are
used instead.


                                                9
between 64 and 65. These jumps correspond to the ages of eligibility for rising levels of

Social Security benefits.13

        We conduct separate analyses by household living arrangements (i.e. single or

couple) and by sex. In addition to the subjective survival probability to age 75 and a

standard set of demographic variables—age, three race/ethnicity dummies (the reference

group is white), years of education, and number of children—we also generate, as

regressors, five dummy variables based on the financial planning horizon (the reference

group is the planning horizon of a few months),14 four dummy variables for self-reported

health status (the reference group is ‘poor health’), a dummy variable for the presence of

a health problem that limits the kind or amount of paid work of the respondent, and the

amount of lump-sum payments received from inheritance, insurance, and pension during

1991.15 For couples our specification includes these explanatory variables as well as the

survival probability for each spouse in order to control for joint decision-making.

Accordingly our instrumental-variables estimates instrument the survival probabilities of

both spouses with the parental mortality experience of both spouses.

        Table 1 reports the results of the retirement probit and the IV retirement probit for

singles.16 Among singles, there is no evidence that higher subjective survival



13
   The drop in the retirement rate observed after age 68 seems to be due to small sample sizes.
The numbers of observations for ages 69 and 70 are 36 and 22 respectively. Moreover, t-tests
confirm that the retirement rates are not significantly different between ages 68 and 69 or
between ages 69 and 70.
14
   Respondents were asked about the time period that was important when planning their savings
and spending. The results do not substantially change when dummy variables for planning
horizon are excluded.
15
   The amount of inheritance is not separately available in the RAND HRS files.
16
   In the first-stage IV estimation of the retirement and wealth equations, the coefficients on the
dummy variables for the mortality experience of the parents, though unreported, show the same
signs and significance as those reported in Table A4.


                                                10
probabilities decrease the probability of retirement, regardless of sex and estimation

method. Other significant variables are consistent with the findings in the literature. Older

individuals are more likely to have retired in our sample.17 More-educated women are

less likely to have retired than less-educated women. Those in poor health and having

health problems are more likely to have retired than those in better health with no health

problems. Women with the longest planning horizon are more likely to have retired than

those with the shortest planning horizon (a few months).

          The conclusions from Table 1 on the effect of subjective survival probabilities on

retirement behavior do not change in Table 2, where we report probit and IV probit

results for couples. The coefficients on the subjective survival probabilities are

statistically insignificant for both spouses, except for males in column 1, which is

significant at the 10 percent level. The coefficients on the age-dummy variables among

men clearly demonstrate sharp jumps at ages 62 and 65. Having an older spouse increases

the likelihood of retirement, as does receiving more lump-sum income in 1991.

          Overall, there is no evidence that higher subjective survival probabilities decrease

the probability of retirement regardless of couple status, sex, control variables, and

estimation method.


Wealth analysis

We define wealth as the sum of all household wealth components less all debt, exclusive

of Social Security and pension wealth. We use imputed values in the RAND HRS when

any of the wealth components is missing. The unit of analysis is the household because

wealth is measured at the household level. We conduct separate analyses by couple

17
     The reference group is age 50.


                                              11
status. Figure 2 presents the distribution of wealth by couple status. Because some

households have zero or negative wealth, we do not use a logarithmic specification. The

mean wealth and median wealth for singles are $95 711 and $27 990 respectively, and the

mean wealth and median wealth for couples are $239 109 and $118 500 respectively.

       Table 3 reports the results of the OLS and IV estimation of the wealth equation

for singles. We use the same set of explanatory variables as we use in the retirement

equations.18 Among singles there is no evidence that higher subjective survival

probabilities increase the wealth of the respondent, regardless of estimation method. The

result of the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test cannot reject the null hypothesis that the OLS

estimate in column 1 of Table 3 is consistent. Other explanatory variables in Table 3

show expected signs. Women have less wealth than men. Blacks have less wealth than

whites. Consistent with the literature, better-educated people have more wealth than less-

educated people. Individuals with planning horizons of longer than five years have more

wealth than those with shorter planning horizons.

       Table 4 reports the results of the OLS and IV estimation of the parameters of the

wealth equation for couples. Column 2 of Table 4 shows that among couples, higher

subjective survival probabilities of both spouses significantly increase the wealth of the

household in the IV estimation. The coefficients on the subjective survival probabilities

in column 2 of Table 4 indicate that a 10 percentage point increase in the husband’s

subjective survival probability results in roughly a $27 600 increase in household wealth,

while a 10 percentage point increase in the wife’s subjective survival probability results

in roughly a $32 700 increase in household wealth. These amounts are more than 10

percent of the mean household wealth for couples.

       Table 4 also reports the results of three tests for the validity of our approach. The

Durbin-Wu-Hausman test indicates that the OLS estimates are inconsistent. The p-value

from the Sargan test of overidentification indicates that our instruments are uncorrelated

with the error term and also that they are correctly excluded from the wealth equation.

Finally the Craig-Donald statistic shows that one cannot regard the instruments as

weak.19

       Overall, the difference in the effect of subjective survival probabilities by couple

status reported in Tables 3 and 4 is consistent with the findings of Hurd, McFadden, and

Gan (1998).


                                 Summary and conclusion

We find that increased subjective probabilities of survival result in increased household

wealth among couples, with no effect on the length of the working life. This finding is

consistent with the view that a longer expected lifespan leads to increased wealth

accumulation because institutional incentives effectively constrain retirement decisions.

We intend to exploit the panel nature of the HRS in future work by extending the analysis

forward through the seventh wave (2004). We also intend to explore the use of answers to

other questions on subjective probabilities as instruments for the subjective survival

probabilities, and to study lifetime savings directly by analyzing HRS data that are linked



19
  Critical values for the Craig-Donald statistic for the presence of weak instruments based on
two-stage least squares bias are 20.69, 11.05, 6.06 and 4.32 for the 5 percent, 10 percent, 20
percent and 30 percent bias respectively. If the Crag-Donald statistic is less than the critical
value, the instruments are weak. See Stock and Yogo (2002) for details.

to individual records on lifetime Social Security earnings. Future analyses will also

encompass individual data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and

the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), so that we can test

more directly whether institutions influence retirement incentives (see Bloom, Canning,

Moore and Song 2006).

       Our results indicate that expected lifetime horizons influence economic decisions

of consequence. This suggests that improving the accuracy of people’s estimates of those

horizons, and of the state of their health during those years, could enhance their lifetime

welfare. Further research, along the lines of Bongaarts and Feeney (2003), that aims to

extract information about the survival probabilities of true cohorts from data on the

survival probabilities of synthetic cohorts—on which life expectancy estimates are

typically formed—would be quite worthwhile.

       Our results also suggest that eliminating institutional arrangements that impinge

on retirement behavior, or making those arrangements responsive to changes in life

expectancy, could lead to welfare-enhancing changes in labor supply and savings. The

Social Security system in the United States has started down this path by increasing the

age at full retirement from 65 for cohorts born before 1937 to 67 for cohorts born after

1960. These changes coincide closely with the 1980–2003 increase in life expectancy at

age 65 from 16.4 to 18.4 years. In view of the projection of Li and Lee (2005) that life

expectancy at birth in the United States will rise to 84.9 by 2050 (from 77.5 in 2003),

further increases in the Social Security retirement age may well be in the offing.

                                          Appendix

Our validation sample consists of 10 070 individuals who were 45–65 in 1992, who were

not represented by a proxy interview at wave 1, and whose mortality status by wave 6 is

known.20 We exclude those with missing data on subjective survival probabilities and the

mortality of parents. The cumulative mortality rate among this sample of 10 070

individuals is reported by each wave in Table A1. By wave 6 (2002), almost 12 percent

of the sample had died.21 For each and every wave, men show significantly higher

cumulative mortality rates than women.

       Figure A1 reports the histogram of the distribution of the reported subjective

survival probability to age 75 that has been normalized to [0, 1] from [0, 10]. The figure

clearly illustrates that there are substantial focal-point responses, regardless of sex: more

than 40 percent of the respondents answered that their survival probability to age 75 is

either 0.5 or 1. The fact that respondents had to choose a number between 0 and 10 may

have aggravated the problem of focal-point responses.

       Table A2 shows how well this subjective survival probability at wave 1 predicts

actual mortality between wave 1 and each subsequent wave by way of probit estimation.

The dependent variable is equal to 1 if the individual has died by wave t (t=2, 3, 4, 5, and

6) and 0 if he or she has survived. Overall the reported marginal effects of the survival

probability to age 75 in Table A2 show that higher values of subjective survival


20
   Outside the age range 51–61, the sample is not representative of the population in 1992. Yet
our analysis includes those respondents outside the age range 51–61 who are spouses or partners
of age-eligible individuals to have more age variation and more observed deaths than in the age-
eligible sample.
21
   The individuals who we exclude because of missing data on subjective survival probabilities
and the mortality of parents (502 observations) have significantly higher cumulative mortality
rates than those included in the sample. By wave 6, for instance, about 17 percent of the
individuals in this excluded group had died.


                                              15
probability to age 75 at wave 1 significantly reduce the probability of dying before

subsequent waves. When the question regarding the subjective survival probability to age

75 was asked of respondents who were 45–65 years old in 1992, it was intended to

measure the long-term mortality (or survival) probability over the next 10 to 30 years.

The fact that the marginal effects of the subjective survival probability to age 75 at wave

1 are both significant and increasing in magnitude over time in Table A2 provides some

evidence that the subjective survival probability to age 75 at wave 1 does indeed predict

people’s long-term mortality.

       However, it is possible that the marginal effects of the subjective survival

probability in Table A2 reflect the effects of other factors that would affect mortality,

such as age, sex, education, health status, disease conditions, smoking behavior, income

and wealth, because these factors have not been controlled for in Table A2.22 We include

these factors from wave 1 in Table A3 as explanatory variables in addition to the

subjective survival probability to age 75.23

       Consistent with the findings of Hurd and McGarry (2002), higher values of

subjective survival probability to age 75 significantly reduce the probability of dying by

wave 2, as shown in column 1 of Table A3. Significant coefficients on other explanatory

variables have the expected signs. Mortality increases with age. Women have lower

mortality rates than men. The four dummy variables for subjective health status (poor

health is the reference group) are significant with the expected signs. Disease conditions

increase mortality rates. Current and past smoking increases mortality rates.


22
   Our income and wealth measures refer to wave 1 and can therefore be regarded as exogenous in
the estimation of mortality in subsequent waves.
23
   Hurd and McGarry (2002) use almost the same explanatory variables.


                                               16
       Yet columns 2 through 5 of Table A3 reveal that when it comes to predicting

long-term mortality by waves 3 through 6, the reported survival probability does not

provide additional explanatory power after other risk factors are controlled. The marginal

effects of the reported survival probability are insignificant and the magnitude does not

increase over time, though the sign is correct. Such an outcome is possible given that the

reported subjective survival probability is subject to measurement error.

       To correct for measurement error, we instrument the reported subjective survival

probability to age 75 by using 12 dummy variables for the mortality experience of the

parents. Table A4 reports the results of the first-stage linear-probability estimation to

predict the subjected survival probability to age 75 in the mortality equation. The table

includes other exogenous variables from the main mortality equation, and they show

reasonable signs. For the 12 dummy variables for the mortality experience of the parents,

the reference group consists of those respondents whose parents died between the ages of

50 and 65. In the first stage of the IV estimation, the coefficients on these instrumental

variables are significant with the expected signs and magnitudes, even after we control

for smoking behavior and disease conditions. If the parents are alive, the subjective

survival probability to age 75 of the respondent is greater by 0.051~0.095 in comparison

with those whose parents died between the ages of 50 and 65. The effect of the parents’

age at death on the subjective survival probabilities is nonmonotonic: if the parents died

before age 50, the subjective survival probability to age 75 of the respondent increases by

0.037~0.040; if the parents died between the ages of 66 and 75, the subjective survival

probability to age 75 increases by 0.023~0.027; and if the parents died after age 75, the

subjective survival probability to age 75 increases even more.




                                            17
        Figure A2 reports the histogram and kernel density graph of the instrumented

subjective survival probability based on the results reported in table A4. In comparison

with the histograms of the reported survival probability in Figure A1, the distribution of

the instrumented subjective survival probability in Figure A2 is unimodal and continuous,

and it falls well within 0 and 1.24 In the full sample the correlation coefficient between

the reported survival probability and the instrumented survival probability is 0.4297 and

statistically significant at the 1 percent level.

        Tables A5 and A6 report the marginal effects of the instrumented subjective

survival probability from probit estimation of the mortality equation for each wave.

Similar to the results in Table A2, the magnitude of the marginal effects of the

instrumented subjective survival probability on actual mortality increases over time in

Table A5, where no control variables have been included other than the instrumented

subjective survival probability. Furthermore, one notices that when the same columns

from the two tables are compared, the magnitudes of the marginal effects are

substantially larger in Table A5 than in Table A2, especially in columns 3, 4 and 5. This

indicates that the instrumented subjective survival probability is a better predictor of

long-term mortality than the reported subjective survival probability.

        This conclusion does not change in Table A6, where other control variables are

included. In predicting long-term mortality between waves 3 through 6, the marginal

effect of the instrumented survival probability becomes gradually larger in absolute

   The minimum and maximum values for the instrumented subjective survival probability are
0.14 and 0.93 respectively.
