                                         ABSTRACT

A financial crisis is an event in which the holders of short-term debt come to question the
collateral backing that debt. So, the resiliency of the financial system depends on the quality of
that collateral. We show that there is a shortage of high-quality collateral by examining the
convenience yield on short-term debt, which summarizes the supply and demand for short-term
safe debt, taking into account the availability of high-quality collateral. We then show how the
private sector has responded by issuing more (unsecured) commercial paper at shorter maturities.
The results suggest that there is a shortage of safe debt now compared to the pre-crisis period,
implying that the seeds for a new shadow banking system to grow exist.

Introduction

In a classic banking panic, holders of demand deposits want their cash back because they do not
trust the value of the banks’ loan portfolios backing the deposits. Deposit insurance solves this
problem. In the crisis of 2007-8 the holders of short-term debt, in the form of repo, came to distrust
the bonds used as collateral and increased haircuts, generating a run on the banking system.1 Have
the many post-crisis legal and regulatory changes to banking systems mitigated this problem? Or,
have these changes exacerbated the shortage of good collateral, resulting in collateral damage? To
the extent new laws and regulations constrain private short-term debt issuance, they also create
an incentive to find new ways to produce private debt—a new shadow banking system. We seek
to study this incentive for private safe debt production by looking at the relative change in the
convenience yield on short-term debt, and the private sector response to increases in the convenience
yield.

Short-term money-like debt is always backed by long-term debt as collateral.2 So, we can summarize
the state of supply and demand of long-term debt collateral indirectly by looking at the convenience
yield on short-term debt. The convenience yield summarizes the outcome of the plethora of legal
and regulatory changes post-crisis. Our results show that measures of the convenience yield have
not returned to pre-crisis levels. Further, we find that the quantity and maturity of private issuance
of short-term debt claims is sensitive to high-frequency changes in Treasury supply, more so than
in the pre-crisis period. Overall, the results suggest a shortage of high-quality collateral.

In the last forty years the financial system permanently changed from a system that mostly pro-
duced retail (insured) demand deposits to a system that produces significant amounts of short-term
(uninsured) debt for the wholesale market. This new system produces short-term debt to a large
extent with backing collateral produced from the very loans that the traditional banking system
originates, a process called securitization. The transformation of the financial system is dramatic.
Using U.S. Flow of Funds (now called the Financial Accounts of the U.S.) data, Gorton et al. (2012)
analyze the transformation of the U.S. banking system over the period 1952Q1 through 2009Q1. As
a percentage of the total amount of privately-produced safe debt, demand deposits fell from about
80% to 31%. Money-like debt (e.g., repo, commercial paper, money market funds) rose from 11%
to 21%. AAA asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities rose from zero to 18%. The shadow
banking system is the sum of the ABS/MBS and money-like debt components, which increased
from 11% to 38%, overtaking demand deposits in total value. This transformation seems to have
accelerated in the late 1980s, and it is apparent that the change is not temporary.

Has the shadow banking system become safer post-crisis? It is hard to answer this question because
there have been so many changes since the financial crisis, including the introduction of many new
bank regulations and capital requirements. Also, since the crisis, the production of privately-
produced collateral in the form of AAA securitization tranches has declined. The sovereign debt
of some countries is no longer considered safe.3 There was a large amount of net government debt
issuance during the crisis, but central bank quantitative easing programs absorbed considerable
amounts of government debt and other high quality collateral. And recent bank regulations, for
example the liquidity coverage ratio, have aimed at tying up high quality collateral, making it

immobile.4 What has been the net effect of all these changes? Answering this question is essential
for understanding the post-crisis financial system. We argue that the convenience yield can serve as
a valuable statistic summarizing the effects of these changes. A high convenience yield corresponds
to a relative scarcity of short-term safe debt, suggesting an insufficient amount of collateral to back
short-term debt.

Dang et al. (2012) argue that information-insensitivity is the defining feature of ”safe” debt. Maxi-
mal information-insensitivity is achieved by debt-on-debt, debt backed by debt. If there is a short-
age of collateral to back the debt, the private sector can respond by issuing unsecured short-term
debt (backed by a portfolio of debt, bonds or loans), attempting to make it information-insensitive
by shortening maturities. With an insufficient amount of bonds to back repo the private sector
will produce short-term debt elsewhere. We show a correlation between the issuance of (unsecured)
commercial paper and heightened convenience yields and that the maturity of the commercial paper
has shortened. This has persisted since the crisis.

In Section 1 we examine the levels of various measures of the convenience yield, comparing the
current levels to pre-crisis values. In Section 2 we look at the sensitivity of the convenience yield to
exogenous (but anticipated) shocks to the amount of outstanding U.S. Treasury bills. In Section
3 we examine how the sensitivity of issuance and maturity of financial commercial paper have
changed, compared to the pre-crisis period. Section 4 concludes by briefly discussing what the
results mean.



1        Levels

We begin by examining changes in the levels of various measures of the convenience yield on long and
short-term debt. These measures are the one and three month spread between the general collateral
(GC) repo rate and the U.S. Treasury bill rate, the spread between AAA corporates and U.S.
Treasury bonds, and the spread between Baa and U.S. Treasury bonds. Krishnamurthy and Vissing-
Jorgensen (2014) and Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2015) examine such convenience yield
measures and associate them with the outstanding aggregate supply of Treasuries. Another measure
of the convenience yield can be constructed by comparing market rates with rates from a fitted yield
curve, like in Greenwood et al. (2015). We construct a version of their “z-spread”—the average
spread between T-bills with remaining maturities between 4 to 26 weeks and fitted values from
Gürkaynak et al. (2012). We subtract market rates from fitted rates to ensure a positive z-spread,
on average. As Figure 1 shows, this measure is strongly correlated with the GC-1 month Treasury
spread.

We want to see if these measures of the convenience yields marginally increased during the crisis
and again in the post-crisis period, compared to the pre-crisis baseline. To do this we run a simple
regression with a constant (the baseline), a dummy variable that is turned to one starting in July
2007 (the start of the crisis) and another dummy that is turned to one from 2012 to the present.
The coefficient on the first dummy tells us how the convenience yield level changed during the crisis
compared to the baseline. The coefficient on the second dummy tells us how the convenience yield
has changed since the crisis. We also report the p-value for the sum of the coefficients on the crisis
and post-crisis dummies being different from zero. If the coefficients sum to zero, then the current

period is like the pre-crisis period.

Table 1 shows the results. The first row of the table shows that convenience yields rose during
the crisis, consistent with a shortage of safe short-term debt. The second row shows that since
then convenience yields have come down. But, adding these two coefficients shows that overall
convenience yields have not returned to pre-crisis levels—the sum of the two dummies is positive
in all cases. The p-values show that the hypothesis that the crisis plus post-crisis dummies sum to
zero is strongly rejected in all cases.

2    Tax Day Dynamics

Another way to gauge the scarcity of short-term safe debt is to look at the sensitivity of U.S.
Treasury yields and convenience yields to Treasury bill (anticipated) supply shocks. In this section
we study the sensitivity of convenience yields to a supply shock which occurs annually around
April 15 in the U.S., when households and firms pay their taxes. Anticipating an inflow of cash,
the Treasury issues fewer Treasury bills. When there is a decline in the outstanding supply of bills,
how does the yield on bills and the convenience yield change?

The regressions reported in Table 2 regress changes in yields on contemporaneous supply changes
in Treasury bills. We further interact the right-hand-side variables with the two dummy variables—
crisis and post-crisis—used in Section 1. We examine daily data in a ten day window around the
tax day.

The baseline regression shows that when the supply of Treasuries drops, the yield on the one month
Treasury goes down, corresponding to an increase in the price of bills. The coefficient 0.58 in the
first column implies that a 5% drop in T-bill supply corresponds to a 2.9 basis point decrease in
the 1 month yield. During the crisis, and since 2008, the yields went up more, for a given size of
supply shock. And, since 2012 there was a reduction in the sensitivity to supply shocks, but overall
the response to the tax-related decrease remains heightened. However, the p-value on the sum of
the coefficients cannot reject that the sum is zero.

Table 2 also shows the response of the GC repo-one month Treasury (Tr 1m) bill spread. A negative
shock to Treasuries outstanding causes the spread to increase, more so with the onset of the crisis.
In the baseline, a 5% drop in T-bill supply corresponds to 3 basis point increase in the GC-Tr 1m
spread. Since the crisis the sensitivity to bill supply has decreased and the overall effect is not
different from the pre-crisis period at the usual 5% significance level.

Figure 2 displays these results graphically. Here we plot of T-bill supply, T-bill rates, and the GC
repo-Treasury Bill spread (as deviations from their 60-day means) five days before and after the
tax day on April 15. The top panel shows the data for the 2002-2017 sample; the bottom panel
shows the data for 2009-2017. As the outstanding T-bill supply falls, the Treasury yield goes down
and the convenience yield rises.

The evidence from studying the tax day dynamics is mixed, but suggestive and consistent with our
other evidence.

3    Commercial Paper Issuance and Maturity

Still another way to look at the issue of whether there is a relative scarcity of money-like debt is
by examining private sector net issuance of short-term debt in response to changes in Treasury
bill supply or the convenience yield, like in Sunderam (2014). Specifically, we study the change
in outstanding financial commercial paper as a function of Treasury supply, and as a function of
the GC-Treasury 1m spread. Commercial paper issued by financial firms is another kind of short-
term debt (though unsecured), with the preponderance of the paper issued at short maturities (in
2017, maturities of 1-4 days made up 58% of issuance). An issuer seeking to issue a maximally
information insensitive asset would tilt towards shorter maturities.

Table 3 shows that reductions in the Treasury bills outstanding, normalized by GDP, coincide with
increases in net (log) issuance of the privately-produced substitutes. In the baseline case, a 1%
reduction in Bills/GDP coincides with a 0.33% increase in financial commercial paper outstanding.
The interaction terms with dummy variables for crisis and post-crisis periods demonstrate that this
sensitivity is mostly on account of the post-crisis period. We strongly reject the null hypothesis
that crisis plus post-crisis interaction terms sum to zero.

We also examine how the outstanding amount of financial commercial paper is related to a measure
of the convenience yield, the GC-Treasury one month spread. The results in Table 4 demonstrate


                                                                 9
that an increase in the convenience yield is associated with an increase in the (log of) outstanding
amount of financial commercial paper. Like before, we find that the sensitivity has increased since
the crisis. The interaction term with the post-crisis dummy indicates that a 1 basis point increase
in the GC-Tr 1m spread coincides with a 0.10% increase in financial paper outstanding.

Finally, we find a reduction in average maturities of commercial paper, consistent with the view that
these claims are issued in part to counteract variation in Treasury bills supply and that information-
insensitivity can be recovered by shortening maturity. As shown in the first three columns of Table
5, on aggregate, commercial paper maturities shortened during the crisis, and have stayed at those
levels.

What is more, we find that average maturities decrease when Treasury supply is low, or when the
GC-1m Treasury spread is high. We find that a 10 basis point increase in the GC-Tr 1m spread
coincides with a 1.2% increase in the share of short maturity commercial paper; a 1% increase in
Bills/GDP coincides with a 0.91% decrease in short maturity commercial paper. In both cases, we
reject the null hypothesis that the crisis and post-crisis interaction terms sum to zero.

4    Conclusion

Since the financial crisis there has been an enormous amount of legal and regulatory changes
with regard to banks. There has been new bank legislation in many countries and new bank
regulations. Central banks have purchased large amounts of safe debt. Some sovereign debt is
no longer considered safe. Regulatory requirements have rendered large swaths of good collateral
immobile, for example, the liquidity coverage ratio. What is the effect of all these changes—is the
financial system safer? This is an important question. It is hard enough to evaluate individual
policy and legal changes, much less the aggregate of the changes. The Lucas Critique suggests that
there may have been unintended consequences.

In this paper we have tried to get at this question by looking at convenience yields, both in levels and
in the responsiveness to Treasury supply shocks. Convenience yields summarize the scarcity of safe
debt, short-term and by implication long-term safe debt. In general, we find evidence that shortages
of short and long-term debt are higher now than pre-crisis. We also find suggestive evidence of a
private response in the form of short maturity commercial paper issuance when convenience yields
are high, or when Treasury supply is low. Overall, the preponderance of our results suggest that
there is a shortage of safe debt now compared to the pre-crisis period, implying that the seeds for
a new shadow banking system to grow exist.
