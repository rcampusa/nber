       This paper critically examines a number of maintained hypotheses that

 are necessarily being tested along with the basic notion derived from the

 rational expectations (RE) formulation of Lucas (1972) (1973) that "only

 unanticipated money matters.' The trend stationary representation of secular

 real output of Lucas and others is
                                       replaced by a difference stationary

 representation found by Nelson and Plosser (1980) to be consistent with U. S.

 historical data. The impact of inflation
                                             uncertainty on real activity is
considered. Attention is paid to possible
                                              mis—measurement of agents' ex ante
anticipated money growth. It is found that three alternative measures of

anticipated money growth produce a stable impact on growth of output and

employment. Contemporaneous and lagged values of
                                                     unanticipated money growth
have no significant additional
                                 explanatory power in the presence of any one
of the three measures of anticipated
                                       money growth. Beyond this, it is
impossible to reject the hypothesis that the initial positive real impact of

anticipated money is riot temporary. Inflation uncertainty is found to act

as a significant depressant of real economic activity in the presence of all

tested combinations of anticipated and
                                         unanticipated money growth.

            ANTICIPATED MONEY, INFLATION UNCERTAINTY
                   AND REAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY



                             Summary



       The prevailing view in neoclassical macroeconomics propounded by

 Lucas (1973) and others, termed the RE hypothesis here, holds that only

 a current monetary surprise will elevate the current level of real

 economic activity. If the Lucas specification is modified, following

Nelson and Plosser (1980) so that real output or employment is assumed

 to follow difference stationary process rather than a trend stationary

process, the main implication of the RE hypothesis becomes that a

current monetary surprise should produce an impact on the current rate

of change of real economic activity that is completely reversed after

a lag of one period.

      This study finds that three alternative measures of expost

anticipated money growth produce a stable impact on employment growth

and output growth in the United States over a 1953—75 sample period.

Beyond this, it is impossible to reject the hypothesis that the initial,

positive real impact of anticipated money is not temporary.

      The impact of anticipated money growth on employment growth and

output growth also dominates the impact of contemporaneous and lagged

"surprises" in money growth. In the presence of anticipated money

growth and inflation uncertainty, contemporaneous and lagged "surprises"

persistently failed F—tests for joint significance. A contemporaneous

monetary surprise by itself also proved insignificant in the presence

of anticipated money growth and inflation uncertainty.

        The discussion in Section 1 of
                                         possible bias arising from an
  investigator's mismeasurement of true
                                          anticipated money growth as seen
  by economic agents within a given sample period reveals that non—

  neutrality discovered in Section 2 cannot be
                                                 fully explained by appeal
  to such mismeasurement. If anything, implications of possibly biased

 measures of anticipated (and thereby of
                                           unanticipated) money only
 enhance damage to the RE hypothesis implicit in empirical findings

 reported in Section 2. In no case where RE holds, with either omitted

 or redundant variables in the investigator's measure of anticipated

 money growth should, as in findings reported here, the estimated co-

 efficient on anticipated money be significantly larger than that on

 unanticipated money.

       To the conclusions reported here regarding real effects of anti-

 cipated money, which must be termed highly improbable under the RE

hypothesis, can be added the finding that a rise in inflation
                                                                uncertainty
as measured by Livingston survey data significantly depresses real econo-

mic activity. This result is robust, appearing in virtually all formu-

lations of tests of the RE hypothesis conducted for this study. While

suggested by earlier writers including Keynes and Friedman, the precise

manner in which inflation uncertainty acts to depress economic activity

is not at present well understood. Considerable research remains to

be done in order to develop a fuller understanding of this phenomenon.

      In sum, results presented here force one to consider rejection of

the core of RE that only surprises matter. Some
                                                  investigators including
Poole (1976), Gordon (1979) and Friedman (1979) have suggested that
                             111


costly information may provide some basis for this alternative.   More
careful measurement and testing will be required to resolve the issue.

       This paper critically examines a number of maintained hypotheses

 that are necessarily being tested along with the basic notion derived

 from the rational expectations (RE) formulation of Lucas (1972, 1973)

 that "only unanticipated money matters." The need for further investi-

 gation of RE along these lines is suggested by results obtained by

 Small (1979), Mishkin (1980) and Darby (1980) in empirical investiga-

 tions of RE stimulated by the pioneering work of Lucas, Barro (1977,

 1979), Sargent and Wallace (1976) and others.

       Implications of three maintained hypotheses implicit in most exist-

ing empirical tests of RE are considered. First examined is the as-

sumption that the natural level of output is a trend stationary process

as represented by Lucas (1973). The implicit assumption that the effect

of a monetary surprise can be measured without holding constant the de—

gree of cx ante uncertainty about future prices is examined next. Work

by Levi and Makin (1979, 1980) and by Mullineaux (1980) strongly sug-

gests the importance of controlling for inflation uncertainty when esti-

mating "real" effects of monetary surprises.

      The third, and perhaps most troublesome assumption employed in

empirical investigation of the RE hypothesis, requires that the investi-

gator's measure of anticipated money, usually derived employing data

from the entire sample period under investigation, be equal to that

actually employed by decision makers within the sample period under

investigation.1 Failure to satisfy this condition can produce biased

estimates of coefficients on anticipated and unanticipated money growth

terms employed in an equation which properly tests the RE hypothesis.

The corollary is that "anticipated" money properly specified ought to
                                         2


     leave residuals which 1matter" in
                                              a properly formulated test of the RE
     hypothesis. However, failure of
                                             numerous !anticipatedI? money filters
     to leave residuals which dominate the real effects of anticipated

     money would constitute evidence damaging to the
                                                           RE hypothesis if an
     investigator were willing exante to grant that the filters had been

     carefully constructed so as to leave residuals
                                                          which displayed no
     systematically predictable behavior.

          Formulation and execution of empirical tests of the RE hypothesis

 based upon attention to maintained
                                              hypotheses embodied in earlier
 studies occupies most of this paper. Section 1 examines further the

 hypotheses which must be maintained
                                              jointly along with the RE hypothesis
 if empirical tests are to be implemented. This examination
                                                            suggests
a modified formulation for tests of the RE hypothesis presented in

Section 2.      The tests reveal that, in the presence of anticipated"

money, "unanticipated" money has no additional
                                                         explanatory power in
equations describing growth of employment and real output. Possible

reasons for this result are explored. Section
                                                         3 presents some conclud-
ing remarks.

 Froyen and Waud (1980) identify a cyclical component of real output,

      as the residual from the trend line       y = a+   t fit by least

 squares for the relevant sample period. Identification of the cyclical

 component of real output under this view requires the assumption that

estimation of a real output equation, where real output is represented

as a deterministic trend line leaves stationary residuals which measure

the cyclical component of real output. Discussion below considers impli-

cations which may arise if, as suggested by empirical investigation of

U.S. macroeconomic time series data, this assumption is not correct.


Real Output asa Trend Stationary Process


      Equations (1) and (2) suggest that real output can be written

as a trend stationary process (TSP)


                 =a+t+e                                                   (1')
                                                   4


  where +    13t measures the stable mean of the long term forecast of

     and the error term e captures the cyclical component of real out-

 put (e =          =                  +
                         n—P)             e1).         Nelson and Plosser (1980) have shown
 that if a variable like y actually follows a difference stationary

 process (DSP), the simplest example being a random walk, instead of

 the TSP indicated by (1'), a misspecifieation results which has im—

 portant implications for tests of RE.

         Writing       as a DSP:


                       L)y   =
               (1 —              f3   +
                                          d;       6(L)d =
                                                             A(L)v;                   (3)


 where (1 — L) is the difference operator,
                                           v is distributed normally
with zero mean and finite variance S and (L) and A(L) are polynomials

satisfying stationarity and invertibility conditions. Taking the simplest

formulation of (3), the random walk suggested by empirical evidence of

Nelson and Plosser, the rate of change of output becomes stochastic
     —
         y3)   = 13 +
                        d]   and:

                                          t
                                              d.
                                      j=l


Suppose now that (1'), the usual output representation, is employed

in place of (4). It is true that both formulations represent y as a

linear function of time plus the deviation from it. But
                                                                            y0,
the intercept in (4) depends on historical events and the deviations

from trend are nonstationary rather than stationary as in (1').

      Nelson and Plosser (1980) are unable to reject the hypothesis that

most long—run time series from U.S. macroeconomic variables, including
                                        5



 real GNP (1909—1970), industrial production (1860—1970) and employment

 (1890—1970), are approximated by a random walk. This finding carries

 implications for existing tests of the RE hypothesis over finite sample

 periods like the 1953—1967 period investigated by Lucas or the 1940—

 1975 period investigated by Barro. Since y depends on historical events

 this may account for inclusion of lagged           terms     to    capture persistence

 effects as in Lucas (1973) or the military conscription, minimum wage

 and other variables included by Barro (1978). The long distributed lag

 on money surprises may also be proxying for historical events operating

 on y.

          If time series evidence suggests that y is a difference stationary

process (specifically, a random walk) empirical tests of (1) ought to

be in first—difference form. Then (where          e1 =              + ut)
                                                         e1
                                                    t         t—l

                              =   + (p-pe) -
                                               t-lt—l + u                       (5)



          Equation   (5)   reflects, beyond accommodation of output as a dif-

ference stationary process, the fact that a monetary surprise will, ac-

cording to the RE hypothesis, produce only a temporary rise in output

or employment               above its natural level, 3. There is no specific

hypothesis about the calendar time actually required to move from "t—V'

to flt"    in   equation (5). This question is investigated empirically in

Section 2.


Inflation Uncertainty and Real Economic Activi

          There is   a growing body of literature   on the effect of inflation
uncertainty      on real economic activity. Evans (1978)        cites arguments
                                             6



 by Keynes (1924) and Friedman (1977) that volatility Of the inflation

 rate depresses economic activity. Evans' own finding is that his

 measure of monetary (inflation) uncertainty depresses employment.

 Empirical studies by Levi and Makin (1979, 1980) and by Mullineaux

 (1980) have found that inflation uncertainty measured by a high variance

 of inflationary expectations across Livingston survey respondents is

 both positively correlated with inflation "surprises" and has a signi-

 ficant negative impact on real variables. These results are tied to

 earlier works by the finding of Cukierman and Wachtel (1979), employing

 Livingston and SRC survey data, that large variance in inflation is

associated with large variance of inflationary expectations across survey

respondents. Taken together, this body of literature suggests that a

measure of inflation uncertainty ought to be included in tests of the RE

hypothesis and further, that in view of the extant positive correlation

between inflation uncertainty and monetary surprises (see Levi and Makin

(1980)) omission of inflation uncertainty from tests of the RE hypothesis

could introduce bias implicit in an omitted variable problem.

        The specific effect of inflation uncertainty hypothesized here is

a negative impact on the rate of change of output, represented as:


                =          + 13 —        +d                          (3')



where        >0
                    a measure of inflation uncertainty.

             dt =      —
                            ci      +
                                        d1
                                  7



  This formulation implies that more inflation uncertainty and attendant

  phenomena such as more variability of relative
                                                   prices, possible reduc-
  tion in specialization and shortening of optimal duration for contracts

  written in nominal terms can permanently depress the level of real

  activity. This result is consistent with the permanent impact of vari-

  ability of monetary phenomena upon the average level of unemployment sug-

 gested by Azariadis (1977). It is also consistent with a negative im-

 pact of inflation uncertainty upon investment derived by Cox, Ingersoll

 and Ross (1977) and with indirect empirical evidence of the same pheno-

 menon reported by Levi and Makin (1979). If investment drops, so does

 the rate of growth of the capital stock, and thereby output growth

 would be expected to fall.

       The formulation suggested by (3') is investigated empirically

 in Section 2 employing the exogenous Livingston survey measure of infla-

 tion uncertainty.


 Implications of Inappropriate Measures of Anticipated Mone


      Testing of the RE hypothesis that only anticipated money matters

requires presence of the investigator's measures of both unanticipated

and anticipated money in an equation describing economic activity. It

is implicitly assumed that the measure of anticipated money, usually

derived employing data from the entire sample period under investigation,

is equal to that actually employed within the sample period under in-

vestigation by rational decision makers. Failure to satisfy this as-

sumption can lead to spurious inferences regarding the effects of un-

anticipated and anticipated money growth.
                                       8



         If the investigator erroneously omits a variable actually used

 to forecast money growth from his own money growth equation, part of

 the investigator's surprise is really anticipated. The estimated co-

 efficient on the mismeasured surprise will be biased toward zero assum-

 ing validity of the RE hypothesis that the (anticipated part of) the

 investigator's surprise has no impact on real activity. The estimated

 coefficient on the remainder of the investigator's measure of antici-

 pated money growth will however be unbiased and should equal zero under

 the RE hypothesis.

         Correcting for an omitted variable in the investigators antici-

pated money growth equation can also have important implications for

validity of the RE hypothesis. In his comment on Barro (1977), Small

 (1979) found that the explanatory power of Barro's surprises fell

sharply when correction was made for an omitted variable in Barro's

anticipated money growth equation. Since Barro's exclusion of a predic-

tor of money growth made part of his surprise predictable Small con-

cluded: "Thus, if anything, Barro has provided evidence that anti-

cipated changes in monetary policy affect. unemployment in the short

run."                 3               .    .
         (p. 1000).       The basic point is that inferences about validity

of the RE hypothesis are conditional upon an accurate measure of

economic agents' anticipated money growth during the sample period

under investigation.

        Another possibility is that the investigator employs a predictor

of anticipated money growth not actually employed by economic agents

in their true anticipated money growth equation. Such a predictor
                                9



 might either not be available to or be undiscovered by economic agents

 within the sample period. An example would be use of current instead

 of lagged explanatory variables in a money growth prediction equation.

 This practice, followed by a number of investigators, is criticized by

 Mishkin (1980). In this case part of the investigator's anticipated

 money growth is really a surprise and the coefficient on it is biased

 away from the zero value which would result given the RE hypothesis.

 The coefficient on the investigator's surprise will be an unbiased

 estimate of the impact of unanticipated money growth on real economic

 activity. The corollary proposition is that if the RE hypothesis is

valid, a significant impact upon real activity of an investigator's

measure of anticipated money can only result from inclusion of a

superfluous predictor in the anticipated money growth equation.

      Superfluous variables in the investigator's equation predicting

money growth won't disturb the conclusion that surprises matter (given

satisfaction of the RE hypothesis). However, if only the investigator's

surprises are included in the equation explaining real activity as in

Small (1979) and some equations estimated by Barro (1977), there is

no test of whether it is only surprises which matter.

      The preceding discussion reveals two possible reasons why an

investigator's measure of anticipated money may affect real economic

activity. First, apparent nonneutrality may result if the investigator

includes a predictor of money growth in his equation that was not actually

employed by economic agents during the sample period under investigation.

In such a case part of the investigator's anticipated money growth

would actually be a surprise. If neutrality holds, the coefficient on
                                   10


  the investigator's measure of anticipated money growth ought, as a

  weighted average of zero and the coefficient on true surprises, to

  lie below the (unbiased) coefficient on the investigator's surprise

  term.

          The second possible reason for nonneutrality is a violation of

 the RE hypothesis. Further, if the investigator's estimated coeffi-

 cient on anticipated money growth is larger than that on unanticipated

 money growth, the implication is that the impact on real activity

 of true ex_ante anticipated money growth outweighs that of true un-

 anticipated money growth. This inference holds if either a true pre-

 dictor of money growth is excluded from the investigator's equation or

 a redundant predictor is included.


 2.       The Impact of "Anticipated" and "Unanticipated"
          Money Growth on Growth of Employment and Output


      gForma t:      Short Run


          The discussion in Section 1 implies some modification of typical,

empirical tests of the RE hypothesis. The dependent variables should

be the rate of change of some index of "real" economic activity. In

the short run, a monetary surprise ought to produce a rise in the

rate of change in such real activity. Over the long run the net effect

should be zero. Tests of the RE hypothesis should hold constant the

level of inflation uncertainty and include measures of anticipated

and unanticipated money growth simultaneously in equations explaining

real economic activity. Attention must be paid to implications of

possible misspecification of the "anticipated" money equation.
                                    11



        Initial tests consider the temporary impact of a monetary distur-

  bance on real activity indicated, after addition of an expression

  for aggregate demand, by equation (5). Real, dependent variables con-

  sidered are the rate of growth of employment (biannual and quarterly

  data) and the rate of growth of real output (quarterly data). The

  latter is particularly useful for comparison with results obtained by

  other investigators like Barro and Rush (1979) and Sheffrin (1979).

        Rates of change of employment and output are regressed on mea-

  sures of anticipated and unanticipated money growth and the Livingston

 measure of inflation uncertainty. The first set of results is for

 biannual data running from April, 1953 through October, 1975. The bi-

 annual format and sample period are dictated by the measure of infla-

 tion uncertainty.4 The basic equation estimated by ordinary least

 squares is (where primes () denote rates of change):5

 Measuring Anti4pated Money Growth


          In   order to allow for different formulations which might be em-

 ployed to estimate monetary surprises, three widely different techniques

 are employed to decompose actual money growth into "anticipated" and

 "unanticipated components. Measures of anticipated money growth are

 taken from an ARIMA model, and from two other completely independent

 sources, Barro and Rush (1979) and Sheffrin (1979).

         It will be seen below that results are not sensitive to the parti-

cular measure of anticipated money growth employed. This outcome is

somewhat surprising in view of the controversy surrounding the question

of appropriate measurement of anticipated money growth.       [See Barro

(1977) and the comment by Small (1979)J. Also, the discussion in

Section 1 suggests some pay—off from alternative efforts to model anti-

cipated money growth. However, the simple fact is that the widely diver-

gent concepts behind models of expected money growth considered here

produce results which are highly correlated. The ARIMA model developed

here for quarterly data produced a series whose correlation coefficients

with comparable series of Barro—Rush and Sheffrin were, respectively,

0.87 and 0.91.8        Initially, for tests using biannual data, anticipated

money growth is estimated by an ARIMA model with seasonal moving average

terms.

         Barro and Rush (1979) and Sheffrin (1979) estimated rterl1 equa-

tions describing anticipated money growth. A quarterly ARIMA model for

money growth was also estimated using data drawn from the same sample

period covered by the biannual data. Livingston's measure of inflation
                                    13



  uncertainty was linearly interpolated to produce a quarterly series.

  Transition to a quarterly format permits assessment of sensitivity of

  biannual results to use of an ARIMA model to estimate anticipated money

  growth. The quarterly format is kept as close as possible to the bi—

  annual. For example, the rate of change of employment from, say, July

  to October is related to the rate of anticipated
                                                     or unanticipated money
 growth over the third quarter and to the level of inflation
                                                               uncertainty,
 anticipated as of the first quarter to prevail during the second and third

 quarters. Indices of inflation uncertainty as of quarters 1 and 3 are

 interpolated from Livingston indices as of quarters 2 and 4. Since the

 quarterly index of inflation uncertainty is lagged a quarter it is indi-

 cated in employment growth equations as

       In order to check for power of employment decisions to affect out-

 put or, alternatively, for pervasiveness of the impact of independent

 variables on employment of all inputs, the rate of growth of real GNP

 (expressed as GNP in 1972 dollars) was also used in place of employment

 growth in quarterly equations.


Anticipated Versus Unanticipated: Biannual


      Results of estimating biannual equations for employment growth are

reported in Table 1.   Equation (1.1) contains a number of interesting

results. Contemporary anticipated money and inflation uncertainty are

the only variables with a significant impact on employment growth.

This conclusion is reinforced by a look at equations 1.2 and 1.3 which

suggest, in addition, dominance of anticipated money over unanticipated

money as an explanatory variable.

       Lagged values of anticipated and unanticipated money do not have

 the anticipated equal but opposite impact upon employment growth. One

 possibility is that this result is due to the (unavoidable) use of a par—

 ticular time interval when estimating equations such as (1.1). The basic

 concept involved is the notion that any monetary shock which causes employ-

 ment or output g to      rise should do so only temporarily and even-

 tually the impact on growth ought to be reversed. Otherwise, there

 follows the implication that a monetary shock permanently elevates the

 level of employment or output, which is very difficult to rationalize

 even if prices are sticky.

       The results reported in Table 1 suggest that the initial "short

run" period during which a monetary shock elevates growth of employment

persists over a year (see equation (1.7)). Further, as will be seen

later on, reversals tend to be somewhat irregularly spread over a period

running from one to 2.5 years after the initial shock.

      To avoid consuming many degrees of freedom by regressing employment

or output growth on long distributed lags for both anticipated and un-

anticipated money growth, initial focus will be on the short run. Speci-

fically, RE hypothesizes that initial effects of surprise money growth

on employment or output growth ought to dominate initial effects of

anticipated money growth. The remainder of Table 1 and Tables 2, 3

and 4 present results of testing that hypothesis. It is consoling to

note that Durbin—Watson statistics in equations like 1.2 and 1.5 where

lagged values for anticipated and surprise money are omitted but highly

significant contemporary anticipated money and inflation uncertainty are

included, do not indicate omission of significant explanatory variables.

          Continuing with discussion of Table 1, equations (1.2) through (1.5)

 clearly establish the significant impact of anticipated money growth

 (me ) on employment growth and its dominance over unanticipated
                                                                 money
 growth. Also established is the significance of inflation
                                                                    uncertainty

 (c) as an explanatory variable, although it should be noted that the

dominance of anticipated over unanticipated money growth is undisturbed

by exclusion of 0.     Results of estimating equations (1.2) and (1.4) with-
out C    are:


                n —0.1876 + 0.5101 m           R2 =   .24;   DW =   1.73
                     (—0.66)     (3.78)


                n     0.7554 —   0.1127                             1.57
                                           m   R2     .01; DW =
                     (4.88)      (—0.60)

Clearly     acts as a significant explanatory variable and helps to elimi-

nate some serial correlation in the errors. Due to its high level of

significance, the inflation uncertainty term is included in all subse-

quently reported equations.

         If employment growth is a target of monetary policy, feedback

may flow from lagged employment growth to current anticipated money

growth, causing the appearance that anticipated money growth is an

important explanatory variable when really a first order autoregressive

process is determining employment growth. It is clear from compari-

son of equations (1.2) and (1.6) that inclusion of lagged employment

growth has virtually no impact on estimated relationship of equation

(1.2).

  Impact of Lagged

       Some investigators   have argued that lagged surprises ought to

 affect employment and output growth due either to a need to rebuild in-

 ventories as in Haraf (1978) and Blinder and Fischer (1978) or to infor—

 mational lags and an accelerator effect in a model including capital

 developed by Lucas (1975). Barro (1977, 1978) found lagged surprises

 to be highly significant in unemployment and real output equations.

 Equation (1.8) reports on the joint significance of current and four

 lagged surprises in the presence of anticipated money growth and infla-

tion uncertainty. The F value for the five surprise terms jointly is

F8 = 1.02    [5 percent critical value =   2.47].   Even allowing for the

impact of lagged surprise terms does not disturb the inference that anti-

cipated money growth dominates surprises.


Impact of   Lagged Anticipated Money



      Equation   (1.7) indicates that one lagged measure of antici-

pated money growth produced a significant positive impact for the

sample period running biannually from April, 1953 through October,

1975, although the impact was only about three—quarters that of the

contemporary measure of anticipated money growth. Anticipated money

growth lagged two periods was insignificant. Here the short run

appears to last at least one year.

 Alternative_Measures   of Monetary   "Surprises"


       It   is appropriate to see if conclusions drawn from Table 1 are

 sensitive to alternative measures of anticipated money growth. Re—

 suits obtained using quarterly measures of money surprises developed

 by Barro and Rush (1979) and by Sheffrin (1979) are compared with

 results yielded by a quarterly ARIMA model to measure surprises.

       Table 2 reports on results of estimating quarterly equations to

check sensitivity of our conclusions drawn from Table 1 either to a

biannual format or, more significantly, to the particular ARIMA model

employed there to estimate anticipated money growth. In addition, it

is convenient to consider the impact upon growth of real output of

variables already related to employment growth.

      Equations (2.1) through (2.3) establish that conclusions drawn

from biannual data about relative explanatory power of anticipated and

unanticipated money growth and the significance of inflation uncertainty

are largely undisturbed in a quarterly format. It is true that some

autocorrelation of residuals is indicated. This is evidently due to use

of quarterly averages of employment numbers to calculate rates of growth

of employment comparable to data on rates of growth of real output.

 since conclusions drawn from estimating the same equations with end—

 of—quarter employment numbers are undisturbed and Durbin—Watson statis-

 tics are satisfactory: In particular:


             [(2.1), DW =    1.59,   R2 =    .15;   (3.2), DW =   1.44,   R2 =   0.08;
               (2.3), DW =   1.59,    R2 =    .15].

 The explanation for this effect of averaging is given by Working

 (1960).

       Equation (2.4) indicates that although lagged employment growth

is more significant than in the biannual equations, its presence does

not disturb the explanatory power of anticipated money growth.

      Equation (2.5) which takes growth of real output rather than em-

ployment growth to be the dependent variable does little to disturb

conclusions drawn from behavior of employment growth.              Unanticipated

money growth is not significant at the 5 percent level of significance

in the presence of inflation uncertainty and anticipated money growth.

Inflation uncertainty was found to operate somewhat more quickly on

real output growth than on employment growth so G lagged one quarter

less was used in output growth equations.

      Equations (2.6) through (2.11) report on results using Barro—Rush

(1979) and Sheffrin (1979) measures of anticipated money growth in place
                                     19




 of our own ARIMA model. If anything these alternative filters for actual

 money growth only serve to establish more firmly the significance of

 anticipated money growth over monetary surprises in explaining employment

 growth.

         Table 3 employs Barro—Rushmeasures of anticipated and unanticipated

 money growth to consider further the sensitivity of our results to the

 manner employed to estimate anticipated money growth and to see how well

 conclusions about employment growth generalize to real output growth

using Barro—Rush data. Sheffrin's data is not considered separately

here because his measure of anticipated money growth is highly correlated

 (0.91 correlation coefficient) with Barro7s. Comparing equation (3.1)

with (2.8) indicates that adding four lagged values of Barro's monetary

surprise does not disturb the conclusion that only anticipated money

growth (Barro's) and inflation uncertainty matter. The F—value for the

five money surprise coefficients is 0.741, far short of the 5 percent

critical value of 2.34.

         Equation (3.2) indicates that anticipated money growth and inflation

uncertainty significantly affect real output growth although some slight

serial   correlation is present in the residuals.

contemporary monetary surprise (equation (3.3)) does nothing to clean

out autocorrelation but it does raise slightly the explanatory power of

the equation. However, the TSUrPriSeI term still does not pass the F—

test for significance at the 5 percent level. Comparing equations

(3.2) and (3.4), the 5 money surprise coefficients decisively fail the

F—test for joint significance even at the 5 percent level.

        In view of the results presented in Tables 2 and 3, it is not

 possible to argue that the real GNP equations provide decisive evi-

 dence of the significance of any of three measures of expost monetary

 surprises and it is certainly not possible to argue that surprises

 dominate anticipated money growth even if lagged values are included.

 The lag structure and fit of output growth and employment growth equa-

 tions is similar, with the exception of a slighly faster negative im-

 pact on employment growth of inflation uncertainty. Changes in anti-

 cipated money growth and inflation uncertainty cause output growth to

 vary more than employment growth. This may be due to "inventorying"

 of labor by firms which do not lay off all redundant labor in a slump

 in order to be able to expand rapidly in a boom without the high cost

 of locating and training new workers.


Long Run Impact of Changes in Anticipated Money Growth


      The "prerational" view of business cycles and the impact of mone-

tary disturbances as espoused by Friedman (1968), Phelps (1968) and

others does not argue that acceleration of money growth will produce

permanent real effects on employment.


      Even though the higher rate of money growth continues, the rise
      in real wages (as labor later demands and gets higher real wages
      due to excess demand for labor arising from firms' accelerated
      hiring) will reverse the decline in unemployment and then lead
      to a rise which will tend to return unemployment to its former
      level. Friedman (1968), p. 10.


In terms of employment growth, the initial rise in response to higher

money growth ought subsequently to become a fall, with a zero net effect
                                    21


  over time. The net impact on
                                    output growth ought to be zero as well.
  This is also the result indicated
                                         by equation (5) if the interval from
        to "t"   is   viewed as the long run.

        A net   long run effect close to zero is not clearly indicated by

  the data. Table 4 reports results of
                                            estimating equation (2.1) in-
  cluding 10 lagged (quarterly) values of (ARIMA)
                                                      anticipated money
  growth as additional explanatory variables.
                                                   In equation (4.1) the sum
 of the anticipated money growth coefficients from lags 0—5 is 0.771.

 Coefficients turn negative at lag 6 and sum to —0.435 from 6—10.

 The F—statistic for the joint significance of all explanatory variables

 is 3.45. In the presence of
                                  contemporaneous expected money growth and
 inflation uncertainty, the test for the joint significance of all 10

 lagged values of expected money growth yields an F—statistic of 1.45

 which is short of the critical (5 percent) value of 1.97.

       The long run reversal of an initial positive impact on employment

 of an acceleration of anticipated
                                      money growth on employment does begin
after 18 months in the sample employed here.
                                                   The effect, period—by—
period, seems to be somewhat uneven within the sample and therefore is

difficult to detect.

      Comparable tests on growth of output reported as equations (4.2)

and (4.3) indicate a larger impact (sum of lag 0—2 coefficients =

0.834) more quickly reversed (sum of lag 3—10 coefficients       —0.691).
This result cannot be viewed as highly significant however.      In the

presence of contemporaneous expected money growth and inflation un-

certainty, as in equation (4.3), the test for the joint significance

 of all 10 lagged values of expected money growth yields an F—statistic

 of 0.66, well below the critical (5 percent) level of 1.97.

       The implication of these results is to suggest only a weak and

 variable pattern of reversal of the highly significant, initial posi-

 tive effects of anticipated money growth on employment and output

 growth. Either result taken separately is contrary to much contemporary

 thinking on effects of monetary disturbances. Taken together they are

 particularly damaging to a number of widely accepted hypotheses. While

 some suggestions, particularly regarding the significance of the manner

 in which anticipated money is measured, have been advanced as a possible

way to square some of the results with the RE hypothesis taken together

the findings make it difficult to avoid raising serious questions

about the validity of that hypothesis itself.


3.    Concluding Remarks


      The prevailing view in neoclassical macroeconomics propounded by

Lucas (1973) and others, termed the RE hypothesis here, holds that only

a current monetary surprise will elevate the current level of real

economic activity. If the Lucas specification is modified, following

Nelson and Plosser (1980) so that real output or employment is assumed

to follow difference stationary process rather than a trend stationary

process, the main implication of the RE hypothesis becomes that a

current monetary surprise should produce an impact on the current rate

of change of real economic activity that is completely reversed after

a lag of one period.
                                23



        This study finds that three alternative measures of ex post

 anticipated money growth produce a stable impact on employment growth

 and output growth in the United States over a 1953—75 sample period.'1

 Beyond this, it is impossible to reject the hypothesis that the initial,

 positive real impact of anticipated money is not temporary.

       The impact of anticipated money growth on employment growth and

 output growth also dominates the impact of contemporaneous and lagged

 "surprises" in money growth. In the presence of anticipated money

 growth and inflation uncertainty, contemporaneous and lagged "surprises"

 persistently failed F—tests for joint significance. A contemporaneous

monetary surprise by itself also proved insignificant in the presence

of anticipated money growth and inflation uncertainty.

      The discussion in Section 1 of possible bias arising from an

investigator's mismeasurement of true anticipated money growth as seen

by economic agents within a given sample period reveals that non—

neutrality discovered in Section 2 cannot be fully explained by appeal

to such mismeasurement. If anything, implications of possibly biased

measures of anticipated (and thereby of unanticipated) money only

enhance damage to the RE hypothesis implicit in empirical findings

reported in Section 2. In no case where RE holds, with either omitted

or redundant variables in the investigator's measure of anticipated

money growth should, as in findings reported here, the estimated co-

efficient on anticipated money be significantly larger than that on

unanticipated money.
                              24


      To the conclusions reported here regarding real effects of anti-

cipated money, which must be termed highly improbable under the RE

hypothesis, can be added the finding that a rise in inflation uncertainty

as measured by Livingston survey data significantly depresses real econo-

mic activity. This result is robust, appearing in virtually all formu—

lations of tests of the RE hypothesis conducted for this study. While

suggested by earlier writers including Keynes and Friedman, the precise

manner in which inflation uncertainty acts to depress economic activity

is not at present well understood. Considerable research remains to

be done in order to develop a fuller understanding of this phenomenon.

      In sum, results presented here force one to consider rejection of

the core of RE that only surprises matter. Some investigators including

Poole (1976), Cordon (1979) and Friedman (1979) have suggested that

costly information may provide some basis for this alternative. More

careful measurement and testing will be required to resolve the issue.

*
      I owe thanks for helpful discussion to Charles Nelson and members
      of my seminar in advanced macroeconomics. Responsibility for any
      errors is my own.

1.    Sheffrin (1979), is the only investigator who tests RE with
      actors who form expectations based only on data available to them
      up to the time the expectation is actually being formed. His
      procedure requires the tedious calculations of U1tI expectation
      formulae (using n —                  j
                            observations) over a sample period with "n"
      observations on the dependent variable.

           Although Sheffrin's considerable efforts are commendable,
     his approach constitutes a necessary but not a sufficient condition
     to satisfy the requirement that the investigator is actually model-
     ling expost or exante representation of anticipated money growth
     prevailing at some point in time.

2.   Alternatively the RE hypothesis is sometimes tested with the unem-
     ployment rate in place of real output as in Barro (1977).
     This formulation can be rearranged to specify employment as the
     dependent variable. The rate of unemployment, U, may be written as:

             U =       (L — N)             Lt
     where


             Lt

             This formulation is expressed directly in terms of employ—.
       ment and not in terms of the share of the labor force
                                                             unemployed.
       The latter requires controlling for labor force behavior (see
       Barro (1977)) in order to extract implications of a monetary
       "surprise" for employment. Empirical tests in Section 2, below,
       employ both (1), real output, and (l.c) employment equations in
       tests of RE.

 3.    A direct test of this assertion would have been possible had
       Small included anticipated money growth directly in his equation
       explaining the rate of unemployment. An equivalent test can be
       performed by including actual money growth along with surprise
       money growth as in Barro (1977).

 4.   The entire sample period runs (biannually) from April 1949 through
      October 1975. The shorter period is selected to facilitate com-
      parison of results obtained here with work of other investigators
      and to permit the use of long lags on monetary "surprises."
      Results for the entire sample period and for shorter periods
      (October, 1960 and October, 1965 each through October, 1975) are
      available from the author on request. While there are some changes
      in estimated coefficients, the significance of which will be ex-
      plored in a subsequent paper, levels of significance and general
      conclusions drawn here are shown not to be sensitive to choice of
      same period.

5.    It is worth noting that the basic equation avoids the problems of
      observational equivalence of tests of Keynesian and classical
      models alluded to by Sargent (1976) and McCallum (1979). Under
      a given policy regime it can be shown that actual and unanticipated
      money may both operate upon real output since a distributed lag
      on actual money may proxy for a contemporary money surprise. But
      here actual money growth is decomposed into independent components,
      anticipated and unanticipated. What is directly confronted is the
      classical proposition that "unanticipated matters and anticipated
      does not."

6.    Data on employment is collected for the week containing the 12th
      day of the month. Therefore November employment is really early
      November and is more appropriately related to the money supply
      measured as the average of daily figures during October.
 7.   It is useful to bear in mind when considering an equation to
      predict money growth like Barro's (1977) that if anticipated money
      growth is being represented in a model which precludes any syste-
      matic impact of monetary policy upon real variables such as the
      rate of unemployment, it requires an assumption of consistent ir-
      rationality on the part of the monetary authority to include such
      a real variable in an equation measuring anticipated money growth.
      Barro seems to recognize this: "This observation (that unemployment
      rates are independent of systematic countercyclical money movements
      effect by policy makers) raises questions concerning the rationality
      of the countercyclical policy response that appears in the equation
      (2)" (describing anticipated money growth) (Barro (1977), p. 114).
      There is, however, no operational response by Barro to this problem.

8.    An experiment was conducted with the money supply data used in the
      biannual analysis in Section 2. Two additional investigators were
      asked to estimate an ARIMA model of money growth using the same
      sample employed to construct the series used in results reported
      here. The correlation coefficients between the biannual series on
      anticipated money growth employed in Section 2 and the two addi-
      tional series were 0.88 and 0.87. The correlation coefficient be-
      tween the two additional series was 0.97. Explanatory power of
      the biannual model used in Section 2 was about 10 percent above
      that of the other two models of money growth.

9.    The specific biannual ARIMA model measuring anticipated money
      growth contained one autoregressive term, one moving average
      term and three seasonal moving average terms:

              (l—,B)m = (l—A1B—A2B8—A312)(l—O2B2) + 5

              R2 =   0.55; F0 = 12.2;   Standard Error   .86135

      where
              B = lag    operator,

                     autoregressive coefficient,

                 = moving average coefficient,

              A.(i=l.. .3) =   seasonal moving average coefficient.

10.   Here again, the autocorrelation is likely due to the Working
      (1960) effect since real output figures are quarter averages
      rather than end—of—period figures.

11.   Actually the results hold for 1949—75 and a number of subperiods
      as well, but only the 1953—75 results are reported in detail here.
