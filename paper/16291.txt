                                            ABSTRACT

Reinforcing earlier findings from other data, college senior fraternity/sorority members are more likely
to consume alcohol frequently. Large reductions in estimates upon controlling for time spent partying,
and to a lesser extent cigarette use and intramural sports involvement, suggest considerable unobserved
heterogeneity in the relationship. Yet, effects remain substantive and are invariant to conditioning
on numerous further measures of socializing, sports participation, academic performance and mental
health. The conclusion holds when non-member comparison groups are restricted to drinkers who
smoke, party and/or play intramurals, or matched to members based on drinking propensities, suggesting
that fraternity/sorority membership raises alcohol use frequency.

1. Introduction

       It is commonly observed that among college students, alcohol consumption is more

prevalent and intense among fraternity and sorority members than others (e.g. Chaloupka &

Wechsler, 1996; De Los Reyes & Rich, 2003). DeSimone (2007, 2009) provided evidence that

although much of the association between fraternity/sorority membership and binge drinking

constitutes unobserved heterogeneity, a statistically and economically significant portion

plausibly reflects a causal influence of membership on drinking.

       In those studies, the identification strategy was to hold constant strict proxies for drinking

preferences, including covariates such as frequency of alcohol use in various settings,

socializing, and attitudes towards partying, which themselves are to be influenced by

fraternity/sorority membership. The causality argument is that the bias towards zero imparted by

interfering with the pathway from membership to drinking is at least as large as the

overestimation arising from omitting neglected unobservables, given that membership

coefficients were often minimally affected when these behavioral controls were inserted.

       This paper investigates frequent consumption of beer and wine or liquor, rather than

binge drinking and associated outcomes, using alternative data from the same era as these earlier

studies. The empirical approach is parallel, yet stricter in two important respects. Time spent

partying, which embodies the core of the identification problem, is held constant. Also, non-

member comparison groups are restricted to drinkers who engage in other behaviors that

complement frequent alcohol use and fraternity/sorority membership, or are matched to members

based on predicted membership propensities. The findings again suggest that while much of the

correlation between heavy drinking and fraternity/sorority membership is spurious, the

remainder represents a quantitatively important causal impact.

2. Empirical Strategy

       The analysis comprises primarily ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions of whether

respondents drank frequently on indicators of membership in a fraternity or sorority and a set of

controls. As in DeSimone (2007, 2009), the main impediment to obtaining a consistent estimator

is that many students join fraternities and sororities precisely because affiliation enables

drinking-related socializing in which students would attempt to engage even if they were not

members. Like those studies, this analysis addresses the issue directly by controlling for

behaviors and attitudes likely to reflect preferences regarding alcohol use.

       Consequently, along with personal characteristics and region-by-school type fixed

effects, regressions control for time spent partying, cigarette use, and intramural sports

involvement. Parties have an obvious association with fraternities and sororities, presumably

representing the main vehicle through which membership is associated with heavy drinking.

Moreover, partying has an inherent alcohol connotation in this setting, because respondents

report time spent socializing with friends as a separate survey response. Smoking is often found

to complement drinking (Bask & Melkersson, 2004; Goodman, 2009), including among youth

(Dee, 1999), and is also taken to signal a high rate of future discounting (Farrell & Fuchs, 1982).

Fraternity and sorority members are more likely than other college students to take part in

intramural sports (Dinger, 1999), and organized recreational sports participants are more likely to

consume alcohol even net of fraternity membership (Ward & Gryczynski, 2007). Beyond this,

regressions hold constant several additional socializing and sports participation measures, and

include abundant controls for academic performance and mental health.

       The identification scheme differs from DeSimone (2007, 2009), which controlled for one

manifestation of alcohol use, its frequency, while examining another, binge drinking, thought to



                                                  2
capture socially problematic consumption. In the data used here, two measures of frequency are

observed but binge drinking is not. Nonetheless, the empirical approach of this analysis is

stronger in three ways. First, the set of controls for partying and socializing, the prime

mechanism through which fraternity membership is associated with alcohol use, is more

extensive, as are those for sports participation, academic performance and mental health.

Second, the robustness of the results to restricting the sample to drinkers, and ultimately to

drinkers who consume both beer and wine or liquor, smoke, party, and/or play intramural sports,

is explored. Third, propensity score matching models (Dehejia & Wahba, 2002), which more

systematically account for selection on observables, are estimated.



3. Data

       This study analyzes the College Senior Survey, administered annually since 1993 by the

Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA (http://gseis.ucla.edu/heri/cssoverview.php).

Though ongoing, data from 1997 are used here because they are the most recent that are publicly

available. In 1997, surveys were conducted at 148 four-year schools (listed at

http://gseis.ucla.edu/heri/researchers/parthist/CSS.Participation.History.PDF), in the classroom

or other group setting or by mail, from the previous November through June to allow

participation by both December and spring graduates.

       Of the 33,824 students interviewed, 498 not attending four-year schools are removed

from the sample, as are 3,433 whose spring degree is something other than bachelor‟s or “none”,

2,095 who attend school part-time, 4,989 with unknown enrollment status, and the 261 left for

whom drinking is unobserved, yielding 22,548 respondents. Missing value indicators are

constructed for two variables, year of entry into college originally and into the current school, in



                                                 3
order to maintain the corresponding 8,261 observations (only 63 of which reflect neither entry

year being reported). Because no other variable is unavailable in more than 647 cases, all

remaining observations with any missing data are excluded, reducing the sample size to 20,277

students, i.e. by only 10%.

       Table 1 lists the analysis variables, all of which are binary indicators, and their means.

The dependent variables taken directly from the survey are indicators of frequently drinking beer

(33% of the sample) and wine or liquor (25%) over the past year, in each case relative to two

alternative choices, drinking occasionally or not at all. From these, indicators for frequently

drinking one (36%) and both (22%) types of alcohol are constructed to serve as two additional

response measures. As table 1 implies, there is substantial overlap among these groups, with

90% of frequent wine or liquor drinkers also frequently consuming beer, although one-third of

frequent beer drinkers do not frequently consume wine or liquor.

       Note that drinking frequency is categorized subjectively by respondents, rather than

based on a specific alcohol use periodicity. Two separate data sets used in DeSimone (2007,

2009) reveal that fraternity and sorority members report more episodes of alcohol use, binge

drinking and intoxication over the past two weeks or month than non-members. This suggests

the threshold rate of alcohol use qualifying as “frequent” is likely to be higher among fraternity/

sorority members, meaning that the subjective nature of the drinking measures will, if anything,

bias the estimates towards zero.

       Just over 18% of students are fraternity or sorority members. Two considerations

involving this variable are that membership is recorded simply by marking the corresponding

questionnaire box, and literally refers to anytime previously rather than currently. The first issue

means that those who neglect or are unwilling to acknowledge membership are miscoded as non-



                                                 4
members, rather than omitted because of missing data. As noted above, however, only 1% of

otherwise eligible students failed to report alcohol use frequency for both beer and wine/liquor,

and these non-responders are already excluded from the sample, so the potential for drinking-

related misclassification seems minimal. The second issue implies the reverse miscategorization

for current non-members who formerly belonged to a fraternity or sorority. If any attrition from

fraternities and sororities is related to drinking, the effect of ever being a member, the parameter

actually estimated, is policy-relevant. Also, models control for potentially correlated school

interruptions and changes. Furthermore, if fraternity dropout is instead related to alcohol

abstention, or reciprocally not reporting membership is related to alcohol use, the estimator will

be biased away from finding a negative effect of current membership.

       The control variable set is divided into four groups that are sequentially inserted into the

regression to begin the analysis. Covariates labeled as exogenous factors, i.e. predetermined or

core demographic characteristics, include indicators of gender, graduating at the end of the

semester, year of entry into original and current college, race/ethnicity, getting married during

college, native English speaking and self-rated physical health. Region-by-school type fixed

effects constitute interactions between seven U.S. regions (New England, Mid-East, Great Lakes,

Plains, Southeast, Southwest/Rocky Mountains, Far West) and six school types (public or private

university, public college, private college that is nonsectarian, Catholic or with another religious

affiliation). Main confounders, as outlined previously, are past year time spent partying and

cigarette smoking frequency along with intramural sports participation during college.

Secondary confounders are past year frequencies of religious service attendance and feeling

lonely, depressed, and overwhelmed; past year time spent socializing with friends, exercising or

playing sports, attending classes or labs, and studying or doing homework; self-rated academic



                                                 5
ability, drive to achieve, intelligence, social self-confidence and emotional health; having

participated in intercollegiate football or basketball and any other intercollegiate sport, taken a

leave of absence, withdrawn from school, and transferred to another school anytime during

college; cumulative grade point average; and satisfaction with the overall college experience.



4. Results

Sequentially adding covariates

       Table 2 displays OLS results for the full sample, with absolute t-statistics in parentheses.

In all OLS models, standard errors are adjusted for clustering within region-by-school type pair

as well as heteroskedasticity. Percentage increases are calculated at sample mean drinking rates.

       Column 1 shows estimates holding constant only basic personal characteristics.

Coefficients are highly significant and large in all four equations. Fraternity/sorority members

are roughly 50% more likely to drink frequently than non-members, slightly less for beer and any

alcohol but slightly higher for wine/liquor and both alcohol types. These magnitudes seem too

large to plausibly reflect causal impacts.

       In lieu of school identifiers, which are not available in the public use data file, column 2

adds fixed effects for the 42 region-by-school type combinations, each representing about 3½

institutions on average. The coefficients actually increase, such that semi-elasticities rise by

about 10% of the dependent variable means, while standard errors fall disproportionately. These

parameter responses suggest that, if anything, not controlling for specific institutions biases the

estimates away from finding a negative effect of fraternities, while also reducing their precision.

       The changes in estimates moving through the rest of table 2 comprise the main results of

the analysis. First, column 3 inserts time spent partying into the regression. Just this one



                                                  6
additional set of indicators has a dramatic impact, reducing the fraternity/sorority membership

coefficients by about 70%. Under the assumption that membership does not alter time allocated

to parties, this result exemplifies substantial unobserved heterogeneity, signifying that most

excess frequent drinking among members is simply attributable to partying more often.

       Conditioning on partying gets at the heart of the identification problem, but is a stringent

solution. Joining a fraternity or sorority is presumably often motivated by a desire to increase

drinking frequency through facilitated access to parties. Still, members might ultimately spent

even more time at parties, and thus drink more frequently, than if they had not joined. In this

case, the column 3 coefficients underestimate the true drinking impacts of fraternities and

sororities, at least relative to the counterfactual situation of holding constant only the component

of partying not influenced by membership. Nonetheless, to minimize the possibility of finding

specious effects, the remainder of the analysis controls for partying time.

       Column 4 adds the two other main confounders, cigarette use and intramural sports

participation. Either, particularly the latter, might also occupy the causal pathway from

fraternity/sorority membership to frequent drinking, akin to the mechanism just argued for

partying. Regardless, coefficients fall by only 10–20%. The implied semi-elasticities of 13% for

beer and either alcohol type, and 18% for wine/liquor and both types, are still highly significant

and quantitatively meaningful.

       In contrast, the estimates are virtually unaltered moving to column 5, despite adding to

the regression 20 sets of indicators covering religious attendance, socializing and social skills,

intercollegiate and informal sports participation and exercise, academic effort, performance,

ability and ambition, school transitions, happiness, and emotional and psychological well-being.

These secondary confounders are jointly significant determinants of frequent drinking, at far



                                                  7
beyond the 1% level, in all four equations (when standard errors are unclustered to allow for

adequate degrees of freedom). This is strong, although by definition not totally conclusive,

evidence that the three main confounders, particularly partying, absorb the omitted factors that

induce spurious correlation between fraternity/sorority membership and frequent drinking.



Drinkers engaging in other confounding behaviors

       Though arguably dubious, the existence of unobservables not related with the included

covariates, yet sufficiently correlated with both fraternity membership and alcohol use frequency

to alter their relationship, is impossible to disprove. To even more strictly test the null of a zero

direct effect, therefore, the analysis proceeds by constructing comparison groups of non-

members that are more observably homogeneous with members. Table 3 shows results for the

first of two strategies for doing so, which is to remove from the sample students who do not

engage in specific correlated behaviors.

       Naturally, the most relevant behavior is drinking. In particular, students abstaining from

alcohol consumption are much less likely than others to be fraternity or sorority members (9% v.

20%), and not drinking at all might be a manifestation not of membership but rather unmeasured

characteristics that also determine membership. Consequently, the remainder of the analysis

omits the 15% of respondents who did not drink either beer or wine/liquor in the past year,

incorporating information on whether non-frequent drinkers of each alcohol type do so

occasionally or not at all, as listed for the other frequency variables in table 1. The implied

additional identifying assumption is that any causal effect of fraternities is limited to raising

drinking frequency from occasional to frequent, rather than across the threshold from non-

drinking. This is another restrictive condition liable to bias the estimator towards zero.



                                                  8
        Column 1 of table 3 provides baseline estimates for the remaining 17,154 respondents.

Semi-elasticities have declined, but not drastically, to 10–11% for beer/any alcohol and 16–17%

for wine/liquor by itself or with beer. Compared with the most conservative specifications from

DeSimone (2007, 2009), which estimated binge drinking semi-elasticities, respectively, of 19%

for the past month and 11% for the past two weeks, these are quite similar, despite the

differences in alcohol use measures and time frames.

       Column 2 maintains only students who consume both beer and wine/liquor. This further

standardizes the sample, raising the prevalence of both fraternity/sorority membership and

frequent alcohol use, but discards over 5% of frequent drinkers. Coefficients are further

diminished, but remain highly significant with semi-elasticities of 8–14%.

       The remainder of table 3 returns to the column 1 sample of drinkers but makes additional

restrictions by excluding students who do not engage in one or more of the three behaviors

shown to influence the relationship of interest, i.e. the main confounders. By design, fraternity/

sorority and frequent drinking prevalence rates are again somewhat higher, usually even

compared with column 2.

       Column 3 limits the sample to respondents who spend at least three hours/week at parties,

which is taken to imply at least weekly party attendance. This threshold omits students who

party less, and correspondingly have substantially lower rates of fraternity membership and

frequent drinking, than the modal category of 3–5 weekly hours. The impact on semi-

elasticities, compared with that of conditioning on partying time in table 2, is relatively small.

       Column 4 omits non-smokers, resulting in the smallest sample yet as well as the most

conservative estimates. A potential explanation is that some of the frequent alcohol use resulting

from fraternity/sorority membership also triggers occasional cigarette use among students who



                                                  9
would not otherwise smoke. In particular, Nichter et al. (2010) reported that many college

student cigarette users, particularly among fraternity and sorority members, smoke primarily at

parties when drinking sufficiently to become intoxicated. Still, coefficients remain significant at

the 5% level, and represent no less than 6% of the corresponding mean drinking rates.

       Column 5 includes only intramural sports participants. Intramurals might be linked to

membership and frequent drinking in part because fraternities and sororities are especially likely

to organize intramural teams while also encouraging drinking, so that removing non-participants

cuts off one mechanism through which membership raises alcohol use. Despite this, coefficients

are comparable with or exceed those in column 1.

       Column 6 is by far the most restrictive sample, simultaneously imposing the exclusion

criteria from columns 3–5 and thereby maintaining only the one-seventh of original respondents

who drink, smoke, party at least three hours/week and play intramural sports. Remaining

students are thus quite homogenous in the factors observed to have a substantive impact on the

relationship between fraternities/sororities and drinking. Nearly one-third are members, over

half frequently drink both beer and wine/liquor, and nearly four-fifths frequently drink some type

of alcohol. Yet, membership continues to raise the incidence of frequent drinking by 8–11%,

providing compelling evidence that membership directly increases alcohol use frequency.



Matching models

       Another technique for constructing comparison groups of fraternity/sorority non-

members that are more homogeneous with members is to match each member with one or more

non-members who have very similar predicted likelihoods of membership, or propensity scores,

based on observable factors. To do so, membership is regressed on the full set of covariates



                                                10
using a probit model. The sample continues to omit non-drinkers, meaning that the propensity

score regression is the probit version of the models from column 1 of table 3 in which fraternity/

sorority membership, rather than frequent drinking, is the dependent variable. For each

respondent, the propensity score is the predicted probability of membership from this regression.

       Two matching strategies are employed. Nearest neighbor matching couples each

fraternity/sorority member with the non-member who has the closest propensity score. The logic

is that each pair has a virtually equivalent tendency for membership, except that one is a member

and other is not. The matching estimator, the mean difference in frequent drinking between

members and matched non-members, is thereby purged of selection on observables. Radius

matching proceeds likewise, except each member is matched with all non-members who have

propensity scores within a pre-defined narrow range, or caliper. The latter procedure trades off

the efficiency gain from adding observations with the homogeneity loss from widening the

propensity score matching range.

       The matching analysis uses a caliper of 0.012. To the nearest 0.001, this is the narrowest

width providing matches for all members besides seven with propensity scores outside the

common support, i.e. the lower and upper bounds among non-members. These seven

observations are omitted regardless of caliper. This approach casts a relatively broad net, but as

discussed below, maintains covariate balancing across membership status.

       In table 4, panel A displays unadjusted mean differences, which despite excluding non-

drinkers are close to the coefficients from column 1 of table 2 that adjust only for exogenous

factors, along with the propensity score results. The two matching procedures yield estimates

that are nearly identical for beer and wine/liquor, and similar for either or both, with different

models producing larger effects in each of the two latter cases. Compared to the OLS



                                                 11
coefficients from column 1 of table 3, the matching estimates are uniformly bigger, though by no

more than one percentage point.

       Panel B shows one manifestation of covariate balancing, or a lack of correlation between

observables and membership status. The top row indicates a pseudo R-squared of over 21% for

the original propensity score regression, with control variables jointly significant at beyond the

0.1% level. In contrast, the two subsequent rows show pseudo R-squareds of around 1% for the

same regression in the matched samples, with the group of covariates highly insignificant in each

model. Observables, therefore, do not predict fraternity/sorority membership differences by

membership status.

       The top row of panel C reports another balancing metric, the standardized difference. For

each of the 144 indicators that comprise the set of controls, this represents the difference in

sample mean between members and non-members, as a percentage of the average standard

deviation. Median standardized differences are only 1–2%, with 95th percentiles less than 5%

and maxima of 6–9%. Rosenbaum & Rubin (1985a, b) consider standardized differences large

when over 20%, and in the latter study also flag values above 10%. This suggests that even the

largest standardized difference in table 4 is acceptable, another indication that the matching

model estimates are not biased by selection on observables.

       Attributes of the matches are detailed in the remainder of panel C. The second row

shows that the vast majority of closest matches involve propensity score differences at least an

order of magnitude below the maximum allowable, so that narrowing the caliper has little scope

for impacting the results, particularly for the nearest neighbor model. The third row indicates

that using the radius approach, the median fraternity/sorority member has over 200 matches and

over 5% have more than 1,000. Finally, the last row shows that while only 2,201 non-members



                                                 12
are nearest neighbors, with 5% matched to at least 4 separate members and one matched to 20

different members, radius matching utilizes all but 28 non-members at least once, with no non-

member constituting more than slightly over six weighted observations. Nonetheless, the

estimates are apparently quite robust to the substantially different amounts of information used

by the two matching procedures.

       Of course, matching does not directly address unobservables, the primary threat to

validity. However, if selection on unobservables parallels that on observables (Altonji et al.,

2005), the fact that the wide array of analysis covariates is balanced across membership status

would suggest that the matching, and thus more conservative OLS, estimators reflect causality.



Stratifying by gender, age & race/ethnicity

       Table 5 investigates whether effects are different across three important demographic

dimensions. It returns to OLS, which as just seen provides estimates that are conservative

relative to matching models, while continuing to restrict the sample to drinkers.

       Columns 1 and 2 show separate estimates for sororities and fraternities. Frequent

drinking, especially of beer, is more prevalent among males, but membership rates and effects

are similar. The semi-elasticity is greater among males for frequent use of both beer and

wine/liquor (21% v. 12%), but among females for any frequent use (13% v. 10%).

       Columns 3 and 4 divide the sample according to whether students first began college in

1993, so would be no more than one semester off track from graduating in four years (with 88%

scheduled to graduate on time), to examine whether behavior differs by status as a “traditional”

student. Membership and drinking rates are slightly higher among 4th-year seniors, while semi-

elasticities are greater among non-4th-years, but estimates do not vary appreciably.



                                                13
       Finally, columns 5 and 6 give results for non-Hispanic whites compared with remaining

students. Whites are 20% more likely to have fraternity/sorority affiliations and 50% more likely

to frequently drink any alcohol as well as both beer and wine/liquor. Coefficients are highly

significant and comparable in size to the table 3 baseline estimates for whites, but as large or

larger for non-whites despite the lower prevalence of alcohol use, with semi-elasticities ranging

from 17–22%.



5. Discussion

       Fraternity and sorority members are more likely to consume alcohol frequently. This

conclusion holds conditional on partying, smoking and playing intramural sports, as well as

among drinkers who engage in these activities even controlling for abundant additional measures

of socializing, sports participation, academic performance and mental health, and using matching

models. These findings suggest that fraternity and sorority membership directly raises the

likelihood of frequent drinking, akin to binge drinking in DeSimone (2007, 2009).

       Frequent drinking does not necessarily imply binge drinking or its potential harmful

consequences. Indeed, consuming a glass or two of beer or wine on a daily basis is associated

with increased cardiovascular health (O‟Keefe et al., 2007) and wages (Hamilton & Hamilton,

1997). Nonetheless, an extremely strong connection between frequent and binge drinking was

the crux of the identification strategy in DeSimone (2007, 2009). Moreover, among college

students it seems unlikely that “wine or liquor” predominantly reflects the former, or that

frequent consumption of the latter would typically occur in moderation.

       Fraternity and sorority membership has also been associated with cheating on exams

(Kerkvliet, 1994) and lower academic performance (Grubb, 2006). Yet, economics research has



                                                 14
also found that fraternity and sorority members are more likely to have GPAs above the

minimum requirement and declare majors by senior year (Grubb, 2006), obtain high-paying

entry-level jobs (Marmaros & Sacerdote, 2002), and donate to their alma maters after graduation

(Harrison et al., 1995). Caution should be exercised, therefore, in extending implications from

this study beyond highlighting the potential usefulness of targeting informational campaigns and

education programs at fraternity and sorority members to minimize the potential for drinking to

become excessive and thereby cause problems on college campuses.

The original sample omits non-drinkers, corresponding to column 1 of table 3. Radius (R) signifies matching each
fraternity/sorority member with all non-members within a propensity score of 0.012, while NN (nearest neighbor)
corresponds to matching only with the non-member who has the closest propensity score. The caliper of 0.012
includes all members besides seven with propensity scores outside the extreme values among all nonmembers.
Covariates include all those listed in table 1, along with region-by-school type indicators.

Each cell represents a different OLS regression of the dependent variable in the row heading on an indicator of fraternity or sorority membership, all covariates
listed in table 1, and region-by-school type fixed effects, with the samples restricted to drinkers and by gender, school entry year or race/ethnicity as stated in the
column. Parentheses contain absolute t-statistics adjusted for heteroskedasticity and clustering within region-by-school type combinations. Means in each cell
are for the dependent variable in the corresponding sample.
