                                              ABSTRACT

Property rights are commonly touted as a solution to common pool resource problems. But in practice
the security of these property rights varies substantially owing to differences in design. In fisheries,
the design of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) varies widely; the consequences of these design
differences on economic outcomes has not been studied. To test whether the security of these property
rights affects asset values, we compile a unique dataset to examine the relationship between the exclusivity
of property rights and the dividend price ratios for ITQs. We find evidence that stronger property rights
lead to higher asset values and lower dividend price ratios in ITQ fisheries. This pecuniary effect of
property rights security informs the current policy debate on the design of property rights institutions
for managing natural resources.

      Property rights are commonly touted as a solution to common pool resource problems. But in practice the
      security of these property rights varies substantially owing to dierences in design. In sheries, the design of
      individual transferable quotas (ITQs) varies widely; the consequences of these design dierences on economic
      outcomes has not been studied. To test whether the security of these property rights aects asset values,
      we compile a unique dataset to examine the relationship between the exclusivity of property rights and the
      dividend price ratios for ITQs. We nd evidence that stronger property rights lead to higher asset values and
      lower dividend price ratios in ITQ sheries. This pecuniary eect of property rights security informs the current
      policy debate on the design of property rights institutions for managing natural resources.


1 Introduction

Property rights and institutions are believed to have a profound impact on investment and economic growth. Yet


it is dicult to empirically disentangle the eects of institutions on economic outcomes. Case studies in a handful


of settings suggest the critical role of institutions, often in the context of developing countries (see, e.g. Acemoglu


and Johnson, 2005; Besley and Burgess, 2000, Alston et al., 1996; Alston and Mueller, 2010; Banerjee et al., 2002;


Besley, 1995; Goldstein and Udry, 2008; Jacoby et al., 2002). Yet a key insight from early economic analysis, and


the focus of our analysis, regards instituting property rights over previously unowned natural resources and how


that might mitigate the ill consequences of the common pool. This paper contributes to this broader literature by


examining the eect of stronger property rights on investment in common pool resources.


   To overcome the problems pervasive in common pool resources (e.g. Gordon, 1954), rights-based management


approaches are increasingly employed globally. Strong evidence of increased economic and ecological performance


from rights-based approaches has emerged (Grafton et al., 2000; Costello et al., 2008), and the policy debate has


shifted away from `whether' these approaches are eective and toward questions of design. Many design elements


are likely to aect the security of a property right. For example, so-called sunset clauses after which rights are

revoked and redistributed will aect stewardship and value (Costello and Kane, 2008) and assignment of rights to


only a portion of the resource stock may erode conservation and investment incentives (Deacon et al., 2010). Other


fundamental design parameters include limits on ownership or transferability (Grafton et al., 2000), revocability,


and geographic or temporal control over resource stocks. Despite their ubiquity and importance for design, the


extent to which these limitations on property rights security aect behavior and economic value has not been


carefully studied. The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the eect of property rights security on asset


values of a globally signicant common pool resource.


   In sheries, where the common pool feature has lead to widespread collapse (e.g. Worm et al., 2006), there is a


signicant trend toward property rights-based approaches. Fisheries in developed countries have largely transitioned


from open access to limited entry, where the number of vessels is restricted, and often an overall quota is set for


all licensed shermen.   Under such management, resource rents may still be dissipated in the race to sh and


overcapitalization (Homans and Wilen, 1997). In an attempt to allow the capture of resource rents, some sheries


have adopted catch shares or other rights-based management.


   In this paper, we focus our analysis exclusively on Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) sheries. ITQs, a form


of `catch shares', are the most prevalent form of shery property right in the industrialized world, where the holder


of an ITQ owns an asset which confers the right to harvest a share of the total allowable catch in the present year


and into the future.   ITQs have been hailed by economists as a means to capture the rents in sheries.       But in


practice, the design of ITQ systems varies signicantly across sheries; these design idiosyncracies aect property


rights security in complex ways.


   Under ITQ management, shares of the total allowable catch (TAC) are allocated to individuals (or rms or


cooperatives), who then hold the right to harvest their share each year. Typically, the holder of an ITQ can exercise


that harvest right, lease it to another sherman, or sell it.   This has been shown to help achieve allocative and


technical eciency (Grafton et al, 2000), which adds signicant value in a shery. In addition to eliminating the


race to sh, ITQ management has been shown to reverse the collapse of sheries (Costello et al, 2008).


   Since the introduction of the rst ITQs in the mid-1980s in Iceland and New Zealand, ITQ sheries have been


established in many countries (prominently the United States, Canada, Peru, Chile, and Australia). The general


structure of ITQ management has been adopted widely, but ITQs as property rights are viewed very dierently by


governments around the world. In New Zealand, ITQs are viewed as perpetual rights to sh. There, a quota is a




                                                         2
legal asset whose owner can use as collateral in establishing credit with banks. On the other hand, in Canada and


the United States ITQ ownership is considered a revocable privelege, and the future of ITQ property rights (at


least in the long run) is uncertain.


   There is also important variation in the security of property rights   within   countries. Beyond dierences in design


features, some stocks are prone to signicant illegal harvest due to high enforcement costs, while highly migratory


species are subject to harvest by neighboring jurisdictions or in international waters. Ownership of quota shares in


these stocks is arguably less secure than stocks with good enforcement and/or species that stay within the waters


of the managing jurisdiction.


   This story is not unique to sheries. The deleterious consequences of common pool management of resources


such as timber, air, water, and biodiversity are increasingly realized. These declines have lead to the establishment


of property rights over these resources.   In so doing, governments inevitably wrestle with the dilemma of how


much control to cede to private resource owners, where more control confers a stronger property right to its owner.


Economic theory suggests that the strength of property rights should aect the value of the asset itself (in sheries,


this is the quota value) but should not aect the current lease value. The lease value simply reects the current


year's rents, whereas the sales price of a quota should in principle capitalize future expectations. Quota markets


oer a good opportunity to study the eect of more secure property rights on asset values because the relationship


between lease prices and sales prices of quota shares should be dictated by market fundamentals.            Newell et al


(2005) study ITQ markets in New Zealand and nd that markets are suciently thick to operate well; the


relationship between lease and sales prices approximately follows market interest rates, and asset values in sheries


that experienced signicant rebuilding showed large gains. In a follow-up paper, Newell et al (2007) extend this


analysis to a more formal model of asset pricing. They nd that asset prices are higher when interest rates are


lower, and asset values are lower for stocks with higher biological uctuation.          They also nd that stocks that


had large decreases in costs or high growth rates in output prices have higher quota asset prices. These papers


contribute signicantly to our understanding of quota markets and asset pricing in sheries, though they do not


address the issue of property rights security.


   In this paper we exploit dierences in property rights across countries to determine the market implications


of secure ownership of these assets.    We then exploit variation in the exclusivity of the property right within


New Zealand to determine the impact of more secure property rights on the dividend price ratio, a measure of




                                                          3
the implied discount rate in asset markets. We nd that property rights security has a signicant eect on asset


values in sheries suggesting that property rights security may have a profound impact on economic behavior in


(previously) common pool resources.




2 Background

ITQs allow the capture of resource rents by reducing the race to sh and allowing the price mechanism to move


harvest rights to the most ecient shermen.      There is, however, considerable variation both across and within


countries in the strength of the property rights underlying these assets.


   Every country imposes idiosyncratic limitations on trades, duration, and use of ITQ shares, including (but


not limited to) caps on ownership of shares, restrictions on ownership by foreign eets, vessel capacity or gear


restrictions, and sunset provisions.   Rather than modeling structurally the independent and combined eects of


                  1 we will take a reduced form approach and leverage the fact that the ITQ asset price should
these restrictions,


capitalize this array of limitations and restrictions.   By calculating the dividend price ratio in each shery over


time, we are able to test whether property rights security aects investment in these assets.


   Experience with ITQ management varies widely, beginning with New Zealand as an early adopter in 1986.


Species have been subsequently added to New Zealand's Quota Management System over the past two decades,


and there are currently 98 species (or species groups) under quota management, with 690 separate management


stocks.


   North America has taken a more cautious approach toward ITQ adoption.               Canada's Pacic Sablesh and


Halibut ITQs were introduced in 1990, and the United States implemented its rst ITQ program in the mid-


Atlantic surf clam and ocean quahog shery in the same year. Since the introduction of the rst ITQs, several


stocks have been added in the United States and Canada; the sheries included in the analysis are listed in Table 1.


While the general principle behind ITQs is the same in these countries, the governments have very dierent legal


denitions of the quota share held by individuals; these imply palpable dierences in property rights security.
                                                                                                                   2

  1 Arnason denes what he calls a Q-Value, which is a measure of the quality (or strength) of property rights in

sheries. The Q-Value is a weighted index of assigned values for exclusivity, security, durability, and transferability,
but in the current empirical setting the practical use of this index has limitations. Use of the Q-Value requires
assigning values to each stick in the bundle for an individual country, and creating a weighted index of these scores
to come up with an overall score for the property rights strength.

2.1 ITQs as Property Rights

In the United States, the resources in a marine shery are deemed common property, which is held in trust by


the government for the community at large.        Such resources cannot be transferred to or owned by individuals.


The Magnuson-Stevens Act
                              3 holds that quota shares shall be considered a permit; may be revoked, limited,


or modied at any time; shall not confer any right of compensation to the holder...if it is revoked, limited, or


modied; shall not create, or be construed to create, any right, title, or interest in or to any sh before the sh is


harvested by the holder; and shall be considered a grant of permission to the holder of the quota share to engage


in activities permitted by such...quota share.


   As a result of this insecure property right, there is uncertainty about the future of the program, and holders of


quota shares are generally unable to use their holdings as collateral at banks.
                                                                                 4 As anecdotal evidence, when asked


why this is the case, a sherman in the Red Snapper shery in the Gulf of Mexico stated that we don't really


own anything. In the legal language, it's a privilege. There's always a danger that the government can change its


shery policy down the road, and then the quota would be worthless.
                                                                           5 Another expressed his concern that the


ITQ management would disappear after the ve-year review.


   A similar situation exists in Canada. Under Canadian law, ITQ shares are considered a revocable privilege, and


a resistance to ITQs has led to other catch share systems (called Enterprise Allocations) in the Atlantic Provinces.


Although sh are considered Property of the Crown in Canada, in 2008 the Supreme Court ruled that shing quota

A recent exception in the United States is the ability of Alaskan shermen to leverage against IFQ holdings with
some Seattle-based banks.

are property for the purposes of the federal Banking and Insolvency Act . ITQs are in place in several sheries in


British Columbia (see Table 1), but restrictions on trading were cited as a constraint on potential eciency gains in


the halibut shery. That is, substantial long-run gains in eciency can be jeopardized by preexisting regulations


and the bundling of the property right to the capital stock (Grafton, Squires, and Fox, pg. 679).


     In New Zealand, explicit property rights are established in the creation of ITQs, and over the past 25 years


nearly all commercial sheries have shifted to ITQ management.                 The right to a share of the catch is held in


perpetuity, and when a program is discontinued, or where the allocation is changed by the regulator, shers are


entitled to nancial compensation. Indeed, in the initial allocation of quota under the Quota Management System


(QMS), allocations were in terms of tonnes, and the TAC was xed. When shery managers subsequently decided


to lower the TAC, quota were bought back in an expensive scheme.
                                                                               7 This buyback will be discussed further and


leveraged in the empirical strategy in Section 5. A list of the ITQ sheries studied in this paper is found in Table


2.




3 Theoretical Background

Economic theory allows us to examine the value of secure property rights by using information inherent in the


relationship between lease and sales prices of quota shares.
                                                                     8 In a competitive market the lease price of an ITQ


should be equal to the expected economic rents from the current year. The lease price is given by                       pit = Et (rit âˆ’ cit ),

where    rit   represents the revenues and   cit   represents the economic costs in shery               i   and year   t;   the expectation


operator,      Et ,   simply reects the fact that revenue and cost need not be known with certainty for this simple


analysis to apply. The sales price of an ITQ asset will capitalize the expected discounted rent streams. If rights

                                                                             âˆ‘âˆž       E0 [riÏ„ âˆ’ciÏ„ ]
are secure and held in perpetuity, the current sales price is        Ï€i0 =     Ï„ =0     (1+Î´)Ï„       .


     If the shery is operating in steady state, expected costs and revenues are constant over time. Then the ratio

                                                                                                 pi0          Î´
of the current lease price to sales price of an ITQ can be written compactly as
                                                                                                 Ï€i0     =   1+Î´ . This ratio is commonly

used in nance to test future expectations about earnings, to compare measures of asset value across geographically


distinct markets, and to test for bubbles in asset markets (see, e.g., Campbell and Shiller, 1988 and Cochrane, 1991).


In that literature, it is referred to as the       dividend price ratio,   to which we will conform here. Under the simple

leading up to the end of the Civil War.

model above, the dividend price ratio should be a function of only the discount rate,                            Î´. In particular, shery specic

characteristics that aect revenues and/or costs conveniently cancel out of the dividend price ratio.
                                                                                                                                  9 However, the


calculus above implies an innitely secure property right.


    Suppose instead that participants in the market for quota share in shery                          i    place some non-zero annual proba-


bility,   Î¸,    on the revocation of rights (e.g. the government discontinues the ITQ program or shuts down the shery).


In that case, the lease value remains unchanged, but the sales value (at time 0) is now given by




                                                                      âˆž
                                                                      âˆ‘                 E0 [riÏ„ âˆ’ ciÏ„ ]
                                             uncertain
                                            Ï€i0        = pi0 +               (1 âˆ’ Î¸)Ï„                   .                                     (1)
                                                                      Ï„ =1
                                                                                          (1 + Î´)Ï„

Again, if the shery is in steady state it is straightforward to show that the dividend price ratio is given by:



                                                                    1 + Î´ âˆ’ (1 âˆ’ Î¸)
                                                             RÌƒ =                   .                                                         (2)
                                                                         1+Î´

All else equal, less security about ownership in an ITQ program leads to a predictable eect on the dividend price


ratio,    RÌƒ.   Perhaps of more practical signicance, we can solve Equation (2) for the annual revocation probability,                        Î¸:



                                                               Î¸ = RÌƒ(1 + Î´) âˆ’ Î´.                                                             (3)



For example, suppose the dividend price ratio is              RÌƒ = 0.15 (a typical value from the ensuing empirical analysis), and

that the relevant discount rate is        Î´ = 0.05.       These values imply an implied annual revocation probability of about


11%. Instead, if       RÌƒ = 0.10,   the annual revocation probability is about 6%. We can use Equation (3) to tease apart


the implied strength of property rights in two dierent sheries with the same                              Î´.   The dierence between annual


revocation probabilities in sheries        i   and   j   are given by:




                                                          Î¸i âˆ’ Î¸j = (1 + Î´)(RÌƒi âˆ’ RÌƒj ),                                                      (4)



which provides a convenient means to compare property rights strength across sheries.


    In cases where ownership of an ITQ is considered a privilege and is not guaranteed in perpetuity, the sales price


would be lower, while the lease price would remain unchanged. Similarly, if exclusivity of the right to a share of


the TAC is attenuated by shery-specic characteristics,                  RÌƒ   would be high. All else equal,          RÌƒ   should be lower where


property rights are secure.

   9 A result that will become useful in our empirical specication.




                                                                          9
   The goal of this paper is to test the hypothesis that strong property rights lead to a lower dividend price ratio in


the context of renewable resources. Using sales and lease prices from countries with varying strengths of property


rights, we rst test for dierences in the dividend price ratio across countries.    In that analysis we attempt to


control for other dierences across countries and sheries and we leverage the insight that the dividend price ratio


dierences out shery specic variables that might aect asset values. We then focus on dierences in dividend price


ratios within countries, examining how shermen implicitly perceive the future value of quota holdings. Because


ITQ programs are generally subject to federal laws that dene catch shares, it is dicult to obtain within-country


heterogeneity in property rights security.
                                           10 For within-country evidence, we exploit variation in the exclusivity


of the property right across sheries resulting from enforcement of the property right (illegal harvesting) and


neighboring jurisdictions that arise due to biological characteristics (migratory species). Furthermore, we exploit


a policy shock to look for evidence that discounting behavior changed in quota markets following a high-prole


buyback.




4 Data Description

We have compiled a unique panel dataset spanning hundreds of ITQ sheries in three countries.            The primary


variables of interest involve ITQ share sales and lease prices. Because data on individual transactions are generally


not available, we use annual average prices for sales and leases of quota shares in three countries: Canada, the


United States, and New Zealand. Variables that can aect the price of quota shares include the total allowable


catch (TAC), ex-vessel prices, the market interest rate, and biological characteristics of the species.    A detailed


description of the data sources is available from the authors.


   Data from New Zealand are the most comprehensive and come from FishServe, the New Zealand Seafood


Industry Council, and the Ministry of Fisheries. For each species under quota management and for each management


area, we have average annual prices for sales and leases, average greenweight tonnage prices,
                                                                                                11 the total allowable


commercial catch, and biological data from the Ministry of Fisheries and FishBase.
                                                                                      12

 10 There is some variation within the United States in how catch shares have been implemented by regional

management councils, but due to data limitations, we focus our attention on New Zealand.
 11 In New Zealand, ex-vessel prices are not available for the entire time period. Following Newell et al (2005), we

calculate greenweight tonnage prices using export price data for each year, and conversion factors from Clement
and Associates.
 12 In consultation with FishServe, a small number of observations are omitted from the analysis because they are

believed to contain signicant errors. Including these observations does not qualitatively change our results.




                                                         10
   Canadian quota prices are from management reports, Department of Fisheries and Oceans consulting reports


from Nelson Bros., and Individual Fishing Quota reports from Munro & Associates. Canadian sheries included in


the analysis are British Columbian halibut, sablesh coastwide hake, gulf hake, arrowtooth ounder, and uncut


groundsh, all of which operate under an ITQ.


   Finally, United States data come from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and regional management


councils.   Fisheries under ITQ management included in the analysis are the Alaskan Halibut and Sablesh, the


Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper, and the Virginia Striped Bass shery.
                                                                       13


   As an introduction to the data, consider a simple graph of the median     RÌƒ   across time for New Zealand, Canada,


and the United States (Figure 1).      While this simple graph fails to control for other factors (e.g.     the interest


rate, shery characteristics), it suggests there might be a systematic dierence across countries. The median        RÌƒ   in


New Zealand always falls below that of the United States, and typically falls below that of Canada. Furthermore


Canada's median    RÌƒ   is typically below that of the United States. This graphical evidence is consistent with our


theory and descriptive accounts that property rights are most secure in New Zealand, somewhat less secure in


Canada, and substantially less secure in the United States. The spike in 2007 for the United States includes only


the rst year of ITQs in the Red Snapper shery. In 2008, both the Red Snapper and Virginia Striped Bass are


included. These ratios tend to be signicantly larger than US halibut and sablesh, which are included in earlier


years in the gure.
                    14 In New Zealand, there is a downward trend from the rst year of the Quota Management


System (QMS) until present. The median ratio in the rst year of the program was about 15%, whereas that rate


in 2008 was near 8%. As is clear from Equation 2, the interest rate appears to play a key role in determining this


ratio.


   It is useful to further motivate our approach with an anecdote. Consider two similar sheries in the United


States and New Zealand: the Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper shery, and the New Zealand Snapper (SNA) shery.


The Snapper shery in New Zealand was rst put under quota management in 1986, and the median                RÌƒ   for that


species group for the rst three years of the program (a period of extremely high interest rates) was about 17%,


and over the entire series the median   RÌƒ   is about 8.8%. On the other hand, the Red Snapper shery in the Gulf of


Mexico had a mean     RÌƒ of about 27% during the rst two years of the ITQ program.     Though biologically similar, the


implicit revocation probability in the Red Snapper shery is much higher, anecdotally supporting our hypothesis

 13 At this time, data from the Alaskan Crab shery are not available. Furthermore, we are unaware of any data

on quota prices in the Atlantic Surf Clam / Ocean Quahog shery.
 14 Data for Alaskan Halibut and Sablesh ITQs leases are not available past 2006.

that weaker property rights raise the dividend price ratio. Of course, a host of factors could aect                                  RÌƒ,   which we


consider in the following section.


   In Figure 2 for each New Zealand species under ITQ management we show a scatter plot of the sales and lease


prices of quota since 2002.
                                                        15 The graph is arranged as follows. Each dot represents the median lease and median


sales value (in 2008 NZ dollars) for a particular New Zealand species under ITQ management between 2002 and


2008. Species above and to the left have higher dividend price ratios,                              RÌƒ.   We distinguish between stocks with high


illegal take (upward triangle), highly migratory stocks (downward triangle), and other stocks (open circle). The


mean   RÌƒ for the latter category is about 8%, and is graphed by the lower line.                             The mean   RÌƒ for the former categories

is about 12% and is graphed by the upper line. While this simple graphical illustration fails to account for other


factors which aect sales and lease prices of sheries quota, it is suggestive of the intra-country eects of property


rights strength. Species with high illegal catches and/or are highly migratory have less exlusive property rights,


and they tend to have higher ratios. The importance of exclusivity of property rights will be discussed further in

liquidity, not the value of stronger property rights.

5 Empirical Results

5.1 Cross-Country Evidence

As described above, there is substantial variation in the property rights underlying ITQs across countries. It may be


possible to qualitatively describe each property right characteristic for each shery, but comparing these property


rights characteristics across sheries and countries is dicult. Here we take a more agnostic approach, estimating


reduced-form equations to test for systematic dierences in property rights across countries. We augment our data


set and attempt to carefully control for relevant shery- and country-specic characteristics. Once again, we make


use of the observation that by dividing lease price by sales price, the dividend price ratio washes away many shery


and country specic factors that aect the value of the shery.


   The dependent variable throughout this section is the dividend price ratio of ITQs,             RÌƒ.16   We exploit the panel-

 16 This variable was constructed using average annual sales and lease prices, which may introduce some measure-




                                                                     13
structure of the data and estimate country xed-eects, which we use to test the null hypothesis that there is no


systematic dierence in dividend price ratios across countries. We estimate several equations, including controls


for market conditions, biological characteristics, xed eects for species groups, and year xed eects to control for


time-varying unobservables.


   The most basic specication regresses      RÌƒ   on country xed eects, species group xed eects,
                                                                                                        17 and the market


interest rate (in this case that country's 5-year Treasury rate in that year). The results are in column (1) of Table


3. The results suggest that, on average,   RÌƒ   in the United States is about 5.7 percentage points larger than in New


Zealand.   RÌƒ   in Canada is also signicantly larger than in New Zealand, and the dierence between the United


States and Canada is signicant. In the second specication (column 2), we add year xed eects to control for


unobserved contemporaneous shocks.
                                       18 In this case, the ratio in the United States is about eight points higher


than in New Zealand.


   Clearly there are other factors that could inuence the sales price of quota shares that are not included in the


stylized model presented above. Expectations about the future harvest and ex-vessel prices would dictate future


protability, and hence quota sales prices. We attempt to control for these expectations by including trends for


harvest and ex-vessel prices. Specically, we control for the percentage change of this year's harvest from last year


(in that shery), and the percentage change of this year's average ex-vessel price from last year.


   Although species group xed eects are included in every specication, we alo add biological characteristics


of each shery, which could inuence the horizon over which stocks rebuild.          We control for years to maturity,


length at maturity, and the maximum age of a species. Inclusion of these variables does not aect the main results,


perhaps unsurprisingly because there is little variation in these variables within ISSCAAP species groups. Finally,


the dynamics of a ratio within a shery over time suggest that the ratio of lease to sales prices decrease with the


tenure of an ITQ program. For each shery, we include the number of years since the rst year of ITQ management.


We also include a quadratic term to account for nonlinear relationships, and each of these variables is interacted


with country xed eects to allow this eect to vary across countries. In column (3), conditional on the control

ment error into our dependent variable. Because our data are on an annual basis, we cannot take into account
intra-year uctuations in lease or sales prices. Furthermore, because we are not constructing the ratio from individ-
ual transactions, we cannot observe whether any outliers (which may not represent arms-length transactions, for
example) are included. To the extent that any measurement error is random (and uncorrelated with the independent
variables), our estimates will be unbiased.
 17 We use ISSCAAP species group classications to hold constant species-specic eects; there are 18 groups in

the baseline specication.
 18 The results are robust to the inclusion of a quadratic function of interest rates.




                                                             14
variables, the ratio in the United States is about 11 points larger than in New Zealand.        In Canada, the point


estimate indicates that the dividend price ratio is nearly seven points larger than in New Zealand.


       As discussed above, New Zealand's Quota Management System includes many species not managed by ITQs


in the United States or Canada. In column (4), we restrict the sample to include only New Zealand species with


comparable counterparts in the United States or Canada.        Specically, we restrict the sample to include only


species in ISSCAAP groups 25, 31, 32, 33 or 34. These results are shown in column (4) of Table 3. In this case,


the point estimate implies that the dividend price ratio in the United States is thirteen points higher than in New


Zealand.


       Our cross-country results suggest that the dividend price ratio of ITQs is signicantly higher in the United


States and Canada, where property rights governing ITQs are relatively weak. Rather than picking up the desired


eect of property rights security, these results could be reecting a higher risk of collapse in US and Canadian


sheries. While we have no empirical or anecdotal evidence that this is the case, we can test for it in our analysis.


In columns (5) and (6) we include a dummy variable for stock collapse; our results are robust to the inclusion of


                                                                                                    19 In column (6),
this variable, as well as alternative denitions of collapse or measures for the health of the stock.


our preferred specication, the dividend price ratio in Canada is about seven points higher than in New Zealand,


and that ratio in the United States is nearly 14 points higher than in New Zealand.


       The cross-country regression results suggest that ITQ sheries in the United States have a signicantly higher


RÌƒ.   The ratio in the United States is higher than in Canada, which, in turn, is higher than New Zealand, though the


results for Canada are not robust across specications. Because we are controlling for shery-specic characteristics


and market factors, we argue that property rights strength explain the dierence in dividend price ratios across


these countries.
                  20 In the next section we examine within-country evidence.




  19 Specically, we include an indicator variable equaling one if the stock is below ten percent of historical harvest

levels, a common measure of shery collapse developed by ecologists (Worm et al. 2006).
  20    Our results are robust to a variety of additional controls, including shery collapse, revenue volatility, and
quadratic functions of the control variables. Our results are also insensitive to inclusion of xed eects for year
or ISSCAAP category. Furthermore, when estimating these regressions excluding the Red Snapper and Virginia
Striped Bass sheries (both of which have very high dividend price ratios), the dierence between the United States
and New Zealand remains signicant.

5.2 Within-Country Specications

5.2.1     Migratory Species and Exclusivity



For within-country evidence, we examine more closely the data from New Zealand. While property rights char-


acteristics such as disposition, use, and possession do not vary signicantly across sheries within New Zealand,


there is substantial variation in exclusivity. This variation is not policy-induced, but rather is a function of the


characteristics of the species. While some species do not move signicantly across space, several highly migratory


species move in and out of New Zealand waters, where they are subject to shing pressure outside the control of


the Quota Management System.


     New Zealand waters contain tunas and other large pelagic species that migrate long distances seasonally, often


outside of the country's Exclusive Economic Zone, into unmanaged international waters or into the waters of other


jurisdictions. These species are characterized as highly migratory.
                                                                        21 Because highly migratory species are subject


to shing pressure that is unregulated by New Zealand's quota management system, the exclusivity of the ITQ


right is arguably weaker than for species that stay within New Zealand's waters. This property right insecurity is


driven by poor (or no) management in neighboring waters.


     Our empirical approach formalizes the casual observation from Figure 2 that highly migratory species tend to


have higher   RÌƒ.   Table 4 provides within-country estimates for New Zealand. In these specications we are able to


control for a host of factors, including 5-year Treasury yields, trends for catch and greenweight prices,
                                                                                                            22 time to


maturity, length at maturity, maximum age, shery type (inshore, oshore, or shellsh)
                                                                                             23 and whether or not the


Ministry characterizes a species as recreationally or customarily signicant.      In addition, we control for stock-


specic revenue volatility, which captures both inter-annual uctuations in total harvest and product prices. In


column (2) we include year xed eects instead of the interest rate. Depending on the control variables included,


RÌƒ   is between 0.8 and 1.1 percentage points higher for highly migratory species, supporting our hypothesis of the


eects of property rights strength on the dividend price ratio.

 21 In Table 2, the fourth column indicates whether each species is classied as highly migratory.
 22 New Zealand's sh production constitutes less than one percent of worldwide production, and exports (in terms

of value) make up about two percent of overall international trade in sh products.         Some stocks, however, are
large on a worldwide basis. In these sheries the ex-vessel price is arguably endogenous. While we do not have a
plausible instrument for ex-vessel prices, in alternative specications (available from the authors) we exclude these
sheries. All of our results are robust to the exclusion of these sheries from the analysis.
 23 In this specication we do not include ISSCAAP category xed eects because they are highly collinear with

the indicator for Highly Migratory Species. When included, though, the species group xed eects that include
highly migratory species are jointly signicant.

5.2.2   Illegal Harvest and Insecure Property Rights



Evidence of illegal harvests in some stocks would suggest a weaker property right due to lack of enforcement. For


each commercial species in the Quota Management System in New Zealand, the 2008 Plenary Report from the


Ministry of Fisheries discusses any known evidence of illegal harvests. Of the 75 species with sucient data for


the analysis here, there are six instances where signicant illegal takes are believed to occur. If shermen are also


aware that some sh are illegally harvested from these stocks, it is plausible that they would place a lower value


on the future value of quota holdings. In Table 4, we also include an indicator variable equal to one if that species


has been prone to illegal harvesting. The point estimates suggest that these stocks have dividend price ratios that


are around three percentage points larger than for similar stocks.




5.2.3   Quota Buybacks and the Treaty of Waitangi



Finally, several policy changes in New Zealand between 1989 and 1992 may plausibly have impacted beliefs about


ITQ security within New Zealand.     In 1986, the initial allocations in the QMS system were in terms of tonnes,


rather than as a percentage of the annual total allowable catch. When it became clear that the initial allocation


was too high for many stocks, the Ministry of Fisheries proceeded to redene the right as a percentage of the total


allowable catch.
                24 After much debate, the government honored the property rights by issuing a buyback of quota


where the initial allocation was too high. As quotas were relatively new in New Zealand (and around the world),


this action by the government likely served as a signal that it would treat quotas as legal assets. The buybacks


began in 1989 and were nalized in the next two years.


   Around the same time, there was a debate about how the Maori people, native New Zealanders, were being


treated under the QMS system. The Maori people had traditionally relied on the ocean's resources, and there was a


concern that the quota system did not take into account the signicance of the sheries to them. Since the inception


of the QMS program, there was much controversy and dispute surrounding the treatment of native people under


the sheries management regime. In 1992 there were concessions citing the Treaty of Waitangi of 1840, in which the


Maori people were allocated 20% of the TAC for some key stocks. This policy decision formalized the government's


position and removed substantial uncertainty about the future of property rights in New Zealand sheries.        We


argue that this further strengthened security and would thus be expected to decrease the dividend price ratio. In


column (3) of Table 4, we estimate a regression with the same controls as in column (1), but also including an

 24 This approach has since been adopted by nearly all countries.

5.2.4   Summary



The results within New Zealand provide further empirical evidence that the security of property rights aects


quota asset values. Fisheries within New Zealand are governed by federal legislation, so we look to other sources of


variation to test whether the security of property rights aects dividend price ratios of quota shares. While other


factors are clearly important, such as market interest rates and the volatility of revenues for that shery, factors


that strengthen or attenuate the security of property rights aect quota asset values. We nd strong evidence of


a pecuniary eect of property rights strength, which suggests that the design of these institutions plays a critical


role.

6 Conclusion

This paper provides the rst empirical evidence that stronger property rights lead to higher asset values and lower


dividend price ratios (RÌƒ) in ITQ sheries. Our cross-country evidence is based on descriptive accounts of ITQs


as property rights in New Zealand, Canada and the United States.              In our cross-country regressions, the point


estimates suggest that   RÌƒ   for quota in the United States is nearly twice as large as in New Zealand. The average      RÌƒ

for quota in Canada is larger than in New Zealand in some specications, but these results are not as robust. Our


estimates are consistent with the general view that ITQs as property rights are more secure in New Zealand than


in North American sheries.


   We then exploit important dierences in the exclusivity of property rights within New Zealand to test whether


stronger rights lead to lower dividend price ratios. Where the exclusivity of the catch share is limited by migratory


species or illegal harvesting,   RÌƒ is signicantly higher than other similar sheries, even when controlling for biological

and other shery-specic characteristics. This lends insight into the importance of strong property rights, but also


suggests that coordination across jurisdictions and better enforcement of these property rights might lead to lower


implicit discount rates and greater quota asset values.


   Several caveats should be mentioned.          First, across countries, we cannot quantify the eects of component


characteristics of property rights on asset values. Instead, we rely on country xed-eects and dummy variables to


capture dierences in property rights security across sheries. However, our focus on sheries and the use of the


dividend price ratio allows us to isolate the eect of country-specic institutions on investment in common pool


resources. Second, our cross-country results could be consistent with systematic dierences in the probability of


shery collapse across countries. To attempt to rule out this possibility, we control for trends in harvest and ex-


vessel prices in our main specications and we control for whether an individual shery was collapsed in any given


year. Our results are robust to the inclusion of controls for the state of the sh stock as well as market conditions


and trends, but, as in any cross-country regression, other unobserved heterogeneity may still be inuencing our


results. Third, our cross-country results could be consistent with credit constraints and non-collateralizable assets.


The dividend price ratio could be higher in the United States because of credit constraints and the inability to


secure a loan for ITQ shares. This would simply be a mechanism through which insecure property rights aect asset


prices. Finally, our results suggest that there is a pecuniary eect of property rights security, and if this result is


present elsewhere (such as capital investment) the security of property rights are critical to sheries management.




                                                              20
On the other hand, if the only impact of property rights security is through quota asset values then the impact on


social welfare is unclear, though the security of property rights would clearly aect the distribution of wealth.


   Rights-based management in sheries can lead to signicant economic gains by eliminating the race to sh


and providing private incentives to steward the resource. Our results suggest that stronger property rights lead to


greater quota asset values. A closely related question concerns how property rights strength will aect dierent


dimensions of investment in common pool resources (e.g. physical capital, environmental recovery, etc.). Indeed,


these changes in investment may be partially responsible for the changes in asset values we observe. One implication


may be that weak property rights decrease the incentive for good stewardship of the resource by increasing the


average implicit discount rate in sheries. While we can only speculate on the underlying mechanisms, we hope


that this research will help motivate future work on the eects of property rights security on the management,


biological status, and sustainability of the resource itself.
