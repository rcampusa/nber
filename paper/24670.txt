                                         ABSTRACT
Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs have spread worldwide, and are designed to promote
comprehensive human capital investments in children, starting from encouraging pre-natal and
maternal care and early childhood health interventions and continuing through incentivizing
school attendance. Yet evaluating these claims over more than a few years is hard, as most CCT
experiments extend the program to the control group after a short experimental period. This paper
experimentally estimates the impacts of Indonesia’s cash transfer program (PKH) six years after
the program launched, using data from about 14,000 households in 360 sub-districts across
Indonesia, taking advantage of the fact that treatment and control locations remained largely
intact throughout the period. We find that PKH continues to have large static incentive effects on
many of the targeted indicators, increasing usage of trained health professionals for childbirth
dramatically and halving the share of children age 7-15 who are not enrolled in school. Wage
labor for 13-15 year olds was reduced by at least one-third. We also begin to observe impacts on
outcomes that may require cumulative investments: for example, six years later, we observe large
reductions in stunting and some evidence of increased high school completion rates. The results
suggest that CCT investments can have substantial effects on the accumulation of human capital,
and that these effects can persist even when programs are operating at large-scale without
researcher intervention.

I. INTRODUCTION

Perhaps the most remarkable innovation in welfare programs in developing countries over the past few

decades has been the invention and spread of conditional cash transfer programs (CCTs). These programs

provide regular cash transfers to poor households, but condition the transfers on households making a series

of human capital investments in their young children. These conditions typically begin before birth – pre-

natal care and deliveries by trained midwives or doctors are usually conditions – and continue through early

childhood health investments (immunizations, growth monitoring) and enrollment in primary and junior

secondary school. These programs began in the 1990s in Mexico, Bangladesh and Brazil, and today over

63 countries have at least one CCT program (Bastagli et al. 2016), covering millions of families worldwide

(Robles, Rubio, and Stampini 2015; World Bank 2018).

        The theory behind these conditions – and the reason they start before birth and continue throughout

childhood – is that static investments in human capital at every stage of the life cycle will accumulate as

children grow up, and the cumulative investments in human capital will eventually lead to substantial

improvements in child outcomes that may affect inter-generational poverty. For example, Santiago Levy,

who helped create the CCT model with the Mexican PROGRESA program in the 1990s, argued, “clearly

achieving good health is a cumulative process, and temporary investments in nutrition are of little help. The

same is true of education: children must be supported year after year…. [PROGRESA’s] central effects

will gradually occur through the accumulation of human capital” (Levy 2006).

        Given the worldwide scope of CCT programs, there has been substantial interest in understanding

whether the static CCT conditions indeed lead to cumulative improvements in child outcomes. This

question, however, has encountered an empirical challenge. Many CCTs, starting with PROGRESA, began

with randomized controlled trials on a pilot basis prior to scale-up, and the vast majority of the evidence on

the impact of CCTs comes from these trials (for example, see Behrman and Todd, 1999; Gertler, 2004).

However, to our knowledge, virtually all of these programs extended the CCT to the control group after a
relatively short pilot period – 18 months in the PROGRESA case, for example. 1 While this phase-in

experimental design is useful for studying the short-run, static impacts of the CCT on the health and

education behaviors they incentivize, the fact that the control group is ultimately treated makes it much

harder to credibly estimate cumulative effects from sustained exposure to the programs as children grow

up having been exposed to the program over a sustained period of time. 2

         A second, related question is whether the programs themselves continue to be effective – even in

the static sense of continuing to increase compliance with incentivized behaviors on new children entering

the program, or those who were quite young when the program began and have now aged into the conditions

for older children. There are a number of reasons to expect that the “static” effects of the program may

change over time. Some have argued that, in many cases, interventions are less effective when implemented

by the government at scale than in a smaller pilot stage, when researchers are more likely to be paying

attention to the implementation (see, for example, Bold et al. 2015; and the related discussions in Banerjee

et al. 2017 and Muralidharan and Niehaus 2017). Moreover, even if the program did have an initial effect

on compliance with the incentivized behaviors, the treatment effects could weaken after it became more

commonplace and people’s initial excitement of being in the program faded, or once people learned that

the conditions placed on health and education behaviors were not always perfectly enforced by the

government. Furthermore, natural improvements over time in socioeconomic conditions, coupled with no

changes in the nominal level of benefit payments, could render these cash payments less relevant to

households’ decisions. Since most CCT experiments extend the program to the control group after a short


1
  To our knowledge, there are two notable exceptions. First, Barrera-Osorio, Linden, and Saavedra (2017),
experimentally evaluate the long-run effect (8-12 years) of an unusual CCT and savings program in Bogotá, Colombia
with an intact control group that focused on incentivizing high-school enrollment, and studied the effect on tertiary
enrollment in universities. Second, Kandpal et al. (2016) study the effect of the Philippines’s Pantawid program 31
months (or, 2.6 years) after the program launch.
2
  Some papers exploit the fact that there is a time gap between treatment and control (even if for a short period) and
this may have effects on different cohorts of children due to differences in exposure effects, and thus look at medium-
or long-run effects for children affected by the program (for example, see Behrman, Parker, and Todd 2011; Barham,
Macours, and Maluccio 2017; Kugler and Rojas 2018). While this is very informative in terms of outcomes, it could
result in underestimates of the impacts as the control group is also exposed to the program, just a few years later.
Others exploit non-experimental variation using discontinuities in who received the transfers (e.g. Filmer and Schady
2014) or cohort analysis across areas with higher and lower program intensity (Parker and Vogl 2017) to measure the
longer-run results.
time, understanding whether the programs continue to be effective even in a static sense after a short

experimental initial period is also challenging. 3

        This study aims to answer these questions using an unusual, large-scale policy experiment in

Indonesia. We study Indonesia’s conditional cash transfer program, Program Keluarga Harapan or PKH.

Starting in early 2008, the government introduced PKH in 438 sub-districts across Indonesia (randomly

selected from 736, spread out over 50 districts), to a total of about 700,000 households. Targeted households

received between 600,000 to 2,200,000 Rupiah (approximately USD 60 to 220) per year, with typical CCT

conditions for children (pre- and post-natal care, deliveries with trained birth attendants, regular growth

monitoring, immunizations, enrollment and attendance of children in primary and junior secondary school).

The World Bank conducted a follow-up survey in 2009, about two years after the roll-out, in 360 of these

sub-districts, which was intended to be the end of the evaluation period (Alatas 2011).

        Crucially, while PKH has subsequently been expanded to many more areas in Indonesia – by 2013

it had reached over 3,400 sub-districts, spread over 336 districts in all of Indonesia’s provinces, and covered

over 2.3 million households — 60 percent of the initial control sub-districts were still not treated nearly six

years later. The reason for this expansion to new provinces and districts, rather than to the control group,

was that the Indonesian government chose to prioritize the expansion of the program to new areas such that

the program would be spread throughout the country rather than focused intensely in a small number of

geographic areas.

        For research, however, this presents a unique opportunity because the initial randomization of sub-

districts to treatment and control status continues to induce random variation in program placement six

years later. To study the impact of the program over this longer time horizon, in 2013 we re-surveyed

households that were in the initial experiment to measure medium-run outcomes. Notably, we found 95




3

conditional cash transfers in Latin American, concluding that the mixed results imply the need for more systematic
rigorous evidence.
percent of the original 14,326 households in the baseline survey. 4 We show that the experimental first stage

– the regression of whether a household is receiving PKH on whether the household’s sub-district was

randomized in 2007 to be in the treatment group – is strong (F-statistic over 400), and virtually identical in

magnitude six years after the program started compared to after just two years. This unique setup – where

the experiment continued to run at scale for over six years without any researcher intervention in program

implementation – allows us to examine whether the static effects of the program on targeted indicators

persist even as the program continues over time, as well as whether these human capital investments began

to accumulate over time as children grew up exposed to the program.

         We start by examining the effect of the program on health-seeking behaviors. For each outcome,

we present the results from our six-year follow-up. We also present corresponding results from the two-

year follow-up survey carried out by the World Bank, which we re-analyzed using exactly the same IV

regression specifications that we use in this paper, in order to compare results over time holding the

specification constant.

         We find that the conditional cash transfer program continued to have a substantial impact on

increased utilization of a number of health services, even after six years. For example, treated households

were more likely to have childbirth assisted by a skilled birth attendant (doctor or midwife; increased by 16

to 23 percentage points, depending on specification) and delivery at facility for those who had given birth

(increased by 13 to 17 percentage points). These are dramatic increases – they imply that the PKH program

reduced the share of children born without the aid of a skilled birth attendant by 69 – 100 percent. Pre- and

post-natal visits, as well as growth monitoring visits for children, increased at two years, but we can no

longer distinguish this effect from zero after six years; this may because the control group also increased

their overall number of visits in the intervening years and “caught up.” Conversely, while there was no



4
  The 95 percent follow up rate includes finding at least one household member. However, as we discuss in more
depth below, not all household members could be found in the same household (or somewhere else within the sub-
district). We found and interviewed 78 percent of all children who were aged 6-15 in the baseline survey; there is no
differential attrition nor any substantial differences in reason for migration (i.e., for work, to follow spouse, or for
school) between the treatment and control groups.
observable impact on immunizations in the short-run, we find that immunization rates increased by the six-

year follow-up—in fact, we observe a 8 to 10 percentage point – 15 to 19 percent – increase in the share of

children who have received the ‘complete’ set of immunizations for their age (where complete is defined

by the Indonesian Ministry of Health guidelines.). On net, many health-seeking behaviors continued to be

substantially increased by the PKH program at the six-year mark, despite overall secular improvements in

health seeking behaviors throughout our sample area.

        Turning to actual health outcomes for young children, which may reflect cumulative health

investments over multiple years, we find very large impacts on children’s propensity to be stunted or

severely stunted in the six-year follow-up. In fact, we observe a 23 to 27 percent reduction in the probability

of being stunted (defined as being 2 standard deviations less than the WHO’s height-for-age standard), and

a 56 to 62 percent reduction in the probability of being severely stunted (3 standard deviations less than the

WHO’s height-for-age standard). There were no detectable stunting effects in the two-year follow-up,

which suggests that cumulative health investments over several years may be important. We find no impact

on malnourishment (low weight-for-age); weight-based measures respond more quickly to nutrition and

health status, whereas stunting is thought to respond to early childhood conditions over a period of several

years (UNICEF 2013; Hoddinott et al. 2013). We do not observe any effects on parent-reported measures

of acute illness of children under 5, such as diarrhea, fever, or coughs in the last month.

        We then turn to investigate education outcomes. We begin by examining outcomes for the younger

age cohorts, for whom the program explicitly seeks to incentivize enrollment and attendance. Overall,

school enrollment rates for the targeted age group – 7-15 year olds – are about 4 percentage points higher

for the treatment than for the control group in the six-year follow-up. Since 92.4 percent of children of this

age in the control group sample are already enrolled in school, this means that the program eliminated 53

percent of non-enrollment. This is slightly less than in the two-year follow-up, where the program increased

enrollment by 6 to 7 percentage points, eliminating 66 to 70 percent of non-enrollment, but still shows that

the program was able to halve the percentage of children who were not in school.
         To capture the cumulative effects of educational investments, we look at impacts on older children

– aged 15-21 at the time of our surveys, who were in the target age range (aged 9-15) at the time PKH

began. We find evidence that children aged 15-17 were about 10 percentage points more likely to still be

enrolled in school. We also find some evidence that high school completion rates increased – by between

4 and 7 percentage points, representing a 16 to 29 percent increase. We find no evidence that this translated

to a higher likelihood of wage employment for those aged 18 to 21 years, however, nor do we find impacts

on early marriage. 5

         Lastly, we look at household consumption and assets to explore the program’s effects on the

households’ current condition. Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio-Codina (2012) find that PROGRESA

households invested a fraction of accumulated transfers in productive assets, which could affect the overall

poverty status of the household. However, we find no evidence of this here. While the point estimates of

the impact on consumption are positive, we cannot distinguish the measured impacts from zero; we also

cannot reject effects equal to the size of the transfer, which was about 7 percent of household consumption.

What we can rule out, however, are transformational impacts on household consumption: given our

confidence intervals, we can reject that household per-capita consumption increased by more than about 10

percent. We also find no observable effect on productive household assets, such as livestock owned, or on

fixed assets, such as land.

         In short, PKH continued to have impacts on the incentivized health and educational investments of

households six years after program introduction: in particular, it continued to impact primary and secondary

school education attainment and deliveries in a facility by trained birth attendants. This occurred despite

the fact that the level of benefits fell from 14 to 7 percent of monthly household consumption. This also

occurred after initial researcher involvement was over, and the program was run by the government with

business-as-usual practices. Perhaps more importantly, with the continued investment in children over time,



5
 Note that unlike the results on stunting, where children were on PKH most of their lives, the children in the 15-21
age category were older to begin with when PKH started. If we believe the cumulative effects come from PKH’s
focus on early childhood, these children are less likely to be impacted than the younger children.
we now begin to see some substantial results on “cumulative outcomes.” In particular, stunting was greatly

reduced, suggesting large health gains. Moreover, for high school-age children, school enrollment and

completion increased. On the other hand, we see no transformational effects over six years of repeated cash

transfers on the incomes of the beneficiaries themselves. Combined, this suggests that if conditional cash

transfers are going to indeed break the cycle of poverty, this effect is going to happen through impacts on

the subsequent generation, rather than through impacts on households themselves.

        The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. We describe the setting, experimental design, and data

in Section II. We provide the findings in Section III, while Section IV concludes.



II. SETTING, EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, AND DATA

A. Program

In this paper, we study the cumulative (six-year) effects of Indonesia’s conditional cash transfer program,

Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH or “Hopeful Family Program”). Launched in 2007, the program provides

quarterly cash transfers to very poor households with children or pregnant and/or lactating women, with a

fraction of the payment conditional on fulfilling a number of health- and education-related obligations. The

goal of the program was two-fold: “(a) to reduce current poverty and (b) to improve the quality of human

resources among poor households” (Alatas 2011).

        Extremely poor households (Rumah Tangga Sangat Miskin) were targeted under the program. To

determine their eligibility, Statistics Indonesia (BPS) surveyed households that were either included in the

2005 targeted program lists or identified as part of their sweep for poor households; the survey included 29

asset and demographic questions. They applied a proxy means test formula to this survey data, and

households that were below a pre-determined cutoff were deemed to be financially eligible. Out of these,

Statistics Indonesia kept households that additionally met the demographic requirements: households with

a pregnant and/or lactating woman, households with children aged 0-15 years, and households with children

aged 16-18 years who have not yet completed 9 years of basic education.
        Eligible households began receiving quarterly cash payments through the nearest postal office. The

amount of cash was designed to be about 15 to 20 percent of annual household income, depending on the

age of the children; the minimum payment per transfer was 600,000 Rupiah per household, while the

maximum was 2,200,000. In order to receive the payments, households had to complete a number of

conditions. For example, households with children aged 0 to 6 needed to ensure that children complete

childhood immunizations and take Vitamin A capsules a minimum of twice per year, and also must take

children for growth monitoring check-ups (see Appendix Figure 1 for the full list of conditions). Trained

facilitators would provide the beneficiaries with information and advice, and also verify the conditions:

one violation would result in a warning letter, a second violation would lead to a 10 percent cut in benefits,

and a third violation would lead to program expulsion. However, in practice, the verification system did

not begin until at least 2010, and even afterwards, the conditions were not always enforced.



B. Sample, Experimental Design and Timing

The Government of Indonesia piloted and tested PKH across six provinces (West Java, East Java, North

Sulawesi, Gorontalo, and East Nusa Tenggara) and the capital city of Jakarta. Within each province, the

government excluded the richest 20 percent of districts, and then determined which sub-districts within the

remaining districts were “supply-side ready” (based on availability of midwives, doctors, and middle

schools) to participate in the program. A total of 736 sub-districts were included in their sample, with 438

sub-districts randomized to the treatment group.

         Out of these, 360 sub-districts were randomly chosen for data collection (180 treatment, 180

control). Appendix Figure 2 shows the distribution of sub-districts across the provinces and experimental

assignments. Note that they are spread across Indonesia—specifically, on and off Java—and thus capture

important heterogeneity in culture and institutions (Dearden and Ravallion 1988).

        As shown in Appendix Figure 3, The World Bank conducted a baseline survey in June to August

2007, and the program was launched in these sub-districts soon afterward. The World Bank conducted a

follow-up survey from October to December 2009, about two years after the start of the program; the results
are described in Alatas (2011). We conducted a follow-up survey in September to November 2013, about

six years after the intervention.

        The evaluation we conduct is possible because subsequent program expansions kept the control

group largely intact. Appendix Figure 4 shows the evolution of the PKH program over the time period that

we study based on administrative data on the program’s expansion. In 2009 (two-year follow-up), the

program was operating in 99 percent of the locations randomized to treatment, and in 22 percent of locations

randomized to control – which implied a sub-district-level ‘first stage’ of 77 percentage points in 2009. By

2013 (six-year follow-up), the program had expanded somewhat, but the experiment still remained intact –

the program was operating in 99 percent of locations randomized to treatment, and in 39 percent of locations

randomized to control, for an implied sub-district-level ‘first stage’ of 60 percentage points. Thus, after six

years, the original sub-district-level randomization still had substantial bite. Moreover, because the program

reached fewer households in areas in the control sub-districts that received the expansion between 2009 and

2013, the first stage for receiving PKH at the household level is virtually identical in both 2009 and 2013.

As described below, we use the original randomization as an instrument for treatment.



E. Data, Data Collection and Experimental Validity

The World Bank collected both a baseline survey and initial follow-up survey in the 360 sub-districts to

assess PKH’s short-run program impacts (see Alatas 2011 for more details). These surveys were conducted

using the same survey instruments as, and in tandem with, the evaluation of the Generasi community block

grant program, which was being carried out in 300 separate sub-districts but was targeting similar indicators

(see Olken, Onishi, and Wong 2014).

        As shown in Appendix Table 1, 14,326 households (73,578 individuals) were surveyed at baseline

in the 360 sampled sub-districts between June and August 2007. To create this sampling frame, 8 randomly

selected villages were drawn from each sub-district, and then one sub-village was selected within each
village. 6 From within each village, four households were randomly selected from the government’s

interview lists, stratified such that two households included a pregnant or lactating mother or a married

woman who was pregnant within the last two years and the other two included children aged 6-15 years of

age. Note that since the survey was conducted in both treatment and control areas (and we do not know

who would have received PKH in the control areas), households were randomly selected to be surveyed

from the initial asset listing (not the beneficiary list), so not all households would have ultimately received

PKH. There was very little attrition of households in the first follow-up that was conducted from October

to December 2009: 13,971 (97.5 percent of baseline) were found and surveyed, and households that split

and moved within the sub-district were also surveyed. Both the baseline and follow-up survey included a

consumption module, demographics, assets, education, and health outcomes. Additionally, they included

anthropometric data (height and weight measurements) for children aged 0 to 36 months in the baseline

survey, and for children aged 0 to 60 months in both follow-up surveys.

         This paper focuses on the medium-run follow-up, which we conducted from September to

November 2013. The survey tracked the original households included in the baseline, collecting the same

data as in the baseline and first follow-up. Overall household attrition was again low: 13,619 households

or 95.1 percent of baseline households were found, with the attrition rates nearly identical across the

treatment and control groups (see Appendix Table 1). 7

         While household attrition was low, it could be that some household members left the sub-district

and thus are not accounted for in the survey. This is not an issue for the young children who were born

after the baseline, since we measure all children present in any household we track, and we track 95 percent




6
  If there were less than 8 villages sampled in a sub-district (since there were not enough eligible households in enough
villages), or if there were less than 5 potential households to survey in the sub-village, additional sub-villages from
the same village were randomly selected.
7
  We followed entire households or household members that moved within the same sub-district. In addition, we
surveyed 362 households that were added to the sampling frame in the two-year follow-up, and 751 households that
were added in the six-year follow-up, in order to compensate for household attrition.
of baseline households. Thus, attrition should likely not be a concern for outcomes like completed

vaccination or stunting. 8

         However, it could, potentially, be relevant for the oldest children at baseline, who are now teenagers

and young adults and could migrate for school, work, marriage, or other reasons. Thus, this could be more

of an issue for results such as high school completion or teenage marriage. Therefore, in Appendix Table

2, we examine attrition for those who were initially aged 6-15 years in the baseline. We find and re-survey

90 percent at the two-year follow-up (Column 1) and 72 percent at the six-year follow-up (Column 2), but

with no differential attrition between the treatment and control group in either survey. There do not appear

to be large differences in attrition in the six-year survey between boys and girls (Columns 3 and 4).

         We can further disaggregate by age at baseline to determine if attrition is worse for older children,

who may be more likely to leave the household for work or marriage. In Appendix Table 3, we observe that

attrition does indeed increase with baseline age. However, this attrition does not appear differential by

treatment group: only 4 out of 40 regression coefficients are significant, which is consistent with chance.

Moreover, for those household members who moved outside of the sub-district within the 12 months before

the survey was conducted, we additionally have information on whether they migrated for work, school, or

to follow a spouse. As shown in Appendix Table 4b, we observe no differences in the reasons for child

migration across the treatment and control group. In short, while older children were more likely to have

migrated than younger children, the probability of migration, as well as the reasons for doing so, do not

appear to be associated with treatment status.

         Finally, Appendix Table 6 shows that the final sample is balanced across treatments in terms of

baseline characteristics. In Column 2, we provide the control group mean for the variable listed in that row,

while Column 3 provides the mean for the treatment group. Column 4 provides the difference between the

treatment and control for that variable (clustered by sub-district, which is the level of randomization) and



8
  An alternative concern for the younger children is that PKH affects differentially affects infant mortality and this
biases the results for the young children. However, this does not appear to be the case: In Appendix Table 5, we show
that there was no observable difference in miscarriage, stillbirth, or infant mortality rates in either follow-up survey.
Column 5 provides this difference conditional on strata (districts). Of the 14 variables considered, no

differences are statistically significant at the 10 percent level. Nonetheless, although our sample appears

balanced, we included household-level baseline controls in our analysis for improved precision (discussed

below).



III. RESULTS

In this section, we first outline our empirical strategy and show the first stage results. Next, we describe

our results on health-seeking behaviors and health outcomes, and then we turn to educational and

employment outcomes.          Finally, we examine impacts on overall household consumption and asset

acquisition.



A. Empirical Strategy and First Stage Results

As discussed above, while compliance with the randomization protocol was generally high, it was not

perfect, and there were some control areas that were treated. In addition, households on Statistics

Indonesia’s interview lists were sampled in both treatment and control areas, but in treatment areas, only a

subset of these households ultimately became beneficiaries of PKH, as there was a subsequent screening

step to determine PKH eligibility. 9 Therefore, we conduct an instrumental variable analysis in which we

instrument receipt of PKH (𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅ℎ𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ) with whether households were initially located in a treatment

sub-district:

                 𝑌𝑌ℎ𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝐾𝐾𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝑿𝑿′ℎ𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝜸𝜸 + 𝛼𝛼𝑑𝑑 + 𝜀𝜀ℎ𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠                 (1)

Y is the outcome of interest for household h in sub-district s in district d. 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅ℎ𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is a dummy

variable for whether the household has ever received PKH, while 𝛼𝛼𝑑𝑑 is a set of district fixed effects. For

additional precision, we include the following baseline control variables 𝑿𝑿ℎ𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 : house roof type, wall type,

floor type, head of household’s education level, head of household works in agriculture, head of household


9
 We cannot restrict our sample to those who ever received PKH. We know who was ultimately chosen off the Statistics
Indonesia list in the treatment group, but we do not know who would have been chosen in the control group.
works in services, household has clean water, household has own latrine, household has square latrine,

household has own septic tank, household has electricity from the state electric company (PLN), log

monthly per-capita expenditure, and log household size. 10 We cluster the standard errors by sub-district,

the level of the randomization. We adjust p-values for multiple hypothesis testing within each panel of

results using the stepdown method of Romano and Wolf (2005; 2016), and report any cases where such

adjustment changes the statistical significance of the results. 11

         To potentially improve our precision, we run a second instrumental variable strategy in which we

instrument whether a household has ever received PKH with the initial sub-district treatment status as well

as the initial treatment status interacted with the baseline demographic and asset variables discussed above.

We do this because we know that households were more likely to receive PKH if they were both in a treated

sub-district and passed the proxy means test, which was a function of a household’s assets; thus, this

specification should theoretically increase our ability to predict who was ultimately a PKH beneficiary.

         Table 1 provides our first-stage estimates. In Columns 1 and 3, we provide first-stage coefficients

on the treatment variable for our simple instrumental strategy; in the last row, we also provide the F-statistic

from a test of the instrument. Column 1 replicates the World Bank’s estimates from the two-year follow-

up for comparison, while Column 3 provides our six-year follow-up results. In Column 2 and 4, we provide

the F-statistic for all instruments (treatment status and treatment status interacted with baseline controls)

for the short-run and medium-run estimates (Appendix Table 7 provides the full set of coefficient estimates

for the fully interacted regressions).

         The regressions show a strong – and almost identical – first stage in both the short-run and medium-

run. By the two-year follow-up (Column 1), about 9 percent of the control group reported receiving PKH,

with a 37.5 percentage point increase in the treatment group (p-value less than 0.001). The results are


10
   When we have missing baseline data, we fill in the controls with zero and create a dummy variable for the missing
variable.
11
   We do this within each family of outcomes, grouped by column-panel. The finding qualitatively remain the same,
with two changes—percentage of immunizations for age in Column 3 of Table 2 is no longer significant, and milk
and egg expenditure in Column 2 of Table 7 is only significant at the 10 percent rather than the 5 percent level. For
conciseness, we list these changes in significance after multiple hypothesis testing adjustment in the table notes.
similar in 6-year follow-up (Column 3), with a 36.8 percentage point increase in the probability of receiving

PKH in the treatment group relative to the 13.1 percent of households having ever received PKH in the

control group (p-value less than 0.001).

         It is important to note that the randomization is at the subdistrict level, and hence control households

come from other subdistricts. Virtually all health and education services (health clinics, schools) are

contained within subdistricts, so spillovers across subdistricts are extremely unlikely in this context, and

indeed, this was the reason the randomization was done at such a high level.

         A second question is whether there are spillovers to non-treated households within treated

subdistricts. This assumption of no within-subdistrict spillovers is important for the exclusion restriction

implicit in estimating equation (1) with instrumental variables. While in other contexts this has been a

concern – see, e.g. Angelucci and di Giorgi (2009) in the PROGRESA case, there are two reasons why even

within-subdistrict spillovers seem very unlikely here. First, unlike PROGRESA, which treated over 60

percent of households in treatment villages, PKH was targeted at the poorest of the poor households, and

as such treated a far smaller fraction of households in a village – in 2009, for example, the typical treated

village had only 78 PKH beneficiary households out of a mean of 1200 households, meaning PKH treated

only 6.5 percent of households in a village on average. General equilibrium effects (e.g. congestion at

schools or health clinics, or positive spillovers through supply-side changes) are therefore likely to be very

small in our case given how small the share of treated households is. 12 Second, our alternate identification

strategy uses baseline assets interacted with sub-district-level treatment status to predict treatment at the

individual level, not at the aggregate level; as shown below, however, this produces very similar results to

the univariate treatment-vs-control sub-district instrument (and in particular, these results are not




12
  Moreover, given this, one would expect that the average effect on a non-beneficiary household is therefore likely at
least an order-of-magnitude smaller than the average effect on beneficiary households. Since our household survey
intentionally sampled households who were likely to be beneficiaries, beneficiary households about 50 percent of the
sampled households in the treatment area. This means that the average effect in our sampled households will be driven
almost entirely by the effect on treated households.
systematically smaller than the univariate results), suggesting empirically that spillovers are very small in

our context.



B. Impacts on Incentivized Health-Seeking Behaviors

In Table 2, we report IV estimates of the effect of receiving PKH on incentivized health-seeking behaviors.

We estimate separate regressions for each outcome of interest listed in each row. Our key estimates from

the six-year follow-up survey are shown in Columns 3 and 4; each cell presents the IV effect of PKH

treatment analyzed using equation (1). For ease of comparability, in the first two columns we show the

results from the two-year survey conducted by the World Bank, which we re-analyzed using the same IV

specification as (1). In Columns 1 and 3, we instrument ever receiving PKH with the sub-district-level

treatment vs. control randomized assignment, while in Columns 2 and 4 we instrument receiving PKH with

the randomized treatment assignment and the treatment assignment interacted with baseline characteristics.

All standard errors are clustered at the sub-district level, and we include household level baseline controls

and strata (district) fixed effects as control variables. 13

         Note that for many of these health-seeking behaviors, they could have easily been moved in the

short-run (e.g. pre-natal visits, or good deliveries) and, indeed, Table 2 shows significant improvements

across many of the indicators in the short-run.

         However, our analysis also shows continued effects of PKH on health-seeking behaviors in the

medium-run, particularly with regard to maternal health-seeking behaviors. In Panel A, we first examine

health-seeking outcomes for women who became pregnant or gave birth within the 24 months prior to each

follow-up survey. We find that PKH continued to have large, positive effects on the probability that



13
  Our results are robust to the model specification choices that we made. For example, in Appendix Tables 8 and 9,
we replicate Tables 2 and 3 using “currently receiving” PKH, rather than “ever received” PKH, as our variable of
interest, because some households received PKH in the two-year follow-up survey but had stopped receiving it by the
six-year follow-up; the results look nearly identical (which is not surprising given the overlap of households in both
categories is high). Similarly, in Appendix Tables 10, 11, and 12, we replicate Columns 1 and 3 from Tables 2, 3,
and 4, but drop baseline controls (we cannot drop baseline controls from our IV strategy in Columns 2 and 4 since
they rely on the interactions of treatment status with the controls). Again, we find similar coefficients, but sometimes
we lose some statistical precision when omitting the baseline controls.
childbirths were assisted by trained personnel (doctors or midwives) in the six-year follow-up, and that

deliveries were more likely take place in a health facility for those who have given birth. In fact, PKH led

to a 13 to 17 percentage point increase in delivery at a health facility at the six-year follow-up (18 to 24

percent increase; p-value 0.045 in Column 3 and 0.01 in Column 4), even qualitatively larger than the

impact seen at two years (8 - 11 percentage points; 19 to 25 percent increase; p-values 0.10 and 0.07).

However, unlike in the short-run, we do not find impacts on pre- and post-natal visits. This could be because

the control group increased their overall number of visits in the intervening years (for example, the control

mean increased from 6.6 to 7.3 pre-natal visits) and essentially caught up to the treatment group. In terms

of the care women and children received, we observe no difference in receiving a full set of iron pills during

pregnancy, either in the two- or six-year follow-up.

        Health inputs into young children (Panel B) also appear to have improved in the medium-run for

children who had ever been covered by PKH since the baseline survey. Importantly, while there was no

observable impact on immunizations in the two-year follow-up survey for children in our baseline sample,

we find that immunization rates increased by the six-year follow-up survey (p-values 0.11 and 0.02). In

fact, we observe about a 5 percentage point increase in the percent of necessary immunizations completed

for age (p-values .09 and .04). We observe no increase in the number of times children between the ages

of 6 months and 2 years received Vitamin A. However, we observe increases in the number of times a child

was weighed by a health professional in the last 3 months (for those aged 0 to 60 months), though these

increases are no longer significant and smaller in the six-year follow-up (p-values 0.19 and 0.17) compared

to the two-year follow-up (p-values both less than 0.01).



C. Impacts of PKH on Health Outcomes

Anthropometric Impacts. The results thus far have shown that health-seeking behaviors continued to be

positively affected by the PKH program, on top of some overall improvements in health-seeking behaviors

over this period. This implies that at the time of the six-year survey, young children (those under 5 years

old) had spent their entire lives accessing improved health services at various points in their life cycle. A
natural question is whether this increased health utilization accumulated and led to changes in health

outcomes.

         We examine this question in Table 3. The regression specifications and table format are similar to

those of Table 2. We explore anthropometric outcomes for children aged 0 to 60 months in Panel A, as

well as their parent-reported acute health outcomes in Panel B. We then examine maternal knowledge

outcomes pertaining to early child health in Panel C.

         We start by examining measures of stunting. Stunting is considered a measure of cumulative health

investments during the first few years of life (Hoddinott et al. 2013; Jayachandran and Pande 2017); it is

also thought to be correlated with worse cognitive and economic outcomes later in life (Case and Paxson

2008; Gluwwe and Miguel 2008; Hoddinott, Maluccio, Behrman et al. 2011; Guven and Lee 2013), and as

such is a major policy interest. We follow WHO definitions and define stunting as being more than 2

standard deviations below the WHO-standardized height-for-age median; severe stunting is defined as

being more than 3 standard deviations below the WHO-standardized height-for-age median.

         We observe very large reductions in stunting among children aged 0 to 60 months in the six-year

follow-up survey. Stunting declined by roughly 9 to 11 percentage points, representing a 23 to 27 percent

reduction in the probability of being stunted (p-values 0.02 and less than 0.01). Severe stunting declined by

approximately 10 percentage points (p-values both less than 0.01), representing a 56 to 62 percent

reduction. 14 Both boys and girls benefited from PKH in terms of decreased stunting and severe stunting,

although the point estimates are slightly larger in magnitude for boys than for girls (see Appendix Table

13). While the point estimates indicate stunting reductions of about 2 to 3 percentage points after the

program had been in effect for two years, these estimates are not statistically significant (p-values 0.42 and

0.45).




14
   Appendix Figure 5 estimates the impacts on stunting non-parametrically by child age, and finds similar reductions
in stunting across the 0- to 60-month-olds in our sample. If anything, the figures suggest somewhat larger reductions
in stunting on older cohorts.
         We observe no impacts on malnourishment overall (weight-for-age more than 2 standard deviations

below WHO standards)—which responds more quickly to health investments—in either the two- or six-

year follow-up (Panel A of Table 3). However, it is worth noting that when we break down the

anthropometric results by gender (see Appendix Table 13), we observe some evidence of reductions in

malnourishment for boys (p-values 0.37 and 0.03 for malnourishment; 0.16 and 0.03 for severe

malnourishment), which could be related to the larger reductions in stunting observed for boys. 15



Potential mechanisms for stunting effects. Given that PKH is a bundled intervention (cash + incentives)

that could affect many aspects of family life, it is hard to disentangle which specific channels could fully

account for the reductions in stunting. However, we next try to explore different factors that could affect

the results.

         First, it could be that the increased health-seeking behaviors (such as improved delivery and

increases in immunizations) that we observe in Table 2 could contribute to reductions in stunting, and it is

possible that these had cumulative effects over time.

         Second, we explore whether reported illness of the children has declined, under the hypothesis that

sick children would have more stunted growth paths. We investigate this in Panel B of Table 3. The results

show no declines in reported acute illness rates, such as diarrhea, fevers, or coughs for children under 5 in

either survey wave; if anything, the point estimates suggest increases in acute illness in the two-year follow-

up. To the extent we can measure these types of illness in our data, they thus do not appear to change in the

data in response to PKH.




15
  As Kanpal (2016) notes, most experimental evaluations to-date of CCTs have not shown large effects on stunting.
There are two exemptions. Fernald et al. (2008) looks at stunting in PROGRESA in 2003, comparing families who
were initially part of the 1997 with those in the control group (that received PROGRESA starting 18 months later)
and find that longer exposure to PROGRESA led to reductions in stunting. Kanpal (2016) experimentally measures
the effect the Philippines’s Pantawid program on stunting 30-31 months after its introduction, and finds similar effects
for children aged 6 months to 36 months. They argue that part of the reasons for the impact could be the program’s
focus on nutrition (particularly dairy) in family development sessions.
        Next, we explore whether mother knowledge and maternal health behaviors changed as a result of

PKH. These results are presented in Panel C of Table 3. We do observe that mothers in the treatment group

were much more likely to be able to report their child’s birthweight in our survey, perhaps a function of

increased deliveries in facilities or PKH’s focus on healthy child weight. We do not, however, observe any

changes in overall maternal knowledge of behaviors that could affect child health and nutrition (see

Appendix Table 14 for a breakdown of the index). 16 Moving to maternal health behaviors, we show no

changes in self-reported breast-feeding practices (although these measures are fairly high to begin with)

and no observable additional household investment in sanitation (e.g. piped water, toilets, electricity) that

could affect child health (see Appendix Table 14).

        Finally, we explore changes in nutrition (see Appendix Table 16). We do find changes in child

nutritional protein intake in response to PKH, concentrated in dairy and eggs: we find that children 18-60

months were roughly 10 to 11 percentage points more likely to have consumed milk (p-values 0.01 and less

than 0.01), and 10 to 12 percentage points more likely to have consumed eggs (p-values both less than

0.01), in the week prior to the two-year follow-up survey. We do not find similar results at the 6 year

endline, though confidence intervals cannot reject substantial positive effects.

        On net, while unpacking mechanisms is challenging, the constellation of results here – the increase

regular weight checks, increased maternal knowledge of birthweight, and increase protein consumption,

combined with the increase in weight-for-age for boys – all point to prolonged attention to weight and

nutrition over the early lifecycle as a potentially important channel for these results.



D. Impacts on Incentivized Primary and Junior Secondary Education




16
   In Appendix Table 15, we also explore whether young mothers (less than age 35) have increased autonomy over
decision-making, particularly around education and health. We observe that most families make decisions about
children together—with the mother reporting being involved in about 75-80 percent of these important family-life
decisions—and this increased further as a result of PKH. Women also reported being more likely to make decisions
alone regarding children’s health, both in the two- and six-year follow-up.
The second component of the PKH incentives are focused on education. We start by examining whether

the program continued to have effects in the six-year follow-up on the children currently explicitly targeted

by PKH: in Table 4, we look at enrollment and attendance for children aged 7-15 (Panel A), and then

disaggregate further by age 7-12 (Panels B and C) and age 13-15 (Panel D). In Section III-F., we examine

whether these educational investments had cumulative effects beyond the target period.

         Overall, we find increases in enrollment for all children, aged 7 to 15 (Panel A). In particular, we

find a 4 percentage point increase in enrollment rates in the six-year follow-up (p-values both less than

0.01). Since 92.4 percent of control group children were enrolled in school, the 4 percentage point increase

in enrollment rates represents a 53 percent decrease in the fraction of students who were not enrolled in

school; that is, PKH eliminated more than half of non-enrollments. This effect is similar (if slightly smaller)

to what was observed at two years – a 6.4 to 6.8 percentage point increase in enrollments (p-values both

less than 0.01), which represents a 66 to 70 percent decline in the non-enrollment rate. Moreover, we

observe increases in the percentage of children who report attending school at least 85 percent of the time

in the last two weeks, with effect sizes quite similar in both the two- and six-year follow-ups (p-values less

than 0.01 for both specifications in each follow-up survey). 17

         Looking at the effects by age group, we see that the six-year effects are concentrated among older

students (Panel D). For students aged 13-15, we see increases in school enrollments of 8 to 9 percentage

points (p-values both less than 0.01), representing a 47 to 52 percent decline in the non-enrollment rate. For

students aged 7-12, we see increases of 1.2 to 1.5 percentage points (p-values 0.11 and 0.05). Since the

control group enrollment rate for this age group is already high, at 97.2 percent, these effects also represent

similarly sized (43 – 54 percent) reductions in the non-enrollment rate. In sum, though the effects are




17
  Note that this attendance measure is defined as 0 for those non-enrolled in school. This measure therefore captures
the combination of enrollment and attendance decisions, since both can respond to PKH receipt. Appendix Table 17
examines the six-year effects for boys and girls separately. As shown in Panel B, younger boys receiving PKH are
more likely to be in school, while we find no effect for younger girls—however, girls have very high rates of
enrollment to begin with (98% are enrolled in some form of school). While somewhat larger in magnitude for older
boys than for older girls, we nonetheless observe treatment effects of PKH on the enrollment and attendance of both
older boys and girls (Panel D).
slightly smaller than were observed after two years, the conditional cash transfer remained highly effective

at reducing non-enrollment in school for those in the targeted age category.



E. Impacts on Child Labor

In Table 5, we examine whether these gains in schooling are associated with changes in child labor for the

same age groups. We do not find any changes for young children aged 7 to 12 (Panel A). However, this is

not surprising as only 1.6 percent of children in the control group report working for a wage at all, and only

0.4 percent report working more than 20 hours for wage in the past month. However, for older children

(Panel B), we find that the PKH program reduced the fraction of children engaged in wage work by between

3 and 4.4 percentage points (p-values 0.10 and 0.03). This represents a reduction of 34 – 48 percent. For

those working extensively, which we define as working for a wage at least 20 hours in the past month, the

effects are similar: reductions of between 2.4 and 3.0 percentage points (p-values 0.12 and 0.08),

representing a decline of 44 to 55 percent. As shown in Appendix Table 18, these reductions in wage work

are primarily found for boys, who are more likely to be working for a wage in general than girls are. 18

        The fact that we see both substantial increases in school enrollments and declines in wage work for

the same age groups suggests that the two effects may be related. This could be both through the children’s

time budget constraint (time spent in school is time spent not working), or due to income effects from the

PKH cash transfer (the income from the cash transfer means the family does not have as strong a need for

the child’s income). While it is hard to distinguish these effects, several facts are worth noting. In Appendix

Table 20, we show that PKH led to a decline in the number of students who were both enrolled in school

and working for a wage at the same time. We also see very small declines in the number of students who

were not enrolled but were working. Combined, these facts suggest that most of the effects we see on

enrollment and work are not coming from a time-budget constraint, where students are induced to switch



18
   In Appendix 19, we explore alternative measures of non-wage work. In the medium-run, we observe some
reductions in working more than 20 hours a month for a family business in for those aged 13-15 (but this is not
significant in all specifications) and no effect on “helping out at home.”
from work to school. While these facts do not necessarily separate price from incentive effects, they are

suggestive evidence that the income from the transfer may be a non-trivial part of the story.



F. Impacts on High School Education, Labor, Early Marriage, and Early Fertility

Our final set of results for children explores outcomes for children who were aged 9 to 15 when PKH was

initially rolled out, and hence are between ages 15 and 21 at the time of the six-year follow-up. This allows

us to explore the cumulative effects of PKH on final educational attainment and early adulthood outcomes

after the incentives have ended. These results are presented in Table 6. Note that we continue to provide

short-run outcomes, when possible, for comparison. 19

        We begin by exploring educational outcomes for this cohort, shown in Table 6, Panel A. We find

large increases in the probability of those aged 15 to 17 attending any kind of school in the six-year follow-

up (p-values both 0.02), with some of this effect driven by increases in high school enrollment. 20 We also

find some evidence of an increase in high school completion rates for those aged 18 to 21 (4 to 7 percentage

points, p-values 0.07 and 0.24). As shown in Appendix Table 22, most of the increases in educational

attainment for these age categories are driven by boys, who show very large impacts on high school

enrollment (9 to 13 percentage points, representing a 27 to 38 percent increase; p-values 0.04 and less than

0.01) and completion rates (4.9 to 9.7 percentage points; 21 to 42 percent increase; p-values 0.19 and 0.03).

We find no impact on high school enrollment or completion rates for girls.

        We then explore work outcomes for this age group, shown in Panel B of Table 6. We find no

impacts on the probability of wage work, for either 16- to17-year-olds or 18- to 21-year-olds. As shown in

Appendix Table 22, we find no effect for either boys or girls. For 16- to 17-year-olds, one might expect a

decrease in wage work due to the increases in school enrollment documented above; while we do not




19
   In particular, we omit outcomes for ages 18 to 21 from our reported two-year regressions, because virtually no
respondents who were aged 9 to 15 at baseline had reached age 18 by the time of the two-year follow-up survey.
20
   As shown in Appendix Table 21, we observe increases in 15-year-olds and 17-year-olds attending any type of
school. The high school effect appears largely driven by 17-year-olds.
observe this, as shown in Panel A of Appendix Table 23, we do observe some decreases in helping out with

the family business or housework (particularly for girls).

         For 18- to 21-year-olds, who are more likely to be out of school and who are more likely to have

completed a high school education, we may have expected higher employment rates for wage work.

However, this does not appear to be the case. We do observe that the boys within this age category were

more likely to help out with the family business (Columns 3 and 4 of Panel B of Appendix Table 23), while

girls were somewhat less likely to help out in any family business or housework (Columns 5 and 6). Note

that, as discussed earlier, these results do not appear to be driven by attrition, as we do not observe

differences between treatment and control either in the probability of leaving the district for these age

groups (Appendix Table 4) nor in the probability of leaving the district for work (Appendix Table 4b). It is

worth noting, however, that these 18- to 21-year-olds were already teenagers at the time PKH started, and

thus spent fewer of their formative years in the program than the young children for whom we observe

reductions in stunting.

         In Panel C, we explore whether PKH led to changes in age of marriage. Age of marriage could be

delayed from the income effect of PKH, or from a delay in marriage due to the practical side of being

enrolled in school longer. However, we find no evidence that PKH changed the propensity to marry for

those aged 16 to 17, or for those aged 18 to 21. Finally, we investigate changes in fertility (Appendix Table

24), and while we qualitatively observe postponement of births—decreases in fertility for girls aged 16-17

and increases for those aged 18-21—we cannot reject that these coefficients are different from zero.



G. Cumulative impacts on recipient households: Consumption, Work and Assets

PKH provides a small amount of cash to households each and every quarter for around 6 years. The cash

payment is around 7 to 15 percent of total household consumption, cumulatively adding up to between $360

and $1320 per household. 21 The next question we ask is whether this assistance was large enough to have


21
  Note that PKH initially aimed to provide beneficiaries with a cash transfer equal to about 15 to 20 percent of their
overall household consumption level. However, the nominal values of the transfer remained fixed, so the real value
a “transformative effect” on households, shifting them out of poverty, having a “transformative effect” One

mechanism for this could be that households save part of the transfers over time, and use this to invest in

productive assets. For example, Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio-Codina (2012) find that PROGRESA invested

a fraction of their accumulated transfers in productive assets.

         To examine this, in Table 7, we examine the impacts of PKH on household consumption, adult

employment, and household assets. 22 Panel A examines the impact on overall log per-capita consumption,

food expenditures, spending on alcohol and tobacco, and spending on health and education. We find no

statistically detectable impacts on any of these outcomes. Specifically, while we observe positive impacts

of PKH on overall household consumption and the other associated expenditure items, we cannot

distinguish these measured impacts from zero; on the other hand, we cannot reject an increase of

consumption equal to the amount of the PKH transfer at the six-year follow-up. Note that the fact that we

cannot detect changes in consumption due to PKH is not driven by heads of household choosing to work

less (and thus reducing consumption): as shown in Panel B, we find no effect on whether the head of

household was employed. In fact, even in the control group, nearly 94 percent of the control group was

employed regardless.

        We also examine whether PKH led to increases in assets as PKH transfers accumulated over time

(Panel B). We show that there was no change in land ownership; however, this is unsurprising as more than

90 percent of the control group owned land. However, we also find no observable effect on assets where

we might expect more movement, such as livestock ownership.

        The key point of these results is that we fail to find any measurable effects on the material

consumption of the recipient households themselves. While we cannot rule out effects on consumption

equal to the size of the transfer, the key point is that we do not see transformational effects for these

households. To the extent that the CCT program leads to substantially large changes in material household



of the transfer declined over time: our estimates suggest that PKH payments were about 7 percent of household
consumption by the six-year follow-up.
22
   In Appendix Table 25, we disaggregate expenditure outcomes by province and again find noisy estimates.
Nonetheless, the increase in log consumption appears largest in the relatively poorer province of East Nusa Tenggara.
welfare, these will likely come through the effects on the next generation, who experience increased health

and education, rather than a reduction in overall poverty of the current generation.



IV. CONCLUSION

The decision to redistribute through targeted transfers is a complex one. Some arguments are at core ethical,

arguing that a society should protect the vulnerable and give them some additional help. Others are

economic, arguing, for example, that increased spending by poorer households shores up economic demand,

or that transfers allow households to make business investments that can transformatively increase

household income and reduce poverty. Still others make arguments that are based on concerns about

inequality and its detrimental effects on intergenerational poverty, with transfers as a mechanism to help

increase investments in child health and education.

        In this paper, we estimate the six-year effects of a large-scale, government-run conditional cash

transfer program (PKH), which provides moderately sized, regular, financial assistance to households that

adhere to conditions that aim to improve investments in child health and education. We find that even

though the program has been running for six years—without any researcher involvement in later years, and

with a changing economic landscape over time—the program continues to promote health and educational

investments in children explicitly targeted by the program. For example, at six years, we continue (as

compared to a two-year follow-up) to observe increases in usage of trained health professionals for

childbirth, and PKH continues to halve the share of children aged 7 to 15 who are not enrolled in school.

        Perhaps even more importantly, for children who have grown up under PKH, we also begin to

observe impacts on outcomes that may require cumulative investments: for example, six years later, we

observe large reductions in stunting and some evidence of increased high school completion rates. While

this does not yet translate to increases in employment for individuals who have just started to age out of

PKH, these are children who were already teenagers at the time PKH started, and have thus spent fewer of

their formative years in the program. The stunting results suggest that effects may be larger in the very

long-run for children who benefited from the program during early childhood.
        In contrast, we do not observe any impact on PKH beneficiaries’ current consumption,

employment, or assets—suggesting that the additional help that PKH provides does not transformatively

reduce poverty for those currently on the program. Rather, given that our results show that CCTs help poor

households make significant investments in their children’s health and education, an important part of the

economic gains of CCTs likely could come from reductions in the intergenerational transmission of poverty.

Note: Each row in this table represents a separate outcome variable, with regression specifications corresponding to each
column of the table. Each table entry includes: 1) the regression coefficient, 2) the cluster-robust standard error, 3) the
number of observations, and 4) the control mean. Panel B regressions include age-bin controls for each month of age up to
1 year, and for each quarter-year of age for ages 1 and above, in addition to baseline controls and fixed effects listed in Ta-
ble 1. Adjusting p-values to control the family-wise error rate within each panel, as described by Romano and Wolf (2005;
2016), the effect on "% of immunizations received for age" in Column 3 is no longer significant; all other significant effects
remain significant. Standard errors, clustered by sub-district, are shown in parentheses.

children who, conditional on having completed primary school, continued on to secondary school. Baseline controls and fixed
effects are as listed in Table 1. Adjusting p-values to control the family-wise error rate within each panel, as described by Ro-
mano and Wolf (2005; 2016), all significant effects remain significant. Standard errors, clustered by sub-district, are shown in

Note: This table explores schooling, labor, and marriage outcomes for children who were between the ages of 6-15 (i.e., school-
ing age) during the baseline survey and initial program rollout. Outcomes for ages 18-21 are omitted from Columns 1 and 2
(2-year follow-up) because virtually none of these children had turned 18 by the time of the follow-up survey. Baseline controls
and fixed effects are as listed in Table 1. Adjusting p-values to control the family-wise error rate within each panel, as de-
scribed by Romano and Wolf (2005; 2016), all significant effects remain significant. Standard errors, clustered by sub-district,
are shown in parentheses.

Note: In the above graphs, we plot the effect of PKH receipt on stunting and severe stunting by children’s age (recorded in days) in the six-year follow-up survey. At each of 50 equally
spaced cutoff points along the x-axis, we estimate the IV regression coefficient and apply a triangular kernel smoother with bandwidth equal to 1/4 of the length of the x-axis. Red lines
                                                        indicate point estimates and grey bands indicate 95% confidence intervals.

Note: This table reports attrition outcomes for children in the 6-year follow-up survey, disaggregated by baseline treatment
status. Children in the baseline survey module (n = 18,947) were either tracked and surveyed in the 6-year follow-up ("Sur-
veyed") or attrited from the survey module for one of the reasons listed in the table. Column 4 lists two-sided p-values for the
difference between control and treatment groups for each outcome, clustered by sub-district.

Note: This table reports miscarriage, stillbirth, and infant mortality rates among women who had given birth within
24 months prior to each follow-up survey. Baseline controls and fixed effects are as listed in Table 1. Panel B regres-
sions also include month-of-birth controls for 24 months prior to the survey date. We omit child mortality outcomes
in Columns 2 and 4 because the sparsity of mortality observations prevents conducting regressions with the "Lottery
+ Assets" instrument. Standard errors, clustered by sub-district, are shown in parentheses.

Note: This table examines baseline differences between control and treatment sub-districts along several key outcome variables. Column 1
reports the number of observations of each outcome in the baseline sample. Columns 2 and 3 report the control and treatment group means, re-
spectively. In Column 4, we report coefficients of OLS regressions on baseline treatment assignment, with no other controls included. In Column
5, we repeat the regression and add district (kabupaten) fixed effects. Standard errors, clustered by sub-district, are shown in parentheses.

Note: This table explores the effect of PKH receipt on several different health and sanitation indicators. For the outcomes in Panel A, surveyed women aged
16-49 were asked a set of questions pertaining to proper feeding and childrearing practices. "Mother’s composite knowledge %" refers to the number of correct
answers (out of five) converted to a percent score. The following three outcomes pertain to the disaggregated questions. Panel B regressions include age-bin
controls for each month of age up to 1 year, and for each quarter-year of age between 1 and 5 years. Baseline controls and fixed effects are as listed in Table 1.
Standard errors, clustered by sub-district, are shown in parentheses. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

Note: This table explores various outcomes pertaining to women’s empowerment and status within the house-
hold, focusing on mothers younger than 35 years of age. Each pair of outcomes corresponds to a survey ques-
tion in which the respondent was asked who in the household is involved in making various decisions pertain-
ing to children. "Mother involved" outcomes indicate that a mother included herself on the list of household
members who were involved in making decisions, which may or may not include other household members.
"Mother alone" outcomes indicate that a mother listed only herself as involved in making such decisions. Base-
line controls and fixed effects are as listed in Table 1. Standard errors, clustered by sub-district, are shown in
parentheses.

Note: This table examines fertility rates among girls who were in our sample at baseline. Fertility status is de-
termined by whether baseline respondents have children listed in the household roster in each follow-up survey.
In Panel A, we examine outcomes for the entire sample, irrespective of province. In Panels B through E, we dis-
aggregate these results by province. Baseline controls and fixed effects are as listed in Table 1. Standard errors,
clustered by sub-district, are shown in parentheses.

Note: This table shows log per-capita expenditure outcomes disaggregated by province. Due to the small number of households
from DKI Jakarta and Gorontalo represented in our sample, we group these provinces with geographically adjacent provinces (West
Java and North Sulawesi, respectively) in the regressions shown above. Baseline controls and fixed effects are as listed in Table 1.
Standard errors, clustered by sub-district, are shown in parentheses.
