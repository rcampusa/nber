Anticipating the Stock Market Crash of 1929: The View from the Floor of the Stock Exchange

                                             ABSTRACT

In the months prior to the stock market crash of 1929, the price of a seat on the New York Stock Exchange
was abnormally low. Rising stock prices and volume should have driven up seat prices during the
boom of 1929; instead there were negative cumulative abnormal returns to seats of approximately
20 percent in the months just before the crash. At the same time, trading nearly ceased in the thin
markets for seats on the regional exchanges. Brokers appear thus to have anticipated the October 1929
crash, although investors in the market apparently did not recognize this information.

         On October 3, 1929, John D. Rockefeller sold his right to a quarter of a new seat

on the New York Stock Exchange for $125,000. Only a few days before on September

26, 1929, J. P. Morgan and Junius S. Morgan, Jr. had sold their rights for the same price,

which represented the highest real price that would ever be paid for a seat on the

exchange.1 Like other members of the exchange they had received these rights on

February 18, 1929 in a plan to expand the capacity of the exchange and meet the flood of

orders that flowed from the stock market boom (Davis, Neal and White, 2005). While

not active brokers, they, like at least another hundred wealthy men, reserved the option to

appear on the floor of the exchange to intervene directly in the market if a merger, proxy

fight or perhaps a panic loomed. These titans of industry and finance could have sold

their rights at any time beforehand, but they held on to them. Their sales seem to have

been extraordinarily well-timed. The Dow Jones had reached its peak on September 3,

1929 and then began a slow decline. Rockefeller and the Morgans sold as the boom

deflated and just ahead of the collapses on Black Thursday October 24 and Black

Tuesday October 29, 1929 when the market lost 23 percent of its value.

         While neither Rockefeller nor the Morgans left any hint of whether their timing

was prescient or lucky, their sales raise the question whether the brokers knew something

about the state of the market in September and early October 1929 that the investing

public did not.        Brokers would certainly be classified among the more informed

participants in the market. A large literature in finance claims that brokers have valuable

 The price of a seat for the purchasers Charles J. Collins and Andrew J. Fox, Jr. who put together four
quarter seats was thus $500,000. Just before the distribution of the quarter rights in the week ending on
January 24, 1929, the price of a seat first reached its peak $625,000; ex-rights, the price would have been
$500,000. The 2005 price of a 1929 $500,000 seat adjusted by the CPI or the GDP deflator would be $5.7
million or $4.7 million respectively, while the highest nominal price attained was $4 million in December
2005.

private information because they observe order flows, permitting them to profit

strategically from timely trading or market making. Did the brokers suspect that there

was a bubble in the market that was in danger of collapse?      A quick sell-off of rights to

a seat and a precipitous fall in the price of a seat on the exchange would be evidence that

these insiders knew that trouble loomed ahead, while an “excessively” high seat price in

the presence of declining share prices might be an indication that brokers were exhibiting

the same mistaken exuberance as their customers.

       Examining seat prices and the abnormal returns to seats on the NYSE, the New

York Curb Exchange and several regional exchanges, this paper considers the possibility

that brokers anticipated the crash. It appears that they became quite cautious by July

1929 and were paying far less for a seat than might otherwise seem justified by the rising

volume of trading, higher securities prices and other positive indicators. In the months

preceding the crash, qualitative evidence suggests that buyers were increasingly very

young and relatively inexperienced.       Brokers on the Curb Exchange in New York

exhibited a similar disbelief as the prices paid for seats on their exchange fell far short of

forecast prices. Regional stock exchanges were also swept up in the 1928-1929 boom;

but unfortunately, the seats on the regional exchange were too illiquid to adequately

measure the determinants of their prices. Still, the prices of regional seats flattened after

mid-1929 and sales were scant, suggestive of a worry that the buoyant market would

collapse.

       The sobriety of the 1929 brokers stands in contrast to Keim and Madhavan’s

(2000) finding that brokers were excessively optimistic in the months before the 1987.

For the crash of 2000, inference is more difficult because the number of seats traded has




                                              3
diminished.2 Nevertheless, it appears that brokers during the most recent boom were

more like their brethren in 1929 and skeptical of the markets’ advance. NYSE seat prices

reached a high in August 1999 and then fell 13% before the peak of the Dow Jones Index

in December 1999, 25% before the peak of the Nasdaq in March 2000, and 37% before

the August 2000 high in S&P500.

         However, even though seats on the NYSE in 1929 appear to have signaled

brokers’ uncertainty about the future course of the market, this phenomenon did not

provide the public with enough information to revise its judgment about share prices.

Consistent with other studies (Schwert, 1977; Keim and Madhavan, 2000) seat prices do

not contain any information that would have allowed investors to forecast the behavior of

the stock market. Like other market anomalies, the lack of robust growth in seat prices

on all exchanges, as the stock market boom continued after mid-1929, should have given

observant investors some second thoughts about pouring more money into the market.

Yet, they may have just assumed that relatively low seat prices were caused by the

general increase in the number of seats and exchanges.                  Efforts by existing market

institutions to restructure themselves to respond to the huge order flow probably rendered

otherwise clear signals opaque.           However, the econometric evidence in this paper

indicates that, given the prices brokers paid, these men on the floor of these exhanges

were not sanguine about the markets continued upwards climb.

 Many seats are owned by large publicly traded companies and there is less turnover than when seats were
owned by individual brokers.

                   Bubbles and the Price of a Seat on the Exchange

       The debate over whether there are bubbles in the stock market has spawned a

large literature. It has proven extraordinarily difficult to provide a tight case for or

against the presence of a bubble in the market because fundamentals are difficult to

identify. As Flood and Hodrick (1990) pointed out, any test for a bubble is troubled by

the problem that the dynamics of asset prices with a bubble will not appear to different

from the dynamics when there is an omitted factor driving the fundamentals. Studies

which purport to find a bubble can be attacked for failing to find some missing

fundamental, while results where the conclusion is that there is no bubble are highly

sensitive to the choice of parameters (See White, 2006).

       While it is generally conceded that boom periods see an influx of new, often

younger, and less informed investors, many models employ only a representative agent.

Yet, we know that no matter how many optimists poured their money into the market,

skeptics were also present and must also have voted with their dollars. Thus, one of the

more potentially fruitful approaches is the identification of anomalies that may indicate

the presence of a bubble. Avoiding the problem of mis-identifying fundamentals, De

Long and Shleifer (1991) examined the prices of closed-end mutual funds, where the

fundamental value of a specific fund is simply the current market value of the securities

in the fund’s portfolio. They found that the median seasoned fund sold for a premium of

37 percent in the first quarter of 1929, rising to 47 percent in the third quarter, before

subsiding to 8 percent by December 1929. Contrary to the usual small discount generally

observed for closed end mutual funds, this huge premium is astonishing. Instead of

buying a fund that was above its fundamentals’ price, investors could simply have been




                                            5
purchased a portfolio of the underlying stocks or entrepreneurs could have created new

funds with the same stocks. The only consistent explanation is that investors were

excessively optimistic, suggesting the existence of a bubble.         Rappoport and White

(1994) found evidence in the market for brokers’ loans that lenders were very skeptical of

the height that the market had attained in late 1929. The extraordinary interest premia

and margin demanded on these loans suggest that lenders felt they needed this protection

against a potentially huge decline in the market.        Casting brokers’ loans as options

written by the lender and bought by the borrowers, Rappoport and White extracted the

volatility implied by the price of these loans as options, revealing the potential for a crash

on the order of 25 to 50 percent, well in advance of October 1929.

       Like brokers’ loans that carried high interest rate premia and margins, relatively

low prices for seats on a stock exchange when the market was booming is evidence of

contrarian expectations from individuals with their hand on the pulse of the market.

Seats on the exchange are assets whose prices reflect stockbrokers' expected future profits

from the special access to the market provided by a seat. As such, seat prices are

influenced by the volume, stock prices, technology, and the rules that govern trading on

the exchange. Although seats are capital assets, the number is fixed and they cannot be

sold short, making it more likely that a bubble can be observed (Keim and Madhavan,

2000). A rapid run up in the price of a seat may thus reveal the sentiment of the holders

regarding their trading for exuberant investors, while a depressed price may be an

indicator of a bearish outlook.




                                              6
        What did brokers expect in 1929? Figure 1 shows monthly indices of the Dow

Jones Industrial Average and the price of a seat on the New York Stock Exchange.3 The

value of a seat on the exchange roughly tracked the movement of stock prices through the

mid-1920s. At that point, volume on the exchange began to rise rapidly and seat prices

began their rapid ascent. On peak days, the exchange was flooded with orders and bid-

ask spreads began to widen. The leadership at the exchange feared that investors would

move to other exchanges and offered a modest proposal in 1925 to expand the 1,100 seat

exchange by 25 new seats. This plan was rejected by the membership; without any

action, the problems became chronic by 1928. On October 15, 1928, the president of the

exchange put forward a new proposal to expand the exchange by giving each member a

quarter-seat dividend that could be sold and bundled to create 275 new seats, thereby

expanding the membership by 25 percent. Davis, Neal and White (2005) have shown

that this bold plan eased the capacity constraint on peak load days, minimizing the

widening of the bid-ask spread. This fact was appreciated by the membership who saw

that the competitiveness of the exchange was thereby improved. In anticipation of sales

of these seats, seat prices rose and yielded a cumulative abnormal return to seat holders of

approximately 20 percent.

  There is higher frequency data. The NYSE Committee on Admissions (n.d.) recorded all transfers of
membership from 1879 to 1971 for each week ending Thursday, giving the price but not the actual day of
the transaction.

                              The publicly reported prices for NYSE seats did not adjust for the stock split and

              they were reported ex-right. Figure 1 corrects for this added value, showing the original

              and the adjusted series. Although adjusted prices did not sag as much as ex-right seat

              prices they do trend downwards from the beginning of seat sales until the end of June

              1929. This movement is puzzling. Perhaps brokers did not correctly anticipate the

              effects of increased competition from a 25 percent increase in the number of brokers or

              perhaps there was now more competition from the expansion of other exchanges in the

              United States.                    The stock market boom was still on and volume was high although the

              Dow-Jones’ rapid rise had moderated, as seen in Figure 1. But beginning in June 1929



                                                                                       8
and continuing until the beginning of October, the price of a seat recovered all its lost

value. Maybe the pessimism of the first half of the year turned into buoyant optimism?

A simple model of the pricing of seats provides some insight into this question.



                          Were NYSE Brokers’ Optimistic or Pessimistic?

         Seats on the stock exchange are capital assets whose price reflects the brokers’

expected future profits from the special access to trading on the floor of the exchange

offered to them by a seat.                The value of seats on an exchange is determined by the

volume of activity on the exchange and the degree of competition among traders on the

exchange and between the exchange and the rest of the market. The behavior of returns

to a seat on the NYSE and the expectations of brokers before the 1929 crash can be

studied by applying a basic capital asset pricing model and examining the cumulative

abnormal returns (Schwert 1977; Keim and Madhavan, 2000). Information from trading

activity is measured by the current and lagged volume, both over the last thirty days and

the change in the daily volume to capture both elements of trend and transitory factors.

Keim and Madhavan included additional factors, relative to size and value/growth from

Fama and French (1993), to identify the non-diversifiable risk of an asset.4 For this

period, there are proxies for the former but not the latter factor.                                  I estimated the

following regression:

                            k                                  k                      k
(1) Rt – rf, t =      +           i   (rm, t-i - rf, t-i) +          i Vol t-i   +          i   SizePrem t-i +   t
                           i =0                               i =0                   i =0

  They were a size premium, measured as the difference between a small stock return and a large stock
return, and a value growth factor, measured, as the difference in a portfolio of high to low book-to-market
returns. According to Fama and French (1993) firms that have high book-to-market ratios tend to have
lower and persistently lower earnings. They also find that size is related to profitability, as small firms tend
to have lower earnings on assets than big firms.

where Rt is the return on a seat on the New York Stock exchange over time t, rf, t is the

risk free rate, measured by the 3 to 6-month rate on U.S. Treasury notes and certificates

(Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Banking and Monetary Statistics,

1943, p. 460) or the 4 to 6-month commercial paper rate (Banking and Monetary

Statistics, 1943, p.450-451). The market return, rm, is the return on the Dow Jones

Industrials. The figures for daily and monthly volume are for the NYSE, and the size

premium is the difference in the returns between the Dow Jones index, an unweighted

index of 20 and later 30 of the very largest firms, and the Federal Reserve Board’s Index

(Banking and Monetary Statistics, 1943, pp. 480-481), a weighted stock market index

that includes several hundred stocks. It is conjectured that the greater the difference, the

greater the return on exchange seats as the business of the exchange focused on larger,

more prominent stocks.

                     Table 1 reports the monthly results for 1920-1933 and two sub-periods.5

          Although only one lag is used, the results are quite robust to various lag structures and

          alternate periods for the purpose of estimating seat prices or abnormal returns. Splitting

          the sample at the end of 1927 before the boom reveals that seat prices in this period

          responded to changes in market information as embodied in the Dow Jones quickly but

          5
              Regressions with weekly seat prices, but more limited independent variables, yielded similar results.


                                                                 11
                 not completely, given that               1    is less than one. After the crash seat returns responded

                 much more quickly. Yet, even in the pre-crash period seat returns are much more

                 sensitive than Keim and Madhavan found for the period 1973 to 1994 and Schwert found

                 for 1926-1972. Recent changes in volume appeared to have information for brokers as

                 seat prices responded to contemporary but not lagged changes in volume. The size factor

                 often has a significant effect of seat returns.

           The cumulative abnormal returns to NYSE seats from the monthly regression in

Column 3 of Table 1 are shown in Figure 2, which are measured as the cumulative

residuals from the regression.6 This figure reveals the rise in the returns for late 1928 and

early 1929. In an earlier paper, Davis, Neal and White (2005) argued that the rise in the

value of the NYSE that was a consequence of the announcement that the NYSE would

increase its capacity by 25 percent. This expansion would help the exchange cope with

its declining share of volume on the national market and its capacity constraints that

drove up bid-ask spreads and created delays on peak volume days. This optimism

appears to have been justified because after the 275 seat increase the bid-ask spread

moved much less when volume surged and the exchange regained some market share.

           Although observed prices of NYSE seats moved upward in the summer of 1929,

Figures 2 reveals that after February 1929, brokers slowly became less optimistic. For

the monthly data, the cumulative excess returns turned negative and by the summer of

1929 they totaled over 20 percent, implying that actual prices were far below what would

have been expected based on the surge in stock prices and volume. There is no recovery

until after the crash in October.

           This relative pessimism stands in contrast to Keim and Madhavan’s             (2000)

finding for the period before the Crash of 1987, when they found there were large

positive abnormal returns to seats in the 12 months before the crash followed by large

negative abnormal returns.           They argue that these findings are consistent with the

behavioral finance interpretation that seats, which are in limited supply and cannot be

sold short, exhibit occasional price bubbles.            To take a closer look at 1929, Figure 3

calculates the forecast price of a seat with the actual price, revealing this widening dollar

                     gap. By July 1929, the high share prices and ever higher volume implied that brokers

                     should have been willing to pay $675,000 for a seat, when the split-adjusted price was

                     only $575,000.

                                There are two possible explanations the apparent pessimism in Figures 3. First,

                     brokers might have erred in believing that the expansion of the exchange would increase

                     its aggregate value.            The increase in capacity may not have increased business

                     sufficiently to overcome downward pressure on the bid-ask spread. But, based on the



                                                                             14
results of Davis, Neal and White (2005), the added increase in volume following the

expansion appears to have outweighed the decline in bid-ask spreads. At the mean

volume prior to the expansion, the mean percentage bid-ask spread was 0.777 percent;

afterwards it was 0.759 percent. Trading was consistently higher month-by-month in

1929 compared to 1928. In July 1928, the market value of shares traded on the NYSE

was $52,903 million and in July 1929, it was $77,264 million (NYSE, Yearbook 1928-

1929, p. 123). In a naïve calculation, the implied profits would have been $411 million

for 1928 and $586 million for 1929, a greater than 25 percent increase. Thus, higher

earnings should have propped up seat prices. The alternative explanation, if their hopes

about the increased efficiency of the exchange were not disappointed, is that brokers may

have thought that the market was excessively exuberant. This second explanation seems

to be more credible as their negative feelings seemed to dissipate just after the crash. It

may be hard to read much into later events, but brokers, like other businessmen, also

seem to have become more hopeful of a recovery by late 1930.7

           Could any investor on the street watching the prices of seats on the exchange have

read this information, or was brokers’ pessimism in the seat market unheeded Cassandra-

like signals?       It is well known that stock returns have been found to be predicted by a

variety of observable market values, including the dividend yield, the Treasury bill yield,

the Term Structure and the book-to-market ratio (See: Campbell and Shiller (1988), Fama

and French (1988), and Keim and Stambaugh (1986)). Using monthly data, Keim and

Madhavan (2000) found that the information embedded in the innovations in the number

of seats traded on the NYSE, but not the seat prices themselves, had predictive power for

the S&P500 returns for 1973-1994. Their approach is employed using the regression

model in equation 2:

         Information from the market for seats on the NYSE is measure both as the lagged

innovation in the price of a seat and, following Keim and Madhavan, as the residuals

from a regression of the number of trades on trades lagged, the log of the last seat price

and the absolute seat return. The difference in returns between the Dow-Jones stocks and

all stocks traded on the NYSE is used again. In addition the yield on 3 to 6 month U.S.

Treasury securities and the term premium, the difference between the long-term yield and

the short-term yield are included (NBER Series 13029 and 13033, www.nber.org).

Rappoport and White (1993, 1994) find that the premium on brokers’ loans compared to

bankers’ acceptances or commercial paper represents the money market’s heightened

awareness of the risk in the market during the boom; hence, the difference between the

call loan rate and the rate on bankers’ acceptances is included in the regression. Lastly,

the dividend yield for Dow-Jones stocks is added (Rappoport and White, 1994).

         Table 2 reports the results for the regressions for several versions of equation 2.

Unlike Keim and Madhavan’s findings for the last quarter of the twentieth century,

neither changes in seat prices or news of seat trades appear to affect the returns on stocks.

These results were robust to increases in the number of lags and curtailing the data at the

end of 1927 to avoid the problem of the increase in the number of seats. The only

significant variables are the yield on short-term U.S. securities and the call loan premium.

The yield on government securities would have signaled tighter monetary policy in 1928


                                                      16
and elevated rate of call loans that stood at an historic 300 basis points for a long period

was a signal of the downside risk in the market, but nothing could apparently be gleaned

by the public from the trading activity in seats.

        These results confirm the findings for the post-World War II period of Schwert

(1977) and Keim and Madhavan (2000) that seat returns did not predict market returns,

although the latter found that seat activity does have information.      Specifically, they




                                             17
found that lagged innovations of trading volumes in the seat market predict the monthly

excess returns of the S&P500 after controlling for the dividend yield and book-to-market

ratio. Whether the information contained in the number of seats traded in the 1920s is

different, is not clear, as it may have been clouded by the big increase in the number of

seats.


                             Who Bought the NYSE Seats?


         Even with 1,110 members, the brokers on the exchange constituted a large old

boys’ club. Although anyone could buy a seat, a prospective member had to be presented

by one of the existing members. The Committee on Admissions took a close and hard

look at their character, rejecting those judged unfit by a blackballing process. Moser

(2006) has presented evidence that this process was sufficiently restrictive to permit some

ethnic discrimination and effectively raise the price to those affected groups, especially

during World War I when Germans and German-Americans were treated with great

suspicion.

         The expansion of the exchange by an additional 275 seats began in February

1929, and although many seats were quickly formed from the quarter-seat rights, it was

unfinished by the time of the crash and dragged on through the early 1930s. Part of this

delay is attributable to members holding on to their seats, hoping for a higher price; but

there also may have been a relative dearth of qualified members who would not have

been blackballed. It is unlikely that the expansion of the exchange did not lower the

experience and quality of the brokers and reduce discrimination, introducing brokers

perhaps more inclined to “irrational exuberance.” Many of the new brokers were able to




                                            18
get on the exchange sooner than they had expected, being already experienced workers

on the exchange or with partnerships whose members were active brokers.

         Reports in the newspapers give a fairly detailed picture of some of the new

members, even if they are impressionistic. The boom in the stock market was drawing in

some men who appear to have had little or no experience. Just before the seat dividend

in January 1929, Lee-Adam Gimbel, 32 years old, resigned as vice president of Gimbel

Brothers, Inc and bought a seat for $575,000; and though he remained a director of the

department store, he became an unaffiliated floor trader. (New York Times January 5,

1929, p. 15). As a floor broker, Gimbel traded on his own account, no doubt, hoping to

quickly make a fortune.8 Floor traders who had been in short supply (Davis, Neal, and

White 2005) were the most adventurous as they had to hustle on the floor, risking their

own capital, by matching incoming orders brought by other brokers, usually within the

bid-ask spread set by the market maker at the post. Two cousins Laurence C. Leeds and

Robert L. Leeds, both directors of the Manhattan Shirt Company, bought seats. (New

York Times January 12, 1929, p. 14.) to become independent floor traders. Others like

Frederic L. Yeager obtained a seat to become a floor trader for the firm of Sutro Brothers

& Co, a rapidly expanding Pacific Coast brokerage house with seats on the San Francisco

and Los Angeles Stock Exchanges as well as seats on the curb exchanges of those cities.

Seeking to get in on the booming New York market, Sutro Brothers bought the business

of Robinson & Co. in New York and transferred that firms’ membership on the exchange

to its New York representatives. (New York Times, January 18, 1929, p. 38).




8
  Later, in July 1929, he was joined floor by Louis S. Gimbel Jr., also a director for Gimbel Brothers, Inc.
in acquiring a seat.


                                                     19
       The seat dividend in February 1929 allowed more young men to move onto the

floor of the exchange. George F. Hawkins, a telephone clerk became one of the youngest

members of the exchange at the age of 22 when he was “rewarded” with a seat by his

employer, Ira Haupt & Co. (New York Times February 26, 1929, p. 42). Others came

from off the exchange. The New York Times (February 22, 1929) noted that James

Russell Lowell, a great-grandson of the poet bought four rights and became a member of

Wrenn Brothers.

       In the next several months, newspaper reports highlighted the arrival of young

men on the floor of the exchange. Telephone clerks, William C. Pressman bought a seat,

(New York Times, July 12, 1929, p. 35), as did George Dolan of Maxwell & Co.

Similarly, John Dempsey, a telephone clerk for Hoge Underhill & Co, put together a seat

in March 1929. Thomas F. Kelly had been a page on the floor of the NYSE for fourteen

years when he was able to buy four “rights” acquire a seat in July 1929 and become a

partner in the firm, Joseph & Co. that he had served. At the same time, Strother B. Purdy

a telephone clerk, James L. Slee an advertising salesman, and Paul Pryibil, a customer’s

man with F. B. Keech acquired seats. George C. Donelon who had been a specialist’s

clerk for only six months and was only 22 years old bought a seat in September 1929

(New York Times, September 23, 1929, p. 50).      However, there were some older men

who took the risk of buying a seat, and Justin A. Morrisey a tube man on the floor of the

NYSE since 1911 bought a membership in September 1929

       Members of brokerages also moved onto the floor, as did Harry C. Schaack of

Harris, Winthrop & Co (New York Times September 13, 1929, p. 43). Some new

members of the NYSE had previously served as brokers on the New York Curb. David




                                           20
H. McDermott, a member of the New York Curb firm of Peter P. McDermott & Co.,

obtained a seat (New York Times March 23, 1929, p. 32). Similarly, in July 1929, Harry

W. Asher Jr. a member of the New York Curb Exchange put together a seat from the

quarter-seat rights. Out-of-town brokerages used the seat-dividend to gain direct access

to the floor.   For example, William H. Bixby of George H.Walker & Co. of St. Louis.

and John F. Betts a member of John F. Betts & Co. of St. Louis acquired seats. Other

new brokers often came from non-brokerage firms, including Frederick T. Sutton and

Harold W. Jennys, who were investment bankers. (New York Times July 26, 1929, p.

31).

        Older members of the exchange may have been happy to relinquish their seats and

quarter-seat rights to more optimistic outsiders. If some members believed that they

observed a bubble in the market, this would have caused a downward shift in each

broker’s ask price. Even if potential buyers did become more exuberant, such a shift

would result in more trades with brokers who had a lower reservation bid price. Moving

down the schedule of bid prices one would encounter potential brokers who placed a

lower value on their human capital. Consequently, we would expect to observe younger

men buying seats if there was a bubble perceived by established brokers. While there is

no data compiled on the age and experience of brokers, the limited journalistic evidence

suggests an inflow of new and inexperienced younger men to the floor of the exchange.



                   The New York Curb and the Regional Exchanges

        The New York Stock Exchange was by far the most active market for securities in

the U.S. and had the largest number of brokers. However, the sheer growth of trading in




                                          21
the late 1920s threatened the NYSE’s dominance. It struggled to handle the soaring

volume of orders and lost market share until it increased its capacity from 1,100 to 1,375

brokers in 1929 (Davis, Neal and White, 2005). The other exchanges eagerly expanded

to capture orders for regional stocks and NYSE-listed securities.

       The New York Curb Exchange, which later became the American Stock

Exchange, was the second largest market.      Its 550 brokers traded many securities that

were not listed on the NYSE. The Curb brokers did not usually compete with the NYSE

but cooperated and served as a market for non-NYSE listed securities, with NYSE

members placing orders for unlisted stocks with Curb brokers. Thus, the Curb primarily

complemented rather than competed with the NYSE. Regional exchanges, on the other

hand, specialized in local stocks and competed for business with the New York

exchanges in its listed securities. The Curb exchange’s volume was only a fraction of the

volume on the NYSE; its aggregate value (the total value of its seats) was at most 10

percent of the NYSE’s aggregate value. Trading volume was even lower on regional

exchanges; taken all together their total volume approximated the volume on the New

York Curb. The smaller number of seats and the lower level of activity on the regional

exchanges and the Curb led to much less frequent trading in seats.

       The Commercial and Financial Chronicle provides data on the last traded seat

prices for the Curb and regional exchanges. Because of infrequent trading, some printed

regional exchange prices were very stale, as they could have been transacted months

before. The Chronicle sometimes also reported the bid-ask spread on the seats

(information not available for the NYSE in this period). Figure 4 displays indices of

                                 Paralleling the NYSE, the Curb market also experienced a meteoric rise in the

                      price its seats. Through the early 1920s and well into 1928, the prices of seats generally

                      followed the movement of volume on the Curb, as seen in Figure 4. Again resembling

                      the NYSE, seat prices begin to rapidly outpace volume growth by late 1928, jumping in

                      1929.      Indeed, Figure 4 suggests that the Curb market might have benefited from its

                      complementary role by the expansion of the NYSE. The NYSE’s increase in the number

                      of brokers primarily served to manage the rise in orders, to which new listings


                                                                     23
contributed modestly. In contrast, the Curb, as well as the regional exchanges, added

many new stocks to their boards during 1929; with the expectation of future trading from

these issues. Unfortunately, there is no monthly data on listings to adequately track these

changes.

        Business on the regional exchanges was also booming. The fastest growing

exchanges were Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles; and the two California

exchanges created their own curb exchanges to handle new start-up companies and less

seasoned stocks. Chicago had 225 seats, raised to 470 in October 1929; consequently, its

adjusted seat price is also reported in Figure 5. San Francisco had 70 seats and its Curb

had 100 seats. Los Angeles and its Curb each had 70 seats, increasing to 75 and 87 in

1929. The venerable Philadelphia exchange had 206 seats, and Baltimore and Boston had

87 and 139 respectively. The markets for these seats were very thin, where trades were

relatively rare.   It is thus much more difficult to determine what the expectations of the

brokers were in these markets given their illiquidity. This feature is reflected in the bid-

ask spreads that were quite wide. For example, the bid-ask spread measured from mid-

quote or the last transaction was 17 percent for Boston and Chicago and 25 percent for

the New York Curb.

                            Except for Baltimore, seat prices rose on all the regional exchanges in 1929.

               However, the strong bulls were Chicago and the West Coast exchanges and their new

               curb markets. Although Figure 5 displays rising prices on the regional exchanges, it also

               shows the illiquidity of seats on these smaller exchanges, with few transactions for many

               months before and after the crash. In addition, Figure 5 strongly suggests that the bloom

               was off the rose by early 1929 for most brokers, as prices failed to rise or even fell. For

               the NYSE, as already seen, split-adjusted prices fell in the second quarter and then


                                                                                      25
rebounded in the third.          This recovery after a considerable period of pessimism is

mirrored in the behavior of the Curb’s seat prices. All the regionals appear to have been

similarly affected by this pessimism, even though their prices did not decline. As in other

thin asset markets, seat owners held on to their seats and waited for an improvement in

price rather than try to sell them for a loss. The regionals’ pessimism may also have

reflected the fact that prices for smaller stocks had peaked in the first quarter of 1929 and

the boom only continued in the larger stocks.9 The only exception to this development

was the Chicago market where seat prices rose to a new high just prior to the increase in

the number of seats on that exchange in October 1929.

        To examine whether the Curb or regional brokers may have exhibited excessive

optimism or pessimism, the model of seat returns from equation (1) was applied to the

New York Curb Exchange and the Chicago and Philadelphia exchanges and estimates are

shown in Tables 3 and 4.             Chicago and Philadelphia were selected because of the

relatively large number of seats, which were traded more frequently than other regional

seats. Volume data was available for the Chicago and Philadelphia exchanges from the

Commercial and Financial Chronicle, and for the Curb Exchange from the New York

Times; but there was no stock price index available for any of these exchanges.                     In its

place the excess returns to holding the Federal Reserve’s stock index was used.

 The Fisher (1966) index of stocks, which is equally weighted, began to fall in February 1929, while the
Dow Jones, composed only of large stocks, and the Federal Reserve index weighted by capitalization,
continued to rise.

              The fit of the model for the Curb Exchange is somewhat weaker than it was for

the NYSE, perhaps reflecting some of the data compromises and the fact that there is no

volume data before February 1923. Two lagged values of the independent variables are

required here to capture their influence. Again the model is at its weakest for the period

just before the stock market boom when there are fewer observations. Nevertheless, the

estimation for the first period, 1923-1927 was employed to forecast seat prices out-of-

sample, as was done for the NYSE. Both cumulative abnormal returns and forecast seat

prices were constructed, and the latter are shown in Figure 6.                      The fit of the model is

fairly good for 1928, and the expansion of the NYSE does not appear to be viewed as

having any positive or negative effects on the business of the Curb, as the forecast


                                                         28
           remains on track when the information about the seat dividend on the NYSE was

           released. However, early in 1929, the forecast for seat prices moves well ahead of actual

           prices on the Curb exchange. Like their brethren on the NYSE, the Curb brokers appear

           to have become very skeptical about the rising market. Only after the crash do actual and

           forecast prices realign themselves, and the fit of the model improves.

                     Estimation of the determinants of seat prices on the regional exchanges in Table 4

           fares less well.    There is comparatively little movement in regional seat prices and the

           Federal Reserve’s stock market index may not accurately reflect events on these


                                                         29
exchanges, dominated many local issues. Philadelphia’s poor fit is perhaps not surprising

as there were few transactions in the face of huge movements by the market.

Nevertheless, even the more active market for Chicago’s seats does not yield an

informative fit.   Given the poor fit of these equations, attempts to extract abnormal

returns to measure brokers’ optimism or pessimism failed, as predicted seat price values

scarcely moved.

       As the stock market soared to new heights, was brokers’ anxiety a generalized

phenomenon or were the Curb and the regional exchanges influenced by the market for

seats on the NYSE?       Any excessive pessimism or optimism from New York, the

dominant exchange, may have spilled over. To test this possibility, news from New York

is extracted from the residuals obtained by differences between the actual and predicted

prices for NYSE seats, using the coefficients for 1920-1927 in Table 1. This information

contributes modestly to explaining the behavior of the returns for seats on the Curb and

the regionals. For Philadelphia, it appears that good news for the NYSE, a positive

residual was initially taken as bad news for this exchange given the negative coefficient

on the first lagged residual. However, this opinion was subsequently overturned, as

indicated by the subsequent coefficient of reserve sign and nearly equal value. For the

Curb and the Chicago exchange, news in the form of changes in the price of a seat on the

NYSE had little effect on the determination of their seat prices. Overall, the data does

not suggest that optimism or pessimism from the New York market spread to other

exchanges.    If there was a feeling among brokers that the investing public was

excessively exuberant, it appears to have been widespread.

       Spotting a bubble during the rise of a market or econometrically measuring it after

a collapse is a hazardous enterprise because of the difficulty of properly identifying the

fundamentals. Established brokers, familiar with their customers and the flow of orders

onto the floor of the exchange might be thought to have a better view of the market than

the average investor. There were enormous stakes for the brokers; while volume may

surge during a boom and crash, it collapsed in the aftermath, driving down profits.

Members of the NYSE found their exchange’s dominance threatened by the mid-1920s.

It could no longer absorb more volume on peak days without higher costs arising in the

form of greater bid-ask spreads and delays in processing orders.       By expanding the

exchange by 25 percent, the NYSE apparently eased the constraints while maintaining

profits. Yet by the third quarter of 1929, the burgeoning market appears to have worried

them and the prices of seats were well below what would have been expected.          This

concern also seems to have taken grip of the Curb and the regional markets.

Furthermore, there is some journalistic evidence that younger men sought out NYSE

seats and the quarter-seat rights to form new seats, as the older and perhaps wiser men

abandoned the exchange. Other market anomalies corroborate brokers’ anticipation of a

crash. The willingness of investors to pay unprecedented premia on closed-end mutual

funds is evidence of a rush by new investors into a bubble market. The extraordinarily

heightened risk premia and margin on brokers’ loans also reveals that lenders to the

market were apprehensive and thought a big drop was imminent. Unfortunately, for the

common investor this information was not appreciated and they continued to pay share

prices that would, in retrospect, seem absurdly high
