An Industry-Adjusted Index of State

                                              ABSTRACT

        This paper describes a new, industry-adjusted index of state environmental compliance costs from
1977 to 1994. The index has two principal advantages: it controls for states’ industrial compositions, and
it can be calculated for 17 years, thus facilitating comparisons both among states and within states over
time. Several notable facts emerge. First, differences in states’ industrial compositions play a large role
in determining their environmental compliance costs. Second, after controlling for industrial composition,
the variance across states in compliance costs declined steadily between 1977 and 1994. Third, this cost
index is negatively correlated with subjective indices of state environmental efforts compiled by various
environmental organizations. In sum, the cost index described here provides some new data on historical
trends in state regulatory differences, differs from the conventional wisdom regarding states’ relative
environmental efforts, and provides a useful tool for researchers exploring the effects of compliance costs
on economic activity.

           An Industry-Adjusted Index of State Environmental Compliance Costs



I. Introduction.

       This paper describes a new industry-adjusted index of state environmental compliance

costs that can be used to compare regulations both across states in a given year and within states

over time.' It compares that index to others used in the environmental economics literature, and

uses the index to answer several often-raised questions about the pattern of environmental

regulations in the United States and how that pattern has changed over time. Finally, the paper

describes an application of the index, as used to assess the effect of environmental regulatory

stringency on foreign direct investment to U.S. states.

       There are three key motivations for creating this index. First, the EPA has worried

publicly that some states are laggards in enforcing federal standards.2 The index described here

documents the variation across states in their environmental compliance costs. Second, since

1980, responsibility for monitoring and enforcement of environmental regulations has been

devolving from the federal government to state and local regulators. In theory, this could cause

states to become less or more similar in their standard stringency as they are freed to set their

own level of stringency and to compete with neighbors to attract industry or clean their

environments. This index provides data on the degree of convergence in state standard

stringency over time. Third, analysts studying the effects of environmental regulations on local

and national economies have been hampered by the difficulty of accurately measuring and

comparing the stringency of those regulations (Jaffe et al., 1995). In particular, studies of the

effect of regulations on local economies rely almost exclusively on cross-section data,3 subjective
                                                                                                      2
indices of state standards, or on cost-based measures that do not control for industrial

composition.

       Existing measure of environmental regulatory stringency take two forms. First, there are

the environmental groups' rankings of states. These are subjective, and typically only measure

perceptions of states' efforts at one point in time, so intertemporal comparisons are not possible.

Most analysts have therefore relied on the Census Bureau's Pollution Abatement Costs and

Expenditures (PACE) survey data to construct measures of statewide compliance costs per unit

of output. These measures, however, fail to control for states' industrial compositions.

Consequently, states with a lot of polluting industry have relatively high environmental

compliance costs, regardless of their regulations.

       To address these concerns, the next section describes the new, industry-adjusted index,

and reports findings about relative stringency and how it has changed over time. Section ifi

describes existing, subjective measures of environmental standard stringency, and compares them

to the industry-adjusted index. Section IV describes an application of the index to assess the

effect of environmental stringency on foreign direct investment to U.S. states.



II. An industry-adjusted index of state environmental compliance costs.

        Many researchers have relied on the Census Bureau's Pollution Abatement Costs and

Expenditures (PACE) survey to construct indices of state environmental regulatory stringency.

The PACE survey collected data from manufacturing establishments about their pollution

abatement operating and capital costs from 1977 to 1994, when it was discontinued.4 Most

commonly, studies use these costs divided by some measure of state economic activity, such as
                                                                                                         3

total employment or gross state product.5 The most significant problem with such measures is

that they fail to adjust for industrial composition. States that have pollution-intensive industrial

compositions will incur high pollution abatement costs, whether or not they have stringent

regulations. Ideally, one would use the pollution abatement costs in the relevant industry as an

index of regulatory stringency. While abatement costs by state and industry are published

annually by the Census Bureau, so many of the observations are censored to prevent disclosure of

confidential information that the data are not comparable year-to-year or state-to-state.6

Therefore, this paper proposes an alternative index.

       The index compares the actual pollution abatement costs in each state, unadjusted for

industrial composition, to the predicted abatement costs in each state, where the predictions are

based solely on nationwide abatement expenditures by industry and each state's industrial

composition.7 Let the actual costs per dollar of output be denoted




                                                   P
                                            S1=!                                                   (1)




where P is pollution abatement costs in state s in year t, and Y5, is the manufacturing sector's

contribution to the gross state product (GSP) of state s in year t. S is the type of unadjusted

measure of compliance costs commonly used. By failing to adjust for the industrial composition

of each state, it likely overstates the compliance costs of states with more pollution-intensive

industries and understates the costs in states with relatively clean industries.
                                                                                                      4

       To adjust for industrial composition, compare (1) to the predicted pollution abatement

costs per dollar of GSP in state s:




                                              —
                                                  39     Yist   Pt
                                      5st =                                                     (2)
                                                  1=20




where industries are indexed from 20 through 39 following the 2-digit manufacturing SIC codes,8

Y is industry i's contribution to the GSP of state s at time t, Y is the nationwide contribution of

industry ito national GDP, and P,, is the nationwide pollution abatement operating costs of

industry i. In other words, S, is the weighted average pollution abatement costs (per dollar of

GSP), where the weights are the relative shares of each industry in state s at time t.

       To construct the industry-adjusted index of relative state stringency, S, I compute the

ratio of actual expenditures in (1) to the predicted expenditures in (2)




                                                     S
                                              S1=—                                              (3)




When S is greater than 1, that indicates that industries in state s at time t spent more on

pollution abatement than those same industries in other states. When S5* is less than 1,

industries in state s at time t spent less on pollution abatement. By implication, states with large

values of Sst* have relatively more stringent regulations than states with small values of S5.'°
                                                                                                  5

        Table 1 presents the average values of various environmental indices. The first column

contains the average unadjusted index, S, from 1977 to 1994 (omitting 1987, when the PACE

data were not collected). The second column contains the industry-adjusted index, 5*•h1 Table

2 contains the rankings of these indices: Several striking facts can be seen from comparing the

indices. First, the ranking of state regulatory stringency according to the industry-adjusted index

(5*) is often quite different from the ranking according to the unadjusted index (5). For example,

New Jersey manufacturers spent a relatively large amount on pollution abatement, causing the

state to be ranked 20th in terms of the average unadjusted index in column (1) of Table 2.

However, when New Jersey's relatively pollution-intensive industrial composition is accounted

for, the state's ranking falls to 34th. In contrast, when Oregon's relatively clean industrial

composition is accounted for, that state's ranking improves from 24th to 12th. Similar reordering

takes place for other states, supporting the conclusion that using abatement costs without

adjusting for industrial composition yields a misleading picture of states' relative regulatory

compliance costs.

        A second fact that emerges from the industry-adjusted index is that while most state

rankings are relatively stable, a few change significantly over time. The appendix tables present

the annual figures. From 1977 to 1991, Florida dropped from the 4th most costly state to the

25th most costly. By contrast, during the same time period illinois rose from the 32nd most

costly state to the 23rd.

        Third, each of these statements should be tempered by the observation that there is

considerable noise in the data, both in the adjusted and unadjusted indices, and especially for the

smaller states. For example, it is hard to imagine that Rhode Island leapt from the 42nd most
                                                                                                     6

costly state in 1986 to 4th in 1988. Most likely, some of the year-to-year variation in the indices

results from sampling error in the PACE survey or from the small size of some states.

       Despite the noisiness of the data for small states, some consistent patterns emerge. To

study trends in the data, I regressed 5* on year dummies and a time trend, and plotted the

residuals. As an example, Figure 1 plots S* for four large states. Compliance costs in Arizona

and Florida declined between 1977 and 1994, relative to the changing compliance costs in other

states. Note that because S* is already normalized on an annual basis, the downward trend in S

does not mean that Arizona and Florida have become less expensive in absolute terms, only less

expensive relative to other states. By contrast, over the same period relative compliance costs

rose in illinois and Massachusetts

       Another important fact discernible from this index is that the variation among states in

their regulatory stringency is decreasing. It has often been speculated that pressure from federal

regulators and national attention is forcing a convergence in state regulatory stringency. This

index provides the first simple evidence of that convergence. Figure 2 depicts the coefficient of

variation in both time series' from 1977 to 1994. The coefficient of variation of the industry-

adjusted index drops from 0.44 in 1977 to 0.29 in 1994. Meanwhile variation in the unadjusted

index falls much less, from 0.66 to 0.59. Taken together, these two time series' suggest that

while states' industrial compositions have become more dissimilar over time, their regulatory

stringency has become more similar.

        Appendix Table 2 makes clear that despite the convergence of states' stringency, there

remains substantial variation among states, even as late as 1994. Expenditures on pollution

abatement in 1994 ranged from 0.5 percent of GSP in Nevada, to 6 percent in Louisiana. While
                                                                                                     7
much of this difference is accounted for by differences in the two states' industrial compositions,

the industry-adjusted index for the most expensive state (Maine) remains 1.7 times the national

average, and 4.13 times as large as for the least expensive state (Nevada).

        Before comparing this index to others, it is important to note a few caveats. First, this

index is not necessarily a measure of regulatory stringency alone. Other state characteristics may

well drive up the cost of pollution abatement. For example, if the wages of environmental

engineers vary state-to-state, they will affect the relative pollution abatement costs. Furthermore,

this index is not intended to be a measure of environmental quality. Many of the nations most

polluted regions also have the strictest regulations.

        Second, this industry-adjusted index makes no attempt to control for the relative age of

different states' manufacturers. This is important because many state environmental standards

are more strict for new sources of pollution than for existing sources. Consequently, states that

have relatively new manufacturing bases also have relatively high compliance costs, even after

controlling for their industrial compositions. Conversely, states that have relatively old

manufacturers will experience lower compliance costs. There is, therefore, potentially a positive

correlation between the amount of new investment and this industry-adjusted index of regulatory

compliance costs. However, there is also reason to believe that this bias is small. In another

paper (Levinson, 1996), I regressed pollution abatement expenditures at the plant level on plant

characteristics, including an indicator for plants built in the last five years. The new plant

indicator, though positive, was small and statistically insignificant.

        Third, this industry-adjusted index of environmental stringency, S', controls for states'

industrial compositions at the level of 2-digit SIC codes. While this surely accounts for a lot of
                                                                                                     8

the differences among states, there is equally certain to be heterogeneity among states within 2-

digit classifications. For example SIC 26, pulp and paper, includes both pulp mills, which are

among the most pollution-intensive manufacturers, and envelope assemblers, which emit very

little pollution. To the extent that some states contain relatively more pulp mills, and others

merely assemble envelopes, if the former experience high abatement costs that will likely be due

to differing industrial compositions rather than more stringent environmental regulations. In

other words, the index S* retains some of the bias due to industrial compositions -- in particular

heterogeneity of industrial compositions within any given 2-digit SIC code.



ifi. Existing indices of state environmental regulatory effort.

       Attempts to quantify state environmental regulations have taken numerous forms over the

years. Many environmental organizations have compiled indices for this purpose, and these

indices form a standard against which the industry-adjusted index can be compared.

        Conservation Foundation Index. In 1983 the Conservation foundation attempted to

measure each state's "effort to provide a quality environment for its citizens" (Duerkson, 1983).

They compiled an index from 23 components including environmental and land-use

characteristics such as the League of Conservation Voters' assessment of each state's

Congressional delegation's voting record, the existence of state environmental impact statement

processes, and the existence of language specifically protecting the environment in state land-use

statutes. Conservation Foundation staff assigned weights to each component based on subjective

assessments of their importance, and the weighted sum comprises an index ranging from 0 to 63.
                                                                                                  9
Minnesota and California received the best scores, while Missouri and Alabama received the

worst.

         FREE Index. The Fund for Renewable Energy and the Environment (FREE, 1987)

published an index of the strength of state environmental programs. The components of the

index include state laws regarding air quality, hazardous waste, and groundwater pollution.

Wisconsin and California scored the highest, while West Virginia and Mississippi received the

lowest marks.

         Green Index. Hall and Kerr (1991) compiled the widely cited "Green Index" of "state

environmental health" from 256 measures of public policy and environmental quality. Oregon

and Maine lie at the top of the ranking, while Louisiana and Alabama are last.

         Southern Studies Index. The Institute for Southern Studies (1994) ranked the states based

on 20 environmental measures such as air quality, state spending on the environment, pollution

and waste generation, and energy efficiency, and then added up the 20 rankings of each state to

get a composite index. Vermont and New Hampshire had the best scores, while Texas and

Louisiana had the worst.

         League of Conservation Voters (LCV). Each year, the LCV assigns each U.S. senator and

representative a score, from 1 to 100, based on their voting record on environmental bills chosen

by the LCV. Some researchers have used these scores as a measure of the environmental

sentiment in each state (Gray, 1997). To compare these scores to the compliance cost index, I

averaged each state's House and Senate delegation's environmental voting records. Each record

is the average voting record for each member of the state's delegation. Thus, for states with more
                                                                                                    10

House members than Senate members, the Senate votes are weighted more heavily (and vice

versa). 12

        Table 1 reports the values of each environmental index for each state. Table 2 presents

each index's ranking of states. The rankings of the subjective indices conform loosely to

anecdotal evidence and to reports in the popular press. Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana

consistently receive the lowest grades from environmental organizations, while Massachusetts,

Wisconsin, Minnesota and California receive the highest grades. I suspect that few policy

analysts, environmental regulators, or industry representatives would be surprised by these

rankings, and I therefore refer to these indices as the "conventional wisdom" regarding states'

relative environmental efforts.

        In the last colunm of Table 1, I present an index calculated from the confidential plant-

level Census of Manufactures, as described in Levinson (1996). Using the raw, establishment-

level 1988 PACE data, I regressed the log of gross pollution abatement operating costs on the log

of the book value of capital, the log of the number of production workers, the log of value added,

a dummy for new plants, dummies for 4-digit SIC codes, and individual state dummies, all from

the 1987 Census of Manufactures.'3 The state dummy coefficients are reported in column (8) of

Table 1. A high point estimate for a state dummy coefficient indicates that, all else equal, plants

in that state spend more on pollution abatement operating costs than otherwise similar plants in

the omitted state, New York.

         Oddly, this plant-level index is not highly correlated with the more aggregate industry-

adjusted index. The correlation between the plant-level index and the industry-adjusted index in

1988 is only 0.19. There are several possible explanations. The plant-level index is from a
                                                                                                    11

regression of 1988 PACE data on 1987 Census of Manufactures data for the same firms. (The

PACE were not collected in 1987.) This mismatch may account for some of the discrepancy.

Also, the plant-level index controls for plant vintage with a new-plant indicator, to account for

the age bias discussed above, though its coefficient is small and statistically insignificant.

       Table 3 presents correlations among the two cost indices and the 5 conventional indices.

Though they were compiled at different times with widely different sets of components, the five

conventional indices are highly positively correlated. Except for the League of Conservation

Voters index, the conventional indices are all fairly ad hoc. Each is based on a list of component

measures, with no objective guide as to what criteria are included or excluded from the index.

Furthermore, each index either adds up the unweighted ranks of the separate components, or

weights the separate scores according to the subjective judgement of the index's authors.

Nevertheless, there is remarkable consistency across the indices.

        On the other hand, the two cost-based indices are negatively correlated with the

conventional indices. While the adjusted and unadjusted indices are correlated with each other,

they are both negatively correlated with each of the conventional indices. While the conventional

indices may measure something systematic about states, it is not correlated with industrial

pollution abatement expenditures.

        There are several reasons for the negative correlation between the compliance-cost-based

measures and the environmental organizations' indices. The environmental organizations' indices

often include the quality of the environment in each state as part of their measure. The Green

and Southern Studies indices include measures of ambient air and water quality, and pollution

emitted. In many cases, environmental quality is inversely associated with compliance costs, as
                                                                                                    12

plants in the dirtiest states are required to spend more effort cleaning up. Los Angeles, for

example, has both the most polluted air and the toughest emissions standards in the U.S.

(Berman and Bui, 1997).

       Another explanation has to do with the fact that the LCV index, which is itself included in

the Conservation Foundation index, ranks states according to their congressional delegations'

voting records on national legislation, rather than state legislation. Furthermore, U.S. senators

and representatives appear to vote for more strict regulations when they are imposed on other

states (Pashigian, 1985). Finally, many of the indices contain elements unrelated to

manufacturers' pollution abatement costs: items such as curbside recycling programs, spending

on public parks, and automobile inspection programs. While these state characteristics may

indicate something about the overall environmental sentiment in a given state, they are not

necessarily related to the compliance costs faced by manufacturers.

       In general, the two groups of indices measure different concepts. The compliance cost

index measures how much it costs to locate a manufacturing facility in any one state, relative to

others, in terms of pollution abatement costs. The subjective indices combine many different

measures, including the quality of the environment, national delegations' voting records, and

environmental effort unrelated to the manufacturing industry.



IV. An application: The effect of regulations on foreign direct investment.

       As an example of the type of work that this index facilitates, in Table 4 I present

regressions of foreign direct investment (FDI) on characteristics of U.S. states, including their

industry-adjusted indices of environmental regulatory stringency, 5*14 Several studies have
                                                                                                     13

examined the effects of environmental regulations on FDI. However, all of the existing studies

have either used a cross-section of data, some unadjusted measure of regulatory stringency, (like

S in equation (1)), or both (Co and List, 1998; Friedman et a!., 1992). Table 4 examines

property, plant, and equipment investment by foreign-owned manufacturers, from the Bureau of

Economic Analysis (BEA), as a measure of foreign direct investment (FD1). It presents

regressions of FDI on state characteristics using a time series of data and the industry-adjusted

index of environmental regulatory stringency.

       The first column of Table 4 presents means and standard deviations of the regressors. As

a benchmark to compare to the previous literature, columns (2) and (3) contain pooled, OLS

regressions of FDI in the manufacturing sector and the chemical industry, respectively, on the

industry-adjusted index of environmental stringency and other covariates. Controlling for other

state characteristics, FDI appears to be positively correlated with stringency. In column (3) I

examine FDI for the chemical industry (SIC 28). This is one of the only relatively pollution-

intensive, 2-digit SIC codes for which this measure of FDI is reported consistently by the BEA.

Here, the coefficient on S remains positive, though it is smaller and statistically insignificant.

These results, however, are based largely on the cross-section comparison of states. (Most of the

variation in S is across states rather than within states over time.) These cross-section results

are likely biased if states have unobserved characteristics correlated with both FDI and regulatory

stringency. To control for those characteristics, and to exploit the panel of data, consider a

dynamic model.

       Suppose that a reduced form relationship for FDI can be characterized by the following

equation:'5
                                                                                                      14


                            FDI5 = ö FDl_1 + 7S       * + X13 +                                     (4)



where X is a vector of characteristics of state s at time t, and u is an error term composed of

two parts, u5=p5+v. Equation (4) states that FDI is a function of current state characteristics and

lagged values of FDI. Both FD1S and FDISJ are functions of p5, and therefore OLS estimates of

(4) will be biased because FDIStJ, a regressor, is correlated with the error term.

       Arellano and Bond (1991) suggest a GMM estimate of (4) that uses lagged values of

FD1311 as instruments, and first differences to eliminate the fixed state effects PS. First, take first

differences of (4):


                        AFDI51 =   MFDI51       +          +        +                               (5)




where A symbolizes first differences. Since FDl2 is correlated with AFDI1, but not correlated

with AFDI51, it is a valid instrument. In fact, all past values FDIct3, FD1514, and so on are valid

instruments for AFDIJ.

        Columns (4) and (5) of Table 4 present GMM estimates of (5) using Doornik et al.

(1999).16 When equation (5) is estimated using all manufacturing FDI, in column (4), the large

spurious positive coefficient on S disappears. Instead, the coefficient (2.4) is tiny and

statistically insignificant, though still positive. Turning to the chemical industry, in column (5),

the coefficient (-338) is negative and statistically significant. This suggests that the positive

coefficients found in the cross-section evidence in this study and others are spurious, and are
                                                                                                   15

based on unobserved characteristics correlated with both environmental regulations and

economic activity.

       To interpret the size of these coefficients consider the following. The fixed-effects

coefficient in column (5) suggest that a one-unit increase in the stringency index is associated

with a decline in chemical industry EDI of $338 million. The standard deviation of this index

within states over time ranges from 0.04 for Wisconsin to 0.56 for Colorado, and averages 0.18.

So the coefficient suggests that a one standard deviation increase in the index, for the average

state, is associated with a decline of FDI investment by foreign-owned chemical manufacturers of

$61 million. This amounts to about 6 percent of the annual average chemical industry FDI

investment of $1017 million per state.

       The industry-adjusted index plays two important roles in the regressions in Table 4. First,

because the index spans 18 years, it is possible to use changes in the variables year-to-year to

control for unobserved fixed state characteristics that may be correlated with both stringency and

FDI. The stringency coefficients in these first-differenced specifications are negative, while

those in the pooled specification are positive, suggesting that these unobserved state

characteristics are extremely important. Second, by adjusting for industrial composition, the

index avoids merely measuring concentrations of polluting industries, and instead assesses

average abatement costs holding industrial composition constant.

       While these results are meant only as an example, they do suggest that an index like the

one described has considerable advantages over empirical approaches taken thus far.
                                                                                                     16

V. Conclusion.

       The research described here creates an industry-adjusted index of state environmental

compliance costs from 1977 to 1994. The index supports several conclusions. First, industry

composition plays an important role in determining spending on environmental compliance costs

for different states. Rank orderings of states by pollution abatement spending look very different

once their industrial compositions have been controlled for. Second, differences among states

are exaggerated by differences in their industrial compositions. The coefficient of variation of

the unadjusted index is 0.65, while the coefficient of variation of the industry-adjusted index is

0.37. Third, once industrial composition has been accounted for, states appear to be converging

in their environmental standard stringency. Fourth, when compared to conventional indices of

state environmental regulations, these cost-based indices have opposite implications for the

relative stringency of states. The two types of indices are negatively correlated across states.

Finally, when used in an analysis of the effect of regulatory stringency on economic activity (FDI

in this case), time-series analyses using the industry-adjusted index have more sensible results

than cross-sectional analyses, or than analyses using the unadjusted index. Together, these

results imply that using conventional indices or unadjusted cost indices to analyze state

environmental policies can lead to misleading conclusions about the effects of those policies on

economic activity.

2.      See, for example, the New York Times, 12/15/96 and 1/30/97.



3.      Because most studies examine differences among jurisdictions at one time, they cannot

distinguish between the simultaneous effects of regulations on economic growth and that of

economic growth on regulations. Notable exceptions include Gray (1997), Greenstone (1998),

and Becker and Henderson (1997).



4.      Recently, it appears that the EPA and the Census Bureau have agreed on plans to renew

collecting the PACE data. Unfortunately, there will have been a minimum of five years during

which the data were not collected. The PACE data collected from 1973 to 1976 are incompatible

with later surveys in their treatment of small plants. Also, the PACE data were not collected in

1987.



5.      See, for example, Crandall (1993), Friedman et al. (1992), or Co and List (1998).

Consulting firms specializing in industrial siting decisions have also relied on such simple

indices of environmental regulatory stringency (Alexander Grant & Co., 1985).
                                                                                                 18

6.     Several papers have used the confidential plant-level PACE data to construct such indices

(Levinson, 1996; Gray, 1997). However, those data are unavailable to most researchers, and the

purpose here is to construct an easily accessible resource for analysts. Below, I do compare the

index created from the confidential data to that compiled from the published data.



7.     For two reasons, I use pollution abatement operating expenses (as opposed to capital

expenses) in the index. First, operating expenses for pollution abatement equipment are easier

for PACE survey respondents to identify separately. Abatement capital expenses may be difficult

to disentangle from investments in production process changes that have little to do with

pollution abatement. Second, abatement capital expenditures are highest when new investment

takes place. So states that have thriving economies and are generating manufacturing investment

tend to have high levels of abatement capital expenses, regardless of the stringency of those

states' environmental laws. Operating costs are more consistent year-to-year.



8.     SIC code 23 (apparel) is omitted because it is relatively pollution-free, and as a result no

data for that industry are collected by the PACE survey.



9.     Note that the state's GSP is in both the numerator and the denominator of (3). Equation
                                     A          A
(3) can thus be expressed as S3=P5/P51, where P is the summation term in (2).



10.    I have also calculated the index described by equations (1), (2) and (3) using the number

of production workers in each 2-digit SIC code to control for industrial composition, instead of
                                                                                                 19

using each industry's share of GSP. The broad conclusions are similar, though the rankings of

some states do change. Also, annual employment totals by state and industry are more often

censored to prevent disclosure of confidential information.

ranking of states. Appendix Table 2 presents annual values of the unadjusted index (5) and its

rankings.



12.    See http:\www.lcv.org. For the Senate votes, the years 1977-78, 1979-80, 1983-4, 1985-

86, and 1987-88 each had only one scorecard. Therefore, the voting records for these pairs of

years were entered separately for each year. For the House votes, the years 1987-8 8 had only one

scorecard. Here also the same value was entered for both years. The LCV has a House scorecard

for 1985 and for 1985-86. The information from the 1985 scorecard was used to disaggregate the

1985-86 scorecard by a weighted average.



13.    Implicit in this specification is a Cobb-Douglas production function in which output (Y)

is estimated as a function of capital (K), labor (L), and pollution (P), with dummy variables for

new plants, industries, and states: Y=AK L D2.3 This estimation substitutes pollution

abatement, which is observable, for pollution, takes the logarithm of both sides, and inverts the

function to estimate abatement as a function of the other variables.

Data Appendix



Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE Data

       PACE data come from U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census. The data

       are published in Current Industrial Reports: Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures,

       MA-200, various years. The variable of interest from this source was the Pollution

       Abatement Gross Annual Cost (GAC) total across all media types. Starting in 1977,

       Census collected data only for establishments with 20 or more employees. Although

       PACE data were collected from all establishments for the years 1973-1979, in order to

       lessen the administrative burden on small businesses, they were dropped from the survey,

       starting in 1980. The PACE Survey was not collected in 1987. There are some censored

       observations for the state totals, and in those cases values were interpolated.



Gross State Product data:

       All gross state product data were acquired via the Regional Economic Information

       System CD, 1969-1994 published by the US Department of Commerce, Bureau of

       Economic Analysis, Regional Economic Measurement Division.



League of Conservation Voters Index

       This index is the unweighted average of the House and Senate environmental voting

       records. Each record is the average voting record for each member of the state's

       delegation. Thus, for states with more House members than Senate members, the Senate
                                                                                              32
      votes are weighted more heavily (and vice versa). The bills that are used to construct the

      index have been chosen by the LCV. See http://www.lcv.org. For the Senate votes, the

      years 1977-78, 1979-80, 1983-4, 1985-86, and 1987-88 each had only one scorecard.

      Therefore, the voting records for these years were entered separately for each year. For

      the House votes, the years 1987-88 had only one scorecard. Here also the same value was

      entered for both years. Also, the House had a scorecard for 1985 and for 1985-86. The

      information from the 1985 scorecard was used to disaggregate the 1985-86 scorecard by a

      weighted average.
