Bad Men, Good Roads, Jim Crow, and the Economics of Southern Chain Gangs

                                         ABSTRACT

Penology in the Jim Crow South centered on the chain gang. Gangs ostensibly served three
purposes: their severity served as a deterrent; their putting convicts to work on roads and other
public improvements reduced the taxpayers' costs of infrastructure; and their discriminatory
implementation reinforced the social order defined by Jim Crow. Drawing on insights from the
economics of crime literature, this paper analyzes whether chain gangs reduced road maintenance
costs. Using a fixed-effects design, the analysis finds that the costs of using gangs in road
maintenance were marginally lower on average than using wage labor. The results are consistent
with county officials choosing between convict and free labor in manner consistent with
minimizing taxpayers' costs.

        "Bad men on bad roads make good roads, while good roads make good men."
        ­ Davis (1916, p.41)




1   Introduction
        Economists' standard models of crime suggest that socially optimal
enforcement of and punishment for violations of the criminal code should be
determined by the seriousness of the offense and the effect of punishment on marginal
deterrence (Becker 1968; Polinsky and Shavell 1992; Friedman 2001). Recent
contributions, however, recognize that law enforcement officials respond to incentives
other than minimizing the social costs of crime. Enforcement agents may act on biases,
prejudices, and preferences with respect to race, gender, age, or other observable and
unobservable (to the econometrician) offender characteristics (Knowles, Persico and
Todd 2001; Fryer 2016). Efforts to minimize the social costs of crime are exchanged at
the margin for maximizing the utility of agents who act, as least in part, on their own
preferences. Enforcement agents, too, may respond to fiscal or financial incentives
provided by revenue-maximizing bureaucrats (Makowsky and Stratmann 2009;
Makowsky, Stratmann and Tabarrok 2019). Traffic enforcement officers, for example,
are more likely to issue traffic citations or impose higher fines for violations when local
municipalities experience budget deficits. Officers may target certain individuals in their
enforcement efforts when doing so reduces the officers' expected cost of issuing
summonses and raises revenues for the municipality.
        This paper applies the insights of these three approaches to the study of criminal
enforcement to better understand the operation of South Carolina's Jim Crow-era chain
gangs. In 1919 South Carolina's counties set between 5 and 133 convicts to work on
road maintenance chain gangs (South Carolina Board of Charities and Corrections
1919). The average county had 35 men at work at a given time. The state's larger cities
also operated their own convict gangs that worked on the cities' streets. Despite the
relatively large number of convicts put to work, there were more miles of road in need
of maintenance than gangs could keep in good repair. Counties and cities also hired
wage labor to maintain roads and streets. Sometimes gangs and free labor worked

                                            1
together; most times they worked separately. The principal question addressed here is
whether South Carolina's counties realized any measurable cost savings from convict
rather than wage labor in the provision of road maintenance.
        Using hand-coded data from the South Carolina Highway Department, this
paper analyzes the costs and potential cost savings of employing convicts rather than
wage labor in road maintenance. The evidence suggests, contrary to the assertions of
contemporaries and historians, that the use of convicts did not necessarily reduce
taxpayers' costs of building and maintaining the state's roads. South Carolina's gangs
were more efficient at road maintenance than road building, but only if convict road
gangs could be maintained at or near optimal size. Statistical evidence reveals that using
convicts or road maintenance reduced costs by less than 10 percent. If county road
commissioners were conscientious, cost-minimizing agents of taxpayers, they would
have equalized the marginal cost of using gangs and wages workers. The evidence points
to their acting in this way.
        One threat to identification is convict gang use responding endogenously to
road conditions and, therefore, labor costs. The choice to treat the use of gangs on
specific road sections as plausibly exogenous can be justified in three ways. First, if the
endogenous choice of gang versus patrol is the product of county-level time-invariant
preferences over the appropriate treatment of criminals, then fixed-effects estimates
derived from a short panel will yield unbiased estimates of the costs of employing
convict gangs. Second, the choice of whether to have a gang and how to employ them
was made at the county level and not the road segment level. Three counties, for
example, never authorized the use of convict gangs. Other counties mandated that local
roads receive a specific number of days of maintenance regardless of road condition,
gang size, and traffic load. Thus, the choice of gang or wage labor did not respond
endogenously to cost or road conditions. Third, temporal changes in county gang sizes
were driven by factors that influenced the propensity of potential criminals to engage in
crime, which is plausibly unrelated to road mileage or condition. One threat to
exogeneity, however, is Makowsky and Stratmann's (2009) finding that local law
enforcement may step up enforcement efforts in periods of municipal financial
stringency, but this would have the effect of increasing gang size not necessarily the
choice of gangs or patrols. Exogenous forces determined gang sizes and gang use.

                                            2
During America's participation in the First World War, for example, average county
gang size declined by six to eight convicts. Young men who may have engaged in
criminal activity found themselves instead in trenches on the western front. Wages also
rose notably during the war. Both effects were completely exogenous to local road
conditions and local fiscal conditions, but surely influenced both the choice of young
men to engage in crime and the gang convict versus wage labor choices of road
supervisors.
         Questions of external validity hang over most case studies, but South Carolina's
experience was not unique. Davis (1916, p.38) observes that "the question of utilizing
convict or prison labor upon works of public improvement ... is the subject of
legislation in practically every state," and Steiner and Brown (1927/1969) argue that
convicts in the South Atlantic states, other than Florida, worked under similar
conditions in similarly organized chain gangs. About one-half of North Carolina's
counties operated their own convict gangs; counties that did not operate a gang leased
their convicts to counties that did (Pratt and Berry 1912). In June 1907 twenty-nine of
Georgia's counties worked an average of 20 convicted felons on their roads, either those
convicted in that county or leased from other counties. Fifty-six counties worked 1,650
misdemeanants on local roads (Georgia Prison Commission 1907). 1 South Carolina's
system is, therefore, representative of the gang system across the South. 2 Although the
system evolved over time, the fundamental features of the system were that criminal
offenders, both felons and misdemeanants, mostly black men, served their terms of
incarceration at hard labor work on roads working under "degrading and humiliating
circumstances" (Davis 1916, p.38).
         Besides the questions raised by early studies of convict gangs that cast doubt on
the alleged cost savings attributable to convict labor, this paper contributes to a several
other literatures. It adds to a now-voluminous literature that addresses the inefficiencies
and inequities of the South's Jim Crow racial order, including disparate education (Higgs


1  In addition to working convicts under county supervision, several Georgia counties leased
misdemeanants to work at private firms, mostly turpentine makers (Georgia 1907). When abuses of
convicts by private contractors were made public, Georgia later prohibited the convict lease system.
2 Lichtenstein (1993, 1996) studies Georgia's system. Miller (2012) traces the evolution of convict labor

in Florida from the post-Civil War convict lease system through the rise and fall of the chain gang and its
replacement by the state prison farm. For a description of life on the chain gang, see its depiction by a
contemporary federal appeals court in Jamison v. Wimbish, 130 F. 351.

1989, Margo 1990), race-based occupational segregation (Donohue and Heckman
1991), residential segregation (Halcoussis and Lowenberg 1998), as well as
discrimination in marriage, public accommodation and transportation (Woodward
1957). The average convict gang in South Carolina circa 1920 was 80 percent black; the
median gang was 100 percent black. As such this paper touches on, but does not test,
the political economy approach to law enforcement discussed by Makowsky and
Stratmann (2009). They show that nonresident drivers ­ those lacking the local franchise
and without local political voice ­ are targeted for moving violations and other traffic
citations. Blacks in the Jim Crow South were the equivalent of nonresident drivers.
Lacking any political voice, they paid a disproportionate tax imposed for the
improvement of local roads, the benefits of which were disproportionately enjoyed by
middle- and upper-middle-class white voters and automobile owners.


Institutional background


The public finance of roads
         The introduction of mass-produced automobiles in the early twentieth century
increased public demand for good, or at least passable, roads. The Good Roads
Movement emerged, which called for a rationalization of the nation's road network, the
construction of more hard-surface roads, and the improved maintenance of existing
roads. Accomplishing all three goals required an overhaul of the road provision and
maintenance procedures. As late as the 1920s South Carolina still relied, in part, on the
ancient common law system under which every able-bodied man between the ages of
18 and 50 years was required to devote up to ten 10-hour days per year at supervised
road maintenance or construction (American Highway Association 1913, p.126).
Although county road administrators enforced compliance, local roads were poorly
maintained and often impassable in the rainy season.
         Table 1 presents road statistics from select counties (and state totals) from 1908,
a half-decade prior to Henry Ford's introduction of the mass-produced automobile.
Several features stand out. First, counties typically had between 500 and 2000 miles of
roads, but most counties had few miles that state road officials classified as improved
and well maintained. The round numbers themselves point toward local government's

                                             4
        lack of information on its own roads. Of Abbeville's 1000-odd miles of road, only five
        miles of those thousand were improved stone; another seven miles were improved
        gravel road. The remaining 988 miles were unimproved, poorly maintained dirt roads.
        In 1908, Abbeville County expended about $7,500 in direct outlays on road
        maintenance; approximately 4,000 men worked four days each year on the roads, a labor
        contribution that county valued at $9,600. The sum of direct outlays and value of labor
        requirement amounted to 50 cents per capita or $1.70 per mile. To place Abbeville
        County's $17,100 annual expenditure in perspective, once states began building
        improved roads in earnest private contractors billed counties about $4,300 per mile for
        construction of new hard-surface (macadam) roads; regular maintenance costs for hard-
        surface roads averaged about $440 per mile (Virginia State Highway Commissioner
        1915, p.111-113). New gravel roads cost about $2,350 per mile and new sand/clay roads
        cost about $1,911; regular maintenance costs for existing roads of each type averaged
        about $250 to $350 per mile. Abbeville's pre-automobile era $17,000 expenditures
        would not have gone very far toward improving the driving experience whether by auto
        or horse-drawn wagon. It was sufficient to add about four miles of new hard-surface
        road per year.

       In the first decade of the twentieth century few roads were good roads, a fact
the American Highway Association (1913) repeatedly illustrated in its annual yearbooks,
each of which included multiple photographs of automobiles buried to their axles in
mud, sometimes with mules laboring to extricate them. Using an average cost of $250
per mile as typical, Abbeville County's direct and indirect expenditures in 1908 meant it
could maintain about 68 miles of its 1000 miles of road. Thus, most of its roads were in
disrepair most of the time. Drivers spent much of their time avoiding muddy and rutted
roads or stuck in them.
       Bad roads imposed substantial costs on the citizenry as a study commissioned
by the North Carolina state geologist documented. Following a comprehensive
statewide survey of North Carolina's roads, the state geologist provided county-level
estimates of the social costs of bad roads (Pratt and Berry 1912). Estimates were based
on the difference in the ton-mile cost of hauling goods on improved versus unimproved
roads by road type (earth, sand, gravel) multiplied by estimated tonnage of locally
produced agricultural and manufactured goods moving across those roads. The
numbers, despite the state geologist's belief that they were lower bound estimates, were
eye-opening. In Alamance County, located in the state's Piedmont Plateau, for example,
the geologist estimated the annual opportunity cost of bad roads at $2.77 per capita in
1911 compared to the county's total expenditures on road maintenance of $1.17. The
statewide average per capita costs of bad roads were $4.54. Average per capita personal
income in North Carolina in 1910 was about $123 (less than one-half the national
average), so bad roads created a loss of at least 3.7% of annual income (Klein 2009;
Rhode 2002).
       As government officials at every level, from municipal to federal, and their
constituents recognized the potential economic gains to be realized from full
exploitation of an emergent automobile technology, public investment in road
construction and maintenance increased apace. Table 2 provides some evidence from
South Carolina that by the early 1920s state and local governments collected revenues
earmarked for roads from several sources. Panel A shows that in 1922 the state was
responsible for just 1,900 miles of improved roadway. It spent $447,000 raised from

                                           6
annual taxes on automobiles, in addition to appropriations from general funds to build
and maintain its highways.

        Panel B of Table 2 reveals several notable county-level features. First, most
counties imposed a base road levy (percent reported in Table 1) that raised nearly one-
fourth of the total county-level revenues available to be spent on roads. Second, if one-
fourth of a county's registered voters petitioned for it, county assessors were required
to hold a referendum on the imposition of an additional property tax levy of no more
than 2 mills (or, $2 per $1,000 assessed value on eligible property), to be spent on road
improvements, which would go into effect if approved by a majority vote (American
Highway Association 1913, p.127). Such additional levies represented a trivial fraction
of road revenues. Third, in lieu of laboring on the roads, eligible, able-bodied men could
pay a commutation tax of $1 to $3, depending on county, earmarked for road work.
Commutation assessments represented about 15 percent of revenues. Fourth, an
additional source of local funds flowed from the state treasury. Eighty percent of all
motor vehicle registration fees collected by the state from residents of a county were
returned to the county in which the vehicles were registered. Statewide, drivers

                                            7
registered 81,147 vehicles (cars, trucks and motorcycles) in 1922, which generated
$527,700 in fees that represented nearly 18% of county revenues. By the end of the
decade, more than 275,000 vehicles were registered, which generated more than $2.6
million in registration fees (South Carolina State Highway Department 1929, p25).
Gasoline taxes, in addition, represented 18% of total road revenues.
         Additional funding for road construction and maintenance, which accounted for
about 25 percent of all revenues, was provided by the federal government under the
terms of the Federal Road Act of 1916. South Carolina's apportionment increased from
$71,800 in 1917 to $1.4 million in 1921. At decade's end, South Carolina still claimed
more than $750,000 in federal funds for the year (SC Highway Department 1929, p.122).
State and counties were required to match federal funds from taxes and registration fees
to receive federal assistance. Compared to 1908 when counties spent an average of
$18,100 per year ($17.70 per mile) on their roads, the $74,400 average annual
expenditures ($64.70 per mile) represented a substantial commitment to the provision
of a public good. Between 1910 and 1920 the increase in county revenues earmarked
for road repairs meant that the average county could increase the miles of road under
maintenance from 65 to 230.
         A popular alternative to taxation (among law-abiding, taxpaying voters, at least)
was to put able-bodied convicts to work on the roads. South Carolina's criminal code
of 1912 provided that, in any case in which convicted criminal was subject to a term of
incarceration, the sentence be served "at hard labor on the public works of the county
in which convicted, if the county maintains a chain gang, without regard to the length
of the sentence" (Bethea 1912 v.2, p.244). The only convicts required to be sent to the
state penitentiary were those convicted of a capital offense (murder or rape) and those
considered physically unable to work at hard labor on a chain gang.
         Not only did the state and county save money on prisons and jails when convicts
served on chain gangs, the federal government allowed them to leverage these savings.
The federal government matched eligible state and county road construction expenses,
including expenditures on chain gangs (Myers 1993). 3 Historians have long recognized


3The 1916 Federal Road Act provided that the federal allocation would represent a maximum of 50% of
the eligible expenses, not to exceed $20,000 per mile, but federal allocations could exceed the 50% limit
for bridges of greater than 20-foot span (SC Highway Commission 1920, p.16).

the connection between the effect of the federal subsidy on chain gang commitments.
Even absent the subsidy, the derived demand for well-maintained roads that followed
from expanding vehicle ownership and a widening highway network created incentives
to set criminal defendants to work on the roads.
       The extent to which county chain gangs were involved in the construction and
maintenance of roads, highways, and bridges in South Carolina during the chain-gang
era varied by county. Three counties ­ Berkeley, Orangeburg, and Saluda ­ did not
operate chain gangs. In a few other counties ­ Charleston being the most prominent
example ­ gangs worked on new construction projects. In most counties, however,
crews of convicted felons and misdemeanants and men who opted to work on the roads
rather than pay the commutation tax were, by the early 1920s, responsible only for the
repair and maintenance of existing roads (SC Board of Charities and Corrections 1919,
p.93). Wage workers were organized into groups labeled "patrols" (SC Highway
Commission 1920, p.9). New construction projects in most counties were outsourced
to private contractors. Most of the work done by gangs and patrols involved grading
smooth the ruts cut into soil and gravel roads by traffic during wet weather, as well as
ditching and clearing brush from roadsides. Grading, ditching and clearing involved few
skills other than a capacity to work long hours at unpleasant tasks under harsh
conditions. Such tasks could be performed by men with little training and less
motivation.
       In counties with chain gangs, convicts were put to work and counties provided
trucks and road grading machines, in addition to mule teams, wagons, hand tools, and,
of course, the accoutrements of convict labor, including guards, dogs, weapons,
shackles, mobile kitchens, and moveable incarceration units, which resembled railroad
box cars set on truck wheels with built-in bunks and prison-style barred doors and
windows. Patrols, on the other hand, were made up of men who lived along the roads
on which they worked. Counties paid wages to patrollers who worked more than their
required labor days and provided them with road drags, some machinery and hand tools,
but the patrollers usually furnished their own teams and wagons. The state's highway
commissioners reported that "satisfactory patrolmen [were] hard to find" in sufficient
numbers to keep the roads in good repair so counties augmented their required labor
workers with convicts and wage labor (SC Highway Commission 1920, p.35).

2.2 Extending South Carolina's road network
         Voter demand and federal subsidies led South Carolina to embark on an
ambitious road building and improvement program that included both hard-surface
and soft-surface roads. The state's plan, approved by the federal government, included
a network that connected every county seat with the seats of all adjacent counties. In
1915 South Carolina had virtually no hard-surface roads and few miles of soft-surface
roads under state maintenance. By 1930 the state had a substantial network of
completed hard- and soft-surface roads, many more miles of road under construction,
and an ambitious plan for future construction (see Appendix B for a map (SC
Department of Transportation 1930)).
         Federally subsidized miles of hard­surface roads increased by more than 1,000
between 1919 and 1929; soft­surface road (soil, sand, gravel) mileage increased by
more than 4,000 miles (SC State Highway Department 1929, p. 49). More roads meant
more routine maintenance and repair. By the end of the decade, the state was
responsible for maintaining more than 5,600 miles of improved roads. Maintenance
and repair costs, even when gangs were used, were not inconsequential. In the six
months after July 1, 1920 the highway commission reported an annual average cost
per mile of road maintained of $323 (approximately $4,000 in 2018 dollars) that did
not include the use costs of capital equipment (SC Highway Commission 1920, p.35).
Heavy equipment, road marking, and signage were budgeted separately. In the year
ending December 31, 1929 the commission reported average annual per mile
maintenance costs of $332 for hard­surface roads and $419 for soft­surface roads (SC
State Highway Department 1929, Table 10). One tradeoff for the state was the greater
initial cost of hard­surface roads versus the higher annual maintenance costs of soft­
surface (soil, sand, and gravel) roads, a choice that depended, in part, on anticipated
traffic load. 4
         The second tradeoff was wage labor versus convict labor. It is generally
accepted by historians that counties saved on labor costs by sentencing criminal

4In 1924 the highway commission reported that high­volume roads were more likely to be hard­surface
roads, which complicated direct per­mile comparisons of maintenance costs on hard­ and soft­surface
roads. It also reported that it was instituting traffic surveys to better allocate maintenance funds based
on traffic flows (SC Highway Commission 1924, p. 24).

                                                    10
convicts to work on roads. When the average low-skilled cotton mill hand was paid
about $1.25 per day, the cost of housing, clothing, and feeding a convict on the chain
gang was just $0.20 per day; the cost of guards added another $0.20 per day and
miscellaneous expenses another $0.15 (SC State Board of Charities 1915, p.139). At 55
cents per day, the average daily cost of a convict was more than the 35-cent daily jail
fee assessed men and women arrested in Greenville County and held until they were
released on bail or recognizance, but it was less than one-half the wages paid non-
convict labor (see Greenville County Sheriff's Office 2019).                      Moreover, most
contemporaries believed that punishments meted out for shirking motivated convicts
to work more hours and exert more effort per hour than could be reasonably expected
from wage labor or patrollers providing their mandatory labor quota. Miller (2012)
reports that convicts worked at brisk paces between sunup and sundown with brief
meal breaks. Shirkers suffered a range of punishments from denial of food to lashings
to time in the box. 5
         Although the public may have believed that convicts represented an
inexpensive labor force, informed contemporary observers doubted whether lower
provisioning costs translated into genuine cost savings (Steiner and Brown 1969/1927;
Pennybacker, Fairbank and Draper 1916). In 1919 Charleston County, for example,
maintained two camps housed in permanent structures and decisions about which
roads the gangs would build or repair were under central direction (SC Board of
Charities and Corrections 1919, p.93). The commissioners believed that Charleston's
gangs were reasonably productive. Clarendon County, on the other hand, had 33
school districts and the law required that one of the county's gangs work for no less
than 10 days on roads in each district. On the day the commissioners inspected one
such gang, they found the convicts working "on the best road in the county, which
needed work the least, but which had to be worked for the stated period" (SC Board
of Charities and Corrections 1919, p.94). The commissioners recommended that
South Carolina impose statewide control of gangs, prioritize repairs across the state,


5When state authorities banned lashings and beatings, gang supervisors instituted use of the sweat box:
a 3-foot by 3-foot by 6-foot box, placed in the sun, in which the prisoner was forced to stand for the
entire day without food and with limited water (Miller 2012). Most prisoners confined to the box lost
consciousness after a few hours. Belligerent convicts and unrepentant shirkers sometimes spent several
consecutive days in the box.

                                                  11
and distribute gangs more rationally along the lines of the Georgia model. Nothing
came of the recommendation; convict gangs remained under county control
throughout. 6


2.3 Courts and convicts
         In theory, men of all ages and races convicted of a crime could expect to find
themselves sentenced to convict gangs operated by all but three counties and many
cities and towns. Men (and a few women) convicted of misdemeanors and municipal
ordinances in a county magistrates' court or municipal police court typically faced the
option of paying a fine or serving on a convict gang. A man convicted on a charge of
drunk and disorderly in a municipal police court, for example, typically faced 20 days
on the city gang or a $10 fine (Greenville City 1910). State law restricted the jurisdiction
of police courts to a handful of petty misdemeanors (mostly larceny of goods less than
$20), municipal ordinances, and less serious felonies such as simple assault and carrying
a concealed weapon for which the maximum penalty was 30 days in jail or on the gang
(Bethea 1912 v.2).
         South Carolina's Courts of General Sessions tried defendants charged with
serious felonies. All men convicted of a felony, except for those convicted of a capital
crime (premeditated murder or rape) and those physically incapable of hard labor
escaped working on some type of convict gang. State law required that all other
convicted felons serve their sentences at hard labor on a county or penitentiary chain
gang (Bethea 1912 v.2). If a county did not operate a chain gang, they could send them
to a neighboring county that did. Sentences could (and did) range from one year to
twenty. In Greenville County (2019), the average defendant charged with murder and
convicted of manslaughter was sentenced to 7.39 years (std dev 6.34) on the county
chain gang. The average sentence for grand larceny was 2.2 years (sd=2.02); it was 2.1
years (sd=2.24) for housebreaking, which was South Carolina's charge for nonviolent
burglary.




6 The state put all able-bodied men sentenced to the penitentiary to work, except death-row inmates, as

well. Some worked on roads; others worked on various other public works near the penitentiary in
Columbia.

                                                 12
        Again, in theory, all men convicted and sentenced to serve time were supposed
to serve their sentence at hard labor. In practice, however, black convicts served time
at hard labor; white convicts may or may or may not have. South Carolina law required
that convict gangs be segregated by race, but many counties with black gangs did not
have white gangs. A few counties operated racially integrated gangs, which drew sharp
rebukes but no penalties from the state's Board of Charities and Corrections when it
uncovered the practice. Of the state's 42 counties that operated a gang in 1920, 27
counties had no white convicts serving on one. Only majority white Pickens County
in the western Upstate had a majority white 40-convict gang in March 1920.
        Figure 1 maps average quarterly county-level gang populations between
September 1915 and June 1920 compiled by the South Carolina Board of Charities and
Corrections (1915-1920). The state required that all jails and convict camps be visited
by state inspectors each year and that counties provide quarterly reports on gang
populations and their racial composition. The Board reprinted the information in their
first six annual reports, and those statistics are summarized in the maps. Two features
stand out. First, the counties with the largest gang populations were those with large
cities. Thus, the largest gang populations are observed in Charleston County on the
Atlantic coast; in the Midlands counties of Richland and Aiken; and the Upstate counties
of Anderson, Greenville, and Spartanburg. In addition to having cities of 20,000 or more
residents, the common thread that connected the Midlands and Upstate counties with
the largest gangs was that each was home to multiple textile mills and substantial mill
village populations. Efforts to maintain order in the mill villages proved to be a constant
challenge to mill managers (Carlton 1982). Keeping order was enough of an issue in mill
towns that South Carolina law authorized some mills to employ private security and
build jails to lock up arrestees until they could be turned over to either a city police force
or sheriff's deputies.




                                             13
                                            Figure 1




        The right-hand graph displays the racially disparate treatment of black men
between the ages of 17 and 30 who were sentenced to the county chain gangs at
disproportionate rates. The average gang was 87% black; the median gang was 100%
black. Criminal activity was not a uniquely black activity, so how did counties maintain
mostly or all-black convict gangs? In some cases, whites were deemed physically unfit
for hard labor and sent to the state penitentiary. County courts could also send men
convicted of noncapital murder, manslaughter, attempted murder, and attempted rape
­ in effect, any genuinely dangerous convict ­ to the penitentiary rather than the county
gang if the court determined that the dangerous convict might disrupt the operation of
the convict gang (Bethea v.2 1912). 7 Court were more disposed to send dangerous white
prisoners to the penitentiary than blacks. The different approaches probably followed
from social attitudes that allowed gang officers to inflict harsher punishments on
disorderly black convicts than white convicts. Most gangs had an officer who served as
a "whipping boss," and transcripts of the testimony offered in Wimbish v. Jamison (1904)
and published in documents submitted to the Supreme Court of the United States (1905)



7 Noncapital murder involved a murder conviction in which the jury returned a guilty verdict with a
recommendation for mercy, and the state prosecutor and judge accepted the recommendation.

                                               14
offer graphic depictions of the whippings and beatings suffered by black men on the
gang. In 1913, for example, the governor, Cole Blease, learned that a black convict who
suffered from epilepsy had received 40 to 50 lashes and been subjected to 30 minutes
of electric shocks as punishment for not maintaining the pace of work required by the
gang supervisor. Blease considered the convict's treatment to be torture and paroled the
convict during good behavior (SC Board of Pardons 1913). Blease reminded the captain
of the gang that corporal punishment violated the state constitution, but less severe
beatings were common and common knowledge. Courts allowed white convicts to
avoid similar treatment by allowing them to serve sentences for less serious felonies in
county jails.
        The third option was to impose fines in lieu of terms at hard labor, with higher
fines for blacks than whites. A much-discussed case from Macon, Georgia in 1904
illuminates the practice (Huebner 2015). Arrested on a drunk and disorderly charge,
Henry Jamison was convicted and given the option of serving seven months on the gang
or paying a $60 fine, which he was unable to pay, a fact the court appeared to understand.
By noon of the day of his conviction he was already shackled and at work on the gang
(Jamison v. Wimbish 130 F. 351 (1904)). A petition for a writ of habeas corpus was granted
and the case argued before Judge Speer of the Southern District Court of Georgia in
Savannah. Speer struck down the punishment and his decision challenged the
constitutionality of the convict gang system more broadly. The case ended when the
Supreme Court of the United States issued a per curiam decision in which it reversed
Speer's ruling and remanded with a direction to quash the writ and dismiss the petition
(Wimbish v. Jamison, 199 U.S. 599, 1905; Supreme Court of the United States 1905). So
long as municipal and county courts observed the defendants' constitutional rights, they
could impose harsh punishments in discriminatory fashion. And they did.
        White voters enlisted the criminal justice system in support of the region's Jim
Crow regime of social control. Blacks who found themselves on the wrong side of the
law faced harsh punishments that served as a tax the benefits of which accrued mostly
to whites, especially those with automobiles and those who indirectly benefitted from
better maintained roads. The chain gang, at least as it was implemented in the South, is
a case study in the political economy of concentrated benefits and dispersed costs.

3. The economics of convict labor and highway maintenance
        3.1 The road commissioners' economic problem
        Jim Crow-era politicians justified the imposition of hard time on the chain
gang for misdemeanants and felons alike to a combination of retributive justice,
criminal deterrence, and the fiscal savings of using convict rather than wage labor on
road maintenance. This section offers some insights into whether South Carolina
realized cost savings from the use of convict labor.
        There are reasons to think that the employment of gang labor on the state's
roads was not a cost-saving measure. South Carolina's Board of Charities and
Corrections (1919, p.15) reported that "the present chain gang system is both
inefficient and unduly expensive." Their conclusion accords with those drawn by
Pennybacker, Fairbank and Draper (1916) and Steiner and Brown (1969/1927), who
argue that gangs used in road construction, not maintenance as in South Carolina, was
more costly than wage labor. Pennybacker, Fairbank and Draper (1916, p.30) argue
that the typical county chain gang of 15 to 25 convicts was too small to generate cost
savings in the construction of hard-surface roads and too large to generate cost savings
on soft-surface roads. Although their argument can be interpreted as a discussion of
economies of scale and minimum efficient scale, they do not have counts of gang size
or gang labor input. Rather they have miles completed and total costs, and they
calculate average costs per mile of completed construction in Virginia between 1909
and 1915. The summary data reported in Pennybacker, Fairbank, and Draper (1916)
is plotted in Appendix A. The graphs reveal that convict labor was not less expensive
in road construction, regardless of road type (see Figures A1-A3).
        The data reveal, however, that average costs per mile of grading roads, the
principal employment of South Carolina's convict gangs that repaired roads, was
minimized at just more than $1,000 per mile for an approximately 15-mile section of
road in Virginia (see Appendix Figure A4). Whereas the Virginia data reports costs of
new construction, South Carolina's convicts mostly repaired and (re-)graded already-
constructed roads, so it is possible that the minimum efficient length of road per gang
was greater than 15 miles and it is likely that the costs per miles were lower.
        The early twentieth-century discussions of the efficient use of gangs on road
focus on two features familiar to economists: fixed costs and scale economies. Gangs,

                                             16
regardless of their size at a given moment operated with a basic infrastructure that
included either a permanent or moveable camp made up of food preparation, sleeping
and sanitary facilities, however rudimentary the latter often was, as well as tools, mules,
and machinery. Gangs also operated under the supervision of armed guards, typically
one daytime guard per approximately 15 convicts, a night-shift guard for the entire
camp, and a gang superintendent or manager (Pennybacker, Fairbank and Draper
1916). Gangs also usually employed a cook and an animal minder, although these
functions were sometimes assigned to trustees, or long-term convicts who showed no
inclination to run away and had not violated camp rules.
         Given the nontrivial fixed costs, average fixed costs per convict will decline
throughout the relevant range. The direct per convict variable costs of basic
maintenance were low and approximately constant; meals consisted mostly of corn,
pork, dilute coffee and, perhaps, some fresh vegetables and fruit in season. Clothing
was basic and uniform, namely work clothes of medium-weight duck or denim with
the characteristic wide horizontal black and gray stripes so that there was no mistaking
convicts and patrollers. The use of guards and mules were lumpy in that contemporary
descriptions depict expansion paths along a near-Leontief-type production function;
that is, efficiency implies approximately fixed proportions between guards and
convicts (1:15), as well as between basic hand tools, likes shovels or rock hammers,
and convicts (1:1), mules and convicts, and road graders and convicts, and so on.
         Assume for simplicity that the only inputs to chain gangs are guards and
convicts, subject to a fixed-proportion technology, while the only inputs to wage-labor
patrols are wage workers and supervisors subject to a standard continuous production
function, such as one the results from a Cobb-Douglas-type technology. Assume, too,
that the costs of maintaining subsistence among gangs are low and approximately
constant, and that gang members themselves exhibit relatively low productivity due to
constant turnover of the gang workforce, as well as the poor health and low incentives
for diligent effort among convicts. 8



8 Steiner and Brown (1969/1927) and Pennybacker, Fairbank and Draper (1916) report high rates of

venereal disease, including advanced cases of syphilis, among convict road gangs; tuberculosis was not
uncommon. One of Pennybacker, Fairbank and Draper's many recommendations was to separate
diseased from healthy convicts, and to treat diseased convicts before putting them to work.

                                                  17
        Figure 2: costs and demands for gang- and patrol-maintained roads




        The economic decision-makers options can be illustrated with a graph as in
Figure 2. There is a constant but relatively high marginal cost curve for chain gangs.
If, in addition, we assume that a guard is added instantaneously every time the convict-
to-guard ratio exceeds the optimal ratio, the marginal cost curve will exhibit a
discontinuity or spike at those points (i.e., 16 convicts, 31 convicts, and so on if the
ratio is 15:1). Assume, as well, diminishing marginal productivity in wage-labor patrols,
which will yield the standard U-shaped marginal and average cost curves that are rising
in the relevant range of miles under repair. If Pennybacker, Fairbank and Draper's
(1916) interpretation is correct, the marginal cost of wage labor is below the marginal
cost of convict labor when only short sections of road are under repair, which requires
few workers. The marginal cost of wage labor is above the marginal cost of convict
labor when long sections, requiring more labor, are under repair. In the intermediate
region, near the intersection of the two cost curves, cost-minimizing administrators
may be indifferent between gangs and patrols or they may use some of each either
separately or together. Appendix Figure A5 reveals a positive correlation between
county road mileage and convict population in 1917. A simple OLS regression of log
miles on log gang size implies a positive, but not statistically significant, elasticity of


                                            18
convicts to miles of +0.08. Counties with more miles of road under maintenance had
more convicts.
       The economic problem facing southern administrators was to minimize road
maintenance costs given local taxpayers' preferred quantity and quality of a county's
roads, which yielded a demand for workers, whether wage labor or convicts. Given
the relative marginal costs of wage and convict labor, maintenance projects with only
few miles under repair are expected to have employed mostly wage labor. Projects with
many miles under repair are expected to have employed mostly convicts. Counties
with projects of intermediate length will have used some combination of wage and
convict labor if the demand curve for road maintenance is such that it passes through
the marginal cost curves near the intersection of the horizontal gang cost curve and
the rising wage-labor cost curve.


        3.1 The road commissioners' solution
        Data come from four of the South Carolina Highway Commission's Annual
Reports (1921 - 1924) that tabulated enough data to test the hypothesis. The
commission reported cost and mileage data by road section under maintenance by
county and labor force type. Although some counties relied exclusively on wage labor
and patrols or convict labor, most counties employed a combination of convict and
wage labor, sometimes on the same road sections. Table 3 provides the basic statistics
where the unit of observation is the road section under repair. The sample is restricted
to soft-surface roads, which was the type of road maintained by chain gangs. The
average section under maintenance was 34.4 miles and average cost per mile was
$351.30. Approximately one-fifth of the state's road were worked by gangs alone; 42%
of roads were worked by wage-labor patrols alone, and the remaining 36% were
maintained by a combination of convicts and wage workers. The commission's annual
reports also rated the quality of the road under maintenance, most of which were rated
"Fair" to "Good." Less than one-tenth of road sections maintained received higher
ratings, which points to counties prioritizing maintenance on lower quality roads.

       Figure 3 presents a scatterplot of cost per mile of road maintenance against
miles of road under maintenance from the commission's reports. Regrettably, the
commission did not record the number of workers or hours worked on the road
sections, but it is not unreasonable to assume that miles and worker-days are
functionally related. Black diamonds represent gangs, blue squares represent wage-
labor road patrols, and red circles the sections worked by both. Three lines in
corresponding colors trace out the estimated central tendencies of per-mile costs using
a quadratic functional form and no additional covariates. The resulting curves are U-
shaped and the 95% confidence intervals (not plotted) all overlap, but the curves
suggest that wage labor was marginally less costly per mile than gangs on short road
sections and that gangs were marginally less costly per mile than wage labor on longer
road sections.

        A formal empirical analysis of the cost data involves testing whether the
annualized maintenance cost per mile is lower for gangs than for patrols or
combinations of gangs and patrols (the reports do not provide information on the
average number of men working on gangs or patrols, which will tend to attenuate the
estimated effects). To test the hypothesis, I estimate the following fixed-effect
regression from a multi-year panel of road section-level data:


   ln()
                                                                =  +   +  / +  ln()
                                                                +  +  +  +  + 


The labor variable is a pair of indicator variables; the first ­ gang  equals one if the
road crew is a gang, and zero otherwise; the second ­ gang/patrol  equals one if the
road crew is a combination of gang and patrol and zero otherwise. The excluded
category is the patrol. If the use of convicts reduced the costs of road maintenance,
the coefficients will be negative. Because the unit of observation is the road section

                                                                                       21
repaired there are multiple observations for most counties in most years. If a county
worked more than one road crew, there is an entry for each such crew. Reported work
crews included gangs, patrols, and combinations of gangs and patrols. It is not clear
whether gangs and patrols worked together or separately, but some segments worked
by gang­patrol combinations were less than two miles in length, which suggests that
they coordinated their efforts if they did not work side-by-side.
        The coefficient on the natural logarithm of miles variable will indicate any
(dis)economies of scale in road maintenance. Cost (dis)economies may also be
captured in the Months fixed effects, which take on values between 1 and 12 and
account for the number of months a gang or patrol worked on a given road segment.
Steiner and Brown (1927/1969) and Pennybacker, Draper and Fairbanks (1916) agree
that it was costly to move gangs and camps between work sites. The longer a gang
worked out of one base, the lower were relocation costs and down time. The
regressions also include fixed effects for road condition (excluded category = fair),
year (excluded category = 1921), and county. County fixed effects capture all relevant
time-invariant factors within a county that influence the per-mile cost of road
maintenance, but these results need to be interpreted cautiously because not every
county employs each type of road crew.
        Table 3 provides key summary statistics for the road maintenance cost data.
The average cost per mile was $351 and the average maintenance crew maintained
about 34 miles of soft-surface roads. The regression analysis considers only soft-
surface roads for two reasons: (1) counties were directly responsible for relatively few
miles of hard-surface roads, some counties had none; and (2) as discussed earlier,
construction and maintenance costs were considerably different for hard- and soft-
surface roads. The data also reveal that about 21 percent of soft-surface roads were
maintained exclusively by chain gangs. Another 36 percent were maintained by a
combination of gangs and free-labor patrols; and 43 percent were maintained by
patrols alone. Thus, it was not the case that most county roads in the state were
maintained by chain gangs. Twice as many counties relied on patrols alone as counties
that relied on gangs alone. Finally, the state highway commission classified a county's
roads as either Fair, Fair-Good, Good, Good-Excellent, or Excellent. Few sections of
road were deemed excellent; most were considered good or just marginally so.

                 Table 4 presents the regression results. The dependent variable is the natural
       logarithm of maintenance costs per mile. Fixed effects controls are entered stepwise
       and tests of joint significance of the fixed effects are reported in the relevant row-
       column cell. Column 1 includes only two indicator variables for road crew type (the
       excluded category is Patrol). This regression points to no cost advantage for counties
       that used gangs or patrols and gangs, instead of patrols alone. Column 2 includes the
       natural logarithm of miles of roads under maintenance to capture any economies in
       maintenance. Columns 3 through 6 sequentially add County, Year, Road Quality, and
       Months Worked fixed effects. Column 6 includes all the fixed effects.
                 The first feature to note is the positive coefficients on Gang and Gang/Patrol
       indicator variables in the first two columns. The first column does not control for
       miles under maintenance and the second does not include county fixed effects, which
       should capture all the time-invariant county-level factors not included in the

                                                          23
regressions. Pennybacker, Fairbank and Draper (1916) and Steiner and Brown
(1927/1969), for all intents, draw their conclusions on the inefficiency of gang labor
from an analysis that corresponds to Column 2, without any fixed effects. The cross-
sectional OLS results are consistent with their conclusion that gangs were more costly
than patrols. After controlling for miles under maintenance, the use of gangs increased
costs by about 8.2 percent, though the estimate is imprecise. Both early analyses
opposed the concurrent use of convicts and patrollers because maintaining discipline
was a challenge when the two types worked together, which raised supervision costs
and reduced labor effort. And the OLS results are consistent with their conclusions.
Mixed gang-patrol work crews raised costs by an estimated 15 to 16 percent.
         The second feature to note is the apparent existence of economies of scale
around the average length of road section maintained. Coefficient estimates in
columns 3 through 6 point to a cost elasticity between -0.085 and -0.169. That is,
holding the type of labor force constant, a ten percent increase in mileage reduced per
mile costs by about 8.5 to 17.0 percent.
         The third feature to note is the importance of controlling for unobserved
county-level factors and road conditions that affected costs. Once county fixed effects
are included (Column 3), the elasticity per mile costs to miles under maintenance was
-8.5%, which points to cost economies in maintenance.
         Compared to the use of patrols, the data provide some limited evidence that
the use of gangs in combination or alone reduced road maintenance costs in a
statistically significant or economically meaningful fashion. The fixed effects estimates
point to lower per mile costs of gangs of between 7.2 and 12.7 percent, though the
estimates are not precisely estimated. Using gangs and wage labor or patrols in
combination reduced per miles costs by 5.0 to 7.0 percent. 9
         The empirical findings reported here are not consistent with Pennybacker,
Fairbank and Draper (1914) and Steiner and Brown (1969/1927), who argued that
convict gangs were so grossly inefficient that their use inflated road building and
maintenance costs. South Carolina's Board of Charities and Corrections (1919, p.15),


9 Tests of the equality of coefficients across models (columns 2 and 6) fail to reject the null of equal

coefficients on the Gang variable, but they reject the null (p-value = 0.02) of coefficient equality on the
Gang/Patrol variable.

                                                   24
too, wrote that "the present chain gang system is both inefficient and unduly
expensive." South Carolina's commissioners contended that gangs were too small and
the labor turnover too high to provide cost-effective road maintenance. But in offering
this conclusion, it appears that the Board members overlooked the statistics they
reported elsewhere. Their returns from county gangs between 1915 and 1920 reveal
that most convicts were sentenced to relatively long terms on county convict gangs.
The vast majority served terms longer than six months; some men were sentenced to
terms exceeding five and even ten years. If there were any learning-by-doing
efficiencies to be captured in working a mule-drawn road grader, digging ditches, and
clearing roadside brush, it is hard to believe that the learning would not occur with the
first few weeks of a six-plus-month term on the gang. It does not appear to be the case
that gangs were notably less efficient than wage labor when deployed in gang-
appropriate employments. It also does not appear to be the case that they were more
efficient, on average.
        The results are consistent with a hypothesis that state and county authorities
and road repair managers chose a road crew type ­ gang, patrol, or a combination ­
that they believed to be the low-cost option for a given maintenance project. If
managers were cost minimizing agents of taxpayers, they would have equalized the
marginal cost of a mile of road repair across labor types. The data here are average,
rather than marginal costs, but the long-run equilibrium in a competitive market
equates the two. We cannot say that road supervisors were not acting in a cost-
minimizing fashion in choosing between convict gangs and wage workers or patrollers.
        The available data does not afford an opportunity to determine whether
putting convicts to work on the roads, housing them in substandard quarters, and
feeding them a nutrient-deficient diet of corn and pork was less expensive than
warehousing them in county jails and state prisons. But assessments of South
Carolina's county jails provided in the annual reports of the Board of Charities and
Corrections (1919) depict jail conditions that were no less wretched than gang
conditions ­ damp, drafty, poorly maintained structures, filthy linens, inadequate
sanitary facilities, and bad food ­ that could not have been much more costly to
taxpayers to operate than convict labor camps. If convicts were at least as productive
as wage workers when employed on road maintenance projects, taxpayers may have

                                           25
saved some money by putting them to work. But if convicts were not at least as
productive at road work, on average, as wage labor and were no less costly to taxpayers
than warehousing them in rudimentary, unsanitary jails, southerners must have
believed that gangs served some purpose other than cost-saving, criminal deterrence,
perhaps, or retributive justice. That issue is the subject of future research.


4 Concluding comments
        A host of studies have documented the costs and economic inefficiencies
associated with the South's black codes. Higgs (1989), for example, finds that the early
twentieth-century racial wage gap was due, in part, to southern states' discriminatory
provision of educational resources. Donohue and Heckman (1991) document that the
wage gap was due, in part, to discriminatory hiring and job assignments that were
eliminated only through federal affirmative-action enforcement. Jim Crow also
included zoning laws designed to exclude blacks from public goods-rich communities
and neighborhoods (Halcoussis and Lowenberg 1998). In general, southern black
codes constructed walls between the races in marriage, education, employment, public
accommodation, and transportation (Woodward 1957). In the balance, discriminatory
white southerners, through their Jim Crow policies, introduced economic inefficiency
and reduced both black and white welfare (Wright 1999).
        This paper investigates one aspect of discriminatory law enforcement and
penology in the Jim Crow South, which is a relatively understudied source of the
region's economic inefficiency. The results generate two broad conclusions. First, it is
no surprise to find that the harshest punishments for criminal offenses were reserved
for young, disfranchised black men. The sanitized Hollywood images of the South's
Jim Crow-era chain gangs as racially integrated and relatively nonviolent does not fairly
depict the systematic legal (corporal punishment was legal) and extralegal (brutal
beatings were not) violence reserved for black men serving on predominantly or
wholly black convict gangs.
        Second, chain gangs were at least as productive as wage workers in maintaining
South Carolina's roads and may have been marginally more so. Contrary to the
assertions of the gangs' early twentieth-century critics, gangs were competitive with



                                            26
wage labor. County administrators and road supervisors found ways to use convicts in
ways that made them serve the interests of local taxpayers.
