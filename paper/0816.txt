                      Troubled Workers in the Labor Market



                                    ABSTRACT



     This paper seeks to discover the criteria by which workers are judged

to be "troubled," to examine the severity of the economic problems facing

"troubled" groups, and to determine whether the condition of these people

is relatively permanent or the result of transitory setbacks. The paper

provides a broad overview of some of the literature on troubled groups

in the labor market, and puts forth several basic propositions about those

having trouble in the labor market. Among these are the fact that many

workers at the bottom of the income distribution are permanently plagued

by problems of low earnings, that workers who drop substantially in the

earnings distribution do not recover their previous economic positions,

and that personal, unobserved characteristics are important factors in the

labor market problems of individuals. Another finding is that areas with

high rates of unemployment tend to experience these rates for a decade

or more, classifying most regional differences in unemployment as per-

manent rather than transitory.

               TROUBLED WORKERS IN THE LABOR MARKET

    The Trade Assistance Act, the Area Redevelopment Act, the
Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) , various equal
employment laws, and other Government programs have been devel-
oped to help people having trouble in the job market. These peo-
ple include displaced workers from the shoe, automobile, and
electronics industries; older persons who have lost their jobs;
workers in declining communities; low—wage workers in the rural
South; working women who are heads of households; and low—wage
black and Hispanic workers. All these groups and others have
been cited at various times by various observer.s as being
likely to benefit from social programs to alleviate their
problems in the labor market.

    By what criteria are workers judged to be "troubled"? How
serious are the economic problems facing "troubled" groups? Is
the condition of these people relatively permanent or the re—
suit of transitory setbacks?
    This paper seeks to answer these questions. It examines
evidence on the dimensions and nature of the "troubled worker"
problem and on the reasons for the problem. It reviews a
variety of studies that focus on troubled groups in the job
market and presents a new analysis of the Panel Survey of
Income Dynamics, a longitudinal survey covering approximately
5,000 families from 1967 to 1979 (University of Michigan Survey
Research Center). Because the problems of youth employment
have been dealt with in detail elsewhere (Freeman and Wise,
1981) this paper addresses only the problems of adult earners,
age 24 and above.
     The literature on troubled workers differs in several
respects from that on many other economic subjects, because
evidence and hypotheses about behavior are derived from more
diverse sources. Some of the most intriguing ideas——those
relating to the "dual labor market" (Doeringer and Piore,
1971)——were obtained by direct observation rather than by
theorizing about the operation of a competitive economy or by
manipulating computer data files. Controlled experiments have
also examined the nature of the problems facing troubled work-
ers.    At the same time, researchers have performed statistical
analyses of cross—sectional data sets and, to a greater extent
than is common in other areas of research, of longitudinal data
sets as well.

    Ths paper provides a broad overview of some of the
literature on troubled groups in the labor market. It seeks,
so far as possible, to avoid the interpretive debate between




                              105
the "dual labor market" and "human capital" analysis that runs
through much of the literature, and tries instead to concen-
trate on empirical findings, regardless of their source. A
first step in evaluating various theories is to "get the facts
straight."
    Section 1 explores alternative concepts of troubled workers
and seeks to show how the resultant universe of need varies
with definition. Section 2 considers the correlates and causes
of the problems. Section 3, the most extensive part of the
study, reviews evidence on five groups of workers often cited
as having problems in the job market. Section 4 is a brief
conclusion.
    The principal results of the analysis can be summarized in
11 basic propositions about workers, and groups of workers,
having trouble in the job market:
    1.   Many workers at the bottom of the income distribution
are permanently plagued by problems of low earnings. If "per—
manently disadvantaged" is defined as being in the lowest dec—
ile of the male earnings distribution for 70 percent or more of
the time over a decade, about 5 percent of working men who are
heads of households are "permanently disadvantaged." And 60
percent of women household heads who are in the labor force in
any given year are in the lowest earnings decile for men. The
existence of this group reflects the predominance of a perma-
nent rather than transitory earnings in the American earnings
distribution.

    2.   Although many workers who lose their jobs (or other-
wise suffer from sudden declines in amount of time worked or in
wages earned) recover successfully, workers who drop substan-
tially in the earnings distribution do not recover their pre-
vious economic positions. That is, large declines in earnings
have a substantial permanent as well as transitory component.
    3.   Low wages and lack of work taking the form of few
weeks worked both contribute to placing an individual at the
bottom of the earnings distribution. Surprisingly, perhaps,
low wages appear to be the more important cause of permanent
economic disadvantage.
    4.   Low—earning workers have certain distinct character-
istics. For the most part, they are black, poorly educated,
relativ-ly unskilled, female, and located in certain indust-
ries. Regression analysis designed to predict the composition
of the troubled group based on the objective characteristics,
however, is less accurate than simply taking a random selection
of workers who were ever in the bottom decile. This fact high-
lights the importance of personal, unobserved factors in the
labor market problems of individuals.


                              106
    5.   The classic labor market adjustments to economic dif-
ficulties——mobility of supply, growth of demand In response to
availability of labor, and changes in wages——appear to be rea-
sonably efficacious for displaced workers, for depressed com-
munities, and for most older workers with job market troubles.
Similarly, economic developments in the 1970's helped improve
the positions of black and Hispanic workers. The Situation for
women heads of households, however, shows little evidence of
change, and sluggish economic growth has meant that persons at
the bottom have hardly improved their absolute earnings.
    6.   Economic growth raises the labor market earnings of
all groups, including disadvantaged workers. It significantly
improves the relative earnings and employment chances of blacks
and, to a lesser extent, women. Although the absolute level of
the earnings of all groups is raised by growth, the earnings
distribution itself is only modestly affected; therefore,
growth does little to improve their relative position.

    With respect to specific groups of troubled workers, the
evidence indicates the following:
    7.   Perhaps the group with the most serious labor market
problem is working women who are heads of households. Their
annual earnings place them in the bottom decile of the earnings
distribution for men to a greater extent than any other defined
group. Unlike blacks, whose median wage and salary earnings
have risen rapidly in the past two decades, women have not
fared well, although nonwhite women have closed the gap between
themselves and white women.

    8.   Economic changes affecting the black community in re-
cent years have substantively altered the nature of the labor
market problem for blacks. A significant proportion of black
men have made considerable economic advances; at the same time,
however, the labor participation of black men has fallen,
creating a disparity between those holding jobs in the main-
stream economy and those outside the mainstream. Traditional
equal employment activities do not seem to offer a route out of
economic distress for many less skilled black workers. For
Hispanics, lack of education and lack of skills appear to be
the most important deterrents to economic progress.
    9.   While most displaced workers manage to recover their
jobs or to obtain good jobs elsewhere, time worked and real
wages fall noticeably for many workers as a result of displace-
ment. In some cases, it appears that workers who lose jobs for
reasons related to foreign competition suffer more serious earn-
ings declines than do other job losers, perhaps because of




                              107
especially severe and permanent declines in their sectors.
The 1osses in earnings are large enough to reduce the workers'
position markedly in the earnings distribution.
    10. Although the positive cross—sectional relationship
between age and earnings may make claims that older workers are
a troubled group seem incorrect, older job losers do appear to
have significant problems, such as protracted unemployment,
lower wages upon receipt of new jobs, and fewer hours worked.
Health problems seriously impair the earnings of some older
workers.
    11. Areas with high rates of unemployment tend to experi-
ence these rates for long periods, a decade or more, making
most regional differences in unemployment permanent rather than
transitory. These differences appear to be at least partially
compensated for by higher wage rates, although the extent to
which persistent unemployment is in excess of that consistent
with equilibrium compensating differentials is unknown. "An
area of high unemployment and low wages" is a better definition
of economically troubled areas than the current definition
based solely on high unemployment rates.
           1. The Problem: Concepts and Definitions
    As already indicated, many groups of workers have been
cited as facing serious troubles in the job market. Two basic
criteria are used to label workers as troubled. The first
focuses on levels of earnings, with workers having low earnings
viewed as being troubled. Following common nomenclature, we
call these workers disadvantaged. The second definition
focuses on workers suffering significant earnings losses, even
though their initial earnings may be relativ'ly high. These
are generally workers who lose their jobs. We call them
distressed workers.
    The two definitions yield different pictures of who is in
trouble. Conceptually, since workers with very low earnings
have little to lose, they are rarely likely to qualify as trou-
bled by a loss criterion, whereas workers with high earnings
are potentially vulnerable to large losses that still leave
many of them with reasonably high earnings.
    The extent to which one worries about workers with low
earnings or with significant losses of earnings depends on two
aspects of their economic position: Its permanent or transi-
tory nature, and the extent to which the individuals or their
families have other income in the relevant period.



                              108
                  The Permanent/Transitory Issue

    The distinction between permanent and transitory income,
originally developed by Friedman and Kuznets (1954) , is central
to identification of real problems in the job market. Workers
with low earnings because of transitory difficulties, who will
receive large increases in the future, are not in the same
category of economic trouble as workers with permanently low
earnings.

    How permanent or transitory is the earnings distribution,
particularly at the lower end? The principal study investi-
gating this question was done by Lillard and Willis (1978)
They found the earnings distribution to be dominated by its
permanent component to a degree that may surprise some read-
ers. In particular, Lillard and Willis found that the correla-
tion coefficients between earnings in one year and earnings in
ensuing years was high initially (about 0.8) and declined only
modestly (to about 0.7 after 6 years) among male heads of
households (see figure 1). This persistence yields an estimate
that 73 percent of income differences among individuals is
permanent and 27 percent is transitory. Lillard and Willis
further estimated that 65 percent to 73 percent of the per-
manent component of income differences was attributable to
measured characteristics of individuals.

    For poverty groups, their study showed that although only
15 percent of white and 35 percent of black workers expected to
be below the poverty level in all 3 years of a given 3—year
period, the chance of being in poverty was greatly affected by
being in poverty during previous years. A white in poverty in
one year has a 37 percent chance of being in poverty the fol-
lowing year, compared with a 1.7 percent chance if the worker
had not been in poverty earlier. For blacks, the differences
are 60 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively.

    As part of this study, I have examined tha Michigan Panel
Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID) and obtained results consis-
tent with Lillard and Willis. Table 1 provides a summary of my
PSID results. It shows the number of appearances in the lowest
deciles for male heads of households. The permanent nature of
low earnings for a large number of workers is evident.   During
the decade covered, while only 1.3 percent of those at the bot-
tom decile were at the bottom every year, 5.1 percent were at
the bottom in all but 3 years. A definite group is located
permanently at the bottom of the earnings distribution. In
1969, this group's earnings averaged $3,511 a year; in 1978,
Its average earnings were $5,679. Note that the 62 percent
increase for the group is considerably below the 78 percent
rate of inflation in the period.

    Although I stress the permanent nature of earnings, other
analysts (Coe, 1978; Levy, 1976) looking at the same or similar
data have stressed the substantial year—to—year changes in eco-
nomic status. In part, this difference is a question of
whether the water glass is half empty or half full. But it
also is a question of whether one focuses on earnings of indi-
viduals or on family incomes. One of the most stri'zing
findings of the Michigan PSID analysis is that changes in
family incomes, and thus poverty status, are affected more by
changes in family organization than by changes in the earnings
of family heads (Duncan and Morgan, 1981, p. 2). This result
suggests greater instability in family incomes than in indi-
vidual earnings, which is consistent with a relativeiy perma-
nent earnings distribution.
    The data underlying table 1 also permit us to examine the
status of workers who suffer significant income losses. Table
2 shows how these workers fare several years later. Part 1
shows that almost 14 percent of male workers experienced de—
dines of two or more deciles. Part 2 shows that for workers
who are big losers, most do not readily recover their posi-
tions, while parts 3 and 4 show that for workers who main-
tained their decile position from 1969 to 1972 gains and losses
in the ensuing period left them in roughly the same position
from 1972 to 1977. on average, those who suffer large losses
end up below their initial positions by about one decile after
5 years. This does not imply that job losers necessarily
suffer permanent income losses, but rather that large changes
in the position of workers in the distribution are partly
permanent changes.
    For purely transitory shocks, the speed with which workers
recover can be estimated using the Lillard and Willis (1978)
model. According to their calculations, earnings in one year
have a serial correlation of 0.4 above and beyond the permanent
income component. This implies that a transitory slip that
reduces earnings by 10 percent in an initial ycar would reduce
earnings by 4 percent in the following year and by less than 1
percent 3 years later. Hence, in this analysis the displaced
workers essentially recover their full positions in 5 years,
assuming all of the slip is transitory.
    Thus far we have examined the economic status of male heads
of households. What about female heads of households?
    Bectuse women earn strikingly less pay than men, and
because women may change their status through marriage or by
dropping out of the labor force, our analysis for women is dif-
ferent from our analysis for men. First, we use the male de—
ciles as earnings categories and include "out of labor force"

or "rio longer head" as special categories. Table 3 presents
the results of our analysis. It shows a larger degree of per-
manence at the bottom of the distribution, because the lower
absolute level of earnings of women more than counterbalances
the enhanced opportunity for "escape" into other states. For
women working in all the years, the pattern of correlation is
similar to that for men; the fact that women are more perma-
nently in the troubled group does not reflect anything special
about their earnings determination process except the mean
level of earnings. Because of the shape of earnings distribu-
tions, the differences in means between men and women
translates into even larger differences in the fraction below a
specified cutoff point. Consistent with the results in table
3, Duncan and Hoffman (1981) reported in their analysis of the
PSID data that "in any given year, half of the white women and
three-quarters of the black women fell into the bottcni fifth of
the male wage rate distribution..." (p. 86).
                    The Hard Core Hypothesis

    The "half empty" or "half full" question of whether workers
at the lower tail of the earnings distribution are there more
or less permanently than we would expect can be examined in
terms of the recent findings of Clark and Summers (1979). In a
series of papers, they have demonstrated that much unemployment
in the United States is generated by a small "hard core" of
persons who lack work for extended periods. They show that "a
large fraction of all unemployment is attributable to persons
out of work a large part of the time" (p. 116). Their analysis
effectively disproves the view of unemployment as a transitory,
turnover problem.
    To what extent does the "hard core" hypothesis fit the
troubled workers on whom we have focused? Table 4 suggests
that, as in unemployment, a small group of men facing permanent
economic problems constitutes the bulk of the disadvantaged
male worker problem. More than 44 percent of ..he person—years
in the lowest decile are accounted for by 5 percent of the
workers "permanently" in the decile. This is, of course,
simply another way of documenting the basic finding of
longitudinal studies of income distribution: The earnings
structure is dominated by its permanent component. Jencks'
(1973) conclusion that the income distribution is dominated by
luck is simply wrong unless one means "luck" in gaining a
permanent income.

                         Outside Income
    Individual workers who are disadvantaged or distressed may
have outside earnings or live in families with other earnings.
To what extent do these other forms of income place the trou-
bled workers in a higher position in the income distribution
than one would otherwise expect?

Is limited to women who were household heads over the entire 10
year period. In the PSID, 80.8 percent of women who were heads in
the initial year (1969) were heads for all of the years, whereas
19.2 percent were not heads for all 10 years.

    To answer this question, I have made the tabulations of the
PSID data contained in table 5. This table shows that the fam-
ilies of disadvantaged workers do not receive sufficient out-
side income to alter their relative position, although they do
receive enough to improve their absolute income significantly.
In part, this conclusion reflects the fact that the income
transfer programs of the government reduce the absolute level
of poverty of people at the bottom, as numerous analysts (see
Danziger, Haveman, and Plotnick, 1981) have pointed out.
    All told, the families of workers identified as disadvan-
taged by labor market earnings remain in the most serious
economic trouble. They are not people who work for low wages
because they have large outside incomes; nor are they persons
subject to transitory declines in economic status. They are
workers who are persistently at the bottom of the earnings
distribution.

       2. Correlates and Causes of Labor Market Problems
    Diverse reasons have been proposed to explain why certain
workers have permanent problems in the job market. Some re-
searchers believe that workers at the bottom of the distri-
bution have innately low productivity because of human capital
factors. Others believe the problem stems from a lack of "good
jobs," that low—wage workers could fill better jobs given the
chance. Still others cite discriminatory barriers as a cause
of low earnings. For displaced workers, changes in demand con-
ditions due to foreign competition, automation, and similar
factors are often cited as causes of problems. Because groups
and individuals having market problems differ greatly, differ-
ent factors are likely to operate on the various groups. In
this section, I present an overview of some elements that must
be considered in any assessment of causality.
                Low Wages Versus Few Weeks Worked

    One of the more surprising findings of the poverty research
of the past decade was the discovery that a large proportion of
families in poverty had household heads working full time
year—round. According to this finding, low wag.s are a major
factor determining poverty status.
    How many of the permanently disadvantaged persons on the
PSID are in that state because of low wages, rather than be
cause of few hours worked? Table 6 presents calculations
designed to answer this question. It shows the mean wages and
hours worked of disadvantaged, distressed, arid other male
workers in our samples. Perhaps the most surprising finding in

    b. Although each individual's annual earnings are the product
of his average hourly earnings and his annual hours, it is not
necessarily true that the mean value of annual earnings for any
group is exactly equal to the product of the mean average hourly
earnings and the mean annual hours. This accounts for the slight
difference between the actual and hypothetical earnings for all
men.

    c. The hypothetical earnings figure for each group is the
product of the group's own mean level of average tiourly earnings
(as shown in the first column) and the mean leve) of annual hours
for the sample as a whole (2,296 hours).

the table is the extensive hours worked by disadvantaged and
displaced workers and by workers in the bottom decile. The
column on the far right shows that even if the disadvantaged
workers worked as many hours over the year as other men, their
year—round earnings would still be quite low, around 5,3O0.
Only a small proportion would rise out of the bottom decile if
they worked full time at their current wages.

    The importance of low wages in keeping workers at the bot-
tom of the income distribution can also be analyzed by com-
paring the correlation coefficients for hourly pay with those
for time worked. Correlation coefficients for hourly wages and
hours worked yield higher correlations for wages, though even
time worked shows considerable persistence. A positive corre—
lation also exists in the data between hourly pay and time
worked.

    Figures for distressed workers tell a different story about
the importance of wages and time worked in reducing a worker's
position in the earnings distribution. Tabulating the annual
earnings, annual hours, and average hourly earnings of workers
who fell two or more deciles from 1969 to 1978 (or in any sub—
period), we estimated that the average drop in the logarithm of
annual earnings between 1969 and the year of their biggest de-
cline in decile position was —0.38. Of this drop, 0.28 points
were due to declines in hours worked and 0.10 points were due
to declines in wages. This result indicates that for dis-
tressed workers much of the problem is due to lack of work
rather than low wages.

       Characteristics of the Disadvantaged and Distressed

    Who are the disadvantaged workers? Who drops in the earn-
ings distribution? Any assessment of the factors causing some
workers to end up at the bottom of the distribution and others
to experience substantial drops in income requires knowledge of
the distinguishing characteristics of the workers.
    Although most studies of low income focus on family incomes
rather than on individual earnings, analyses of earnings func-
tions and of the determinants of poverty—level wages by
Bluestone, Murphy, and Stevenson (1973) and Muller (1977) show
results roughly similar to those found in poverty studies.
Workers with low earnings tend to be those for whom standard
earnings equations would predict to have low earnings, i.e.,
relatively unskilled workers, blacks, women, and so forth.
Table 7 documents this fact with the 1971 Michigan PSID data.
The first columns present the coefficients on selected vari-
ables in earnings equations (columns 2 and 3) and hours
equations (column 4); the last three equations explain who
faces serious economic trouble, due to the distress of falling

two or more deciles in the distribution (column 5); being in
our disadvantaged group (column 6); and in terms of the number
of times an individual appears in the bottom decile (column
7). It is riot surprising that in general the same characteris—
tics that affect average earnings also influence the likelihood
of falling at the bottom of the distribution. So long as the
distributions of persons in the various groups being compared
are reasonably shaped (for example, they have a standard single
hump and nonriegligible tails), factors that alter average
levels of earnings will necessarily also alter the frequency of
falling below a certain cutoff point. Indeed, if distributions
had specified shapes (for instance, lognormal), we could esti-
mate the impact of factors on the chance of being below a
cutoff point from estimates of the effect of that factor on
earnings.

    It is significant to note the importance of industry in de-
termining the earnings arid disadvantaged status of workers in
the table 7 calculations. In a detailed analysis of the deter-
minants of poverty status among families of workers employed 40
weeks or more, Muller (1977) found industry to be as important
as education in some calculations and important in virtually
all. In hourly wage regressions, industry was second to
education as an explanatory factor while in determination of
poverty—level wages, industry was the major factor. At one
level, evidence of an important industry component in the wage
determination process can and has been taken as indicative of
support for the dual market hypothesis that workers with the
same personal attributes obtain very different economic out-
comes in different parts of the economy. The evidence can also
be interpreted, however, as reflecting unobserved personal
attributes: Low—wage industries may simply be the "employers
of last resort" for the less productive. Whatever the reason,
industry, as well as standard demographic and human capital
factors, is an important determinant of earnings and disadvan-
taged status.

    Another interesting aspect of table 7 is found in the
coefficients for older workers, who, despite having incomes
above those of the deleted (30- to 34-year-old) group, have
greater chances of being in the disadvantaged and displaced
sets. This fact highlights the problems, to be discussed
later, of troubled older workers.

    Although definite characteristics can be associated with
being disadvantaged, it is important to recognize that models
that predict a person's disadvantaged status from these charac—
teristics are not as reliable as knowledge of a person's pre-
vious placement in the lowest decile in predicting permanent
placement in the lowest decile. We documented this point by



                             125
comparing the fraction of persons correctly and incorrectly
predicted, based on their 1971 characteristics, to be in the
lowest decile seven or more times with the fraction predicted
by previous placement in the lowest decile. We used linear
probability models to predict disadvantaged status from an in-
dividual's position in the earnings distribution in 1971 and
selected demographic characteristics. The results of these
regressions were a set of predicted probabilities on whether or
not a given individual would be in the disadvantaged group.
These predicted values were used with a set of cutoff criteria
such that for each model the percentage of the sample predicted
to be in the disadvantaged group was equal to the actual pro-
portion (5.2 percent). Under these criteria, using demographic
characteristics provided relatively little gain in predictive
power.
    When the only datum used was the individual's poverty
status in 1971 (whether or not he was in the bottom decile),
the results were: 3.0 percent predicted disadvantaged and
actually disadvantaged; 2.2 percent predicted disadvantaged
and not actually disadvantaged; 2.2 percent not predicted dis-
advantaged and actually disadvantaged. When the individual's
1971 poverty status was used along with simple demographic
characteristics (education, age, race, region), the accuracy
increased only slightly: 3.5 percent predicted disadvantaged
actually disadvan.taged; 1.7 percent predicted disadvantaged
not actually disadvantaged; 1.7 percent not predicted disad-
vantaged actually disadvantaged. Moreover, adding more com-
plex controls (industry, occupation) did not improve the re—
suits any further.

Family Background
    To what extent does family background influence a person's
chances of being a distressed or disadvantaged worker?
    Since most studies of the economic impact of family back-
ground have examined the link between background factors and
average economic success, we rely on that relation to infer the
effects of background on the chances of being i.n one of our
troubled categories. Using background measure3 such as paren-
tal occupation and education, most studies find that background
operates largely through education. Bowles (1972) criticized
the conclusion on measurement error grounds and showed that
background could have a larger independent effect than was
obtaine1 in regressions that did not correct for measurement
error. Although studies that correct for measurement error
have failed to substantiate Bowles's specific argument (see
Corcoran and Datcher, 1981, pp. 175—76), work with other meas-
ures of family income has supported the thrust of his point.



                                126
Family income arid at least one other measure of family back-
ground, religion, are also important factors in earnings
 (Jencks, 1979; Corcoran and Datcher, 1981) even with education
held fixed. A different set of studies has sought to estimate
background effect using data on brothers and twins on the hypo—
thesis that similarity between brothers and twins reflects
similarity of background. These studies suggest a support role
for unmeasured background factors (genetic or environmental) in
determining earnings (Taubman, 1976; Behrrnan and Taubman, 1976;
Behrrnan, Taubman, and Wales, 1977). The new work indicates
that "the families into which men are born have a considerable
impact upon their chances of economic success" (Corcoran and
Datcher, 1981, p. 203). From this we can reasonably assume
that family background is an important determinant of whether a
worker is permanently in trouble in the job market.
The Dual Market Hypothesis

    Two basic views attempt to explain why some individuals
become permanently disadvantaged in the job market. Standard
economic analysis seeks to explain the lower tail of the earn—
•ings distribution in terms of the same economic factors that
operate elsewhere. From the supply side, this makes the deter-
mination of poverty—level wages a question of personal pro-
ductivity, of human capital. On the demand side, the theory of
compensating diferentia1s is used, in conjunction with posited
prejudiced tastes, to explain the particularly low earnings of
minority and women workers. The principal alternative to the
standard theory is the dual or segmented market hypothesis,
which seeks to offer a more focused explanation of the lower
tail in terms of the characteristics of low—wage labor markets
and the theory of rioncompeting groups.
    The dual market hypothesis has three basic components: (1)
The job people hold is an important determinant of their pro-
ductivity, so that two workers with the same human capital
could have different levels of productivity and wages in dif-
ferent parts of the economy; (2) there is limited mobility be-
tween the part of the labor market where wages are high, jobs
are stable, and learning opportunities are significant (the
so—called primary sector) and the part of the ir'arket where jobs
are "bad" (the secondary sector); and (3) in the "secondary
sector," personal attributes such as education and age are
relatively modest determinants of earnings, so that persons
stuck in those sectors cannot improve their status through
better education or on—the—job training.

    Judging the empirical validity of the dual market theory is
difficult because neither proponents nor critics have carefully
specified the alternative hypothesis against which the theory



                                127
should be run. Obviously, to some extent earnings and produc-
tivity differ by job as well as by personal competence. And
mobility across sectors is not instantaneous and perfect. The
question is, how much di.'ergence from a perfect competitive
market is needed to establish the dual market hypothesis? Al-
ternatively, how much mobility and determination of wages on
human capital criteria are needed to reject it? In the cri-
tiques and debates about the dual market theory (Cain, 1976;
Wachter, 1974; Ryan, 1981), no one has specified the proper
empirical magnitudes that could resolve the issue.

    Instead of trying to determine the validity of the theory,
let us try to evaluate what has been learned about the three
points. Can we take disadvantaged workers and readily improve
their earnings capacity, getting them in better jobs?

     A human capital adherent might answer "yes,11 but only
 through skill augmentation. A dual market adherent might an-
 swer "yes," but possibly through other methods as well, such as
 the Supported Work Experiment (Manpower Demonstration Research
Corporation, 1980—81) or provision of better labor market in-
 formation. The question cannot be answered with cross—section
regression analysis comparing the earnings of persons with the
same measured attributes in different sectors, because such
comparisons involve different persons, one of whom may have
superior unobserved attributes. Longitudinal studies of earn-
ings provide some evidence but are subject to alternative in-
terpretations, also because of questions about the unmeasured
characteristics of persons who shift sectors. Although more
can probably be done with longitudinal data, perhaps the best
evidence comes from manpower training efforts to improve the
earnings power of the poor and from recent Supported Work
Experiments. Some studies suggest that some training programs
have been successful in improving earnings power (see
Ashenfelter, 1978; Perry, Rowari, Anderson, and Northrup, 1975),
but no one claims this to be the case overall, and no study has
resolved the question of whether even successful programs do
more than give some of the disadvantaged a "leg up" on others
(see Johnson [1978J for discussion). As for the Supported
Work, the experiment with women receiving Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC) was judged by the Manpower Demonstra-
tion Research Corporation as a success, but experiments with
ex—addicts and ex--offenders were not judged successful in their
impact on the labor market. The question of how much resources
and effort are needed to move the disadvantaged to better jobs
is uneso1ved.

    Does the wage determination process reward personal
attributes, education, and age less in the secondary sector
than in the primary sector? Although subject to criticism, the
empirical results here appear to be fairly strong: Wage


                              128
equations for low—skill occupations and industries generally
yield much smaller coefficients for years of schooling and age
than do identical equations for high-skill groups or workers as
a whole (see Buchele, 1976; Osterman, 1975; Wachtel and Betsey,
 1972; Harrison, 1972). Although this result has been criti-
cized by Cain (1976) as possibly due to truncation bias (the
fact that educated workers employed in bad jobs are likely to
have negative unobserved characteristics), no one has demon-
strated that the bias explains the results. Because truncation
should reduce the slope of the earnings equation in both low—
arid high—skill (secondary and primary) sectors, whereas returns
are lower in the former only, it is doubtful that truncation is
the main force explaining the results. At present, our best
conclusion is that the wage determination process differs
between markets in which few workers are low paid and those in

                                 .. ,-i-
    Is mobility limited between the secondary and primary
sectors? Most dual market studies find substantial movement
across industry and occupation lines (see Ryan [1981J for a
summary of studies), but in the absence of a measuring rod as
to how much is needed for a reasonably well-functioning market
and how little is needed to judge markets as segmented, a firm
conclusion is not possible. The dual labor studies of mobility
do, however, indicate that having a "dead end" job in the
secondary sector, while obvidusly undesirable, is far from
being a permanent barrier to economic advancement.
    In short, the dual market claim regarding wage determi-
nation processes appears to be valid, but its other assertions
have yet to be shown empirically correct. And subtle claims
regarding the impact of bad secondary sector jobs on individ-
uals' work behavior have also not received sufficient empirical
support to be judged correct.
Interpreting Stable Permanent Earnings Distribution

    The most depressing piece of evidence regarding the problem
of workers at the bottom of the earnings distribution is that,
notwithstanding diverse training efforts to aid the disadvan-
taged, the distribution of earnings appears to be relatively
unchanged in recent years. As table 8 shows, the ratio of the
earnings of male workers of the lowest decile to the median
earnings of male workers (unadjusted for age and numerous other
factors) has not declined in the past decade. Coupled with
sluggish real economic growth in the 1970's, the stable
earnings distribution has meant little improvement in both the
real and relative positions of workers in trouble in the
market, as indicated by the number of persons in poverty in
official government counts.

    The conjunction of a permanent distribution of earnings
among individuals and a stable distribution of earnings over
time does not augur well for low—earning workers. It suggests
that the only reliable solution to the problem of troubled
workers is a resurgence of productivity growth and accompanying
real earnings growth. This does not mean that efforts to im-
prove the positions of particular groups or of individuals may
not have value, nor that poverty cannot be ameliorated with
transfer programs; however, it does cast a pall over efforts to
raise the labor market earnings of the disadvantaged in the
absence of real growth.
     3.   Specific Groups Having Trouble in the Labor Market
    The analyses of the PSID data in this and other studies and
of other data sets, together with a variety of case investi-
gations and related experiments, have identified certain groups
of workers as overrepresented among workers having trouble in
the job market. This section reviews some evidence of the eco-
nomic problems facing specified groups. No effort is made to
provide a complete literature summary for all groups with job
problems. Some groups——including rural and migrant workers,
workers who are injured or otherwise handicapped, and
self—employed workers——are not discussed here.
                   Female Heads of Households

    One of the most striking socioeconomic developments in the
Urited States in recent years has been the substantial growth
in the number of families headed by women. In 1970, women were
heads of households in 11 percent of all families; in 1978,
women headed 14 percent of all families. Among blacks, for
whom the rise in women—headed homes to 23 percent in 1964 moti-
vated the controversial "Moynihan Report," (U.S. Department of
Labor, 1965) the proportion of homes headed by women reached 40
percent in 1979. The increase in both groups is fueled by
rising divorce rates and a large proportion of never—married
women in their twenties.
    Table 9, which summarizes some of the data on women—headed
homes, shows the dimensions of the economic problem for these
women. First, lines I and 2 in table 9 show that homes headed
by women had incomes far below those of homes headed by men.
As a result, the percentage of female—headed homes with incomes
below the poverty level was six times the percentage of male—
headed homes in poverty. Despite the predominance of male—
headed homes, female—headed families constituted slightly more
than half of poverty—level families in 1978.




                                132
    Second, and of particular relevance to the job market, is
that although a large proportion of women household heads were
out of the labor force and dependent on welfare, a growing pro-
portion of those with children are in the work force (66 per-
cent of mothers in 1979 compared with 59 percent in 1970) and
dependent on labor market earnings for their family incomes.
In total, 68 percent of income in female—headed homes was at-
tributed to labor market earnings; among those in poverty, how-
ever, the figure was 32 percent. Both black and white female—
headed homes are similar in this respect.

    Third, an extraordinarily large proportion of American
children are brought up in homes headed by women and thus in
relatively low—income homes. In 1978, 18 percent of all
children and 48 percent of black children were in families
maintained by women. Moreover, a disproportionate number of
those children were in families where the mother neither earned
an adequate income nor obtained it elsewhere.

    In addition, the income of female—headed homes relative to
male—headed homes has not risen over time. Indeed, the income
of female—headed homes was higher relative to that of male—
headed homes in 1969 than in 1978 (U.s. Bureau of the Census,
1980). This, of course, reflects the fact that there has been
little, if any, rise in the female—male wage ratio in recent
decades.

    Longitudinal studies of the economic position of women when
their families break up show the extent of the decline of in-
come. In the National Longitudinal Survey of Women, Mott
(1979) found that the breakup of the husband—wife family re-
duced family incomes in the female—headed homes by about 50
percent. In the PSID data, the comparable figure is about 53
percent (Duncan and Morgan, 1981, estimated from table 1.5)
whereas "female heads who married enjoyed family income in-
creases averaging $16,000" (Duncan and Morgan, 1981, p. 18).
What is less clear is whether these figures represent a rela-
tively permanent or transitory problem. Current Population
Survey data on remarriage of divorced women shcw that the major-
ity remarry within a few years. Women divorcing before age 30
(of whom at least three—fourths remarry) do so within 3 years,
on the average. This fact suggests that the problem of women
who head households may be more properly categorized as in a
depressed economic state, not as permanently disadvantaged.
PSID data, however, show that 80 percent of women—headed homes
in 1972 remained so 6 years later, suggesting a more permanent
economic problem (Duncan and Morgan, 1981, table 1.5). In any
case, the economic difficulties that women face in the labor
market create extreme economic problems for families that
depend permanently on women.

    In examining the gap in wages between men and women,
several studies have separated the reasons for the gap into two
groups: Those due to sex differences in control variables and
in work patterns, which may be linked to productivity; and
those due to differences based on sex alone, which may be due
to discrimination. The most interesting factor studied is the
intermittent work experience of women (Mincer and Polachek,
1974). According to the intermittent work hypothesis, some of
the male—female differential is due to the failure of female
workers to invest in work skills to the same extent as men do
and to their withdrawal from the labor market for childbearing
and childrearing during a critical part of the lifecycle. As
initially formulated by Mincer and Polachek, the intermittent
work hypothesis appeared to explain a substantial proportion of
male—female wage gaps in the NLS survey. Later studies probed
the finding further. Sandell and Shapiro (1977) pointed out an
error in the Mincer—Polachek statistics, and obtained much
weaker results. Corcoran (1978) examined the hypothesis in the
PSID data set and also obtained a smaller estimate of the con-
tribution of interrupted work patterns to the female—male gap
than did Mincer and Polachek (1974), finding stronger effects
of withdrawal for the age group they studied (.30 to 44) than
for any other age group.
    Regarding the potential role of discrimination in the
male—female earnings gap, perhaps the most important empirical
finding has been the significance of occupational segmentation
in differentials. Every study in the area has revealed major
differences, controlling for other factors, in the jobs held by
men and women. In one of the earliest studies, Fuchs (1971)
noted "how few occupations employ large numbers from both
sexes," a result on which all other analysts concur. Blau
(1979) found even more surprising evidence of segregation in
the workplace. Within the same specific occupation in the same
local labor market, men and women tended to congregate in dif-
ferent firms, with the men in the high—wage firms and women in
the low—wage firms.
    There is some question about the extent to which occu-
pational differences account for the observed earnings dif-
ferentials. In one early study, Sanborn (1964) obtained re—
suits suggesting that the bulk of male—female differences is
purely occupational. Most recent studies, however, have ob-
tained weaker results in this respect, although their level of
occupational detail is less fine. Chiswick et al. (1974), for
instance, attributed only 28 percent of the male—female wage
gap to occupational factors. Whatever its precise role in ac—
counting for wage differences, however, occupational segre-
gation undoubtedly is a key aspect of male—female economic dif-
ferences.

                           Minority Workers: Blacks
    Despite the widely heralded economic progress of black
Americans in the post—1964 era, blacks continue to constitute a
disproportionate number of the disadvantaged workers. Indeed,
as analysts have looked more carefully at the dimensions of the
economic progress of blacks, most have noted that despite
overall gains in the 1970's, the economic positions of many
disadvantaged black workers has, if anything, grown worse in
recent decades. In a recent article, Kilson (1981) said, "Out
of these transformations is evolving a distinctly new kind of
social stratification among Afro—Americans, one of haves and
have—nots" (p. 63).
    Table 10 shows the type of evidence that leads most
analysts to conclude that (1) blacks have made substantial
  in.   . .. e .1   QA 1S •l-,. t-S-

community faces a significant and worsening economic problem.
    The earnings and occupation data in table 10, lines 1
through 5, reveal large gains relative to whites, with no indi-
cation of retrogression in the sluggish 1970's economy. The
-decline in the white earnings advantage has been confirmed in
numerous studies using diverse data sets: For example, the
1960 and 1970 Census of Population (Smith and Welch, 1977), the
1962 and 1973 Occupational Change in a Generation (OCG) Survey
(Hauser and Featherman, 1977), the National Longitudinal Survey
(Daymont, 1980), and the PSID (Duncan and Hoffman, 1981).
    Whether the economic gains of blacks are permanent or
whether they are transitory, dissipating as persons age, has
been raised by Lazear (1977). On the face of it, the data in
table 10 appear to reject his argument because the ratios rise
even in a no—growth economy; however, the correct test of
Lazear's proposition is to examine longitudinal experiences.
Several recent studies have done this, and as the list of
studies in table 11 shows, all the analysts rejected Lazear's
conclusion. The data do not indicate a decline in black-white
earnings ratios as cohorts age except for the very youngest
cohort, for whom ratios may have been artificially close due to
minimum wage legislation. The decline among the youngest
group, moreover, still leaves the ratio far clcser to unity
than was true of earlier cohorts, and it is smaller than de-
clines found in earlier decades (Freeman, 1981).
    With respect to the locus of black gains, most analysts
agree that the largest economic advances have been achieved by
black women (who have attained virtual economic parity with
white women in earnings) and more educated and skilled blacks.

Studies of the economic return to investments in school have
found a sharp trend in favor of more educated blacks, a finding
that contrasts with the trend against highly educated whites.
Studies of the extent to which black families transmit their
economic status to their children in the NLS, PSID, and OCG
data sets show an increase in the impact of family background
factors on the position of blacks, in sharp contrast to
Duncan's (1968) initial result that black family background did
not affect children's success prior to 1964. Finally, evidence
of extensive upgrading in the occupational attainment of blacks
provides further sport for the proposition that blacks have
made notable gains in managerial, professional, and skilled
craft jobs.
    An important dimension of these gains—-the extent to which
the new or growing black middle class is employed by govern-
ment——has, however, not received adequate attention. With re-
spect to professionals, 57 percent of black men college grad-
uates in 1970 were employed by government, compared with 27
percent of white men college graduates; 72 percent of black
women graduates and 56 percent of white women graduates were
also employed by government (Freeman, 1976, table 54, p. 152).
In a recent analysis, Brown and Erie (1981, table 1) estimated
that 55 percent of the growth of nonagricultural employment for
blacks from 1960 to 1976 was in the public sector, compared
with 26 percent of that for whites, and that the rate of growth
of blacks in professional and managerial positions was concen-
trated in the public sector in social welfare work. Although
these figures may simply represent the normal pattern in which
a rising group finds an exceptional proportion of employment in
a growing sector, the danger is that the black middle class has
become tied to a sector likely to contract in the future.
    With respect to blue—collar jobs, perhaps the most positive
fact about the current condition of black workers is that they
are disproportionately represented in unions and hold a large
number of stable high—wage blue—collar jobs.
    What about Kilson's (1981) "have nots"? The first dis-
couraging aspect is the sharp drop in labor participation rates
and employment rates among older as well as younger black men.
In 1969, 73 percent of black men age 16 and over were employed,
compared with 78 percent of white men. In 1979, the figures
dropped to 64 percent and 75 percent, respectively. A large
portion of this decline occurred in the form of labor force
withdrawals rather than unemployment. Although an increasing
proportion of employed black men hold better jobs, an in-
creasing proportion are also apparently out of the mainstream
economy.

    The second discouraging aspect is the continued decline in
the proportion of husband—wife families among blacks noted
earlier. The impact of family composition on poverty can be
seen in the fact that whereas the proportion of black families
below the poverty level headed by men fell from 41 percent in
1969 to 25 percent in 1978, the overall proportion of blacks in
poverty did not noticeably change in the period due to the
rising number of families headed by black women.

    Finally, the distribution of earnings among blacks may have
worsened somewhat in the 1970's. Kilson (1981) pointed out a
decline in the share of the lowest two—fifths of blacks in the
black income distribution from 1969 to 1977 contrasted with a
rise in the share of the t.pper two—fifths, upper one-fifth, or
top 5 percent. This change exceeds directionally similar
changes among whites. Over the same period, a rising fraction
of black men in CPS surveys reported no labor market earnings
(Kilson, 1981, table 8).

    All told, the evidence suggests that although equal employ-
ment opportunity (EEO) and related antibias activities improved
the position of some blacks in the period (see Brown [198JJ for
an assessment of the causes of change), a radically different
approach is evidently needed to improve the position of the
"have—nots."

                  Minority Workers: Hispanics
    Hispanic workers appear to face economic problems that are
different from those of black Americans. Differences in pre—
market resources rather than unexplained "residual" discrimi-
nation appear to be the prime cause of economic disadvantage
among this group. Table 12 shows that the earnings of Hispanic
workers have been below those of whites but above those of
blacks, and rose more rapidly than the earnings of either
blacks or whites in the 1970's. In contrast to blacks, the
labor participation of Hispanic men exceeds that of whites,
whereas the percentage of families headed by women has changed
only slightly.
    A principal problem for Hispanic workers appears to be low
levels of schooling. Although research results are not uni-
form, some studies explain virtually all white—Hispanic
earnings differentials in terms of education and related dif-
ferences in background. Briggs, Fogel, and Schmidt (1977) re—
ported tabulations showing income ratios of Mexican—American
men relative to all males within education groips that exceed
unity for workers with 8 or fewer years of education, that are
in the 0.93 to 0.94 ratio for workers with a high school edu-
cation, and that are below unity only for those with college

and cite findings that indicate that controlling for schooling,
training, and age, Hispanics obtain earnings 14 percent above
those predicted for the average worker. Reimers' (1980 a, b)
analysis attributes nearly all of the white—Hispanic differ-
ences to background factors, although she finds different
results for different Hispanic groups. The income data from
the 1979 March Current Population in table 13, line 4, support
the thrust of these results for family incomes, showing that
nearly all of the white—Hispanic family income gap is attribu-
table to education attainment. Earnings data for individuals
(line 5), however, yield the more moderate conclusion that
about 40 percent of the gap is due to education. Although
there are differences among studies and data in the proportion
of the white—Hispanic income gap attributed to schooling, the
evidence to date suggests that limited schooling is a serious
problem. Language difficulties, which have been thought to be
a major independent deterrent to economic success, were found
by Reimers to have only a modest impact on earnings.

    With respect to the education problem, the low percentage
of Hispanics of voting age registered to vote (44.4 percent
compared with 73.4 percent for Anglos) reported by Briggs,
Fogel, and Schmidt (1977, p. 25) may make schools less respon-
sive to their needs. The relatively flat education-earnings
profile for Hispanic men implicit in the Briggs et al. (1977)
and other studies may further provide less incentive for His-
panic young persons to invest in schooling.
                     Industrial Dislocation
    In a dynamic economy, demand for labor in some sectors
grows while in others it declines over time. The reasons for
growth and decline vary; they may include technological change,
shifts in consumer preferences, foreign competition, and
domestic competition. Concern is often expressed for workers
who lose their jobs as a result of declines in their indus-
tries. In the 1960's, there was general concern for declines
in labor demand due to technological change; in the 1970's, the
focus has been on declines due to foreign competition.
    To what extent are adjustments in the work force attribu-
table to changes in trade patterns, technological change, or
other factors costly to specific groups of workers? Are these
losses permanent or transitory? Viewed broadly, the cost of
declines in demand depends on the nature of the adjustment in
employment, the length of time it takes workers to find new
jobs, and the possible reductions in their earnings.

    Consider two possible worlds: One in which workers are
permanently attached to enterprises and in which economic re-
wards are strongly dependent on years of tenure with an employ-
er; arid one in which voluntary attrition rates are high or in
which economic rewards are only modestly linked to tenure. In
the former world, changes in demand due to outside shocks are
likely to be highly costly, with workers suffering significant
capital losses. In the latter world, one would expect only
moderate economic losses, for job changes are a normal and not
especially costly part of life. As has been noted by research
analysts, turnover rates are high in the United States (see
Salant, 1978; Brechling, 1978), so that industries can adjust
employment largely through attrition; however, some firms do,
of course, go out of business and other permanently lay off
workers as a result of normal economic change.

    Industries experiencing significant technological change
are less likely to experience declines in employment than those
facing serious foreign or domestic competition. This is be-
cause technological advance lowers unit labor costs, and thus
the price of output, thereby stimulating demand. Industry
productivity growth rates are not negatively correlated with
employment growth (see Salter, 1960; Kendrick, 1961), although
one study found negative correlations at the plant level in the
1950's (National Commission on Technology, Automation, and
Economic Progress, 1966). Industries subject to competition
from other sectors or parts of the world are more likely to
undergo serious employment losses and perhaps more significant
and permanent economic distress as well.
    Recent research on displaced workers has examined what
happens to workers displaced for particular reasons, notably
growth of foreign imports (as defined by the Trade Assistance
Act [TAAJ), or to workers on Unemployment Insurance (UI) rather
than on the general topic of industries with declining demand.
Jacobson's (1978) work, to be discussed shortly, is the major
exception because it tries to differentiate between workers in
declining and nondeclining sectors in general.
    Table 13 summarizes some of the major studies. In general,
the evidence suggests that although most workers displaced as a
result of competition recover their initial jobs and earnings
positions, a large proportion suffer major economic losses as a
result of displacement; their wages and hours of work fall, and
there is an extended period of time before reemployment.

    The Corson et al. (1979) and Neumann (1978) studies, which
compared the TAA and UI recipients, found that the TAA sample
contained older workers with considerable job tenure who were
more likely to be union members and to be less educated than



                             148
typical UI recipients. These characteristics support the view
that layoffs due to import competition affect a group of work-
ers that is different from the normal UI recipient population.
It is not clear, however, whether these differences stem from
the characteristics of the labor force in the trade—affected
industries. In that case, the observed differences between the
TAA and UI groups would change with changes in the industries
affected by trade. Trade—affected layoffs, however, may cut
deeper into an industry's labor force, releasing more senior or
productive people than would a normal cyclical layoff. Then
the differences would be relatively stable over time. Neither
study attempted to distinguish between the two possible causes
for sample group differences.
    Both studies indicated that a small group of trdde—
displaced workers were hurt by their layoffs but that the
majority did not suffer serious losses. As shown in table 14,
from 66 percent to 75 percent of TAA recipients returned to
their own jobs with larger wages than they had originally.
Those who did not return to the same jobs, however, suffered
substantial losses, with the TAA group experiencing larger
percentage declines in earnings than did the UI group.
    The other studies in table 14 also revealed large losses to
workers who suffered job losses, with older workers and female
workers apparently the most severely affected. In the Burgess
and Kingston (1978) study, a sizable proportion of women and
older workers withdrew from the labor force, exhausted their UI
benefits, and had large percentage reductions in hourly wages
and in time worked. Bale and Mutti (1978) estimated a large
capital loss for workers displaced from the shoe industry.
Jacobson's (1978) analysis of displaced workers in general
found sizable losses in earnings for persons who lost their
jobs in years of declining employment compared with persons who
held their jobs. Jacobson obtained less clear results when he
compared earnings loss of job losers in areas with declining
employment with the earnings loss of job losers in areas with
rising employment, because even in areas of rising employment,
job losers suffered large income losses in his sample. The
losses were greater for industries with low normal attrition
rates and higher in industries with a high proportion of
prime—age male workers. The most recent study, by the U.S.
Government Accounting Office (GAO, 1980), yields results con-
sistent with the others. In the GAO survey of 242,000 workers,
two—thirds of those initially displaced had returned to work
for their same employer at the time of the interview, and an
additional 4 percent expected to be recalled. As a result of
this pattern, most workers indicated that they had not ex-
perienced severe economic hardships as a result of their lay—

offs. Most were able to rely on unemployment insurance bene—
fits and other resources to meet their financial needs. Of the
minority who did not return to the same employer, 10 percent
found jobs elsewhere, 6 percent retired, and 5 percent were
looking for work. It is among the last group that serious eco-
nomic problems are likely.
    Finally, the Corson, Nicholson, and Skidmore (1976) study
of the experiences of Unemployment Insurance recipients the
first year after exhausting their benefits provides additional
support for the conciusion that some of the displaced suffer
real earnings losses. In their sample, only 5 percent of
1,721 exhaustees found jobs 1 year after initial exhaustion of
benefits, and they had a decline in real earnings of close to
30 percent (Corson et al., 1976, p. 18, obtained by adding de—
creases in earnings and increases in consumer prices).
    In sum, the evidence supports the claim that although most
workers who suffer initial job losses recover their positions,
certain workers experience a substantial drop in the earnings
distribution. Because our earlier results concerning persons
who fall in the distribution suggest that sizable drops are
partially permanent, there appears to be a hard core of persons
who (for whatever reason) bear the brunt of economic distress.

                         Older Workers

    It may seem odd to argue that older workers are a troubled
group in the labor market. Cross—section age—earnings profiles
peak at ages 45 to 54; vacation time, promotions, and layoffs
usually depend on seniority; and older persons experience rela-
tively low unemployment rates. Indeed, older workers in
general are not a disadvantaged group. Nevertheless, a small
number of workers over age 45 are in trouble for one important
reason: loss of job. Institutional arrangements relating to
seniority (not age) and firm—specific human capital make the
loss of a job by older workers especially onerous. First, the
loss often involves leaving a position with relatively high
wages. Second, companies that offer defined benefit pension
plans and related fringe benefits find that the cost of hiring
older workers exceeds the cost of hiring younger workers by a
greater amount than the wage differential. As a result, older
workers are alleged to face serious adjustment difficulties:
Longer unemployment than younger workers, lower wages on subse-
quent jobs, and lack of steady employment after layoffs. As a
result, some older male workers drop out of the work force
earlier than planned. In addition to problems caused by lay-
offs, older workers suffer from potential health problems,
which also affect earnings and labor participation.




                              151
    What is the evidence for these claims? With respect to
unemployment, the rates published by the Bureau of J-abor
Statistics show clearly that older workers have longer incom-
plete spells than do younger workers. Virtually all the
studies of industrial dislocations cited in table 15 found that
older displaced workers have more problems obtaining work than
do younger workers. Exceptions may exist, but the results of
the studies seem unequivocal.

    The evidence also seems to support the assertion that older
job losers suffer more substantial declines in wages and time
worked than do younger workers. The Bartel and Borjas (1977a,
b; 1978) studies, which dealt specifically with this issue in
the context of a specific human capital model, showed that lay-
offs of older men had a large, negative effect on the wages of
men who had accumulated 3 or more years of tenure; also, the
authors found that layoffs caused relatively larger wage losses
and flatter wage profiles in the future for older than for
younger workers. Parnes and King (1977) also showed much lower
earnings and declines in occupational status for displaced
older workers, although they stressed the variability of the
outcomes. Finally, Mick's (1975) review of case studies on
displaced workers concluded that those who lost the most from
layoffs were older, less skilled, blue—collar workers.

    Overall, the evidence seems to support the assertion that
older job losers are a troubled group in the work force, at
least in terms of the substantial drops in their position in
the earnings distribution.

    What factors explain the problem of older workers in the
market? Several possible causes of labor market difficulties
are discussed in the literature. First is the hypothesis that
older workers show declines in productivity. Although the
Employment and Training Report of the President, 1978 (U.s.
Department of Labor, 1979) correctly cites extant productivity
literature as contradicting this allegation (productivity
levels off early in the work life and remains level with age),
the possibility exists that firms displace those older workers
whose productivity falls. Although I do not regard this as
likely, it deserves some attention. A second reason, stressed
by Barnow and Ehrenberg (1979), appears more reasonable: Be—
cause of defined benefit pension plans (and other fringe costs
likely to rise with age), older workers are more expensive than
younger workers at the same wage. To date, however, the irnpor—
tance cf this factor has not been empirically estimated. A
third reason relates to the advantages of older senior workers
cited at the beginning of this section. Recent evidence
(Medoff and Abraham, 1981) showing that a significant propor—
tiori of higher wages go to older workers because of seniority

wage policies, not productivity, suggests that loss of
seniority due to job loss would force the wages of older
workers to drop significantly. The Bartel and Borjas (1977a,
b; 1978) evidence on declines in wages for laid—off older men
with 3 or more years of seniority is consistent with this
claim. Finally, the concentration of older workers in older,
often declining, industries may also contribute to their
difficulties.
    The fact that some older men face serious labor market
problems despite the high average earnings of the group is
consistent with the distribution of earnings by age, because
not only does the level of earnings rise with age, the level of
dispersion also rises with age. Relatively more older men than
younger men have earnings below (and above) the group average,
thereby generating a definite tail of troubled workers, as
shown in table 7.

    Poor health, as reported by survey respondents, associated
with economic problems has been reported in numerous studies
(Luft, 1975; Fuchs, 1975; Parnes et al., 1970). The lower par-
ticipation of older black men than of older white men has been
attributed to the greater health problems of the former (Parnes
et al., 1970). The decline in the participation of older black
men has been attributed to poor health combined with in-
creasingly more generous Social Security disability insurance
(Parsons, 1980; Leonard, 1979). One possible problem with this
interpretation relates to the self-reporting of health status:
Perhaps men who wish to work fewer hours, to take easier jobs,
or to withdraw from the labor force find it more socially ac-
ceptable to cite poor health as the reason. For older men at
least, the evidence rejects this possibility. Andrisani (1977,
table 1) found that older men reporting that their health
affected their work had markedly higher mortality in ensuing
years than did those who reported that health did not affect
their work. In addition, a large fraction o.2 older men who
retire or leave the labor force do not cite health as a cause:
It has become more acceptable to retire or r.tire early for
personal non—health—related reasons. Hence, the studies that
show that self—reported health problems are a major cause of
labor market problems of older workers are likely to be true.
    In sum, although a majority of workers over age 45 are
relatively successful in the labor market, a hard core of job
losers and workers with health limitations face serious eco-
nomic troubles.

                 Workers in Depressed Communities

    The problem of depressed areas has drawn serious concern
for many years; this concern was most dramatically exemplified
by President Kennedy's attention to Appalachia in the 1960's.
    Recent economic analysis of the depressed area problem has
focused on two questions: Whether unemployment in an area is
permanent or transitory, and whether unemployment is compen—
sated for by higher wages.
     Studies of the relationship between area unemployment rates
 over time provide a clear answer to the question of persis-
 tence. They show unequivocally that unemployment across areas
 is a structural, relatively permanent problem rather than a
 transitory phenomenon. In a series of calculations, Marston
 (1980a, b) ha documented this point effectively. In an
analysis of variance of area unemployment comparable to decom-
position of individual earnings described earlier, he found
that 58 percent of the variance in rates across 30 SMSA's was
due to area effect and another 30 percent was due to year ef-
fect, leaving only a modest 12 percent due to transitory
factors. Using Census of Population data for 1950, 1960, and
1970, he not only obtained a higher estimate for the area ef-
fect (two—thirds of the variance was attributed to areas), but
also a higher residual effect (28 percent). Browne's (1978)
analysis of unemployment by census region divisions also re-
vealed distinct patterns, with average unemployment higher in
the West and lower in the North Central and South than in other
regions throughout the 1960—76 period. As a check on these
findings, I computed correlations between unemployment rates in
more than 100 SMSA's using the crude data published in the
Employment and Trainin9 Reports of the Presid2nt, for the
period 1963-79. Figure 2, which summarizes this analysis,
shows initially high correlations exceeding 0.9 that fall and
then stabilize at about 0.7, with no indication of further
drops. Areas that had high unemployment in 1963 had a strong
tendency to have high unemployment more than a decade later.
    The hypothesis that area unemployment rates are at least
partly compensated for by area wages was first. suggested by
Hall (1976). He showed that there was a positive correlation
between the two variables in 12 cities. Since then, several
studies have examined the relation in greater detail. As table
16 suggests, Hall's initial conjecture appears to be valid:
High rates of unemployment are associated with high wages.
Reza (1978) extended Hall's work to 18 cities for the period
1967—74 and found a large positive correlation, but he failed
to allow for any other variables that might have affected the
relation. Browne (1978) examined regional employment rates for
the period 1960—75, including numerous demand—side variables,

and obtained a significant negative relation between regional
wages and employment rates, which implies a significant posi-
tive relation between wages and unemployment. In the most
definitive work, Marston (1980a, b) used the 1970 Public Use
Sample to analyze the unemployment of more than a half—million
people in 125 metropolitan areas. With numerous other controls
in his calculations, he found the real area wage rate to be
significantly permanently correlated with the chances of an in-
dividual being unemployed. As seen in studies of developing
countries, however, the extent to which wages and unemployment
are related far exceeds that predicted by the usual expected
income model, which suggests the need for a more complex
analysis.
    The fact that unemployment and wages are positively related
by geographic area does not, of course, mean that unemoloyment
and wage differences across regions are at equilibrium levels.
To investigate this issue, it is necessary to examine how mi-
gration behavior responds to the difference. The results of
the literature on determinants of migration yield the striking
finding that local unemployment rates do not explain migration,
whereas income and wage differences do (Greenwood, 1975, p.
411). This finding implies that greater attention should be
given to regional income differences than to regional unemploy-
ment differences in defining depressed areas.

    Overall, the finding that wages and unemployment rates are
positively related does not mean that no high unemployment
areas suffer serious economic problems; inner—city slums cer-
tainly are troubled. The literature findings do suggest, how-
ever, that areas that deviate adversely from the normal un-
employment-wage relation (that is, that have both low wages and
high unemployment) should be the focus of concern, rather than
high unemployment areas.
                         4. Conclusion
    This paper has reviewed some of the literature on groups of
workers having trouble in the economy and analyzed the Michigan
PSID to provide ac1itional information relating to those
groups. It has shown the existence of a relativ2ly permanent
hardcore group of troubled workers with distinctive charac-
teristics. This study also found that workers in trouble are
better distinguished by personal, unobserved characteristics
than by any set of observables. This fact points to the need
to define and aid workers in trouble on the basis of market
outcomes, not on the basis of particular "causes" of problems.
The permanence of the earnings distribution among persons, com-
bined with the stability of the distribution o'.'er time, sug-
gests that real economic growth is the key to aiding troubled
workers, although special programs and efforts may help parti-
cular groups.


                               159
    The most interesting aspect of the literature on troubled
workers is the wide diversity of perspectives and forms of evi—
dence examined. The most disappointing aspects are the incon-
clusive nature of the dual labor market/neoclassical debates
and the failure to combine the diverse evidence and ideas into
a unified perspective on the individual and institutional
causes of troubled workers. This failure, of course, offers an -
opportunity for future research.
