                                          ABSTRACT

This paper evaluates the U.S. Census Bureau’s most recent data collection efforts to classify
business entities that engage in an extreme form of production fragmentation called “factoryless”
goods production. “Factoryless” goods-producing entities outsource physical transformation
activities while retaining ownership of the intellectual property and control of sales to customers.
Responses to a special inquiry on the incidence of purchases of contract manufacturing services
in combination with data on production inputs and outputs, intellectual property, and international
trade is used to identify and document characteristics of “factoryless” firms in the U.S. economy.

1. Introduction

            Goods production is increasingly vertically disintegrated (Johnson and Noguera, 2012). An

extreme form of fragmentation of the goods production process entails outsourcing the processing

and manufacturing activities while retaining ownership of the intellectual property and controlling

sales to customers, giving rise to the so-called “factoryless” goods producers (FGPs). Firms may

choose to outsource the physical transformation process both within and across firm as well as

national borders. Firm organization decisions that give rise to complex, global production chains have

been linked to the simultaneous ascent of China as the world’s factory and the decline in U.S.

manufacturing (Feenstra and Wei, 2010; Autor, Dorn, and Hanson, 2013; Pierce and Schott, 2016).

The fragmented nature of economic activity has reshaped the global production landscape and

subsequently poses challenges for producing meaningful national statistics.

            The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandated U.S. statistical agencies to classify

FGPs within the existing data collection system to better reflect the changes in modern production

arrangements. 2 The Census Bureau’s efforts to isolate goods producers that do not perform physical

transformation of goods led to data collection, through a special inquiry, on the purchase of contract

manufacturing services (CMS). Purchase of CMS indicates if an establishment outsources part or all

of its production transformation activities to another establishment either under common ownership

or at arm’s length, within or outside the United States. However, post-collection interviews with

responding establishments revealed inconsistencies in how respondents understood the CMS

purchase question as intended (Murphy, 2015). OMB concluded that the special inquiry failed “to

yield responses that provide accurate and reliable identification and classification of FGPs” at the

establishment level and resulted in the latest recommendation to further evaluate “the feasibility of

                                                               2
developing methods for the consistent identification and classification of Factoryless Goods

Producers that are accurate and reliable” (80 FR 46479-46484). 3

         This paper explores the feasibility of identifying FGP firms. Recognizing that establishment

responses to purchase of CMS alone may yield unreliable classification of FGPs, this paper augments

establishment responses (in the 2012 Economic Census) with firm responses to purchase of CMS (in

the 2012 Company Organization Survey) and information on firms’ manufacturing activities

(measured as employment in the manufacturing sector). 4 Although OMB’s Economic Classification

Policy Committee (ECPC) recommends measuring FGPs at the establishment level, a number of

characteristics essential to identifying FGPs have historically not been collected at the establishment

level. Research and design activities at the establishment level is collected on a yes/no basis and only

for the wholesale sector, but real measures are available at the firm level in all sectors. Merchandise

imports (more likely associated with FGP firms when production is not only outsourced but also

offshored) are available at the firm level only. Moreover, company headquarters, which possess

comprehensive knowledge of the firm’s operations, may be better suited to respond to the special

inquiry intended to measure FGP activity.

         The focus on identifying “factoryless” activity as a firm level concept is further motivated by

the view of the firm as the central-decision maker that controls and coordinates the key economic

activities of design, production, and sales, with each of its establishments specializing in a given

activity. This view accords well with the empirical reality of within-firm reallocations as well as the

general importance of firms in shaping a range of economic outcomes. Fort, Pierce, and Schott (2018)

document that plant exits at incumbent firms accounted for three-quarters of the total decline in U.S.

manufacturing between 1977 and 2012. A small number of “superstar” firms are responsible for the

growing concentration of employment and output in U.S. industries (Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson,

and Van Reenen, 2017) and even comparative advantage of a country (Freund and Pierola, 2015).

         The classification of FGP firms in the existing data collection system faces two main

challenges. First, goods-producing firms that outsource all production transformation activities are

currently classified outside the manufacturing sector with other services-producing firms. Second,

goods-producing firms that outsource only a part of the production transformation process are

currently classified in the manufacturing sector with all other goods-producing firms. An instructive

comparison of FGPs to other goods-producers requires distinguishing the extent of “factoryless”

production arrangements among manufacturing firms. The special inquiry on purchase of CMS was

sent to both manufacturing and non-manufacturing establishments in an effort to identify all possible

goods-producers in the economy separately from services-producing firms.

         This paper begins by identifying three types of goods-producers distinct from firms that

provide services: FGP firms that outsource all production activities and do not have any domestic

manufacturing activity; Hybrid Manufacturers that outsource some production activities but also own

domestic manufacturing plants; Traditional Manufacturers that do not outsource any production and

perform all production-related activities at own domestic plants; and distinct from goods-producers

are Service Providers that do not undertake any manufacturing activity – neither outsources nor owns

any domestic manufacturing plants. 5




5 I thank John Murphy for suggesting the terminology for the distinct firm types. Traditional Manufactures include both

integrated manufacturers and firms that provide CMS. Hybrid and Traditional Manufacturers represent firms with primary
activity in the manufacturing sector (NAICS 31-33). Service Providers represent firms with primary activities outside the
manufacturing sector.
                                                           4
        The paper then performs two sets of comparisons - FGP firms to Service Providers and

Hybrid Manufacturers to Traditional Manufacturers - of characteristics guided by the conceptual

definition of “factoryless” production. The ECPC’s definition of FGPs states that the FGP

“outsources all transformation steps that traditionally have been considered manufacturing, but

undertakes all of the entrepreneurial steps and arranges for all required capital, labor, and material

inputs required to make a good” (OMB, 2010). The conceptual definition of “factoryless” production

can then be summarized along three main attributes: ownership of intellectual property, ownership

and control of finished products, and outsourcing transformation activities (Doherty, 2015). The

characteristics studied, therefore, include ownership of intellectual property (measured as research and

development expenditures, number of patents, number of trademarks), ownership and sales of

finished goods (measured as revenue), incidence of borderless production arrangements (measured as

imports), incidence of “headquarter” activity encompassing strategic or organizational planning and

decision-making activities (measured as employment in NAICS 54 and 55). These variables capture

features hypothesized to be more prevalent at firms that outsource production. This approach, thus,

combines two distinct strategies for identifying FGP’s - self-identification by companies and their

establishments on statistical surveys and implementation of a profiling method based on conceptual

definitions.

        The comparison of employment mix across sectors, ownership of intellectual property, and

foreign imports between FGPs and Service Providers yields correlations consistent with the

conceptual definition of “factoryless” production. I find that FGP firms tend to have higher shares of

workers engaged in the provision of “headquarter” services, greater ownership of intellectual property,

and higher propensities to import from abroad than Service Providers. FGPs tend to be smaller and

younger than Service Providers. I also find that Hybrid Manufacturers tend to have higher shares of

non-production workers, lower shares of production workers, greater ownership of intellectual
                                                   5
property, and higher propensities to import from abroad than Traditional Manufacturers. Hybrid

Manufacturers tend to be larger than and similarly aged as Traditional Manufacturers.

        The analyses in this paper offer three main insights to guide identification of FGP firms within

existing data collection systems. First, disagreements in responses to purchase of CMS between

respondents in the Economic Census and the Company Organization Survey provide an instructive

set of cases to select for cognitive interviews to help inform the feasibility of identifying FGPs at the

establishment or firm level. Second, combining responses to the special inquiry with firm level

information on ownership of intellectual property, imports, and employment mix across sectors yields

a picture consistent with the conceptual definition of “factoryless” production arrangements.

Comparison of FGPs with Service Providers highlights differences in characteristics between two

distinct entities currently classified outside the manufacturing sector. Comparison of Hybrid

Manufacturers with Traditional Manufacturers highlights differences in characteristics between goods-

producers that outsource some production and those that perform all production and are currently

classified together in the manufacturing sector. The results suggest a profiling method based not only

on responses to special inquiries but one that also harnesses existing sources of data, hence, reducing

respondent burden. Third, the meaningful correlations uncovered in this paper between variables

identified based on conceptual definitions and outsourcing status indicate a possible path towards

developing a model-based approach to identify FGP firms.

        This paper relates closely to a set of studies examining responses to the special inquiry on

purchase of CMS to characterize the extent and nature of FGP activity in the U.S. economy. Kamal,

Moulton, and Ribarsky (2015) evaluate data collection efforts on enterprises’ purchase of CMS by the

Census Bureau on the 2011 Company Organization Survey and the Bureau of Economic Analysis on

the 2009 Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad. The authors find that CMS purchasing

firms tend to be larger and older. Bernard and Fort (2013), using the 2002 and 2007 Census of
                                                   6
Wholesale Trade, find that firms with manufacturing activity that also have a FGP establishment in

the wholesale sector are significantly larger compared to firms with a FGP establishment in the

wholesale sector and wholesale activity only. Bernard and Fort (2015), using the 2007 Census of

Wholesale Trade, document that FGP firms tend to be larger but younger than traditional wholesalers.

Tracing employment back in time, they also document that FGPs include former manufacturing firms,

new firms born as FGPs, and other firms that became FGPs. Bayard, Byrne, and Smith (2015) identify

FGP firms engaged in semiconductor production in the 2007 Economic Census using external

company directories and document that FGP firms are larger than non-FGP firms. Previous studies

characterizing “factoryless” production arrangements have relied on a single source of data, or on data

for a narrowly focused sector, and applied varying definitions of “factoryless” status, making it difficult

to compare and draw inferences for the whole economy. This paper implements a consistent

definition of “factoryless” status across all sectors and draws from multiple data sources to provide a

comprehensive picture of FGP firms as distinct from other goods- and services-producing firms in

the U.S. economy.

        Developing reliable methods to classify FGP firms accurately in U.S. data not only fulfills the

Census Bureau’s mandate to implement OMB’s recommendation but also provides the foundation to

conduct careful analyses of the economic consequences of extreme production fragmentation.

“Factoryless” goods production divorces research and design from physical production. This has

potentially significant implications for occupational structures, innovation, and international trade.

Papers studying the impact of offshoring, an arrangement where goods production is located abroad,

offer partial glimpses on the economic consequences along these dimensions. 6 Offshoring is

associated with higher relative wages and demand for skilled labor in the home country, consistent


6 Fort (2017), using the 2007 Census of Manufactures, documents that domestic outsourcing is more prevalent than
offshoring but offshoring firms are almost twice as large.
                                                       7
with the concentration of design and R&D activities in the home country, while lower skilled

production activities shift abroad (Bernard, Fort, Smeets, and Warzynski, 2017; Hummels, Jørgensen,

Munch, and Xiang, 2014; Mion and Zhu, 2013). Offshoring is also associated with increases in product

development and R&D expenditures (Bernard et al, 2017). Vertical specialization, an outcome under

extreme production fragmentation, changes the composition of international trade as it entails

increases in imported intermediate inputs to produce goods for export (Hummels, Ishii, and Yi, 2001).

       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data sources used to identify

outsourcing of the physical transformation process and firm level inputs, output, ownership of

intellectual property and imports. Section 3 identifies FGP firms currently classified outside the

manufacturing sector and systematically documents the extent and characteristics of these firms in

relation to Service Providers. Section 4 identifies Hybrid Manufacturers, manufacturing firms who

outsource a part of the production process, and systematically documents the extent and

characteristics of these firms in relation to Traditional Manufacturers. The final section concludes

with discussion for future work.

2. Data

       There does not exist a single data source that contains the ideal set of information to identify

FGPs. Therefore, I utilize a host of confidential microdata sourced from the Census Bureau for the

most recent year, 2012, of comprehensive data collection efforts. Responses to the special inquiry

about purchase of CMS in the Economic Census and the Company Organization Survey are used as




                                                  8
a first step towards identifying FGP firms. 7, 8 Establishment responses in the Economic Census are

aggregated at the firm level to enable comparison to responses in the Company Organization Survey.

         The Economic Census, conducted in years ending in 2 and 7, cover the universe of private,

non-farm establishments active in the economy. The annual Company Organization Survey is

designed chiefly to maintain the Business Register. The Business Register is a current list of business

establishments in the U.S. and used as a survey frame to conduct the Economic Census every five

years. The Company Organization Survey covers all multi-unit companies with 250 or more employees

and a selection of smaller companies. Smaller companies are only selected when administrative records

indicate that the company may be undergoing organizational change and is expanding (adding

establishments) or shrinking (dropping establishments).

         The responses to the special inquiry are further combined with additional firm level variables.

Employment by sector, number of establishments under common ownership, and payroll are

aggregated to the firm level using the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). The LBD contains

information on employment, payroll, ownership, sector, and geography of the universe of

establishments operating in the U.S. private, non-farm sector with at least one employee (Jarmin and

Miranda, 2002). Firm age is equivalent to the age of its oldest establishment. The LBD also provides

total revenue for the firm (Haltiwanger, Jarmin, Kulick, and Miranda, 2017). 9

         Firm level imports is sourced from the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database

(LFTTD) that links the universe of individual customs transaction records to the firms that carry out


7 In the context of this study, the Economic Census refers to the Census of Manufactures, Census of Wholesale Trade,
and Census of Services. Establishments in every six-digit industry within manufacturing (NAICS 31-32), wholesale
(NAICS 42), and Professional Scientific, and Technical Services (NAICS 54) and establishments in Corporate, Subsidiary,
and Regional Managing Offices (NAICS 551114) were legally required to respond to the special inquiry on the use of
CMS.
8 The Bureau of Economic Analysis also included a question about CMS on the BE-120 (Benchmark Survey of

Transactions in Selected Services and Intellectual Property with Foreign Persons) and BE-10 (Benchmark Survey of U.S.
Direct Investment Abroad) surveys. These data are not used in this paper.

these transactions (Bernard, Jensen, and Schott, 2009). 10 Information on firm ownership of intellectual

property – patents, trademarks, and R&D expenditures - is obtained from Dinlersoz, Goldschlag,

Myers, and Zolas (forthcoming). The authors combine survey data on research and design

expenditures sourced from the Business R&D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS) with administrative

data sourced from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on number of granted patents and

trademarks. The statistics on R&D expenditures used in this paper only include firms surveyed in the

BRDIS. 11 U.S. multinational firms and U.S. affiliates of foreign multinational firms are identified using

the mandatory surveys - U.S. Direct Investment Abroad (USDIA) and Foreign Direct Investment in

the United States (FDIUS) - conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. 12



2.1 Special Inquiry on Contract Manufacturing Services

         The purchase of CMS identifies whether an establishment or firm outsources the fabrication

of products. Appendix tables A1 and A2 display excerpts of the specific question about purchase of

CMS from the Economic Census and Company Organization Survey, respectively. 13 The Economic

Census and Company Organization Survey ask whether the establishment and firm, respectively,

purchase CMS. The Economic Census also asks for the costs incurred to purchase these services while

the Company Organization Survey asks for the CMS cost as a percent of all expenses. The Company

Organization Survey further asks whether the company purchased these services inside or outside the

U.S. and whether own affiliates abroad provided CMS.




10 LFFTD contains the universe of import transactions valued over $2,000.
11 Patent and trademark data are available for all firms in the LBD but R&D data is only available for firms sampled in the
BRDIS. The BRDIS sample constitutes of firms that are known to have some R&D activity.
12 The Center for Economic Studies, in a joint project with the Bureau of Economic Analysis, has linked the 2012 USDIA

and FDIUS to the Census Bureau’s Business Register. The resulting crosswalks identify multinational firms in the LBD.
13 The Company Organization Survey and the Census of Manufactures also ask about providing CMS. The focus of this

paper is CMS purchasers, not CMS providers.
                                                            10
        A firm purchases CMS if at least one of its establishment in the Economic Census responded

yes or it responded yes in the Company Organization Survey. An establishment in the Economic

Census is identified as purchasing CMS if it answers affirmatively to the question of purchasing CMS

or if it reports a non-zero value for either costs incurred to purchase CMS or sales generated from

products whose purchases were reported as CMS costs. A firm in the Company Organization Survey

purchases CMS if it answers affirmatively to the question of purchasing CMS, or it provides a non-

zero percent of the cost of sales from expenses for CMS, or it answers affirmatively to using a third

party contractor either inside or outside the United States. A firm does not purchase CMS if all its

establishments respond no to purchasing CMS in the Economic Census or it responded no in the

Company Organization Survey.

        The choice to utilize responses in the Economic Census aggregated at the firm level in addition

to firm level responses to the Company Organization Survey ensures the broadest coverage of likely

FGP firms. The unweighted response rates for purchasing CMS is 61.4 percent for the Census of

Wholesale Trade, 57.7 percent for the Census of Manufacture, and 47.9 percent for the Census of

Services (Murphy, 2015). Over 95 percent of firms provided a response (yes or no) to purchasing CMS

in the Company Organization Survey. 14 There is a high degree of disagreement in responses across

the two data sources. Table A3 shows the distribution of firms by their response status

(yes/no/missing) to purchasing CMS in the Economic Census and the Company Organization Survey.

The total number of firms represent the analysis sample of FGP and other goods and services-

producing firms considered in this study. About 40 percent of firms that provided a non-missing

response in both datasets disagreed in their responses. Most of the disagreements are due to firms that




14 The Economic Census and Company Organization Survey data from the special inquiry are not adjusted for non-
response.
                                                     11
respond no to purchasing CMS in the Company Organization Survey but one of their establishments

responded yes to purchasing CMS in the Economic Census. 15

         I apply a broad and restricted definition of CMS purchase status to balance between the goal

to comprehensively identify outsourcing firms in the economy and account for the high incidence of

disagreement in firm responses to purchase of CMS across the two data sources. Under the broad

definition, an outsourcing firm responds yes to purchasing CMS in either data source. 16 Under the

restricted definition, an outsourcing firm responds yes to purchasing CMS in both data sources. Firms

that do not outsource are similarly categorized except the firm responds no to purchasing CMS. Thus,

firms under the restricted definition are necessarily a subset of firms under the broad definition.

Analyses in the paper only includes firms that can be classified as purchasing or not purchasing CMS.

Respondents that did not provide a response and respondents that did not receive the special inquiry

are excluded. An assumption maintained in the discussion of descriptive results in this paper is that

non-respondents are not systematically different from respondents.

         Under the broad definition, the analyses sample contains 16,500 FGPs and 112,000 Service

Providers; and 11,000 Hybrid Manufacturers and 10,000 Traditional Manufacturers. Under the

restricted definition, the analyses sample contains 400 FGP and 1,300 Service Providers; and 750




15 The high incidence of disagreement might be driven by differences in survey questionnaires. The Company Organization
Survey specifies use of “company’s patents, trade secrets, or proprietary technology” in purchase of CMS while the
Economic Census does not (see tables A1 and A2). The 2017 Economic Census asks establishments if it determined “the
design or specifications for any of the products that were manufactured on its behalf”. For example, see
https://bhs.econ.census.gov/ombpdfs/export/MC-32312_mu.pdf (accessed September 30, 2018). An assessment of
responses to the newly designed questions offers a potentially fruitful avenue for evaluating the disagreements.
16 Under the broad definition, a firm purchases CMS if it meets any of the following four criteria (i) responds yes to

purchasing CMS in the Company Organization Survey but one of its establishments responded no in the Economic
Census; (ii) responds no to purchasing CMS in the Company Organization Survey but one of its establishments responded
yes in the Economic Census; (iii) missing response in Company Organization Survey but one of its establishments
responded yes in the Economic Census; or (iv) missing response in Economic Census but responded yes to purchasing
CMS in the Company Organization Survey.

Hybrid Manufacturers and 400 Traditional Manufacturers. 17 The identified firms are not nationally

representative but they provide the opportunity to assess the potential scope and challenges associated

with the task of measuring “factoryless” activities in the existing data collection system.

         For ease of exposition, each section discusses results based on the broad definition unless

statistics differ markedly between the broad and restricted definitions.



3. “Factoryless” activity outside the Manufacturing Sector

         The goal in this section is to identify FGPs among firms that are currently classified outside

manufacturing sector. A FGP is defined as a firm that purchases CMS and does not have any

manufacturing employment. However, this definition does not explicitly capture performance of

design activities, a key FGP characteristic. Nonetheless, in contrast to prior studies, it offers the

advantage of enabling consistent classification of FGP firms in both the wholesale and services

sectors. For example, Bernard and Fort (2015) define a FGP firm as having at least one establishment

in the wholesale sector that performs design/engineering/R&D activity, purchases CMS, and has no

manufacturing establishments. This definition cannot be applied to the services sector where

comparable measures of design/engineering/R&D activities at the establishment level do not exist.

To test whether this definition is capable of capturing FGPs as suggested by the conceptual definition

of “factoryless” production arrangements, I compare the sectoral employment distribution, ownership

of intellectual property, and foreign imports at identified FGPs with those at identified Service

Providers.




17The final analyses samples only include firms for which we are able to obtain information on basic characteristics from
the LBD. Over 90 percent of identified firms were linked to the LBD. Firm counts are rounded to comply with Census
Bureau rules on disclosure avoidance.
                                                           13
3.1 Employment Shares

        The conceptual definition of FGPs – entities that outsource all transformation activities and

retain control of research and design and final sales to customers – suggests three implications for the

employment mix at a FGP firm. First, the FGP firm should have little to no manufacturing

employment. Second, FGP firms should be more active than Service Providers in the wholesale sector

that encompasses delivery, warehousing, order fulfillment, and logistics. Third, services employment

at a FGP firm should be relatively concentrated in “headquarter” services, which includes R&D

personnel. The focus on FGP firms currently classified outside the manufacturing sector already

excludes manufacturing activity and, thus, by construction is concentrated in the wholesale and

services sectors. We should then expect to observe FGP firms with relatively higher shares of

employment in wholesale and services than Service Providers.

        Table 1 presents the average shares of employment in wholesale, services, and all other sectors

at FGP and service-providing firms. 18 Employment in the services sector is further decomposed into

employment in professional, scientific, and technical services (NAICS 54) and management of

companies and enterprises (NAICS 55). Employment in NAICS 54 includes workers providing

scientific research and development services. Based on the definition of FGP activities, we would

expect FGP firms to specialize in providing “headquarter” services.

        FGP firms, on average, have most of their employment in wholesale and the remaining almost

evenly divided between services and other sectors of the economy. FGP firms with employment in

the services sector have the majority of their workers engaged in provision of “headquarter” services.

Service Providers, in contrast, have most of their employment housed in other sectors of the economy

and only a third of their services workers are engaged in the provision of “headquarter” services. Using


18“Other” sectors include retail, agriculture, transportation, warehousing, and utilities, construction, and public
administration but exclude manufacturing.

the restricted definition, Service Providers display higher shares of employment in wholesale and

“headquarter” services, although these shares do not reach the levels of FGP firms.



3.2 Innovative Activity

        A key feature of FGPs is control of the research and design processes, so we expect to observe

higher shares of employment in R&D activities as found in Table 1. We also expect FGP firms to own

intellectual property defined here as R&D expenditures, ownership of granted patents, and

trademarks. Table 2 presents average values of the ownership of intellectual property. FGP firms have

substantially higher average values of R&D expenditures and counts of granted patents and

trademarks than Service Providers.

        The differences in average innovative outcomes between FGPs and Service Providers are

magnified when we use the restricted definition. For instance, FGP firms display almost seventy times

more R&D expenditures than Service Providers under the restricted definition. This difference is only

about four times under the broad definition. The patterns in ownership of intellectual property in this

table display that FGPs have a higher likelihood of controlling the research and design process than

Service Providers.



3.3 Importing Activity

        FGP firms may use factories located in foreign countries to manufacture the goods they

control. This implies that FGP firms are likely to import the foreign-produced goods back to the U.S.

for domestic sale or further processing. Table 3 shows that, indeed, FGP firms are more likely to be

importers relative to Service Providers. The vast majority of FGP firms engage in importing while less

than half of Service Providers import. Average import values are also larger at FGP firms.


                                                  15
        Table 3 also provides the average share of firm imports sourced from low-wage countries.

Lower-income countries are more likely to be low-wage countries (Bernard, Jensen, and Schott, 2006).

If lower labor costs motivate FGP firms to use foreign factories, we would expect to see higher shares

of imports from low-wage countries at FGP firms. Imports from low-income countries are a very

small share of total firm imports (less than 1 percent) at both FGP and service-providing firms.

However, the average share of imports from low-wage countries is about twice as high at FGP firms.

Finally, imports as a share of firm revenue is more than three times higher at FGP firms. Together,

these results suggest that FGP firms are more likely to utilize borderless-production arrangements

than Service Providers.

        A striking 80 percent of global trade takes place in production networks administered by

multinational firms (UNCTAD, 2013). We may expect that FGPs are more likely to also be

multinational firms than Service Providers. For example, Kamal et al (2015) document that over half

of the firms that purchase CMS outside the U.S. do so from their affiliates. Using the USDIA and

FDIUS linked to the Business Register and using the broad definition only, FGP firms that are

currently classified outside the manufacturing sector account for 3 percent of all multinational firms

operating in the U.S.; 5 percent of all U.S. multinational parent firms; and 3 percent of all U.S. affiliates

of foreign parent firms. These shares are considerably higher for Service Providers. Service Providers

account for 14 percent of all multinational firms operating in the U.S.; 25 percent of all U.S.

multinational parent firms; and 10 percent of all U.S. affiliates of foreign parent firms. These statistics,

although not meant to be nationally representative, suggest a more nuanced relationship between

multinational status and “factoryless” activity of firms outside the manufacturing sector.

3.4 Firm Characteristics

        The descriptive analyses in the previous sections establish meaningful correlations between

the definition of FGP firms and observable outcomes implied by “factoryless” activity. FGPs are

associated with higher concentration of employment in “headquarter” services, greater ownership of

intellectual property, and higher import shares than Service Providers. This section presents

characteristics - revenue, employment, revenue per worker, payroll, payroll per worker, number of

establishments, and age - of an average FGP classified outside the manufacturing sector and an average

Service Provider.

        Table 4 shows that FGP firms earn lower average revenue than Service Providers. FGP firms

also employ almost three times fewer workers, have smaller payroll, and own fewer establishments

than Service Providers. These findings are in contrast to Bernard and Fort (2015) who find that FGP

firms tend to be larger than traditional wholesalers using the Census of Wholesale only. However,

there is no obvious prediction for firm size and “factoryless” status. Outside the manufacturing sector,

FGP firms may employ fewer workers at fewer numbers of establishments than Service Providers, if

non-production activities focused on managing production transformation tasks require fewer

workers and physical facilities. FGP firms may display lower sales if they are more likely than Service

Providers to locate production and sales abroad.

        Prior research has found a close and generally positive relationship between firm size and

productivity (Haltiwanger, Lane, and Spletzer, 1999). This may lead us to expect that smaller FGP

firms are less productive than the larger Service Providers. However, Table 4 shows that FGP firms

display higher average revenue and payroll per worker (the difference is more pronounced using the

broad definition of FGP firms). Finally, FGP firms tend to be younger, a finding consistent with that

in Bernard and Fort (2015), by an average of five to six years.


                                                   17
4. “Factoryless” activity in the Manufacturing Sector

        The goal in this section is to separately identify goods-producers that outsource a part of the

production process (Hybrid Manufacturers) and goods-producers that do not outsource any

production (Traditional Manufacturers), both currently classified in the manufacturing sector.

Although the ECPC’s conceptual definition of FGPs precludes any production transformation

activities, existing evidence shows the growing prevalence of outsourcing by firms with manufacturing

activity (Bayard et al, 2015). The authors find that, only 30 percent of firms with some manufacturing

activity in the U.S. engaged in “factoryless” manufacturing in 2002 but by 2012 this share had increased

to half. Thus, an additional challenge faced by the statistical system is to distinguish between the extent

of “factoryless” activities at a firm. A Hybrid Manufacturer is defined as purchasing CMS and having

employment in the manufacturing sector. A Traditional Manufacturer is defined as not purchasing

CMS and having employment in the manufacturing sector. The goal, as in Section 3, is to compare

Hybrid Manufacturers and Traditional Manufacturers along dimensions suggested by the conceptual

definition of “factoryless” production and test whether the implied correlations exist for Hybrid

Manufacturers that outsource only a part of the production process. The broad and restricted

definitions used are as described in Section 2.1.



4.1 Employment Shares

        The focus on Hybrid Manufacturers currently classified within the manufacturing sector

implies that these firms will have a larger share of their employment in the manufacturing sector. Table

5 confirms that the average share of manufacturing employment at both types of goods-producing

firms is over 80 percent. The table presents the share of production and non-production workers in

lieu of comparing the share of employment in “headquarter” services at Hybrid and Traditional

manufacturing firms. We expect Hybrid Manufacturers to have fewer production workers than
                                                    18
Traditional Manufacturers since part of production at Hybrid manufacturing firms is outsourced.

Concurrently, we expect Hybrid Manufacturers’ to have more non-production workers than

Traditional Manufacturers. Table 5 shows that, in comparison to Traditional Manufacturers, the

average share of production workers is lower at Hybrid manufacturing firms while the average share

of non-production workers is higher.



4.2 Innovative Activity

        Table 6 presents average R&D expenditures and ownership of intellectual property for Hybrid

and Traditional manufacturing firms. Hybrid Manufacturers have higher average R&D expenditures

than Traditional Manufacturers. Hybrid Manufacturers’ also have higher numbers of patents and

trademarks than Traditional Manufacturers. These patterns suggest that even Hybrid Manufacturers

that outsource only a part of the production transformation process display patterns in ownership of

intellectual property that are consistent with the conceptual definition of “factoryless” production.



4.3 Importing Activity

        Average trade characteristics displayed in Table 7 yield three sets of correlations that are

consistent with the idea that Hybrid Manufacturers may use foreign factories to manufacture goods

more intensively than Traditional Manufacturers. First, both types of manufacturers are almost equally

likely to import (under the broad definition) but imports make up 23 percent of total revenue at Hybrid

compared to 19 percent at Traditional manufacturing firms. Under the restricted definition, 92 percent

of Hybrid Manufacturers and 72 percent of Traditional Manufacturers firms import and the share of

imports in total revenue is 30 and 12 percent, respectively. Together, these statistics suggest that

Hybrid Manufacturers are more likely to import than Traditional Manufacturers. Second, average

import values are almost three times larger at Hybrid manufacturing firms. Finally, Hybrid
                                                  19
Manufacturers’ have higher shares of imports from low-wage countries than Traditional

Manufacturers.

        Since multinational firms mediate a large share of world trade, we may expect there to be a

correlation between propensity to engage in “factoryless” production and multinational status of a

firm. Using the USDIA and FDIUS linked to the Business Register and the broad definition only,

Hybrid Manufacturers account for 8 percent of all multinational firms operating in the U.S.; 22 percent

of all U.S. multinational parent firms; and 3 percent of all U.S. affiliates of foreign parent firms. These

shares are lower for Traditional Manufacturers. Traditional Manufacturers account for 7 percent of all

multinational firms operating in the U.S.; 14 percent of all U.S. multinational parent firms; and 5

percent of all U.S. affiliates of foreign parent firms. These preliminary share statistics suggest that

Hybrid Manufacturers are more likely to be multinational firms than Traditional Manufacturers.



4.4 Firm Characteristics

        The descriptive analyses in the previous sections demonstrate that “factoryless” activity in the

manufacturing sector is associated with lower shares of production workers, higher shares of non-

production workers, greater ownership of intellectual property, and higher import shares. Thus,

meaningful correlations between “factoryless” status and observable outcomes implied by ECPC’s

conceptual definition also hold for firms that outsource only a part of production. This section

presents characteristics - revenue, employment, revenue per worker, payroll, payroll per worker,

number of establishments, and age - of an average Hybrid Manufacturer and an average Traditional

Manufacturer.

        Table 8 shows that Hybrid Manufacturers are larger than Traditional Manufacturers in terms

of average revenue, employment and payroll. However, Hybrid Manufacturers own fewer numbers of

establishments consistent with the idea that firms require fewer physical plants when part of the
                                                    20
production is outsourced. Hybrid Manufacturers have higher average payroll per worker (under both

definitions) and higher average revenue per worker (under the restricted definition only). Both types

of manufacturers display similar ages, averaging over twenty-four years.



6. Conclusion

        The rise of complex production arrangements in recent decades demands the need for

statistical agencies to better reflect these activities in economic statistics. This paper evaluates 2012

data collection efforts by the U.S. Census Bureau to identify “factoryless” goods producers that

outsource physical transformation activities while retaining control of designing and marketing a

product. All establishments in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors and a select set of

establishments in the services sector were legally required to respond to a special inquiry that captures

a key element of this extreme form of production fragmentation – decision to outsource the physical

transformation activities to other domestic firms or offshored to foreign firms and/or own affiliates.

Headquarter locations of a select set of large firms across a broad range of sectors were also required

to respond to the special inquiry. The goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of identifying

“factoryless” activity at the firm level in a departure from official guidelines that has mandated

identification of FGP establishments. The firm as the focal unit of analysis is motivated not only by

the availability of key data elements required to identify “factoryless” status but also its role as the

central decision-making unit that ultimately controls the activities at individual establishments. In this

study, FGP firms that have no manufacturing employment are separately analyzed from firms

providing services and other goods-producers that may or may not outsource some part of the

production process.

        The paper starts by documenting a high degree of disagreement in establishment and firm

responses to self-identifying as an outsourcer, thereby highlighting challenges in relying on survey
                                                   21
responses alone for classification of FGPs. Characteristics implied by the definition of “factoryless”

production arrangements are then explored to reveal meaningful correlations between “factoryless”

status and variables identified based on conceptual definitions: employment mix, innovation, and

importing activities. These correlations are presented separately for firms currently classified outside

the manufacturing sector from firms currently classified in the manufacturing sector. The

unconditional correlations merit further study building towards developing a model-based algorithm

to identify FGPs. A model-based approach would capture salient features of “factoryless” production

using existing data sources and reducing sole reliance on survey responses.

        There are three practical dimensions along which the identification exercise may be

augmented. First, outsourcing status of a firm identified using only the Economic Census requires that

one establishment of the firm reports purchasing CMS. I utilize responses to the economic value of

activities related to the purchase of CMS to create a binary CMS purchase status indicator. However,

this categorization does not explicitly consider the intensity of outsourcing activities. The intensity of

activities could indicate how prevalent outsourcing is for FGP firms and suggest thresholds to assign

likelihoods of being a FGP firm. This may be more relevant for Hybrid Manufacturers that outsource

only a part of production. Second, more than one establishment of a multi-unit firm may have received

the special inquiry on purchase of CMS. The firm is assigned a positive CMS purchase status if at least

one establishment responds in the affirmative. However, when multiple establishments respond,

analyzing the share that say yes versus no may allow an alternative method of classification, for

instance, assigning the firm a positive CMS purchases status if majority of its establishments outsource

production. Third, the Bureau of Economic Analysis added questions about purchase of CMS in two

of their mandatory surveys. One of these surveys, the 2009 USDIA, was separately analyzed in Kamal

et al (2015), but was not linked to Census data. Linking the BEA surveys to Census data used in this


                                                   22
study would permit further validation of responses by the same firm and a focus on FGP firms that

are also multinationals.

        Concerted efforts to collect data on outsourcing activities at the firm level could further

complement the above extensions. Sole reliance on surveys of multinational firms and the Company

Organization Survey (intended primarily to update the Census Bureau’s Business Register and

accordingly surveys a select set of firms) limits our ability to systematically measure production

fragmentation in the U.S. economy. I offer three other potential sources of data collection

opportunities at the firm level to augment our discussions of how best to measure “factoryless”

production. First, the Annual Business Survey, covering non-farm businesses with paid employees,

may offer a more comprehensive coverage of firms in the U.S. economy. 19 Cognitive testing results

from the 2017 Economic Census special inquiry could inform candidate questions. Second, the

Services Annual Survey may also offer an additional survey instrument to collect relevant information

on firm’s foreign outsourcing activities. 20 The survey currently collects data on firms’ exports of

services only. Including questions related to services imports could shed light on purchases of foreign

manufacturing services. Finally, including questions on customs forms would provide the ability to

distinguish between products of a firm that are directly manufactured from those that are processed

abroad. Leveraging existing data sources and evaluating the advantages and challenges associated with

new data collection opportunities, together, paves a path forward to gaining a deeper understanding

of and the ability to measure “factoryless” goods production arrangements in the U.S. economy.
