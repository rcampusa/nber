Creativity and the Family Tree: Human Capital Endowments and the Propensity of Entrepreneurs

                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper we show that the patenting behavior of creative entrepreneurs is correlated with the patenting
behavior of their fathers, which we refer to as a source of the entrepreneurs’ human capital endowments.
Our argument for this relationship follows from established theories of developmental creativity, and our
empirical analysis is based on survey data collected from MIT’s Technology Review winners.

                                 Creativity and the Family Tree:
         Human Capital Endowments and the Propensity of Entrepreneurs to Patent




1 Introduction
The propensity to patent by firms and entrepreneurs is related to the external and internal
environment of each. The environment surrounding firms consists externally of their market
structure and internally of their investments in research and development (R&D), among other
things (Cohen 2010). That surrounding entrepreneurs also consists externally of their market
environment and internally of both their financial ability (own or that of alternative investors) to
move their technology to a market innovation and their incentive structure (Siegel et al. 2003).


Surprisingly, this literature has ignored human capital endowments when comparing the
propensity to patent across entrepreneurs.1 Link and Ruhm (2011) focused on investments in
human capital and showed that prior business education/experience is a correlate with patenting.
This paper extends the study of patenting by focusing on the developmentally-acquired creativity
of the entrepreneur.


In Section II we posit a model of human capital endowments, obtained through observing
parental behavior, and one’s propensity to patent; we describe our database; and we present our
empirical findings. Concluding remarks are in Section III.


2 The Propensity to Patent
2.1 An Empirical Model
Creativity is “the interaction among aptitude, process, and environment by which an individual
or group produces a perceptible product that is both novel and useful.” (Plucker et al. 2004, p.
90). Kaufman and Sternberg (2007) discuss creativity in several dimensions, often referred to as
“4-Ps.” The “Ps” are the creative person, product, process, and place (i.e., environment). Thus,

1
 Nicolaou et al. (2008) argued that genetic factors be considered for why individuals engage in entrepreneurial
activity. Relatedly, Bates (1985) showed a positive relationship between human capital endowments and minority
enterprise profitability.

                                                        2
a creative person can produce, through a creative process, a creative product; and it follows that
the creative person and his/her process can be influenced by place.


Creativity, as reflected through innovativeness, is also a characteristic of an entrepreneur (Hébert
and Link 2009); and patenting is a purposeful activity motivated to protect intellectual property
(Sichelman and Graham 2010). Generally, a requirement for a patent is that the invention is
novel, useful, and non-obvious (USPTO 2011).


Our framework stems from developmental theories of creativity. Goertzel and Goertzel (1976),
Helson (1999), and others argued that developmental experiences of individuals, including
parental guidance and family structure, are correlated with the demonstrated creativeness of
individuals. The roots of the background of individuals establish the trajectory for their creative
development (Kozbelt et al. 2010).2


Based on this argument, we hypothesize that the propensity of a creative individual (i) to patent
is related to the same behavior of his/her parents:


(1)        Patenti = F(Xi + ui> 0)


where Patent measures the propensity of an individual to patent, X a vector of parental patenting
activity and other characteristics, and ui ~ N(0,1).


We estimated equation (1) using a rich and previously unexamined database of international
inventors, as acknowledged by MIT’s Technology Review.


2.2 Technology Review Database
To commemorate the 100th year of publication of MIT’s innovation magazine, Technology
Review (TR), 100 international inventors (under age 35 at nomination) from universities,
businesses, and government laboratories, who have the potential to make major technology
contributions in the decades ahead, were identified in the November/December 1999 issue of the

2
    Self-employed entrepreneurs often have fathers who were self-employed (Shane 2003).

                                                         3
Review (Benditt 1999). TR100 inventors received this distinction in 2002, 2003, and 2004. In
2005, and thereafter, the TR100 became the TR35.3


All TR winners, arguably among the most inventive young individuals from 1999 through 2009
(thus, not representative of all creative entrepreneurs) are the population for our survey-based
study. We obtained e-mail addresses and were able to contact 341 of the 575 winners. Sixty-
three, or 18.5 percent, of those returned surveys.4 See Table 1.


The specification of equation (1) is parsimonious owing to limited survey information and to the
relatively homogenous nature of TR winners. For example, 83 percent holds a terminal degree
(i.e., PhD, MD, or JD) Nominees must be under 35; the age range in Table 3 is 26 to 35.


2.3 Empirical Findings
The variables used to estimate equation (1) are defined and descriptive statistics are in Table 2.


We estimated equation (1) using a two-part model. Regarding the probit results in column (1) of
Table 3 for the full survey sample of n=63, creative entrepreneurs with fathers who patented are
nearly 26 percentage points more likely to patent themselves compared to a similarly creative
entrepreneur whose father did not patent, ceteris paribus. Also, those of Asian descent and those
with a graduate degree in science or engineering are also relatively more likely to patent than
other creative entrepreneurs. Finally, males are more likely to patent than females but the
difference does not reach statistical significance (p-value=0.12).5


The second part of our estimation involves identifying correlates with the natural log of the
number of patents received conditional on patenting. As seen in column (2) for the sample of
n=29 who patented, those with a patenting father patent more, ceteris paribus. There is also
evidence that age is a factor in determining the number of patents received rather than the per se

3
  This change coincided with a new editor at Technology Review.
4
  This response rate is on par with others innovation studies. The response rate for the National Research Council’s
(NRC’s) Congressional mandated study of NASA Small Business Innovation Research award recipient firms was
23%.
5
  Baer and Kaufman (2008) argued that there are no gender differences in the creativity of individuals, based on
traditional tools for measuring creativity.

                                                         4
propensity to patent, but this finding may only represent the fact that receipt of a patent is time
intensive. And, nationality is not significant among those who patent, but field of study is.


Finally, in column (3), we treated patenting as a count process. The negative binomial results
confirm the positive predicted effect of one’s father having patented. Males and Asians also have
higher patent counts, but field of study is no longer relevant reflecting the previous evidence that
scientists and engineers are more likely to patent but in smaller numbers among those who do so.


Equation (1) was also estimated as a probit model with control for survey response; that is, it was
estimated as a maximum likelihood model with selection. The model for non-response was
estimated as a function of the award year, Year, under the argument that the earlier in time the
award the less likely the awardee would respond to the survey, and the probit results confirmed
this. However, when estimated simultaneously with the probability of patenting model, the
correlation between the error terms was not significant. Separately, we estimated the model
underlying the results in column (1) of Table 3 with Year and a regressor. The estimated
coefficient on Year was not significant thus supporting the conclusion that this variable could
reasonably be excluded from the patenting probit model.


3 Concluding Observations
We caution against generalizing from our patent-specific findings that observed parental
behavior is related to other dimensions of entrepreneurial creativity. Our sample of TR winners
is unique, and our economic analysis is exploratory in structure and scope. Nevertheless, our
findings might suggest that human capital endowments be considered in future studies of
innovative behavior.
