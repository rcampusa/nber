 Inflation and the Taxation of Capital Income in the
                    Corporate Sector

     This paper presents a detailed examination of the effect of
inflation on the taxation of capital used in the nonfinancial
sector of the U.S. economy.  In contrast to previous studies of
the relation between inflation and corporate tax burdens, we
consider not only the tax paid by the corporations themselves but
also the tax paid by the individuals and institutions that provide
capital to the corporate sector.

     According to our calculations, the effect of inflation with the
existing tax laws was to raise the 1977 tax burden on corporate
sector capital income by more than $32 billion, an amount equal to
69 percent of the real after tax capital income of the nonfinancial
corporate sector (including dividends, retained earnings and real
interest). This extra tax raised the total effective tax rate from
43 percent to 66 percent of capital income in the nonfinancial
corporate sector.

     A separate analysis for each of 20 manufacturing industries
shows substantial variation among these industries in the relative
importance of this increased taxation.  Inflation therefore can
distort the allocation of capital among industries as well as the
total volume of corporate capital formation.

     The paper considers the role of corporate debt in detail.
Inflation distorts taxation by allowing corporations to deduct no-
minal interest payments that exceed real interest but then taxes
lenders on their nominal receipts. Our analysis shows that the
additional taxes paid by lenders exceed the tax saving by corporate
borrowers. Since the difference between the relevant tax rates
of borrowers and lenders is quite small, the mismeasurement of
interest income and expenses can be ignored without seriously
distorting the evaluation of the overall effect of inflation on
the taxation of corporate sector capital.

       This paper presents a detailed eXamination of the effect of inflation

 on the taxation of capital used in the nonfillancial corporate sector of

 the u.S. economy.    Our analysis shows that, with current tax laws,inflation

 substantially mcreases the effective tax rate on capital incorre m the

 corporate .sector.   The principal reason for this is that the historic cost

 n:ethod of depreciation causes a major overstaterrent of taxable profits, Le.,

 historic cost. depreciaton results in a large mcrease m the level of real

 taxable profits at any level of. real economic profits.    current rrethods

 of inventory accounting add further to this overstatement of profits for tax

 purposes •.

       According to our nost comprehensive calculation, the effect of inflation

 with existing tax laws was to raise the 1977 tax burden on corporate sector

 capital income by m:>re than $32 billion.    'Ihis extra tax burden was equivalent

 to 69 percent of the real after-tax capital incane of the nonfinancial corporate

 sector, including retained earnmgs, elividends, and real interest receipts

of the oorporations' creditors.     Since our calculations show that the total

tax burden on this oorporate capital incorre was $92       billion, the extra tax

burden raised the tax by rrore than 54 p . ~rcent.   The total effective tax rate

on oorporate sector capital incarre in 1977 was 66 percent;       without the

extra tax caused by inflation, the effective tax rate would have been only
4 J -percent.
        In contrast to previous studies of the relation between inflation

and oorporate tax burdens, we oonsider not only the tax paid by the

oorporations themselves but also the tax paid by the individuals and mstitutions

that· supply €apital to the corporate sector.        This is particularly important

for a oorrect treatrrent of oorporate debt.     Inflation implies that the

nominal interest payrrents that oorporatLons deduct in calculating

taxable profits exceed the real oost of borrowed funds; in itself, this
                                                      . .               2
tends to understate real profits and to lower the effec.t1.ve tax rate.
However, the individuals and institutions that lend to. the oorporations
                                                    3
are taxed on the overstated nominal interest income.        Our calculations

show that the excess tax :p.a.id by the lenders is slightly greater than the

tax saving of the corpOrate borrowers.     Since the difference between the

relevant tax rate for borrowers and lenders is quite small, the miSITEasure-

ment of interest incorre (or, equivalently, the real gains and losses on net

oorporate debt) can be ignored without seriously distorting the evaluation

of the overall effect 6f inflation on the taxation of corporate sector

capital.                                                                               i ...

            In addition to our analysis of the nonfinancial corporate sector as

a whole, the present study makes use of an important new source of data

for individual firms on the values of both replacerrent cost depreciation

and depreciation based on historic costs.     Beginning with the year 1976,

the 8ecurities and Exchange COmmission has required large corporations to
provide information on replacement cost depreciation and inventory profits

as Part of their annual form lO-K reports.      We use these data together with

other information on the financial and real performance of 327 individual

manufacturing firms in order to examine how inflation has raised the

effective tax rates on different industries.

            In the first section of this study, we ignore the miSIreasuremant

of   ib~stexpenses    and incc:m: in order to focus on the additional taxation

caused by historic cost depreciation and by existing. inventory accounting

rrethods.   section 2 then shows that the corporate tax savings that result

from overstating real interest expenses are slightly rrore than balanced by

the greater tax burdens that the miSIreasurerrent of interest incc:m: irrposes

on the individuals and institutions that directly and indirectly supply debt

capital to the corporate sector.      The total increase in tax liabilities on

corporate source ineate due to inflation is then estimated in section 3.

Section 4 describes inflation's impact on effective tax rates.     The fifth

section then uses the data on individual firms to calculate the extent of

additional taxation in each of the 20 different manufacturing industries.

There is a brief concluding section that discusses the implications of these
                                                                                 1
higher effective tax rates for capital formation and economic performance.


lThe analysis relates only to nonfinancial corporations even when the text
 refers only to corporations. Throughout the study we make no attertlf>t to assess
 the extent to which the initial tax burdens are shifted to other capital or
 to labor by changes in the allocation of capital or in the financial decisions
 of households and firms. We also ignore state and local taxes and to that extent,
 understate total tax burdens.

1.   ~preciation    Rules, Inventory Accounting and Corporate Tax Payments

           A desirable taxation criterion is that :rreal tax payments should not

be affected by changes in the overall price level which do not alter real

inccme or wealth.    Our   tax system violates this standard in its treat:m:mt
of corporate profits.      ~.vhen   the price level rises and firms' real profits
remain constant, their real tax payments rise both because of historical cost

depreciation and FIFO inventory accounting.          The real cost of the depreciating

of a finn's capital stock is the replacerrent cost of the obsolescent capital.

Yet for tax purPOses finns are only pennitted to deduct depreciation based

on the original purchase price.          In inflationary periods, this may be much

less than the replacerrent cost.         Similarly, the cost of depleting inventories,

is the replacerrent cost of the goods, not their original acquisition cost.

Firms which use FIFO inventory cost deduct only the acquisition cost, giving

rise to phantan inventory: ,.:iprofits.

            In this section, we discuss our estimates of how much existing

depreciation and inventory rules raise corporate taxes in our inflationary

economy.   We ignore the role of debt and limit our attention to the tax

burdens at the level of the corporation; this restriction is droPPed in the

 subsequent sections where, as we noted in the introduction, we show that

explicit recognition of debt has little effect on the total additional

 taxation of all the capital used in the corporate sector because of the

offsetting effects of inflation on the taxation of borrowers and lenders.

We begin this section by exaI!lining the experience for 1977, the rrost recent

 year for which all the required infonnation is available.         We then discuss

 the trends in inflation's effects on the ta,'ffition of corporate source

 incorre over the period since 1954.

1.1     The Experience of 1977

             Before looking in dete1.il at the data for 1977, we can surmnarize

briefly the impact of inflation on the taxes paid by nonfinancial corporations

in 1977.     The cumulative effect of inflation reduced the depreciation allowed

on existing plant and equiprent by $39.7 billion in 1977.       This raised

corporate tax payrre:n.ts by $19 billion, on nearly one-third of the $59 billion

of corporate tax liabilities for 1977.       Artifical inventory profits added

an additional $7 billion to tax liabilities.       Thus, inflation raised corporate

taxes from $33 billion to $59 billion, an increase of 79 percent.       Stnting

this in a different way, the additional corporate tax caused by inflation

accounts for 57 percent of the $59 billion of corporate tax liabilities in

1977.

            we can now examine the specific data used to calculate these
additional tax burdens. The official national ineate account estimate of
                                                                              l
the 1977 real profits of nonfinancial corporations was $113.9 billion.

Taxable profits for those corporations were $143.5 billion in the same

year.     '!he $30 billion difference between these two profit figures is the

Stml   of the inventory valuation adjustJrent and the capital consumption

adjust:Irent.   The inventory valuation adjust:Irent (IVA) of $14.8 billion

implies that inflation added $14.8 billion of false inventory profits

to taxable ineate.     The capital consumption adjust:Irent (CCA) of $14.7

billion actually    ref~ects   two countervailing differences between real
straight-line depreciation and the depreciation allowed for tax P'llI"POses:


lsurvey of Current Business, November 1978. For earlier years, we use the
 Survey of Current Business, March 1976, pages 53-57, and updates in the
 Survey 'of- Current -BUSiness: .Dep'recia1;.i~ is based on straight-line depre-
ciation at 85 percent of the Bulletin F lives with depreciation calculated
at replacenent cost.                             -    .   .,.'      -
                                           -6-




the accelerated depreciation rules made tax-deductible depreciation exceed

straight-line depreciation by $25.0 billion while inflation reduced the

value of tax-deduCtible depreciation and raised taxable profits by

$39.7 billion.         We shall refer to the   u..'O   components of the CCA as the

"accelerntion ccmponent" (CCA-A) and the "i."1flation CC'l!l'POIlent" (CCA-I).        Thus

historic cost depreciation plus .false inventory profits together added

$54.5 billion to taxable profits.          With a 48 percent statutory marginal

tax rate, inflation caused a $26 billion increase incorPOrate tax payrrents.

                 In· calculating the excess corPOrate tax paynents we have :irrplicitly

assumed that accelerated depreciation and the investn:ent tax credit were

8Ilacted to stimulate invesi::Irent and not as .::m offset to inflation.        It is

clear that these features \vere enacted long before adjusting taxable income

for inflation was a serious issue.          Accelerated depreciation was int.."'"CX1uced

to the tax law in 1954 (a year in which the CPI actually fell) because of a

conviction that tax depreciation lives were too long.              Extensions of accelerated

depreciation .in subsequent years appear to have been instituted by a desire

to stimulate invest:.m:mt rat."1er than as an offset to inflation.          As Stanley

Surrey noted in connection with the 1971 acct:leration provisions that created

the asset depreciation range (ADR) system, "The new ADR system was urged by

the Treasury and adopted by the COngress in 1971 not as a device needed to

measure real net inoone •.. but as incentive for e.e purchases of new machinery

and equiprent."         (Surrey,   1973, p. 32 ).      Similarly the investrrent ~: credit

was introduced as a countercyclic::.l :rrcasure to simulate demand in 1962, a year

in "f,ymch   b.~    CPI rose only 1.2 percent.

             Although the tax credits and accelerated depreciation that was

legislated before the recent inflation can clearly be regarded as invest:Iret1t

i11ce..'1tives   rat.~r   than offsets to inflation, it can be argued that the changes
                                          -7-




made in the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 (and .in subsequent legislation)             "W'erC


intended at least partly as an offset to the inflationary distortions of the
                    1
tax liabilities.        It is wortbernphasizing therefore that these tax charges

have done relatively little to reduce corporate taxes.              The accelerated

depreciation ccmponent of the capital consumption adjustJ:rent rose from

$20~4   billion in 1975 to $25.0 billion in 1977, an increase proportional

to the naninal level of fixed invest::Irent on the nonfinancial corporate

sector.    The increase iLi the arrount of the investment tax credit between

1975 and 1977 due to the liberalization enacted in 19751 cannot be measured

precisely but   a   reasonably accurate    II   upper-bound II estimate can be made.

If the three percent increase in the I. T. C. rate' applied to all equiprrent

invest:nent in 1977, the additional tax credit for nonf.inancial corporations

would have been only $3.4 billion.         This is clearly an overestimate of the

additional .invest::Irent tax credit because various limitations prevent all

corporations from using the full 10 percent credit a"'1.q occause the rate is

less than 10 percent on certai.i1 types of equip:nent.           Furthe:rrrore, the 1975

liberalization of the loT.C. can be ascribed at least as plausibly to anti-

recession policy as to a desire to offset inflation's LipClct            o~   taxable

profits.

1.2   The Period S.ince 1954

            It is useful now to see the grow.ing impact of .inflation on tax

liabilities by examin.ing the evolution of taxable incanz and taxes s.ince 1954. 2

This analysis   SI-IOWS   thc::.t, although .inflation has caused serre increa;;e in

corporate taxes for the past two decades, the period since 1970 has seen

lThe Tax RGd.uction Act of 1975 rai~ed the invest.rrent tax credit from 7 percent
 to 10 perce."1t and liberalized the accelerated depreciation rules.

We begin with 1954 to avoid ·thecomplexit.ie6 of 'the excess profits taxes'1:hcrt

 a major overhaul of the tax law that, with arrendrrents, continues to provide
 the framework for current tax legi.slation.

dramatically greater tax increases induced by inflation.

            Table 1 presents annual infonnatioi"l on   'l;he   distortion of taxable

profits caused by historic cost depreciation (CCA-I) and by artificial inventory

accounting prcfi ts (IVA), the additional tax due to each of these, and tl1e

proportion of actual taxes that are accountE:d for by these excess taxes.

            Consider fi:r:s.tthe reduced depreciation for tax purposes cau:::ed by

historic cost accounting.     Column 2 shows that this reduction in depreciation

(CCA-I) remained less than $10 billion a year until 1970 but reached $39.7

billion in 1977.     The 1977 level is nearly double the 1974 level and nearly

eight tiIres the level of 1967.    This is reflected in the corresponding

excess taxes shown in column 5.     While the excess tax due to historic cost

depreciation varied between $2 billion and $3 billion a year until 1967, it

has doubled every three years since then: the excess taxes rose fran $2.4

billior. in 1967 to $4.8 billion in 1970, $10.3 billion in 1974, and.$19.l
billion iI). 1977.   While the excess tax caused by histbDic cost depreciation

accounted fer 9 percent of actual. corporate taxes i.."1 1967 {see column 8),.

they accounted for 32 percent of the taxes paid in 1977.

            The artificial inventory profits also remained very small U1"1.til

1967, never reaching $3 billion (column 3).        More recently, however, inventory

profits have   e~""edcd   $10 billion a year and the resulting excess profits

r...ave accounted for rrore than ten percent of   a~tual   taxes paid.

            Column 10 sumnarizes the overall effect of both sources of increased

taxation.    Until 1967, the excess tax caused by inflation accounted for 10 percent

to 20 percent of the corporate taxes actual1y paid.            This implies t..'1at

the excess tax raised the tax that \\Quld otherwise have been paid by up to

25 Percent.        During the nest recent five years, however, the excess tax

accoilllted for an average of 50 percent of the corporate taxes actually paid,

implying that these taxes were doubled by the excess tax caused by historic

cost depreciation and inflated invento:ry profits.


                 It is :i.rrportant to recognize that these distortions will continue

to grow even if the rate of inflation does nbt accelerate any further.

2.    Inflation and Debt:        Corp:>rate Gains and lenders' losses

             We   nCM   tum to the crucial issue of corporate debt.      Although

inflation'reduces the real value of outstanding corporate debt, this gain

by cor};X)rations is not taxable income.          Equivalently, corporations subtract

nominal instead of real interest payrrents in calculating taxable profits.

A number of previous writers on the relation between inflation and cor};X)rate

taxes have concluded that the corporate tax saving from the exclusion of

real gains on the debt is sufficient to offset the excess tax caused by the mis-
                                                    l
measurement of depreciation and invento:ry profits.   This has been interpreted

. as implying that inflation has no net effect on the taxation of corporate

source inaJJ:te.

           These conclusions are misleading because they are based on consider-

ing only sorre of the taxes levied on corporate source income.            The basic issue

is not the effect of inflation on the corporations' .tax liability but the·

effect of inflation on the taxation of capital used in the Corporate sector.

It is important to look through the corporation to the individuals and

institutions that provide the equity and debt . capital.          The total '1:.J.x on

corporate source incare includes taxes paid by the. owners of corporate

securities on dividends, interest payrrents, and capital gains.             It is this

total tax rather than the tax levied at the corporate level alone that

affects econanic incentives.

           'Ibis perspective is particularly important with respect to interest

payrrents.    ~.vhi.le   cor};X)rations are pennitted to deduct nominal rather than
                                                           ,              ,


 ~or example, Shoven and          BulCM (1976) and Cagan and Lipsey (1978) reached
     this conclusion.

real interest paymmts, lenders are obliged to pay taxes on nominal

interest receipts.      The effect of inflation on the total taxation of interest

incare depends on the relative rnagnitude of the tax rates facing corporate

borrowers on one hand and those who lend to corporations on the other.

If the tax .rate of corporate borrowers exceeds that of lenders, total tax
                                                   1
paymmts fall.      otherwise, tax revenues rise.

             The effect of dividend and capital gains   ~s   Irn.lSt also be considered.

The measurement.of income which gives rise to extra corporate tax payments

reduces dividends and retained ear:J lings.   This causes a reduction in non-

corporate taxes which partly offsets the increase in corporate taxes.

Inflation also increases nominal capital gains but not real capital gains,

leading to increases in noncorporate tax payments.      A full calculation

of the effects of inflation on the taxation of corporate source income

requires taking account of these effects.      The analysis that we present

in this .section shows that the relevant weighted average of the marginal

tax rates Paid by the individuals and· institutions that lend to nonfinancial

corporations is even greater than the marginal rate of tax that is saved

by corporations and their shareholders because of the overstaterrent of true

interest payments.     fibre SPecifically, we shall show that the relevant marginal

tax rate for those who lend to corporations is .0.420 while the relevant

combined rate of corporations and their shareholders as borrowers is
         2
0.404.       Ignoring the real gains and losses on corporate debt therefore

results in an underestimate of the total excess tax on corporate source incone



IThe potential balancing between borrowers and lenders is stressed in
 theoretical nodels of the effect of inflation in Feldstein (1976) and
 Feldstein, Green and Sheshinski (1978) .

2The   reason why the combined effective marginal tax rates for corporations
 and   their shareholders is less than the 48 percent corporate rate is that
 the   extra corporate tax payments lead to a reduction in taxes on dividends
 and   retained earnings.
                                  -13-




that is caused by inflation.   However, since the difference between

the effective marginal rates of the borrowers and the .lenders is quite

small ~ the whole issue of the real gains and losses on debt (or the mis-

rreasurerrent of interest payments) can be ignored without distorting the
                                                    1
-measurement of the excess tax caused by inflation.

         Although we believe it is important to examine the effect of

inflation on the total tax burden on corporate source income, we shall

also analyze the effect of inflation on the tax burden of the corporations

and their shareholders.   Our calculations, presented in Section 3, show

that the extra taxes that the corporations and their shareholders pay

because of inflation substantially exceed the arrount they save by ignoring

their inflationary gains on their net debts.   Thus whether one looks at

total capital incorne or only at the equity investors, the data show that

inflation raises the effective tax burden.

2 .1.     Noncorporate taxation of equity incorre.

         Owners of corporate equity pay dividend taxes on corporate incorne

if it is distributed or capital gains taxes if it is retained.     The rates

at which these taxes are levied depend on the holder .   Individuals, for

exanple, pay taxes on dividend incore at regular income tax rates but pay

capital gains taxes at much lower effective rates.    Different financial

institutions pay taxes at varying rates on capital :i,ncare.   As noted below,

pension incorre is essentially untaxed while certain institutions (e.g. life


lSince the lenders and borrowers are not the sarre individual~, inflation
 does cause a redistribution of net incorre arrong individuals and institutions.

insurance companies) actually face higher capital gains tax rates than

dividend tax rates.

         The first step in finding the effective tax rate paid on equity

incare is to determine thE distribution of ownership of corPOrate equity.

Table 2 displays the pattern of ownership of corporate equity at the end

of 1976 as refOrted in the official flow of funds accounts prepared by the

Board of Q:)vernors of the Federal Reserve System.     The bulk of the equity

is held by households with significant fractions held by pension funds and

life insurance companies.      A small fOrtion is held by other financial

institutions.     The second and tli.hd columns' of the table indicate the marginal

tax rates on dividends and capital gains for each tyPe of stockowner.         We
                                                                             1
asst:me that retained earnings are taxed at the capital gains tax rate.
         We estimate that under 1976 law, the average marginal tax rate on
                                                 2
 individual dividend receipts was 39 percent.

         Individual capital gains are taxed at half the statutory rate on

 dividends.     However, gains are taxed only if realized and the effective
                                                         3
 rate is reduced by the postfOnement of realization.

lAssuming retained earnings to be taxed at the capital gains rate involves
 the implicit assumption that each dollar of retained' earnings raises share
 prices by $1.00. Although Bradford (1977) and Auerbach (1977) have
 challenged this assumption by suggesting that the existing tax rules and
 dividends make the equilibrium value of retained earnings less than one,
 the possibility of distributing the corPOrate net worr.h through mergers and
 stock repurchases implies that even existing tax rules do not keep the
 value of retained earnings below one. While the issue is still in flux,
 we adopt the traditional assumption that each dollar of retained earnings
 raises the share prices by $1. 00 .
 2'Ihe marginal tax rate was found by using the NBER' s 'l;ro{SIlYJrrodel to estimate
 the additional tax payrrents arising fran a 1% increaSe in dividend payrrents.
  The TliiXSliMl't'K:DdELl is described in Feldstein and Frisch (1977). we allow
  for an estimated 7% of equity held by institutions which are not taxed
  but which are included by the flow of funds statistics in the household
  sector; this estimate of institutional ownership is derived fran the
  SEC Statistical Bulletin.
 3Individuals wh::> realize   capital gains are taxed on the gain -which occurred
  while they were holding     the asset. Hence capital gains which accrue on
  assets which are passed     at death completely avoid taxation. This is be-
  cause the new owner is      pennitted to "step up" his basis for future tax
  liabilities.

           Bailey (1968) has estimated that each of these factors

approximately halves the effective tax rate on capital gains.         Hence

we assurre a 5% tax rate on capital gains.      This estimate is conservative

because we ignore the' taxes paid underthe min.i.mum tax and preference ineare

provisiOOS of the tax law.

           We assurre that no taxes are levied on the equity ineare of Pension

funds.     In fact, PenSion recipients do pay taxes on· Pension ineare upon

receipt.     The effective rate is low, however, because the tax liability

is postponed and because the receipients generally hcive low marginal

tax rates during retirenent.      M:>reover, increased Pension returns may be

associated with reduced employer contributions rather than increased

benefits.     In order to be conservative in our estimate of the effective

tax rate on capital incare, we assurre a zero effective tax rate on Pension

meare.

           Life insurance cx::JJq?a!lies and cormercial banks are taxed at corporate

tax rates on dividends and capital gains.       They are pennitted to exclude

85% of dividends because of the intercorporate dividend exclusion.            Hence,

their effective marginal tax rate on dividend incorrie is 7.2%.2 These

institutions are taxed at a 30% statutory rate on capital gains realizations.

We assurre an effective rate of 15% on such gains because of the effect of

deferral.     Unlike our treatrrent of individuals, we assurre that all gains

 It can be argued that the tax treatrrent of Pension incorre is equivalent
 to a consumption tax because incorre put into Pensions escapes all tax
 until the Pension is withdrawn and _pr~~umably consurred. . On thil? view,
 the effective tax rate on Pension dividend and interest illcome lS zero.

2This overstates the dividend tax rate for insurance companies because of
 the special rules applying to insurance corrpanies.

are eventually realized.

         A weighted average of the effective tax rates provides our es-

tiroates of the overall marginal effective rates on dividends and retained

earnings.   In order to detennine the noncorporate tax rate on all

equity inCOIre, it is necessary to detennine how corporate profits are

divided between dividends and retained earnings.     We estimate this
                                                                           1
payout   ratio by using the average payout . ratio over the past decade.

'!he share of total profits going to dividends over this period was

46.1 percent, implying an overall tax rate on equity incorre of 15. T per cent.

         using this figure it is possible to find the total tax increase

on equity due to a misrreasurem:mt of corporate profits.    Suppose that

corporate taxable incare is increased by a single dollar with no change

in real incare.   '!he corporation pays 48 cents nore in taxes.   Shareholder

incare in the fonn of dividends and retained earnings is reduced by

48 cents, leading to a decline of 7.6 cents in shareholder tax payments.

Hence, total' tax payrrents rise by 40.4 cents.   '!hus, the marginal tax rate

on misrreasured inCOIre is 40.4%.   calculations of the increase in corporate -taxes

due to historical cost depreciation or false inventory accounting overstate

by about 20% the true additional burden on the suppliers of equity capital.




lIn calculating the payout ratio, profits are adjusted for inflation effects
on inventory and depreciation and on real indebtedness. We implicity
assume that there are no "clientele" effects, so that payout ratio is the
same for the equity owned by different classes of investors. Blurre et al
(1974) provide empirical support for this assumption.

total tax payrrents py less than 18%.          This occurs because the increase

in after-tax coI"f:X)rate incOtre re3ults in an increase in noncorporate

tax payrrents on dividends and capital gains.          In t.n.e preceding section

2.1, we showed that the effective marginal tax rate on dividends and retentions

is 15.7 percent; Le., it was derronstrated that the equity owners' tax rate

on "misrreasuro':''' corporate incop€ was 40.4 percent.          This is the correct

rreasure of the reduction in tax liabilities due to the deduction of nominal

interest.    It is this 40.4 percEnt rate that can be compared to the

marginal tax rate of cOI"f:X)rate debt holders in order to determine the

effect of inflation on the taxation of interest income and expenses.

In the next part of this section we consider the extra tax paid by the

holders of corporate debt.

2. 3 •         The Tax on CoI"f:X)rateI:Ebt Holders.

         We now examine the extra taxes that the holders of cOI"f:X)rate

debt pay when interest rates rise in response to a higher rate of inflation.

Equivalently, we estimate the arrolIDt by whichtheir:-taxeSlwt!lulabe reduced

if the taxation of interest income were indexed.           ~ve   also examine the

extra taxes corporations pay on their interest bearing financial assets.

financial assets and liabilities.         The holders of these securities are

debt holdings of each class of investor, fonred by aggregating the

entries in the aolunn.       In order to calculate the effective tax rate

on'the holders of corporate debt,      we   find the weighted average of

I1\3rginal tax ratesfor each investor class.

         Before describing our estimates of the specific marginal tax

rates, several features of Table 3 deserve corment.          First, IIDst

aorporate debt is not in the form of bonds.          Nearly half is canprised

of bankborrDwing and mortgages.        Second, only a small proportion of

aorporate interest paynents, less than 15%, goes to individuals.            The

1argestpot:!=ion goes to ccmnercial banks.        'Ihird, it is inportant to

recall that corporations themselves hold a large quantity of interest

bearing financial assets. Inflation leads to the increased tax liabilities
                                            1
on increased inCCl'OO fran these assets.

          our· estimate of the marginal tax rate facing each class of creditors
is shown in the botton row of Table 3.          'Ihese estimates are only approximate

since the laws governing financial institutions are quite ccmplex and since

all of the desired infonnation is not available. Fortunately, the esti-

mates that are rrost uncertain generally apply to only small quantities of

debt.    When in doubt,   we have selected relatively aonservative assurrptions.
The rationale for each of our estimates now follows:



lIn   SOIre   cases this leads to deductions for the issuers of the assets.
                                        -21-




Households:      According to the NBER TAXSTI-1 m:x1el, the weighted average of

the marginal tax rates on interest incOIre is about 25 percent.            Havvever,

this average includes bank dep:>sit interest as well as interest on

corporate securities.      Since corpo:r:rte bonds are held by nore affluent

taxpayers than ordinary bank accounttirre dep:>sits (see Projector

and Weiss 1     1966), the 25 percent overall figures for all interest payrrents

is too low.     We have selected a 35 percent tax rate on interest paid, thereby

implying that household bondholders have lower marginal tax rates on average

than household dividend recipients.

Pensions:      'Ihese are conservatively treated as fully tax exempt, implying a

zero marginal tax rate.

CoJ.'mercial Banks:    Ccmrercial banks pay a 48 percent corporate incorre tax

at the margin on interest receipts.       'Ihose interest   re~ipts   net of corporate

tax are then subject to further taxes as dividends and retained earnings i we

assure the sarre 15. 7 Fercent rate for this equity income that we derived

in section 2.1 for the equity incorre of nonfinancial corporations.            combining

the 48 percent and the 15. 7 percent implies an overall tax on this equity incorre

of 56.1.      However, When the interest rates that banks charge rise, banks also

raise the interest payrrents\ that they make to their dep:>sitors.          'Ib the

extent that these interest payrrents rise, the banks do not pay extra taxes

but their dep:>sitors do.     Of course, there is no increase in the interest paid

on demand dep:>sits.     lrile assure that interest rate ceilings constrain the

increase in other interest rates to 0.3 percent for each one percent increase

in inflation.      When this is allowed for, the total marginal tax rate on
                                                                       1
corporations and their dep:>sitors is approximately 54 Fercent.


l'Ihis assumes that demand dep:>sits account for 38% of total bank liabilities
 and that the marginal tax rate on the dep:>sitors at commercial banks is 25
  percent.
                                        -22-




Mutual Savings Banks.      In sorre cases, these banks pay the sane 48 percent

tax as ordinary corporations.      However, mutual savings banks ''lith a sufficient

fraction of their assets in the form of local rrortgages are allowed to exclude

a fraction of their portfolio incar€, a fraction that increases with the

rrortgage share.    The overall effective rate must also reflect the extent to

which mutual savings banks raise the interest rate they pay and the corresponding

marginal tax rate of their depositors.         We estimcl.te a 24 percent overall

rate for these institutions.

Life Insurance Companies:      Life insurance companies are taxed according to

the "M=nge Fonnula" or "ten-to-one rule" which allows insurance companies to

exclude a portion of the±r portfolio incx::xre before applying the 48 percent

corporat<~   tax rate (see Hu.eJ:ner,    1976 for a di-scussion of this tax rule) .

The procedure in the existing law is designed to separate investIrent income

into an anount required to rreet the funding requirements for existing insurance

and a residual profit that is deerred taxable.        'Ib achieve this, life insurance

companies pay tax on a percentage of incorre equal to ten ti.rres the difference

between the average nominal yield on the portfolio (i) and the nominal yield

that the insurance carnmissioners deem to be the appropriately conservative

yield to use in calculating required reserves(s).         Thus if the assets of the

insurance company (A) are invested at a nominal yield of i, the total tax

liability of the company is T=O.48LlO(i-sUiA.          The change in the effective

tax rate caused by inflation depends on how i and s adjust.          As we noted

above, 'the nominal market yield (i) generally rises point-for point for

expected inflation.     In contrast, the regulatory authorities have not altered

s in response to inflation; historically, s has remained close to 3 percent

for the past 70 years.      The marginal tax rate implied by this tax fonnula for
                                      -23-




increases in the interest rate is an increasing function of the initial

rrarginal tax rate.   Evaluating the marginal tax rate at the relatively
                                                                       1
conservative value of i=0.07 i..nplies a marginal tax rate of 0.57.        We

use this value to be conservative; at higher initial interest yields, the

effective marginal tax would be even greater.      Note we are also conservative

in ignoring the tax paid on dividends and retained earnings of the non-mutual

life insurance companies.


Finance Companies and other Insurance:       These are taxed liked ordinary

corporations.   Corrbining the 48 percent corporate rate with the additional

tax on dividends and retained earnings yields an overall marginal tax

rate of 57.1 Percent on this type of incane.

<bveTI'lIrEl1t: We asStmE that goveTI'lIrEl1t neither pays taxes on interest

receipts nor deducts expenses for tax purposes.       While increases in interest

receipts may enable goverrurents to reduce other taxes, there is no reason

to suppose that capital taxes will be reduced.       M::>reover, other costs

of goveTI'lIrEl1t are increased by raising interest rates.




~te that at i=.07, -a $1,000 portfolio earns $70. '(.<Jith s=.O;3 only 40 percent
 of this or $28 is taxed; the tax is $13.44 and the net incane is therefore
 $56.56. Raising the interest rate to i=.08"implies earnings of $80 but 50 percent
 or $40 is taxable. The tax is thus $19.20, leaving a net income of $60.80.
 Note that an extra $10 of gross interest raises net interest incane by only
 $4.24. The effective marginal tax rate is thus 57.6 percent.
                                     -24-
Miscellaneous:     The interest on th~se assets are assumed to be untaxed.       Note that

 "miscellaneous" includes assets and liabilities of the rest of the world so

our no-tax assumption implies that no taxes are paid to either' the U. S.      Or'    to

 foreign governments by foreigners owning bonds of     u.s.   cOrpOrations.   It is

 clear that our asst:UT1f:>tion that all of this incane is untaxed is very conservative.

             In order to calculate the marginal tax rate on interest incane,

we have averaged the marginal tax ratES shown in the final raw of Table 3, weight-

ing by the share of debt awned .. a::lass of investors share of debt.    The results

 imply a marginal rate of 0.420 on interest income.

            This implies that inflation raises the taxation of interest income,

 since the tax rate that lenders pay exceeds that at which corporations

 deduct.   Allowing in the overall calculation for the impact of inflation' on

 debt thus actually strengthens the conclusion that inflation raises the

effective taxation of capital incarre.      This effect is, however, quite

 small.    It is equal to 1.6 percent of net interest payrrents (the difference


between the 42.0 percent of lenders and the 40.4 percent of corporate

borrowers or about a half billion dollars per year.) This is dwarfed by

the depreciation and inventory effects described in the previous section.

           While several of our estimated marginal tax rates are only

approximate, they pertain to relatively snaIl arrounts of debt.       It is unlikely

that a rrore exact estimate of these n'l.lITbers would alter our basic conclusion

that the tax on those who lend to corporationsis at least as great as the

rate at -which corporations and their owners can deduct interest payrrents.

3.   The Increased Taxation of Corporate Source Income
                                                                                   1
     The first section of this paper presented calculations of the excess tax
paid by corporations because of the mismeasurement of depreciation and
inventories.   The current section extends that calculation in three significant
ways to obtain the total increased tax on corporations, on equity CMners and on
all sources of capital for nonfinancial corporations.
     Our calculations shCM that inflation raised the total tax on the income of
nonfinancial corporations by $32.3 billion.    This arvmmt is substantially greater
than the $ 26.1 billion additional tax paid by cOrPOrations themselves because of the
mismeasurement of depreciation and inventory profits.


     This section begins by analyzing the several effects of inflation in 1977.
Estimates for the years since 1954 are then presented.

3.1 An Analysis for 1977

     We proceed in three steps to calculate the total excess taxes on corporate
source income in 1977.   We first calculate the excess tax paid by the cor-
poration itself, recognizing the effect of not taxing the real· gains on debt as

well as the effect on depreciation and inventory profits.    We then extend this
to obtain the total excess tax paid by equity CMners, including the effect on
the tax liabilities of the corporations and the shareholders.    Finally, we
extend the calculation to the total excess tax including the tax paid by those
who lend to the nonfinancial corporations.
     The calculations in section 1 shCMed that historic cost depreciation and

the existing inventory accounting practices added $ 26.1 billion to the 1977 tax
liabilities of nonfinancial corporations.     In 1977 these corporations had net

     lThroughout this section the term "excess taxation" refers to the addi-
tional taxes paid because of inflation.

interest bearing liabilities l of $ 592.2 billion and non-interest bearing
assets (primarily cash and net accounts receivable 2) of $ 130.9 billion.          The-i r

net nominal liabilities were thus $ 461.3 billion.       Since the 1977 inflation
rate was 6.8 percent (the December to December increase in the Cpr), these
corporations had a real gain of $ 31. 1+ billion on their net liabilities.         Excluding

the gain from the corporations' taxable income saved them $ 15.1 billion in
corporate tax.   These tax savings thus offset approximately one-half of the
$ 26.0 billion of extra tax caused by the existing tax treatment of

inventories and debt.      Inflation caused corporations to pay an extra tax of
$ 11.0 billion in 1977.

     The extra tax paid by the equity owners of the corporations differs in
two ways from the extra tax paid by the corporations.       First, as we
discussed earlier, the extra tax paid a: the corporate level leaves less
income to be taxed as dividends.     With a dividend payout rate of 0.46 and
effective marginal tax rates of .287 on dividends and 0.047 on retained ear-
nings, the $ 11.0 billion of extra corporate tax reduces shareholders own
taxes by $ 1. 7 billion.    Second, the shareholders IIDlSt eventually pay capi-
tal gain tax on the nominal increase in the market value of the company that
results from inflation.     Since this   n~ninal   increase in value is over and
above the real increase due to retained earnings the extra tax paid on this
nominal gain represents an unwarranted extra tax.       We shall assume that the
ratio of the market value to the real value of the corporation remains

constant and that the nominal gain can be approximated by the product of the


     ISee section 2 for a description of the composition of this net amount.
Note that $ 592.2 billion is net of the interest bearing assets of these firms.
     2These assets also include Treasury bills and other federal government
securities that bear interest since the important distinguishing feature of
these "non-interest bearing assets" is that private individuals and institutions
do not pay any interest on them.

inflation rate and the real value of oorporate assets.! The relevant

marginal rate of tax on these accrued nominal gains is the effective capital
gains tax rate of 0.047.    The real value of the physical assets of these
corporations (plant and equipment, inventories and land)2 in 1977 was
$1,68 Lf billion. The inflation rate of 6.8 percent and the tax rate of 0.047

imply an additional capital gain tax of $ 5.3 billion.     'The   tota1 excess tax
on the equity owners of the nonfinancial oorporations is therefore the sum

of three terms:   the $ ·11. 0 billion of extra oorporate income tax minus the
$ 1.7 billion resulting reduction in personal taxes plus the capital gains

tax of $ 5.3 billion.    Inflation thus induced a net extra tax of $ 14.6
billion on ooporations and their owners in 1977.

     To obtain the total excess taxation of oorporate source income that is
caused by inflation, the overtaxation of ooporate creditors must be added to
this $ 14.6 billion.    .The f!et financial capital supplied by the creditors of
these corporations was $ 595.2 billion. 3 The inflation rate of 6.8 per-

cent imposed a real loss of $ 40.3·billion that should have been offset

against the interest income of the creditors.     The effective marginal tax
rate of 0.420 on interest inoome implies an excess taxation of $ 17.7
billion.

     Combining this $17.7 billion with the $14.6 billion implies an excess tax

on corporations and their owners that yields a total excess       tax   on corporate
source income of $32.3
-----~e actual nominal gain ca~sed by inflation is very hard to disengage
from other changes in market value. Theoretical oonsiderations imp~y that a
change in the expected rate of inflation will cause an inverse change in the
market valuation ratio which then slowly returns to its equilibrium value (See
Feldstein, 1978).

     2The data came from Von, Furstenberg (1977).

     3we ignore the corpOrate assets in the form of government securities and
net accounts receivable because these do not represent the supply of financial
capital by private investors.

billion.   This excess tax on corporate source income was 54 percent of the
corporate income tax liabilities of $ 59.0 billion and 35.0 percent of the
combined corporate, shareholder and lender tax liabilities of $ 93 billion.
Stated in yet a different way, the excess tc:iX of $32.3 billion caused by
inflation is equivalent to an additional wealth tax or capital levy of 2 percent
on the real corporate assets of $ l68li billion.       Since these corporations earn
                                                   1
between 10 and 12 percent on their real assets ,this extra tax absorbs
between one-sixth and one-fifth of pretax real earnings.

3.2 The Period Since 1954
     This same framework can be used to calculate the excess tax caused by
inflation in each year since 1954.   Since we do not have a detailed flow of
funds calculation of the sort presented in section 2 for each year, we shall
use the same effective marginal tax rates for all years.       The calculations
therefore represent the excess tax that would have been caused for each year
if the 1976 statutory tax rates and composition of creditors and debtors had
prevailed; differences due to using actual statutory rates and ownership
information would be small relative to the differences 'over time caused by
the changing history of inflation.
     Table 4 traces the evolution of the inflation-generated excess taxation
of corporate source income between 1954 and 1977.       Column 2 repeats the
figures from Table 1, column 7, of the excess tax at the corporate level due
to the mismeasurement of depreciation and inventory profits.       The corporate
tax savings due to ignoring the real gains on net corporate debt are pre-
sented in column 3.   It is worth noting that the excess tax due to the
mismeasurement of depreciation and inventory profits always exceeds the tax
savings on the debt gains.   The net excess at the corporate level, presented

in column 4, remains relatively low (less than $ 5 billion) until 1974 when
it jumped to $ 8.7 billion.
        The reduced taxation of dividends and retained earnings due to higher
corporate tax payments is     shown in column 5 and the capital gains tax
liability on the nominal capital gains caused by inflation is     shown in
column 6.     Combining columns 4, 5, and 6 gives the net increase in the taxation
of equity capital presented in column 7.     This excess tax on equity income
remained less the $ 5 billion until 1970 but has exceeded $ 10 billion annually
since 1974.     The excess tax on equity income since 1970 has totalled more than
$ 80 billion.

        Column 8 presents the very important excess tax on the individuals and
institutions that provide debt capital to the nonfinancial corporations.        This
excess tax on lenders reached $ 5.0 billion in 1968 and exceeded $ 15 billion in
1973.     The excess tax on those who lent to nonfinancial corporations has
exceeded over $ 100 billion in the brief period from 1970 to 1977.
        The total excess tax on corporate source income caused by inflation is
shown in column 9.     Three things should be noted about these figures.     First,
this total excess tax caused by inflation exceeds the excess tax paid by cor-
porations because of the mismeasurement of depreciation and inventory profits
(column 2).     FOcusing exclusively on the extra corporate taxes paid because of
the mismeasurement of depreciation and inventory profits is therefore a conser-
vative evaluation of the total inflationary bnpact.      Second, the total excess
tax remained less than $ 5 billion a year until 1966, doubled by 1970 and then
doubled again by 1973.     The excess tax has exceeded $ 20 billion a year since
1973.     Third, the total excess tax on coqx>rate source income has exceeded $ 180
billion in the period between 1970 and 1977.

       Finally, column 10 states the total excess tax on corporate source income
as a percentage of the corporate tax liability.    Although the excess tax
remained less than one-sixth of corporate income tax payments until the
mid-1960's, it then quickly rose to more than one-third of the corporate income
tax.    For the final five years, the excess tax payments have been more than 50
percent of corporate tax liabilities.

4.    The Effective Tax Rate on Corporate Source Income

            This section presents our estimates of the total effective tax

rate on the real capital income earned in the cOrPOrate sector.     Our

calculations show that the total tax on corporate source incorre in 1977,

including the tax liabilities of shareholders and lenders as well as of

the corporations themselves,· was $ 91.8 billion, an effective tax rate

of 67 percent on the real pretax incane of the nonfinancial corPOrate

sector.    The data shov.7 that this 67 percent represents a substantial increase

in the effective tax rate over the past decade and a return to the effective

tax rates of the mid-1950's.

            The substantial increase in the effective tax rate despite statutory

reductions reflects the i.:rrpact of inflation.   The $32.3 billion of extra tax

caused by inflation in 1977 accounts for rrore than one-third of the total tax

on corporate source incare, raising the effective total tax rate from 43 Percent

to 66 percent.    The extra tax caused by inflation has thus offset all of the

accelerated depreciation and other legislated tax reductions during the past

two decades.

4.1    The Effective Tax Rate in 1977

            The best rreasure of the tax burden on corPOrate source incorre is the

ratio of the total tax Paid on such incorre - including the taxes paid by share-

holders and lenders as well as by the corPOrations - to the total real incorre

available before tax for the shareholders and creditors.     The official national
incane estimate of 1977 profits with the inventory valuation adjustment and

capital consumption adjustrrent was $113.9 billion.    Net nominal interest paYrrents

. by nonfinancial cOrPOrations were $33.7 billion.    It seems at first that the

total pretax income available for shareholder ,and creditors could be obtained
                                    -33-




by simply adding these adjusted profits     and net interest on the grOl.md$

that it isunnecessary to adjust interest payn:ents for inflation since any

correction to naninal interest expenses by the corporation would require

an equal correction to nominal receipts by creditors.     Ai though this is

a generally   co~ect   principle, one further m:xlification is required.   A

significant fraction of the corporations' financial assets are not liabilities

of investors but of the governrrent or of the corporations' custaners.     Hhen

inflation lowers the real value of these assets, the loss to the corporations

is a gain to the governrrent and to the corporations' custaners and not to

individual or institutional investors.     The corporations' loss on these

financial assets should therefore be subtracted from other corporate profits.

In 1977, these assets were $130.9 billion; the inflationary loss was therefore

$8.9 billion.   The 1977 total pretax corporate sector income available for

shareholders and creditors was therefore $138.7 billion.

          Our estimated total tax of $91.8 billion on this inCOll'e consists of

five components. (1) The largest of these is the corporate incane tax payrrents

of $59.0 billion.   This alone represents an effective tax rate of 42.5 percent

on total corporate source inCOll'e. (2) Dividends in 1977 were $39.1 billion; an

effective tax rate of 0.287 on dividends implies a tax liability of $1,1.2
        1
billion and adds 8.1 percent to the effective tax rate. (3) The national income

account estimate of $16.0 billion of retained earnings 2 ignores the real gain

on outstanding debt.    With a net debt of $461.3 billion and a 6.8 percent

inflation rate, the additional real retained earnings were $31.4 billion.


lThis calculation uses our estimated marginal tax rate on dividends to :rreasure the
 average tax rate on dividends. This causes an overstatement of the tax
 liability but the error is likely to be very small.

 inventory valuation and capital consumption adjust::rrents.

The total retained earnings of $47.4 billion are eventually subject to

capital gains taxation with an effective tax rate of 0.047; this adds

$2.2 billion to the total tax and 1. 6 percent to the effective tax rate.

(4) An additional~ _ capital gains, ,tax liability results from the nominal

increase in the value of corporate assets that accarpanies a general rise

in the price level.   We abstract fran the particular market fluctuations

of 1977 and calculate that the real capital st.ock with an initial value of

$1,684 billion rose by 6.8 percent.     With a tax rate of4. 7 percent, this

naninal increase implies an effective tax of $5.4 billion, adding 3.9 percent

to the total effective tax rate.    (5) Finally, the nominal interest payrrents

of $33.7 billion were taxable incane of the creditors. With a tax rate of

0.42, these interest percents involve a tax liability of $14.2 billion, adding
                                          2
10.2 percent to the effective tax rate.       The total of these five figures

of tax payments is thus' $92.0 billion for a total effective tax rate of

66.3 percent.

          Before turning to a comparison of 1977 with earlier years, it is useful

to contrast the actual effective tax rate of 66.3 percent with several alterna-

tive rates that are frequently cited.     Perhaps the rrost comrron measure of

the corporate tax burden is the ratio of the $59.0 billion corporate incorre

tax to the conventionally rreasured corporate profits of $143.5 billion;
the resulting rate af 4i.l is a gross underestimate of the actual'total rate.

An alternative and rrore sophisticated rate is the ratio. of the corporate



~e  are again using an estimated marginal tax rate as an average tax rate
 on this incorre. This causes serre overstatement, particularly for life
 insurance canpanies. Adjusting this to use an average rather than marginal
 taxLrate for life'insurance campa:hies might reduce the tax by up to $2 billion
 dollars.

incorre tax to    the sum of 9Orporate profits with the inventory valuation

and capital consumption adjustrnents ($113.9 billion) plus the real gains

on the net corporate debt ($31.4 billion)   i   the resulting ratio of 40.6

percent is again less than two thirds of the total burden.       These

calculations underline the imp:)rtance of looking beyond the corporation

to the shareholders and creditors in order to obtain a correct picture of

total tax burdens on capital used in the corporate sector.

4.2   Variations in the Effective 'Ibtal Tax Rate Since 1954

           Table 5 traces the variations in the effective total tax rate

on corporate capital since 1954.     The total real incOme presented in

column 1 is the sum of real profits as rreasured by the national incorre

statistics and net nominal interest paym2l1.ts with an adjuSbnent for corporate

losses on gove:rnrrent assets and net accounts receivable.

           Actual corporate tax liabilities as a percentage of this total

real incorre have declined nearly one fifth since the mid-1950' s.       ~breover,

there has been no increase at all in this ratio between 1970 and 1977.

           The varying taxes on shareholders and creditors in columns 3 through

6 reflect variations in dividends, full retained earnings, inflationary

appreciation, and interest paym2l1.ts.   The same 197 7 effective tax rates are

ass'l.llred for each tax base; allowing for statutory changes would raise taxes

on dividends and interest inC()f(E in the earlier years and reduce the taxes

on retained earnings and inflationary appreciation in those years but these

effects would be relatively small.

           The net result of these char:lges is shown in the total effective

tax rate presented in column 7.    Despite the decline in the relative corporate

mid-1950's.   The effect of inflation has been powerful enough to offset

the introduction of the inves1::Irent tax credit, the cuts in the corporate

tax rate, and the rrore rapid acceleration of depreciation.

5.   Inflation and Corporate Tax Liabilities in Two-Digit      r.1a.nufacturing Industries

           Although historic cost depreciation and existing accounting practices

raise the tax liabilities of all corporations,. their :i.rnpJrtance varies sub-

stantially arrong different industries.     The current section presents informa-

tion for each of the twenty 2-digit manufacturing industries.       For manufacturing

as a Whole, the additional taxes in 1976     c~used   by historic cost depreciation

and existing accounting practices accounted for slightly nore than half of all

the federal tax liabilities of these finns.      These additional taxes varied

from less than 25 percent of actual taxes in a few industries to 100 percent

of the taxes Paid in several others.      If the taxes are expressed as a percentage

of the real value of capital used in these industries, the additional tax

varies from less than one percent of capital to nearly three percent of

capital.     The very high tax rates that result in several of the industries

make,' it particularly difficult for them to compete for capital.       If these

additional tax burdens persist, the allocation of capital among manufacturing

industries vvill be substantially distorted by inflation.

           Our analysi$ of the additional tax burdens of individual in-

dustries is based on information supplied by individual firms in their

annual reports and lO-K fonus.     Beginning with 1976, the Securities

.and Exchange Camnission has required the largest f inns to supply in-

formation on replacement cost depreciation and on inflation-adjusted

inventory gains as well as on historic cost depreciation and on their

inventory profits as they are used for tax PUrposes.        We use the differences

between the inflation-adjusted and the unadjusted figures for depreciation

and inventories to measure the overstatement of taxable profits.        For each
                                          -39-




industry, we then compare the total additional tax liabilities implied by

these overstated profits with the actual tax liabilities paid by the finns

in our sample.     We also calculate the additional tax payrrents as a

percentage of the real value of the capital used by the sample finns
                   1
in the industry.       . Finally, we use the' ratio of sales by the sample finns

to sales by all fi:r:msin the industry to estimate the total additional taxes

caused in each industry in 1976 by historic cost depreciation and by prevailing
accounting rrethods.
           AI. though the general approach of these calculations parallels

.the analysis of section 1,     the~e   are several differences that should 'be

borne in mind in inte:rpreting the results.        First, the infonnation supplied

by the fi:r:ms represents consolidated accounts and not just the darestic

activities that were analyzed in section 1.         Because -we are forced to

include the overseas        depreciation and inventory gains, we overstate the

extent of overtaxation.                     ,
                              Second, the firms provide the historic
                                                                  .  cost

depreciation and replacerrent cost depreciation as altemative measures of

"book" depreciation rather than "tax'" depreciation.        Since the straight-line

"book" depreciation is less than the accelerated "tax" depreciation, this

procedure causes us to understate the extent of overtaxation.         The net

effect of these two countervailing biases cannot be detennined from the

existing data but is unlikely to be large enough to distort the conclusions

of the analysis.

           The sample of firms for which we have infonnation represents

approximately 50 percent of the total sales of manufacturing firms.         Because



~stimates of the replacerrent cost value of plant, equipment and inventories
 are also required by the SEC.
                                   --40-


of the nature of the S.E.C. requirenent, the sample consists exclusively

of large firms.   M)reover, the coverage varies substantially am:mg the

industries with a very much smaller fraction of sales in the samples for

some industries than for others.    The tables in this section indicate

the nurriber of firms in each sample and the fraction of sales that the

sample firms represent. l

            Table 6 presents information on the extent of reduced

depreciation and the consequent additional taxation.      The first two colUIl'U1s

show the number of firms in the sample and the percentage of the total

industry sales accounted for by the sample firms.      The third colUIl'U1 shows

the understaterrent of depreciation, i.e., the difference between replacement

cost depreciation and historic cost depreciation.      The additional tax

liability presented in colUIl'U1 4 is calculated by surrming (for all the sample

firms in the industry) 0.48 t..i.rres each firm's understatErl depreciation up to

the limit of the tax actually   Paia by the firm.   Note that this is a very

conservative staterrent of the additional tax for any firm in which the

limit constrains our calculated arrount because it assumes that no additional

profits would have been earned even at a zero tax rate and disregards the

possibility of loss carry forwards.    ColUIl'U1 5 expresses the additional tax

as a percentage of the total federal tax liability of the firms in the sample

while colUIl'U1 6 states the additional tax liability as a percentage of the
                                                             2

  2500 firms prepared by Standard and Poors. The 1332 manufacturing firms
  in this file represent 1976 sales of $1,052 billion or 87 percent of all
 manufacturing sales as estimated by the Federal Trade Conmission. We use the
 Campustat file to estimate total sales by industry in order to be sure that
  firms are classified by industry in the sarre v-Jay as in our replacement cost
  sample.

columns are estimates for all the finns in the industry and not just the

by the ratio of total industry sales to sales in the sample.

           The related importance of the additional taxes that resulted from the

understatement of depreciation varied substantially arcong the 20 inGlividual fudus-

tries.     Column 5 shows that these additional taxes repJ;:'esented less than on-sixth

of actual 1976 tax liabilities in six of the twenty industries.       These are

primarily non-durable goods (tobacco, apparel, printing and publishing, and

leather and footwear) but also include the non-electrical machinery and

instruments industries).     At the other extreme, there are four industries

in which the additional tax represents rrore than three-fourths of actual

tax liabilities: primary metals, rubber, paper, and wood products.

           A similar picture of very substantial variation emerges when the

additional taxation is related to the replacement cost value of the finns'

real capital stock (column 6).  The additional tax varies fran 0.4 percent
                                                         1
of the real capital stock in the primary metals industry and· 0.5 percent

in the non-electrical machinery industry to 2.0 percent in the paper in-.

dustry and 2.4 percent in the wood products industry.

           Fbr :m::mufacturing as a whole, the reduction in real depreciation

totalled $18.0 billion or half of the reduction for all nonfinancial corpora-

tions that was discussed in section 1.       Nondurable goods industries (SIC codes

20 through 29) accounted for 58 percent of this reduced depreciation or $10.4

billion.    Reduced depreciation in durable goods industries     (SIC codes 30 through

39. was $7.6 billion.     The additional tax caused by the understatement of


IT.his tax is kept so low because the extra tax is assurred to be no greater than
 actual taxes paid which, in the case of primary metals, were kept low by ex-
  tremely 10\\7 real profits.
                                       -44-




depreciation was $7.6 billion, of which $4.9 billion was in nondurable

goods industries and $2. 7 billion was in durable'. goods industries.

            Table 7 presents the combined effects of reduced depreciation

and overstated inventory profits. The organization of the table Parallels

that of Table 6.    The results presented in coltnTln 5 shCM very substantial

variation arrong industries in the importance of the extra tax as a percentage

of actual taxes Paid.     In two of the industries (leather and non-electrical

machinery), the extra tax arrounted to less than 25 percent of the actual

tax Paid.    In contrast, four of the industries (wood and wood products; paper;

rubber; and steel) would have paid no tax if depreciation had been calculated

at replacement cost and if the artificial inventory profits were also

eliminated. ColtnTln 6 confinns the picture of substantial variation arrong

industries by canparing the additional tax to the replacement value of the

real capital stock.     The extra tax paid (as limited by the total tax paid)

varied fran less than one Percent of the capital stock on the primary metals and

non-electrical machinery industries to nearly three percent of the capital

stock in the food industry and in textiles.


            For all manufacturing industries, the mismeasurerrent of depreciation

and inventories totaled $27.1 billion or 54 percent of the aggregate reported

for all nonfinancial corporations in section 1.    "Of this $27.1 billion total,

58 percent was accounted for by nondurable manufacturing. Note that this

58 percent is the sane as the figure for depreciation only, implying that the

mismeasurements of inventories and depreciation are distributed in the same

way.   The additional taxation for manufacturing finns totalled $11.3 billion,

of which $7.4 billion was in the nondurable qoods industries.

 6.   Conclusion

            The tax laws of the United States were designed for an economy

 with little or no inflation.     The analysis in this paper has shown that, with

 the existing tax laws, inflation substantially increases the effective tax

 rate on capital income in the nonfinancial corporate sector.        In contrast

 to earlier studies of the inpact of inflation on corporate tax burdens,

 we have considered not only the tax paid by the corporations themselves

 but also the taxes paid by the individ1..k11s una instjtutions t-h."lt snpply (;(1pttr]

to the corporate sector.     This is particularly LlpOl.-taut for a correct

treat:Irent of corporate debt; our calculations indicate that the additionul

tax paid by lenders because of inflation is actually slightly greater than
the taxel? that corporate borrowers save by deducting higher ila";rl.nal interest

paynents.

            The overall effect of inflation with existing tax laws       ~vas    to

raise the real 1977 Lax burden on corporate sector capital incarre by :rrore than

$32 billion.   This extra tax represented 69 perce..""lt of the real after-tax

capital inca:ne of the nonfinancial corporate sector, including retained earnings               I




dividends, and the real interest receipts of the corporations I creditors.            The

extra tax raised the total tax burden on nonfinancial corporate capital inCOIre

by rrore than one-half of its noninflation value, raising the total effective tax

rate from 43 percent to 66 percent.

            The substantial i.lcrease in the effective tax rate on capital used

in·-the nonfin.cmcial corporate sector can influe..'1ce the }?erfonnance of the

economy in a number of irnt-ortant ways.    The lIDSt obvious of these is a       ~-edLlction

in the rate of capital fonnation in responsGto the reduction in         "b.~e   real after
             ,
tax rctm:n . ..L

lAlthough this reduction cannot be unambigously established, in any realistic
 life cycle rrodel a lower net return will reduce private saving (Surrmers, 1978).
 S<JIre preliminary empirical evidence tends to support this view (Baskin, 1978).

            Moreover, -since the tax rules that we have emphasized do not apply

 to residential real estate, the canbination of inflation and existing tax rules

 will encourage a redis ~iLution of invest:Irent away fran the corporat.e s€ctcr

 and to residential construction and consumsr durables.          Within total corporate

 invest:rne:i1t, existing tax rules will induce firros to invest i,Dre in inventories

 and less in equip:rent and structures.

            The evidence on individual manufacturing industries presented in

 section 5 shows that there' is substantial variation unong industries to the
 extent to which inflation has caused greater tax burdens.          In   sarre industries,
 the addi ticnal tax induced by inflation accOlmts for less        tha;.-;, 25   percent of

 actual taxes paid, in other indu03tr.i.es, the additional tax induced by inflation

 is, responsible for the entire actual tax payrrent.        The additional tax varies

 fran less than one-half perCGnt of the real capital in two industries to nearly

 3 percent in others.   Thus   substa..~tiCll   variation implies a further source of

 capital misallocations arrong individual industries within the everallrnanufacturing

 sector.
