Evidence that Seat Belts are as Effective as Child Safety Seats in Preventing Death for Children
Aged Two and Up

                                             ABSTRACT




Over the last thirty years, the use of child safety seats in motor vehicles has increased dramatically,
fueled by well publicized information campaigns and legal mandates. In spite of this movement,
there is relatively little empirical evidence regarding the efficacy of child safety seats relative to the
much cheaper alternative of traditional seat belts. Using data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting
System (FARS) on all fatal crashes in the United States from 1975-2003, I find that child safety
seats, in actual practice, are no better than seat belts at reducing fatalities among children aged 2-6.
This result is robust to a wide range of sensitivity analyses, including controlling for sample selection
that arises because the FARS data set includes only crashes in which at least one fatality occurs.

         The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that

child safety seats have saved over 6,000 lives between 1975 and 2003, including over 400 in

2003 (Kahane 2004, Starnes 2005). In response to the apparent life-saving benefits of car seats,

an expanding set of state and national regulations have been put into place. All 50 states

currently require that children ride in approved safety seats. The required ages and weights up to

which a child must use a safety seat vary by state, but have been steadily increasing over time

(Insurance Institute for Highway Safety 2004). As a consequence, child safety seat usage has

increased dramatically. Child safety seats have been heralded as one of the most successful

safety innovations of recent decaces (Kahane 1986), with benefit-cost ratio estimates as high as

thirty-two to one (Children’s Safety Network 1996). According to the 1997 Census of

Manufactures, more than four million child car seats were purchased in 1997, with an estimated

cost to consumers of more than $300 million.

         Given the widespread use of child safety seats and the substantial consumer expenditure

on them, there is relatively little systematic empirical research evaluating their effectiveness,

most of it done by NHTSA researchers (Kahane 1986, Partyka 1988, Hertz 1996). All of these

studies find that child safety seats greatly reduce injuries relative to passengers who ride

unrestrained. 2

         Often overlooked in the public discussion of the safety of child passengers is the


2
  Based on sled tests with crash test dummies and accounting for the mix of correctly and incorrectly used child
safety seats in 1984, Kahane (1986) estimates that safety seats reduced both fatalities and hospitalizations by 46
percent relative to children riding unconstrained. Partyka (1988) and Hertz (1996) each use a “double pairs”
comparison to evaluate restraint effectiveness. The ratio of driver fatalities to child passenger fatalities in which the
child is restrained is compared to the ratio of driver to child passenger deaths when the child is unrestrained. This
double pairs analysis does not condition on any additional variables except whether the driver is wearing a seat belt
and whether the child is seated in the back seat. Partyka (1988), using data from 1982 to 1987, estimates that child
safety seats are 69 percent effective in reducing fatalities of infants and 47 percent effective in reducing fatalities for
children aged 1-4. Hertz (1996), using a similar methodology but later data, finds that child safety seats reduce
fatalities of infants by 71 percent and 58 percent in cars and light trucks/vans respectively relative to riding
unrestrained. For children aged 1-4 the corresponding numbers are 54 and 59 percent.



                                                                                                                          1
availability of traditional seat belts as a substitute for child car seats, except for very young

children. When NHTSA computes lives saved from child safety seats, for instance, the assumed

counterfactual is one in which all children are completely unrestrained. Unlike child car seats,

which represent a substantial incremental expense (carrying a typical retail price between $50

and $300), lap and shoulder belts have been standard equipment in the front seat of all passenger

vehicles manufactured since 1974. Some form of seat belt – either lap and shoulder belts or just

lap belts – are available in the back seats of all recent vehicles.3

         In previous studies published by NHTSA, the point estimates on seat belts suggest they

are less effective than child safety seats (Kahane 1986, Partyka 1988, Hertz 1996).4 There are a

number of important caveats, however, on this prior research. First, these studies combine cases

in which a child uses a lap and shoulder belt with instances of using lap-only belts, which in

theory are less beneficial. Second, the estimates include children as young as one year old, for

whom seat belts are likely to be especially ill-fitting. Third, no standard errors are reported in

these earlier studies. When I replicate their analyses, I cannot reject the null hypothesis of equal

coefficients on seat belts and child safety seats due to substantial standard errors.5

         The raw data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) database covering the

universe of fatal motor vehicle crashes in the United States over the period 1975-2003 further

calls into question the effectiveness of car seats relative to seat belts when one restricts the

3
 Tarbet (2004) estimates that the cost of a seat belt to an automobile manufacturer is roughly $25, well below the
wholesale cost of a child safety seat. Moreover, existing child safety seats only work using the seat belts installed in
the car, so seat belts are a necessary input to child safety seats anyway.
4
  Kahane (1986) found that lap-only seat belts reduced fatalities of children by 33 percent relative to those who were
unrestrained, and hospitalizations by 50 percent. Partyka (1988) estimates that seat belts are 36 percent effective in
reducing fatalities among children aged 4 and under. Hertz (1996) reports that seat belts are 47 percent effective on
children aged 1-4 in passenger cars and 48 percent effective on the same age group in light trucks and vans.
5
  For instance, in replicating Hertz (1996), I obtain bootstrapped standard errors of .06 on the child car seat estimate
for 1-4 year olds and .05 on the seat belt estimate for that same age. It is also worth noting that I have been unable
to precisely replicate the findings of these earlier papers; in all cases, I obtain slightly smaller gaps between child
safety seats and seat belts.



                                                                                                                      2
sample to the age groups for which there is substantial overlap in the use of car seats and seat

belts (ages 2-6). Table 1 reports injury severity outcomes by type of restraint used for children

aged 2-6 riding in passenger vehicles that are involved in accidents with at least one fatality.6

Nearly 30 percent of the children who are unrestrained die in these crashes. In comparison, 18.3

percent of children in child safety seats die. The death rate among children using lap and

shoulder belts is slightly higher in the raw data, at 19.2 percent. Those using lap belts only, on

the other hand, experience slightly lower death rates of 16.7 percent. The other rows of Table 1,

which correspond to lesser injuries, suggest that child safety seats may somewhat outperform

seat belts in terms of the types of non-fatal injuries sustained.

         There are many reasons why the raw crash data might provide misleading estimates of

the causal impact of child safety seat and seat belt usage. First, crash severity, vehicle type, and

other circumstances may systematically vary across children using different types of restraints

and unrestrained children. Second, there have been substantial technological improvements in

both child safety seats and seat belts over the last three decades. A comparison of their average

effectiveness over the entire sample may differ substantially from the benefits afforded by the

currently available technology. Third, the FARS database includes only crashes in which a

fatality occurs. If the use of a child restraint affects the probability a child dies, and there are no

other fatalities resulting from the crash, then there is sample selection with respect to which

crashes are included in the data (Levitt and Porter 2001).

         In this paper, I carry out the most thorough analysis to date of the effectiveness of child

safety seats and seat belts in saving children’s lives and reducing injury severity in motor vehicle

crashes. The analysis controls for a wide range of observable individual, vehicle-level, and crash-

the data appendix.



                                                                                                                        3
level characteristics. Inclusion of these control variables, however, does little to alter the basic

conclusion that emerges in the raw data regarding fatalities.

         In actual practice, child safety seats do not appear to provide any reduction in fatality risk

relative to traditional lap and shoulder seat belts for children aged two and up. 7 Furthermore,

once controls are included, the apparent reduction in injuries when using car seats vis-à-vis seat

belts largely disappears. These results are robust to a wide range of sensitivity analyses,

including limiting the sample to crashes in recent years, particular types of vehicles and crash

impacts, and focusing only on safety restraints which are being properly used according to police

reports. The results continue to hold when the sample is restricted to two-car crashes in which

someone in the other vehicle dies, which eliminates sample selection bias under quite general

assumptions, as demonstrated in Levitt and Porter (2001).

         In light of these findings, there appears to be little justification for the legal requirements

mandating the use of child safety seats for children aged two and up, as opposed to providing

parents the flexibility of using either child safety seats or seat belts. Current annual expenditures

on child safety seats for children aged two and up in the United States is in the hundreds of

millions of dollars, an investment that appears to provide limited safety benefit. Moreover,

because of the current requirements that children be place in safety seats, existing seat belts have

not been optimized for use on young children. One could imagine that, absent the existing car

seat laws, car manufacturers could equip new vehicles with seatbelts designed to more

comfortably and effectively accommodate child passengers at relatively low cost.

         A second result of the paper is that the benefits in terms of reduced death and injury of


7
 I have also looked at the one-year olds. Because few one-year olds wear adult seat belts, the estimates are quite
imprecise. It should be noted, however, that the point estimate on child safety seats is greater than the point estimate
on either form of seat belts for one year olds, which is consistent with child safety seats providing better protection
for children under the age of two.



                                                                                                                      4
moving children from the front seat to the back seat are substantially smaller than the

corresponding benefit to adults of moving to the back seat. This finding raises the question of

whether the absence of legal rules and public awareness campaigns about the danger of front

seats for adults is due to a difference in the relative utility associated with adults riding in the

front seat versus the back seat, or a lack of awareness of the risks borne by adult passengers

riding in the front seat.

        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section I briefly reviews the history

and background on child safety seats and seat belts. Section II describes the estimation approach

and the data used in the analysis. Section III presents the basic empirical results. Section IV

explores whether sample selection in the set of crashes that are included in the data set affects the

results. Section V analyzes non-fatal injuries and estimates parallel specifications for adults.

Section VI concludes.



Section I: Background on Child Safety Seats

        The concept of the child safety seat was first introduced in the mid 1960s by car

manufacturers.8 In 1971, NHTSA issued the first federal safety standard addressing child safety

seats. Entitled FMVSS 213, it required that safety seats be anchored by the vehicle’s seat belts,

but did not initially have any requirements regarding performance in crash tests. In 1981,

FMVSS 213 was revised to require that the safety seat meet certain requirements in 30 mph

crash tests. In 1999, further stipulations related to the distance the head travels in crash tests and

requiring safety seats to have upper and lower tethers were added. FMVSS 225, also published

in 1999, requires motor vehicles to have anchors for attaching the tethers.


8
 The background information on car seats draws heavily on Kahane (1986, 2004) and Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety (2005). The interested reader is directed to these sources for greater detail on the subject.



                                                                                                               5
           Tennessee was the first state to mandate safety seats for young children in 1978. by

1985, every state in the country had enacted such laws. Over time, the statutory age at which

children have been allowed to “graduate” from child safety seats to seat belts has increased. As

of 2003, 44 states required children to be in safety seats at least until their fourth birthday. Since

that time, more than a dozen states have increased the age or weight requirement, extending the

population mandated to ride in safety seats.

           The fraction of children in car seats has paralleled the rise of laws requiring their use.

Kahane (1996) reports that only 16 percent of children under the age of four were restrained in

child safety seats in 1974, but Glassbrenner (2003) finds that by 2002, more than 82 percent of

children aged 1-3 were in car seats.9



Section II: Data and Estimation Approach

           The data used in this analysis are drawn from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System

(FARS) for the period 1975-2003.10 FARS contains detailed information on all vehicles and

passengers for the universe of motor vehicle crashes in which at least one person dies. Over the

period studied, there were more than 1.13 million fatal crashes involving more than 1.67 million

vehicles and 2.78 million individuals. Roughly 38% of the individuals in these crashes died.

Included in the FARS data is information on the type of restraint use by each vehicle occupant,

which distinguishes between lap-only seat belts, lap and shoulder seat belts, and child safety

seats.11


9
  Glassbrenner (2003) does not distinguish between backless booster seats and seat belts, and thus this estimate
understates the true use of car seats and booster seats
10
   FARS is the standard data source for analysis of motor vehicle fatalities. See, for instance, Evans (1986), Saffer
and Grossman (1987), Ruhm (1996), Braver et al. (1997), Lave and Elias (1997), Cohen and Dehejia (2004), and
Grabowski and Morrisey (2004).
11
   There are currently a wide variety of types of child safety seats in use (e.g. rear-facing, forward-facing, backless



                                                                                                                          6
         I restrict the data set in a number of dimensions. Crashes in which the only fatalities are

to pedestrians, motorcyclists, or occupants of non-standard vehicles (e.g. four-wheeled all-terrain

vehicles) are dropped from the sample. For the remaining crashes, the sample is limited to

occupants of automobiles, mini-vans, and sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) with model years later

than 1969. I drop individual records in which injury severity is unknown or missing, as well as

cases in which restraint use (i.e. child safety seat, lap belt, lap and shoulder belt, no restraint) is

missing. In addition, observations with unknown or missing values for age, gender, the hour of

the crash, the principle point of impact, the day of the week, or crashes in which the person was

not seated in one of the first three rows of the vehicle were dropped.

         The sample covers children aged two to six. Children under the age of two are almost

exclusively in child safety seats or unrestrained, and children over the age of six are rarely

observed in child safety seats in the data. Thus, only for the age range two to six are direct

comparisons of child safety seats and seat belts available. After these exclusions, and limiting

the ages in this manner, 37,635 observations remain.12

         To measure the relationship between restraint use and injury severity, I estimate linear

probability models of the form:13

                      R
          InjSevi = ∑ β r * ri + X i Γ + ε i                      (1)
                     r =1



where i and r index individuals and restraint types respectively. Restraint types ri are mutually



booster seats, etc). In addition there are dozens of car seat manufacturers. Unfortunately, the FARS data that we
use does not allow us to distinguish the style or brand of car seat in use in a particular vehicle, although the age of
the occupant provides a strong signal as to whether the seat is forward or backward facing.
12
   Later in the paper, I also estimate parallel specifications for adults in order to compare the relative benefits of seat
belts and riding in the back seat for children and adults.
13
  None of the results of the paper are sensitive to using logit or probit models and evaluating the marginal effects at
the sample means.



                                                                                                                          7
exclusive indicator variables corresponding to no restraint, child safety seat, lap belt only, and

lap and shoulder belt.14 InjSev is one of a series of indicator variables reflecting the injuries

sustained in the crash. My focus is primarily on fatal injuries, but results are also reported for

varying degrees of non-fatal injury severity. A wide variety of characteristics corresponding to

the individual, the vehicle he or she is traveling in, and the particulars of the crash are included in

the vector of covariates X. There are individual-level controls for the seat position (i.e. front

seat, back right, back center, back left, and back unspecified), age, and gender. Vehicle

characteristics include the model year of the vehicle, whether it is an automobile, minivan, or

SUV, the weight of the vehicle, the primary point of the crash impact on the vehicle, whether the

driver of the vehicle was wearing a seat belt, and information on the driver’s prior moving

violations. Crash characteristics capture the number of vehicles in the crash, the total number of

occupants in all vehicles in the crash, urban versus rural, time of day, weekday versus weekend,

the posted speed limit, and the year of the crash. In two car crashes, we also control for the

weight differential of the vehicles in the crash.

         Summary statistics for the variables included in the analysis are presented in Table 2.

Means and standard deviations for the full sample are shown in the first two columns. The

remaining four columns divide the sample by restraint type. More than half of the children in the

sample are unrestrained. The remainder of children are distributed relatively equally across child

safety seats and the two types of seat belts. Over time, these proportions have shifted away from

being unrestrained and toward child safety seats. Direct frontal crashes are the most common.

Children who are unrestrained are over represented in vehicles with drivers who are unbelted and

14
  There are a small number of observations recorded as shoulder belt only. These are included in the lap belt only
category. Following earlier work (Hertz 1996), I code passengers as using a restraint even if they are recorded as
using that restraint improperly (for example, a child is in a car seat but not properly buckled, or a single seat belt is
used for multiple passengers). In the sensitivity analysis, I also report results excluding individuals who are not
using the safety restraints properly. The basic findings are unchanged.



                                                                                                                            8
have previous moving violations, in one-car crashes, and in early morning crashes (i.e. between

midnight to 6 a.m.). There are few systematic differences in characteristics across the three

types of restraints, except that front-seat passengers and earlier model vehicles are more likely to

use lap and shoulder belts to restrain children.



Section III: Empirical results

         Table 3 presents regression estimates of equation (1) on the full sample of crashes. The

unit of observation is a child-crash. The dependent variable is an indicator equal to one if the

child dies and zero otherwise. The estimates reported are from linear probability models.

Standard errors are in parentheses. In all specifications, the estimates of restraint effectiveness

are relative to a child who is unrestrained, i.e. the omitted category for restraint type is “no

restraint used.”

         In column 1 of Table 3, the only right-hand-side variables included are the type of

restraint used. In this case, the constant term, which is equal to 0.293 reflects the baseline death

rate among unrestrained children. Each of the three restraint types (child safety seats, lap and

shoulder belts, and lap belts only) provide similar fatality reductions, reducing the death rate

between 0.10 and 0.126, or a little more than one-third of the rate for a child with no restraint.15

In each case, the life-saving benefits of the restraints are highly statistically significant relative to

the baseline of no restraint use. The null hypothesis of equality across the coefficients of the

three restraint types, however, cannot be rejected.



15
   The percentage reduction in fatalities reported here is smaller than that estimated in prior research using the paired
comparison approach of Partyka (1988) and Hertz (1996). The lower safety restraint effectiveness, when expressed
in percentage terms, is likely an artifact of sample selection which leads one to understate the true effectiveness of
life saving devices when using the FARS sample (Levitt and Porter 2001). When I control for sample selection in
Table 5 of this paper, the effectiveness of the restraints, measured by the percentage reduction in deaths relative to
unrestrained passengers, rises to levels comparable to the prior research.



                                                                                                                       9
         As one moves from left to right in Table 3, progressively more controls are added to the

specification. Column 2 includes seating position and age dummies. Adding these controls

makes the estimates across the three restraint types even more closely bunched. The back seat is

safer than the front seat with the middle of the back seat better than the sides. In side-impact

crashes, the child seated near the point of impact fares especially badly; by being in the middle a

passenger avoids the direct impacts on either side and is likely to make contact with the front

seat.

         Column 3 of Table 3 adds indicator variables for the year of the crash, the model year of

the vehicle the passenger is traveling in, and the point of impact for the crash. The coefficients

on the safety restraints are not greatly affected. Lap and shoulder belts have the largest point

estimate, but equality of the three safety restraints cannot be rejected. Column 4 adds a wide

array of further controls such as the gender of the child, information about the driver and the

vehicle, and the circumstances of the crash (only some of which are included in the table; full

results are available from the author on request). Children fare worse in cars and better in

heavier vehicles. The impact of restraints remains similar across the three types of devices.

         Column 5 of Table 3 includes indicator variables for the number of people involved in

the crash. Although it is unlikely that the number of people in the crash has any actual causal

link to the probability of death, because of sample selection in how the data set is created, the

number of people in the crash serves as an indirect measure of crash severity. Controlling for

other factors, the more people in the crash, the more likely that the crash is included in the

sample even if this particular child survives. Thus, on average, death rates in observed crashes

are strongly negatively related to the number of individuals involved in the crash.16 To the


16
  Although not shown in tabular form, the coefficients from column 5 of Table 3 imply, for instance, that all else
equal the child is 20 percentage points more likely to die in a crash with thee people involved than in a crash with



                                                                                                                       10
extent that restraint use is systematically correlated with the number of people in crashes (e.g. if

families with more children in the car are less likely to use car seats), failure to control for

number of vehicle occupants would lead to biased estimates of the impact of restraint use. Child

safety seats and lap and shoulder belts carry identical coefficients; lap-only belts have a smaller

point estimate. I am able to reject the null that the lap-only coefficient is equal to the values on

the other restraints at the .05 level.17

         Table 4 further explores the robustness of the estimates on the restraint types to a wide

range of crash circumstances, vehicle and passenger characteristics, and alternative data

definitions. Each row of Table 4 represents a different regression estimate. The first column of

the table presents the mean death rate for unrestrained passengers in that sample. Columns 2-4

show the coefficients on the three restraint types. In all cases, the estimates reported are from

specifications including the most extensive set of controls (i.e., corresponding to column 5 of

Table 3). Only the coefficients on the restraints are reported in the table.

         The first row reports baseline estimates from the overall sample. Each of the subsequent

rows corresponds to a different sub-sample of the data. Of the 32 sensitivity analyses I report,

the null hypothesis of equality across the three restraint types can be rejected 12 times, largely

because of smaller coefficients on lap-only seat belts. The point estimate on child safety seats is

more negative than the coefficient on lap and shoulder belts in only 15 of the 32 cases, and in

none of the cases can equality of these two coefficients be rejected. In sum, there is no evidence

in the data to suggest that child safety seats outperform lap and shoulder belts in this sample.



ten people involved.
17
   It is also possible to include vehicle-fixed effects, so that the coefficients are identified solely off of variation from
multiple children riding in the same vehicle and involved in the same crash. Because there is relatively little within-
vehicle variation in restraint use, however, the estimates become imprecise. The point estimate on child safety seats,
lap and shoulder belts, and lap-only belts with vehicle fixed-effects are respectively -.215 (se=.025), -.192 (se=.026),
and -.193 (se=.025). One cannot reject the null hypothesis of equality across these three coefficients.



                                                                                                                         11
Section IV: Controlling for sample selection in the crashes that are included in the FARS data set

         As noted earlier, in order for a crash to be included in the FARS data set, there must be at

least one fatality. For those crashes in which a child is the only fatality, if that child would have

survived the crash had he or she been differently restrained, the crash would have been absent

from FARS. Similarly, for crashes in which no one dies, but a child would have died had he or

she been using a different restraint, the sample composition depends upon the child’s restraint

use. As demonstrated by Levitt and Porter (2001), this sample selection is likely to cause the

benefits of effective safety devices to be systematically understated in the analysis presented

above. Intuitively, all of the failures of these safety devices are included in the FARS data (since

all fatalities are in the data set), but some of the successes are omitted when the safety device

works for the passenger in question and no one else dies. For instance, Levitt and Porter (2001)

estimate that the actual safety benefits of seat belts for adult front-seat passengers are roughly 25

percent greater than implied by the naïve OLS estimates.

         In this paper, I adopt the same strategy for dealing with sample selection used by Levitt

and Porter (2001). Namely, I restrict the sample to individuals involved in two-car crashes in

which someone dies in the other vehicle. Under the assumption that, conditional on other

factors, safety device usage in one vehicle is independent of the fatality outcome of individuals

in the other vehicle involved in a crash, limiting the sample in this way eliminates the sample

selection problem.18 By limiting attention to crashes in which someone dies in the other car, the


18
  Note that in order for the estimate to reflect a true causal impact of restraint use, one also requires the standard
identifying assumption that, conditional on the set of observed individual and crash characteristics, restraint use is as
good as randomly assigned. The presence of a Peltzman (1975) effect, in which the safety afforded by restraint
usage leads to more aggressive driving, could lead to bias in the basic specifications, which do not control for
restraint use by passengers in the other vehicle. If I do condition on restraint use in the other vehicle, the Peltzman
effect is no longer a concern. Empirically, when I control for seat belt use by the driver in the other vehicle, the key
results are unaffected.



                                                                                                                      12
link between one’s own safety device usage and inclusion in the sample is eliminated.

Regardless of one’s personal outcome, the crash will be included in the data set.

        One important caveat of this approach is that the subset of crashes in which someone in

the other vehicle dies may have a distribution of crash severity that is very different from the full

universe of crashes. Indeed, crashes in which someone dies in one vehicle appear to be less

severe on average for occupants of the other vehicle (e.g. due to differences in vehicle weight, or

in the points of impact). It is uncertain whether our estimates from the sample selection-

corrected data generalize to the full distribution of crashes.

        Table 5 reports results for the sample selection corrected data that otherwise exactly

mirrors the basic regressions in Table 3. The magnitude of the coefficients on the safety

restraints are in all cases smaller than in Table 3. This is due to the fact that these crashes are, on

average, less severe than the overall sample of crashes. In terms of the percentage of lives saved

through the use of safety devices relative to a baseline of no restraint, however, the estimates in

Table 5 are larger. The death rate among unrestrained children in this set of crashes is roughly

10 percent. Thus, restraint use cuts fatalities between 44 and 67 percent, depending on the

restraint and the specification. As was the case earlier, there is no evidence that child safety

seats systematically outperform lap and shoulder belts with respect to preventing fatalities, and

only mixed evidence that these two types of devices outperform lap-only seat belts. In none of

the six specifications shown can the null hypothesis of equal coefficients be rejected.

        Although not shown in tabular form, I have also estimated all of the sensitivity tests

included in Table 4, but controlling for sample selection, and for none of the cases can I reject

equality of the coefficients on the three restraint types at the .05 level.




                                                                                                    13
Section V: Non-fatal injuries and a comparison to adult passengers

         The focus thus far in the paper has been on fatalities. Restraint systems also affect non-

fatal injuries. In the raw data shown in Table 1, it appeared that injury rates may be lower for

children in child safety seats relative to seat belts. Table 6 reports regression analysis of injuries.

FARS classifies injuries according to five mutually exclusive degrees of severity: fatal,

incapacitating injury, non-incapacitating injury, possible injury, and no injury. In the top panel

of Table 6, each row corresponds to a specification identical to those presented in column 5 of

Table 4, but with the dependent variable an indicator as to whether the listed injury occurred.

The first row simply replicates the results for fatalities. The second through fifth rows examine

the different degrees of non-fatal injuries. The point estimate on reductions in incapacitating

injuries is largest for child safety seats, but I cannot reject equality across the three restraint

types. Child safety seats yield the largest number of children with no injuries, by about 1.6

percentage points relative to lap and shoulder belts and 3.6 percent relative to lap-only seat belts.

The difference in rates at which no injury occurs is borderline statistically significant when

comparing child safety seats and lap and shoulder belts, and significant at the .01 level when

comparing child safety seats to lap only seat belts.

         The bottom panel of Table 6 is identical to the top panel, except that the results presented

correct for sample selection using crashes in which someone in the other vehicle dies. The point

estimates suggest a slight shifting by child safety seats away from the more severe non-fatal

injuries, relative to lap and shoulder belts, although these differences are not statistically

significant. Lap-only seat belts continue to under-perform the other safety restraints with respect

to injuries.19


19
  The findings in Table 6 are largely consistent with the recent work of Doyle and Levitt (2005) that analyzes three
different data sets (all crashes reported to the police in New Jersey and Wisconsin, and a nationally represent sample



                                                                                                                   14
Analyzing adult outcomes

         Although the focus of this paper is on child outcomes, a comparison to adults yields some

additional insights. Table 7 presents results side-by-side for children and adults aged 16 and up

for the specifications with the full set of controls. The first two columns do not control for

sample selection; the final two columns do. Only the coefficients on safety restraints and seat

position are shown in tabular form.

         Three points of interest emerge from a comparison of child and adult outcomes. First, the

fatality reduction associated with restraint use by adults is roughly double the magnitude for

children. This is due in part to the fact that adults are more likely to ride in the front seat than

children, and seat belts afford greater benefits to front-seat occupants (as observed in Table 4 for

children). Adults also have higher base rates for fatalities in crashes when unrestrained. A

second finding is that for adults there is a greater gain in protection afforded by lap and shoulder

belts relative to lap belts alone than was observed for children. For instance, in the regressions

correcting for sample selection, for children the difference in the coefficients for lap and

shoulder belts versus lap only seatbelts is a statistically insignificant 0.006, whereas for adults

the difference is 0.029, and highly statistically significant. Presumably, the extra benefit of the

shoulder harness to adults arises because they are taller and thus more likely to hit their head

than children absent a shoulder belt. Finally, it is worth noting that the reduction in fatalities

from moving an adult from the front seat to the back seat is higher than that of moving a child to



of crashes reported to the police). Doyle and Levitt find no systematic difference in incapacitating and non-
incapacitating injuries for child safety seats and lap and shoulder belts. Child safety seats reduce possible injuries by
approximately 20 percent in their sample. These results stand in stark contrast to the results of Winston et al. (2000)
and Durbin et al. (2003), both of which draw subjects from insurance claims and conduct telephone interviews to
assess restraint use and injury severity, finding that child safety seats reduce injuries by roughly 60 percent relative
to seat belts.



                                                                                                                     15
the back seat.20 For instance, in the sample selection corrected regression, the difference

between the front-seat coefficient and the average of the back left and back right coefficients is

0.012 for children and 0.046 for adults.21 From the perspective of minimizing total lives lost, it

is optimal to have both adult and child passengers ride in the back seat. But conditional on

having one passenger ride in the front seat, from a safety perspective alone, it is better to put the

child in front and the adult in back. Although beyond the scope of this paper, it is interesting to

note that there has been such an effective public health campaign to move children from the front

seat to the back seat, but no parallel effort whatsoever with respect to adult passengers.



Section VI: Conclusion

         Over the past three decades, there has been a concerted public campaign to ensure that all

children riding in motor vehicles use child safety seats. The empirical evidence presented in this

paper, however, suggests that for children aged two and up, child safety seats provide no

discernible advantage over traditional lap and shoulder belts, and only a marginal improvement

relative to lap-only seat belts in preventing fatalities. These conclusions are robust to the

inclusion of a wide array of covariates, analyzing a variety of sub-samples of the data, including

vehicle fixed-effects, and correcting for sample selection in the way the FARS data set is

constructed. An obvious question to ask, although one which is beyond the scope of the FARS

data, is the extent to which the failure of child safety seats to outperform seat belts is a

consequence of child safety seats frequently being improperly installed. Indeed, NHTSA (1996)



20
   Presumably the back seat is especially beneficial to adults because they are taller and thus more likely to make
contact with the windshield than a child when seated in the front seat.
21
   In the specifications that do not correct for sample selection, the estimated benefit of moving from the front seat to
the average of the back left and back right seats is 0.048 for children and 0.073 for adults.




                                                                                                                      16
estimates that more than 80 percent of all child safety seats are incorrectly installed.22                 Based

on crash tests, Kahane (1986) argues that properly installed car seats reduce fatailities by 71

percent, compared to 44 percent for improperly installed safety seats. Thus, there may be

potential gains to achieving better installation. On the other hand, it is worth noting that when I

conducted my own crash tests at an independent lab using lap and shoulder belts on dummies

corresponding to children aged 3 and 6, the seat belts performed well within the guidelines the

federal government has established for child safety seats, and just about as well as the (properly

installed) child safety seats that I tested. While far from definitive, the crash tests I conducted

suggest that even with proper installation, there may not be clear advantages of car seats over

seat belts.23

         The limited apparent effectiveness of child safety seats calls into question the justification

for the current legal requirement in all 50 states that children aged two and older be restrained in

child safety seats when riding in motor vehicles. Annual expenditures on child safety seats for

children two and older are perhaps $200 million in the United States, an outlay that appears to be

providing little return in terms of safety. Indeed, in the long run, the emphasis on child safety

seats over seat belts may actually be having a negative impact on child welfare. Because the

government mandates the use of child safety seats, there is little financial incentive on the part of

automobile manufacturers to invest in developing seat belts that better serve the needs of child

passengers.




22
    The complexity of correctly installing car seats is underscored by the fact that law enforcement officers undergo
a four-day training program to become a certified Child Passenger Safety Technician.

Notes: Summary statistics are for children aged 2-6 involved in crashes in which at least one fatality occurred, as
reported in the FARS data for the years 1975 - 2003. Observations with missing values for injury severity,
restraint use, seat position, age, sex, or model year were dropped. Additional observations where the restraint
was a helmet, the model year of the automobile was before 1970, or the type of automobile was classified as a
large truck, non-motorist, motocyclist, or other nonstandard vehicle were dropped. See appendix for precise rules
for inclusion in the sample.

Notes for Table 3: Dependent variable is an indicator equal to one if the child dies in the crash. The omitted
restraint category is “no restraint.” Coefficients are from linear probability models, with standard errors in
parentheses. The data are from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) for the years 1975-2003. See
appendix for precise rules for inclusion in the sample. Other controls included in columns 4 and 5 but not
reported in the table are the difference in the weight of the cars in a two car crash, if the weight of the vehicle
was missing, if the driver had had a major violation in the past, if the driver had had a minor violation in the past,
if the speed limit on the road was less than or equal to 55 mph, if it was a rural road, if it was a weekend, and
three dummies dividing the day into daytime (6 AM to 7 PM), evening (8 PM to midnight), and early morning
(1AM to 5AM). The restraint type variables--child seat, lap and shoulder belt, and lap or shoulder belt--are
relative to no restraint use. The seating position variables, such as front or back left, are relative to the middle
seat in the back.

Notes to table 4: The reported coefficients are from regressions in which the dependent variable is an indicator variable equal to one if the child dies in a crash and zero
otherwise. The top row represents the baseline estimates for the full sample, including the full set of covariates including dummies for year, model year, and the number
of people in the crash, i.e. the same set of covariates presented in column (5) of Table 3. Each row reflects a different subset of the overall data set. The omitted
restraint category is “no restraint.” See appendix for precise rules for inclusion in the sample. All reported regressions are linear probability models as described in the
text. Also reported is the mean fatality rate in the sub-sample for unrestrained 2-6 year old passengers.

Notes: Values in columns 2-4 are coefficient estimates and standard errors from regressions with
indicator variables for injuries sustained in crashes. The specifications include the full set of
controls in column (5) of Table 3. See appendix for precise rules for inclusion in the sample. All
reported regressions are linear probability models as described in the text. Each row corresponds
to a different, mutually exclusive injury category. Column (1) reports the sample average among 2
- 6 year olds who are unrestrained. The top panel includes all 2-6 year olds in crashes with at least
one fatality; the bottom panel corrects for sample selection by limiting the sample to two-vehicle
crashes in which there is at least one fatality in the other vehicle.

Notes: The dependent variable in all specifications is an indicator equal to one if the occupant dies. Columns 1
and 3 limit the sample to occupants aged 2-6; columns 2 and 4 are for occupants aged 16 and up. The data are
from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) for the years 1975-2003. See appendix for precise rules for
inclusion in the sample. All reported regressions are linear probability models as described in the text. The
restraint type variables--lap and shoulder belt or lap or shoulder belt--are relative to no restraint use. The
seating position variables, such as front or back left, are relative to the middle seat in the back. The full set of
covariates used in column 5 of Table 3 are included in these specifications, but not reported in the table.
Columns 1 and 2 use all crashes; columns 3 and 4 correct for sample selection by limiting the sample to two-
vehicle crashes in which someone dies in the other vehicle.

                                        DATA APPENDIX

All data used in this study are taken from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)
collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). FARS provides
detailed data on all occupants and non-motorists involved in motor-vehicle accidents resulting in
at least one fatality. Crashes from calendar years 1975-2003 were included in the analysis.
Programs and log files are available on request from the author.

The following exclusions were made from the dataset:


    1) Any crash in which the only deaths were to non-motorists were excluded from the
       sample.
    2) All non-motorists, large trucks, motorcyclists, and other non-standard vehicles (drop if
       body_typ>39 | body_typ==12 | body_typ==13 | (body_typ>20 & body_typ<30) |
       body_typ==32 | body_typ==33).
    3) All vehicles with model years prior to 1970 (before 1998, mod_year<70; during and after
       1998, mod_year<1970).
    4) Observations were dropped when the injury severity was unknown, when an occupant
       dies prior to the accident, or when injury severity was missing (inj_sev>4).
    5) Observations were dropped when the restraint use was unknown, a motorcycle or bicycle
       helmet was used, or a helmet was used improperly (the commands depend upon the
       years: (rest_use>4 & year>=1991 & year<=1993), (((rest_use>=5&rest_use<=8) |
       rest_use>=15)&year>=1994), and (rest_use>4&year<=1990)).
    6) Observations were dropped if the person was not classified as sitting in the first three
       rows of the vehicle (the commands depend upon the years: (seat_pos>39&year>1981)
       and (year<1982&seat_pos>=13)).
    7) In the regressions, any observation with missing data for any of the covariates (except for
       the vehicle’s weight) was excluded.
    8) For the great majority of the analysis, the sample was restricted to children between the
       ages of 2 and 6 (age>1&age<7).

Variable Definitions and Other Notes:

Lap-Only Belt: A dummy equal to one if the restraint used was either a lap belt or a shoulder
belt, not both ((rest_use==2|rest_use==1) for 1991-2003, (man_rest==1|man_rest==2)).

Lap and Shoulder Belt: A dummy equal to one if the restraint used was a lap and shoulder belt,
not one or the other ((rest_use==3) for 1991-2003, (man_rest)==3 for 1975-1990).

Child Seat: A dummy equal to one if the restraint used was a child seat ((rest_use==4) for 1991-
2003, (man_rest)==4 for 1975-1990). Unfortunately, the data do not give a breakdown of the
type of child seat—e.g. rear-facing infant seat.

Beginning in 1994, NHTSA began differentiating between properly and improperly used
restraints. Thus, after 1993, observations with rest_use==14 (improperly used child seat) were
classified as using a child seat. Rest_use==13 indicates that it was an improperly used seat belt.
However, because we have two different dummies for seat belt use, we compared these values to
properly used seat belt values for the same make and model vehicle to assign these values to
either Lap and Shoulder Belt or Lap-Only Belt.

The dummy variables front, back left, back middle, back right, and back other refer to the
position in the car where the person was seated (front: seat_pos<20 after 1981,
((seat_pos<4&seat_pos>0)|seat_pos==10) before 1982) (back left: (seat_pos==21|seat_pos==31)

                                                                                                27
after 1981, (seat_pos==4|seat_pos==7) before 1982) (back middle:
(seat_pos==22|seat_pos==32) after 1981, (seat_pos==5|seat_pos==8) before 1982) (back right:
(seat_pos==23|seat_pos==33) after 1981, (seat_pos==6|seat_pos==9) before 1982) (back other:
(seat_pos==28|seat_pos==29|seat_pos==38|seat_pos==39) after 1981,
(seat_pos==11|seat_pos==12) before 1982). Someone would be classified as back left if she
were seated on the left side of the vehicle, behind the driver, in either the second or third row of
seats (observations in the 4th row or further back were dropped as noted above).

The impact of crash variables describe where the principle point of impact of the crash occurred
on the car. The options include front (impact2==12), partial front
(impact2==1|impact2==2|impact==11|impact2==10), side (Right: impact2==3, Left:
impact2==9), partial rear (impact2==7|impact2==8|impact2==5|impact2==4), and rear
(impact2==6).

Other dummy variables indicate whether the driver was male (sex==1), if she was wearing a seat
belt, if it was a single car accident (ve_forms==1 after 1981, vehicles==1 before 1982), if it was a
two car accident (ve_forms==2, vehicles==2 before 1982), the weight of the vehicle (vin_wgt), if
the weight of the vehicle was missing (when this happened, the weight of the vehicle was replace
with a zero and the dummy indicating missing weight was set to one) (vin_wgt==9999 and make
vehicle weight missing = 1), if the speed limit on the road where the crash occurred was less than
or equal to 55 miles per hour (sp_limit<=55&sp_limit>0) .

Number in Crash: This variable is the number of motor vehicle occupants involved in the crash.

The dummies that indicate the time of day (Daytime, Evening, and Early Morning) divide the day
into three periods: Daytime is set to 1 if the crash occurs between 6 am and 7:59 pm, Evening is
set to 1 if the crash occurs between 8 pm and 12:59 am, Early Morning is set to 1 if the crash
occurs between 1 am and 5:59 am.

Injury severity:Incapacitating Injury (inj_sev==3), Non-Incapacitating Injury (inj_sev==2),
Possible Injury (inj_sev==1), and No Injury (inj_sev==0).

Car, Minivan, and SUV are dummies indicating the type of vehicle the observation was riding in.
The automobile was classified as car if (body_typ>=1 & body_typ<=9 before 1982,
((body_typ>=1&body_typ<=11)|body_typ==67) between 1982 and 1990, and
body_typ>=1&body_typ<=11 after 1990). The automobile was classified as a minivan if the year
was after 1990 and body_typ==20. The vehicle was classified as an SUV if the year was after
1990 and body_typ>13 & body_typ<16.

A dummy called rural was created equal to one if road_fnc<10 (except for between and including
1981 and 1986 when road_fnc was between 6 and 8 for rural roads).

Weekend was a dummy created equal to one if day_week==1 or day_week==7.
Weekday was created equal to one if day_week>=2 & day_week<=6.

For the sample selection correction, we created a dummy variable equal to one if
someone died in another vehicle involved in the crash.
