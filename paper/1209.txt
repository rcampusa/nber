              Managing the U.S. Govermnent Deficit in the 1980s

                                    ABSTRACT




         In the absence of major policy changes, federal government budget

deficits will probably constitute a serious impediment to any increase in

the U.S. economy's net investment rate, and may even depress the investment

rate still further, during the latter 1980s. The U.S. Government's

outstanding debt is now rising sharply in relation to gross national product,

and, under   either   current legislation or the budget policies proposed by

the.ragan Administration, it     will   continue to do so. This sustained

upward   movement of the government debt ratio will be unprecedented in
U.S. peacetime experience. Because government debt      and private-sector

debt have historically moved inversely     in relation to   gross national product

in the United States, a rising government debt ratio over time implies a

sustained contraction of private debt relative to the economy's size. This

reduction in the private sector's relative debt position in turn implies a

constriction of its ability to finance investment in net new capital formation.

                 MANAGING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFICIT IN THE 1980s

       The prospect of a large and persistent government budget deficit
during the balance of the l980s has become the focus of intense public
policy concern in the United States. This widespread anxiety has stemmed
from the experience of actually realized U.S. Government deficits in the
early    years of the decade, as well as from the growing awareness of a

persistent imbalance    between the government's revenues and expenditures.
The    federal deficit in the 1983 fiscal year reached a peacetime record
level, not just in absolute dollars but in relation to the size of the
U.S. economy. Moreover, it     has   become apparent that, under the policies
in   effect as of the time of writing, the deficit will not shrink over time,

even as the economy recovers from the severe effects of the two business

recessions that marked the onset of the 1980s. It is also now apparent

(if it ever was not) that such politically popular actions as cutting

income tax rates or trimming "wasteful, fraudulent and abusive" elements

of    government spending will not eliminate the deficit either.

         One of the most important reasons why this large and growing govern-

ment deficit represents a cause for alarm is its negative implications

for the economy's ability to undertake fixed capital formation and thereby

to achieve rapid growth of productivity and, ultimately, the population's

standard of living. Capital formation is sufficiently central to the economy's

development prospects overall, and the potential links between it and

government saving or dissaving are sufficiently important, that the threat

to capital formation stands out as one of the leading elements underlying
                                        —2—




the   concern that the spreading realization of the deficit problem has

prompted.

         The connection to capital investment is hardly the only reason why

numerous diverse constituencies have reacted sharply to the emerging

deficit prospects, of course. Fears of a re—acceleration of price inflation,

for example, stand out prominently in this regard. Although it is strictly

correct, in an analytical sense, to distinguish between the respective

inflationary consequences of government debt issues and money creation,

for practical purposes it is naive to suppose that the political and

societal pressures which lead to large deficits over many years will not

also affect the posture of monetary policy. For reasons more political

than economic, therefore, a decade marked by continuing large government

deficits is also likely to be an inflationary era.      The primary focus of

this paper, however, is the implication of a continuing deficit for the

u.s. capital formation process.

         The role of physical capital formation in enhancing productivity

has always been an elusive subject for economists. At an abstract level

the contribution of plant and equipment to workers' ability to generate

output appears obvious enough. Yet accounting for historical productivity

growth in any precise way has proved problematical, and the extra produc—

tivity growth likely to result from additional capital investment in the

 future is correspondingly difficult to quantify.

          More specifically, what is clear is that since the late l960s

 the U.S. economy's net capital formation rate has fallen by almost any

             After allowance for depreciation and   obsolescence (but not for
 measure.

 investment   in   pollution control), the United States devoted an average 35%

                                                its net stock of fixed
 of its gross national product to increasing
                                        —3—




nonresidential capital during 1961-70, but only 3.0% during 1971-80 (and

even less during the subsequent recession years). As a combined result

of the decline in the capital formation rate and the unusually large

growth of the labor force which took place over these same years, the

amount of capital per worker in the U.S. economy's private sector grew

by 3.2% per annum on average during 1961-70, but only 1.3% per annum

during 1971—80. At the same time, the economy's productivity growth

slowed from 2.8% per annum on average during 1961-70 to only 1.4% per annum

during l971_80) What is unclear is how much faster productivity would

have grown if capital formation had not slowed (but other adverse develop-

ments, like energy price increases and business recessions, had occurred

as they did historically). What is also unclear, therefore, is what

marginal impact on productivity growth during the balance of the l980s

would follow from, say, a restoration of the net nonresidential capital

formation rate to 3.5% of gross national product as in the 1960s, versus

a continuation of the 2.4% rate realized in 1981—82 (or possibly even lower).2

         The potential role of a greater capital stock in spurring aggregate

productivity growth is not the only rationale underlying the widespread

support for an increased u.s. capital formation rate during the l980s,

but the other dimensions of the subject are, if anything, even harder to

quantify. Familiar questions like whether the United States should continue

to have a major position in the world steel industry, or whether the nation

should move more vigorously toward energy independence, or whether it

shouldpursue a sharply accelerated shift of production into "high technology"
areas — each an interesting and important issue on its own     are also
all   questions about the magnitude and the composition of the economy's

capital formation. In addition to whatever more specific public policy
                                         —4—




measures may help to determine the resolution of each of these issues1

the general economic and financial environment that either fosters or

impedes fixed capital formation overall will importantly affect all of them.

The    stance of fiscal policy, as summarized in part by the path of the
U.S.   Government's   budget deficit, will in turn be a central element
importantly shaping that environment.
          The object of this paper is to assess the prospects for this

interaction, between capital formation and the government deficit in the

United States during the remainder of the l980s, and in particular to

consider potential budgetary choices from the perspective of their likely

effect on the economy's capital formation rate. To anticipate, the paper's

examination of the most likely prospects for this interaction indicates

that, in the absence of new policy directions and initiatives, the macro-

economic effects of U.S. fiscal policy will probably place unprecedentedly

severe strains on the economy's ability to undertake new capital formation

in the medium—run future. By contrast, an alternative fiscal policy stance

consistent with maintaining or even enhancing the nation's capital formation

rate   would probably require a combination of individually important changes.
          Section I reviews, with specific reference to prospects for the
1980s,    the economics of the connection between government deficits and

private capital formation. Section II builds on this analysis to consider

specific policies for limiting the deficit to a level consistent with

preserving capital formation. A novelty of the analysis here is its use

of the ratio of the government's outstanding debt to the economy's gross

national product as a benchmark measure summarizing the implications for

private financing, and hence for private capital formation, of any given

deficit path through time. Section III extends the analysis to consider
                                     —5—




two potentially important aspects of fiscal policy not directly incorporated

within the narrow lens provided by the overall budget deficit per se,

including the composition of the government's spending and the composition

of its liabilities. Section IV briefly summarizes the paper's major

conclusions and policy recommendations.

I. The Interaction Between Capital Formation and Government Deficits

       The U.S. economy has traditionally allocated aiDout one—sixth of each

year's total output to investment for the future. Considered in isolation,

without any benchmark reference points, this fraction appears neither

large nor small. Most families would be pleased if they could set aside

a sixth of their incomes to provide for their future needs, and few manage

to do so. The saving problem from the overall economy's perspective is not

the same as the saving problem from the perspective of an individual

family, however, since the economy must be self—sufficient in ways that

few families ever are. In comparison with an individual family, the

aggregate economy has not only a richer set of opportunities to save but

also a broader range of claims on whatever saving it does.

       Table 1 summarizes the experience of the U.S. economy in this regard

since 1955 by showing the relationship among the main elements of its

saving and investment, stated throughout as percentages of gross national

product. The data in the table condense the 1956—80 experience into

averages for successive five—year periods, but show the more recent

experience during 1981 and 1982 separately. The upper part of the table

details the economy's sources of gross saving, while the lower part relates

this saving to its use for gross investment (which equals gross saving

except for statistical discrepancies).

       what is most striking about the economy's saving behavior as shown

in Table 1 is, first, the relative lack of variation in the total saving

experience over the past quarter century and, second, the sharp departure

from prior experience associated with the large federal government deficit

 in 1982. Contrary to the usual impression of declining private saving,

the U.S. economy's gross private saving rate has shown little variation

in recent decades, hovering closely around an average 16.7% of gross

national product. Within the total of gross private saving, personal

saving has remained equally steady around an average 4.7% of gross national

product. The retained earnings of corporate businesses, measured net of

taxes, depreciation and artificial inventory profits due to the use of

first—in—first—out accounting methods, have declined sharply relative to

gross national product during the last decade, but the relative growth of

depreciation allowances (adjusted to reflect true economic depreciation)

has more than offset that decline. In sum, the economy's gross private

saving has actually grown slightly in comparison to its total output.

Because more than all of the increase has consisted of depreciation,

however, the economy's net private saving (equal to gross private saving

less depreciation) has declined in relative terms.

        The private sector, including both households and businesses, is

not the only source of saving. The economy's total saving consists

of private saving plus the saving —   or,   importantly, the dissaving —

of   government. In large part because of the surpluses associated with

funding the pensions of teachers and other employees, state and local

governments have increasingly added to total gross saving since the mid

1960s.3 By contrast, the federal government's budget deficit has grown

steadily over this period — from a balanced budget on average during the

 1950s, to average deficits of Q5% and 1.9% of gross national product

 in the 1960s and 1970s, respectively, to a peacetime record 4.9% of gross

 national product in 1982. This growth of dissaving by the federal govern-

 ment has more than balanced the growth of saving by state and local govern-

 ments, so that the economy's total saving has not kept pace with its private

 saving. In 1982 the total gross saving rate was at its lowest point since
                                          —8—




World War II. Because saving is what finances investment, so too was

the total gross investment rate.

            Although the u.s. economy's total gross investment rate has shown

little change (actually a small increase) in recent years, except for

1982, what presumably matters for productivity growth is not total invest-

ment but only the additions to productive plant and equipment —and,

moreover,      not gross investment but investment net of depreciation. New

installations that merely replace earlier ones which have worn out through

time and usage, or which have become obsolete as technologies change, do

not   represent further accumulation of capital. In the sense that matters
here, therefore, the part of saving offset by depreciation correspondingly
does not represent a genuine setting aside of the economy's resources to
provide      for its future. What matters instead is net saving and net invest-

ment.

            Table 2 indicates the composition of gross private domestic investment,

as shown in Table 1, among business plant and equipment, residential

construction, and inventory accumulation. In addition, for the plant and

equipment component the table shows the mix of depreciation and net

investment comprising the gross investment total.4 Except for the early

1960s and again in 1982, gross investment in plant and equipment has now

shown   a   steady increase in relation to gross national product for several

decades. Once again, however, more than all of this long-term increase

has consisted of a relative growth of depreciation allowances, due to the

economy's rising overall capital intensity and to the progressive change

in the composition of the capital stock away from (longer—lived) plant

toward (shorter-lived) equipment.5

        By contrast, net investment in plant and equipment increased sharply

as a share of gross national product during the l960s but then fell just

as sharply during the l970s. The 2.0% recorded in 1982 closely approached

the lowest net investment rate for plant and equipment that the U.S.

economy has experienced since. World War II (1.8% in 1958). Moreover, this

deterioration in the economy's net investment in relation to gross national

product has also corresponded to a deterioration in comparison to the

existing capital stock. From a peak of 4.7% per annum on average during

1966—70, the growth rate of the U.S. economy's net stock of private

nonresidential capital declined to 3.9% per annum on average during 1971-81,

and only 2.4% in 1982.

       In the context of this deteriorating investment performance, the

immediate source of current alarm about the federal government's budget

is the prospect that, even after the economy completes its recovery from

the 1980 and 1981—82 business recessions, the federal deficit in relation

to gross national product will not return even to the level of the l970s,

much less to the more nearly balanced budget experience of the 1950s and

l960s. Without policy changes, the Reagan Administration's 1983 estimates

indicate an increase in the total federal deficit (including a small amount

of "off—budget" outlays) to 7.1% of gross national product in each of the

1983 and 1984 fiscal years, followed by a decline only to 6.4% of gross

national product in fiscal year 1988 despite a projected recovery to a

6.5% unemployment rate in that year.6

       The likelihood of large and growing government deficits in the

remainder of the 1980s therefore calls into question the economy's ability

to achieve significant progress in increasing its net capital formation

rate, and even raises the prospect that the decline shown in Table 2 may

continue still further. Although the Economic Recovery Act of 1981 included
                                       —10—




several measures intended to stimulate private saving, the data shown in

Table 1 suggest that the share of private saving in the U.S. economy

exhibits only limited responsiveness. More sophisticated econometric

investigations typically confirm this casual impression.7 Moreover,

even if these tax measures succeeded in increasing the gross private

saving rate by fully one-half —     that   is, from the historical average

4.7% of gross national product to an unprecedented 7.1% —         that   still

would not be nearly sufficient to fund      the   projected increase in the

federal deficit and   also   finance private capital formation even at its

recently depressed pace.

        What is the economic process by which growing federal budget deficits

can   so impair the economy's ability to undertake private capital formation?
The answer depends, in the first instance, on whether the government

deficit itself is the result of an active fiscal policy that sets the

government's expenditures in excess of even the level of revenues it would

achieve if the economy were operating normally or, alternatively, the

result of a depressed economy. In addition, the answer depends importantly

on what posture monetary policy assumes in conjunction with fiscal policy.

         Table 3 presents data comparing the actual federal government

budget surplus or deficit realized during the past quarter century to the

surplus or deficit that would have ensued, under unchanged legislation,

if the economy had been at "high employment." The upper part of the table

compares the actual and hypothetical budget totals in dollar magnitudes.

The lower part compares the actual budget outcome measured as a percentage

of actual gross national product, as shown in Table 1, to the corresponding

high—employment total measured as a percentage of the economy's potential

gross national product.

       Since   1955 more than three-fourths of the cumulated actual federal

deficit has merely reflected the smaller government revenues that accompany

reduced incomes, together with the additional government spending intended

to supplement reduced incomes, in periods of weak overall economic activity.

The distinction between active and passive deficits was especially important

in 1981 and 1982, the years of what was by many measures the most severe

business recession since the 1930s. The passive response of revenues and

spending   accounted for more than all of the realized federal deficit in
1981, and   for   more than four-fifths of the realized deficit in   1982.

       When a government deficit emerges as a passive result of a weakened

economy, it carries little if any indication that fiscal policy is retarding

private capital formation. Such a passive deficit is simply the mirror

image of the excess of private saving that always accompanies (in some

senses, defines) a recession in the first place.8 For this reason it is

difficult to blame the weakness of U.S. capital formation in 1981 and 1982

on the enlarged federal deficit. The more plausible interpretation of the

experience of the past two years is, instead, just the opposite —        that
the weakness of business investment, by contributing to the severity of

the recession (while also being affected by the recession, of course),

caused the deficit to be larger than it would have been otherwise.

       The problem confronting U.S. capital formation during the balance

of the 1980s is different, however. If the deficit were merely passive,

it would shrink and ultimately disappear in the course of the business

recovery. Instead, nearly all estimates indicate that without policy

changes the deficit will grow larger. Over time, therefore, the growing

deficit will increasingly represent not a passive but an active deficit.

In contrast to 1982, when less than 20% of the deficit was active in this
                                      —12—




sense, the Reagan Administration has estimated that even by 1984 more than

70% of the deficit will be its active component, and by 1987 the active

component will be more than 90%.

       When the government runs a deficit even though the economy is fully

employed, the most basic reason why private capital formation suffers is

that the excess of government spending over government revenues represents

a net claim on the economy's real resources. Government purchases of goods

and services —airplanes for the military, for example, or bridges and

highways —   clearly   constitute uses of the economy's productive capacity

directly by the government. Government transfer payments — Social Security

benefits, for example, or food stamps        facilitate uses of the economy's

productive capacity, typically for consumption spending, not directly by

the government but by the recipients of these transfers. To the extent

that the government raises tax revenues commensurate with its spending,

it draws its claims on the economy's resources by simply taking income

(or profits) away from other potential claimants. The total claim on

resources represented by the government's spending does not disappear just

because the government runs a deficit, however. To the extent that the

government's revenues fall short of its expenditures, so that the government

must borrow to cover its deficit, the process of reducing the private

sector's claims on resources is indirect, relying not on coercion but on

market pressures.9

       The nature of the market process by which the financing of a

government deficit reduces the private sector's use of resources depends

in turn on the posture of monetary policy. If monetary policy accommodates

the deficit, in effect monetizing the newly issued government debt,1° then the

resulting monetary growth when the economy is already fully employed will
                                          —13—




typically lead to price inflation, which reduces the private use of resources

by eroding people's purchasing power. In this case the government deficit

in effect claims resources that would have been used for consumption spending,

especially by those whose incomes and assets are most vulnerable to infla—
        11
tion.         The course of U.S. monetary policy since the late 1970s makes

such an outcome appear unlikely, however, and it is presumably undesirable

in any case. Once the economy has recovered from the recession, continued

accommodation of a sustained government deficit would only create anew the

inflationary spiral which led policy makers to take actions that produced

the recession in the first place.

             If monetary policy does not accommodate the government deficit, then

the sale of government debt to the general public constitutes a direct

absorption of private saving and therefore reduces the amount of that

saving left to finance private investment. Here the market mechanism

that pre—empts the private sector's use of the economy's resources is not

price inflation but high interest rates. Since no one is forced to buy

government securities, additional sales of debt to finance the government's

deficit will be possible only if the government raises the interest rate

it pays on its debt. Once the government pays a higher interest rate,

however, private borrowers must also pay higher interest rates if they are

to sell their debt, but not all private borrowers will be willing to do so.

Some business firms will find that a planned investment opportunity is no

longer profitable at the new, higher financing cost, just as some families

will find that a planned new home or new car purchase is no longer affordable

at the new, larger monthly payment. Interest sensitive private spending,

including physical capital formation, will decline, and in the end the

economy's total investment will equal the deficit—reduced total saving.
                                          —14—




         This effect of government deficits operating through higher interest

rates is always present, whether or not the economy is operating at full

employment; but when the economy is not fully employed other effects are

at work which may be equally or even more powerful. when the government

runs a larger deficit, it does so because it is spending more itself, or

because it is making larger transfer payments, or because it is collecting

less taxes. zny      or   all of these actions increase the demand for goods

and   services,   either directly in the case of the government's own      spending
or indirectly in the case of the spending of transfer recipients and

taxpayers.    The overall effect on total demand is the net of the negative

impact on interest-sensitive spending and        the   positive impact of the

actions that immediately account for the deficit.

         Although there are some conditions under       which the negative effects
on spending due to higher interest rates would outweigh the positive

effects that are more obviously tied to the government's spending and

taxing,12 it is highly unlikely that those conditions even roughly describe

the U.S. economy. Government deficits caused by an active fiscal policy

that is increasing government spending and/or reducing taxes therefore

raise the overall level of economic activity, at least as long as there is

room left to raise it. Further, if accelerator effects are sufficiently

powerful, the net effect on business investment spending could well be

positive rather than negative. Under conditions of ample underemployed

resources,   with unused capacity and slack final demand dominating prospects
in many industries, the associated revival of overall business activity
could   easily stimulate investment by more than the resulting higher interest

rates retard it. By contrast, when the economy is already fully employed,

there is no further stimulus to total demand, and the absorption of resources
                                     —15—




by the government deficit unambiguously reduces the saving available to

finance private investment.

       In light of this sharp   contrast   between the effects of active

deficits when the economy is fully employed and passive deficits when it

is not, in considering the interaction between the U.S. Government deficit

and private capital formation during the 1980s it is important to distinguish

explicitly three separate time periods: 1980-82, when the economy was

deeply under-employed and there was little if any active deficit; 1983—84

(and possibly into 1985), when the economy's resources are still substantially

underemployed, but with a significant active deficit; and the remainder of

the decade, when (in the absence of fresh disturbances) the economy's

resources will be more fully employed but under current policies there

will still be a large active deficit. During 1980-82 the realized government

deficit was not an impediment to private capital formation, because it

was not in large part an active deficit and because the economy then had

ample unemployed resources anyway. During 1983-84 the deficit is becoming

primarily an active deficit, but it will still probably not significantly

impede capital formation. At least during the early stages of the recovery,

the positive effect due to the increase in the overall level of economic

activity from the fiscal stimulation of the recovery will probably

outweigh the negative effect due to the resulting increase in interest

rates. Only during the years beginning around the middle of the decade

is the government deficit likely to impair the economy's ability to finance

intended capital formation.

       The U.S. Government deficit in the current fiscal year and the next,

therefore, is not really an object for serious concern in this context.

By contrast, the concerns expressed about the deficit prospects for the
                                    —16—




balance of the 1980s are well taken and important. Sustained government

deficits in an approximately fully employed economy absorb private saving

that could otherwise finance private investment, and during the mid to

late 1980s this absorption threatens to assume magnitudes that are

unprecedented in U.S. peacetime experience. Especially since the performance

of capital formation in the last decade has already been weak (and weakening),

this prospect presents a major issue for public policy choice.

II. A Strategy for Managing the Deficit

       Table 4 shows the realized U.S. Government deficit for fiscal years

1980—82, together with separate deficit paths projected for fiscal years

1983—88 under three separate sets of assumptions about fiscal policy: a

"current services" path, indicating the Reagan Administration's projection

of the likely deficit under   a   continuation of current tax and spending

policies (without the 1983 Social Security legislation, but with the

Administration's defense program); a "Reagan budget" path, indicating the

Administration's projection of the likely deficit after adoption of all

of its current tax and spending proposals; and an "adjusted Reagan" path,

which differs from the "Reagan budget" path only in omitting the effect

of the proposed (but unlikely) "contingency tax plan."3 The table shows

each deficit path both in dollar magnitudes and as percentages of gross

national product.14 All three deficit paths take on the same value for

1983, because the Administration's proposals apply only to fiscal years

1984 and beyond. The "Reagan budget" and "adjusted Reagan" paths are

identical through 1985, because the contingency tax plan as proposed is

scheduled to take effect only beginning in fiscal year 1986.

       Although these three deficit paths clearly differ, with the "Reagan

budget" deficit showing the greatest relative shrinkage over time in

comparison with almost none at all for the "current services" deficit,

all three paths nevertheless show continuing federal deficits which, even

in relation to gross national product, are well outside the historical

experience reviewed in Section I, and which persist for some time. If

the problem at hand were to analyze the potential effects on capital

formation of such outsized deficits for just one year or two, then the annual

flow concepts used in the conventional statement of the economy's saving—

investment balance in Table 1 would be adequate. In order to assess the

likely implications of each deficit path over an extended period of time,

however, it is also useful to rely on some benchmark measure that goes

beyond these year-by-year flows. As in most analytical models of economies

that grow over time, a convenient form for such a benchmark is the relation-

ship between an accumulating asset (or liability) stock and the flow

of the economy's output as measured by gross national product.

       The form of stock-flow measure that is most suitable for the purpose

of analyzing the longer-run effects of government deficits is the government

debt ratio, defined as the outstanding indebtedness of the U.S. Government

measured as a percentage of gross national product. The reason why the

government debt ratio is a helpful guide in this context is that a broader

stock-flow relationship, of which the government debt ratio is one component,

has exhibited a pronounced stability in the United States for many years.

In particular, the economy's total debt ratio, including the outstanding

debt not just of the federal government but of all U.S. borrowers other

than financial intermediaries,15 has displayed essentially no trend (and

only limited cyclical variation) throughout the post World War II period.

Moreover, the stability of the U.S. economy's outstanding debt in relation

to nonfinancial economic activity has not merely represented the stability

of a sum of stable parts. Neither private-sector debt nor government debt

has borne a stable relationship to economic activity, but their total has.

       Figure 1 shows the yearend indebtedness of U.S. nonfinancial

borrowers, measured as percentages of fourth—quarter gross national product,

for each year since the end of the Korean War, as well as the corresponding

percentages for the end of the 1982 fiscal year.   The top line in the

borrowers. The lines below divide this total into the respective

indebtedness of each of five specific borrowing sectors: the federal

government, state and local governments, nonfinancial business corporations,

other nonfinancial businesses, and households.

         The strong stability of the total nonfinancial debt ratio shown

at the top of Figure 1 stands out plainly in contrast to the variation

of the individual sector components shown below. Although the total debt

ratio rose somewhat during the most recent business recession, as gross

national   product in the denominator weakened sharply, the experience
of   a similar (though less pronounced) cyclicality in prior   recessions

suggests no interruption of the basic long—run stability. In addition,

the stability of the u.s. economy's total debt ratio is of longer standing

than the thirty years plotted in Figure 1. With the exception of a sharp

rise and subsequent fall during the depression of the early 1930s (when
much of the debt on record had defaulted de facto) , and to a lesser extent.
during   World War II, the total debt ratio in the United States has been
                                             16
essentially constant since the early l920s.

         By contrast, the individual components of the total debt ratio

have varied in diverging ways both secularly and cyclically. In brief,

the post World War II secular rise in private debt has largely mirrored

a substantial decline (relative to economic activity) in public debt, while

cyclical bulges in public debt issuance have mostly had their counterpart

in the abatement of private borrowing. Households have almost continually

increased their reliance on debt in relation to their nonfinancial activity

throughout this period. Both corporations and unincorporated businesses

have also issued steadily more debt, on a relative basis, except for

temporary retrenchments during recession years.    State and local governments
                                    —20—




steadily increased their relative debt issuing activity during the 1950s

and 1960s, but just as steadily reduced it during the 1970s. Finally,

except only for 1975-76 and 1980—82, years marked by large deficits due

to recession and its aftermath, the federal government has reduced its

debt ratio in every year to date since 1953, although this relative debt

reduction has also been slower in years when even milder recessions have

temporarily inflated the government's deficit (and, again, depressed gross

national product in the denominator).

       This variation of the federal government's debt ratio provides a

useful perspective on the magnitude and import of the federal deficit.

During the post World War II period as a whole, the federal debt ratio

has declined not just from 62.9% in 1953 but from 103.4% in 1946. Indeed,

the 24-29% range in which the federal debt ratio fluctuated during the

1970s, and until 1982, corresponded favorably to the 27.4% value in 1918.

At the same time, the past decade has marked a departure from prior

experience in an important way. The years 1975 and 1976 were the first

since 1953 in which the government debt ratio rose, and the renewed decline

during 1977-79, which was subsequently reversed by the recession years

1980—82, was not sufficient to reduce the ratio to its 1974 low.

       The federal government's debt ratio is relevant to the interaction

between fiscal policy and private capital formation because, in the context

of a stable economy—wide total debt ratio, it represents a useful summary

measure of the net impact of federal deficits on the environment for

private financing. If the government deficit is sufficiently small, or

if either real economic growth or price inflation is increasing the gross

national product sufficiently rapidly, then the government debt ratio

will be falling — as it was, almost continuously, throughout the first
                                    —21—




three decades following World War II. Conversely, if the deficit is

sufficiently large in relation to the economy's size and growth, then

the government debt ratio will be rising — as it was during 1975-76 and

1980—82. The analytical advantage of the stock-flow relationship is that,

by comparing the nominal stock of outstanding government debt to the

nominal gross national product, it implicitly allows not only for economic

growth but also for the much discussed (but in the end usually ignored)

real capital gain that the government earns by inflating away its prior

debt obligations.17 Hence the government debt ratio measure also illustrates

the lack of essential importance to be attached to a precisely balanced

government budget in a growing economy.

       If the economy's total outstanding debt is approximately stable in

relation to gross national product over time, then a sustained movement

in the government debt ratio implies an offsetting movement in the aggregate

private—sector debt ratio. A falling government debt ratio like that

experienced during 1946—74 implies a rising private debt ratio, while a

rising government debt ratio like that during 1980—83 implies a falling

private debt ratio. A rising or falling private debt ratio, however,

simply indicates whether the economy's private sector is increasing its

outstanding debt more rapidly or more slowly than the economy's total

output is growing.

       The relevance in turn of a rising or falling private debt ratio

for the economy's ability to undertake capital formation reflects the

traditional importance in the United States of debt financing of net

 investment by the private sector, including both homebuilding and invest-

ment in new plant and equipment. For example, the nonfinancial corporate

 business sector, which typically accounts for nearly three—quarters of
                                        —22—




all U.S. investment in plant and equipment1 relied on external debt

financing for 64.3% of its total net sources of funds on average during
           18
1956-80.        Moreover, within this period business corporations' reliance

on external debt has shown an irregular but nevertheless increasing trend.

Unincorporated businesses financing new plant and equipment and households

financing new homebuilding have also relied heavily, and increasingly,

on borrowed sources of funds.

       In the absence of a major change in financing patterns, therefore,

the economy's ability to achieve a greater capital intensity       that is,

to increase its capital stock in relation to total output — depends at

least in part on the private sector's ability to increase its debt in

relation to gross national product. Over time, however, the private

sector's debt ratio moves inversely with the government debt ratio. In

the end, the rise or fall of the pvernment debt ratio is therefore likely

to be an important factor shaping the relationship between growth of the

capital stock and growth of the economy's total output.

       Figure 1 indicates the respective implications for the government

debt ratio associated with each of the three projected deficit paths shown

in Table 4. Just as there are large differences among the three projected

deficit paths, there are also significant differences among the respective

government debt ratio paths that each implies. With "current services"

deficits, the government debt ratio will continue to rise steadily, reaching

51.0% of gross national product by the end of fiscal year 1988 (in comparison

to 30.1% at the end of fiscal year 1982). Because the projected "Reagan

budget" deficits are the smallest of the three considered, they imply

the least rise in the government debt ratio. In this case the ratio will

actually peak at 40.2% of gross national product at the end of fiscal year
                                          —23—




1987 and then decline slightly to 39•5% a year later. Without the

contingency tax plan, however, the "adjusted Reagant' deficits will again

imply a continuously rising government debt ratio, reaching 42.4% of gross

national product by the end of the period.

       What stands out in Figure 1, however, is that all three of these

projected deficit paths will continue to carry the government debt

ratio sharply higher, instead of returning it tcMard the 24.8% postwar

low reached in 1974, or even stabilizing it at the 1982 level of 30.1%.

This projected further rise, equal to between 10% and 20% measured in terms

of gross national product, will raise the government debt ratio to levels

last experienced two decades or more ago. The "Reagan budget" path will

return the ratio to its 1964 level, while the "current services" path

will return the ratio to its 1957 level. As is apparent from Figure 1,

such a sustained increase in the government debt ratio will be unprecedented

in the U.S. postwar experience.

       If the economy's total debt ratio remains approximately unchanged

over this period, then the increase of the government debt ratio by 10-20%

of gross national product implies a decline of roughly the same magnitude

in the private debt ratio)9 This sustained decline in the private debt

ratio will also, of course, be unprecedented in U.S. postwar experience.

As of the end of the 1982 fiscal year, the debt ratios of the household

and combined   (corporate and unincorporated) nonfinancial business sectors
were 53.0%   and   54.7%, respectively.    A 10-20% decline,   applied either to
households   or businesses alone or to both together, will represent a

substantial re—adjustment. Because such movements will differ so sharply

from prior experience, there is simply no way to say with confidence what

consequences they will bring. Nevertheless, the close historical connection
                                    —24—




between debt financing and private investment strongly suggests that the

market forces which compel the private sector to shrink its debt in relation

to economic activity will hardly be conducive to private capital formation.

       The division of this relative debt decline between the household

and business sectors will also have important implications for the cornposi—

tion of U.S. capital formation, along with the effect of the total decline

on aggregate capital formation. Although a renewed depression of residential

construction could be sufficient to reduce household mortgage borrowing

by enough to absorb the entire private-sector decline,20 especially under the

smaller "Reagan budget" deficits, even that extreme outcome would probably

not permit any growth at all in the business sector's debt ratio    nor would

sacrificing homebuilding to such an extent necessarily be desirable anyway.

More probably, business debt relative to income will also have to decline

in order to make room for the ballooning federal government debt.

       Without the ability to raise external funds in the credit market,

the business sector will largely have to forego taking advantage of the

recently legislated investment incentives unless it turns massively to equity

financing — an unlikely prospect in light of traditional U.S. business

financing patterns.21 put in terms of the factors confronting business

decision making, the problem will be that the increased real cost of

financing (and, for some companies, reduced availability) will outweigh

the added attractiveness of new investment due to the large favorable

tax changes. Under these conditions business will probably invest

not more but less, and the U.S. economy's net capital formation rate will

decline still further.

       The principal conclusion of this analysis, therefore, is that either

the current stance of U.S. fiscal policy or the policy stance proposed
                                       —25—




by the Reagan Administration is likely, over the medium run, to provide

a major impediment to achieving increased net capital formation and, in

turn, to meeting the increased productivity growth and other more targeted

economic objectives associated with increased capital formation. If fiscal

policy is not to have this presumably unintended and undesirable effect,

then the analysis developed here suggests, at a minimum, that it will be

necessary to reduce federal government spending or raise taxes (or both)

sufficiently so that the implied increase in the federal government's

outstanding    indebtedness over time merely keeps pace with the growth of
gross national product.22 In terms of averages for the five fiscal years
1984-88, preventing any further increase in the government debt ratio
after the end of the current fiscal year would imply an annual deficit
of   $122 billion, while returning the government debt ratio to its level

at the end of fiscal year 1982 would imply an annual deficit of only

$74 billion.23 By contrast, the 1984—88 averages for the three paths

shown   in Table 4 are $285 billion for the "current services" deficit,
$169 billion for the "Reagan budget" deficit, and $198 billion for the
"adjusted Reagan" deficit without the contingency tax plan.
         Stabilizing the government debt ratio would therefore require
very   major changes even in comparison with the Reagan Administration's

budget proposals, not to mention currently existing tax and spending

legislation. The question that immediately arises, is what changes.

This crucial issue, however, is largely a matter of value judgments,

not economic analysis.

         The   standard trio of suggested ways to reduce the federal deficit
in the medium—run future includes cutting entitlement program benefits,
slowing the scheduled acceleration in    defense   spending, and
                                    —26—




eliminating either the reduction in individual income tax rates which took

effect in 1983 or the indexation of the tax code scheduled to take effect

in 1985. The magnitude of the change involved in reducing the average

1984-88 deficit to the $74—l22 billion range is such, however, that no

one among these three steps would by itself be sufficient. Table 5 shows

a decomposition of the U.S. Government budget position (including off-

budget outlays) into components roughly corresponding to these three

policy options, plus an additional expenditure category for net interest

payments, measured throughout as percentages of gross national product.

The table applies this decomposition to the actual outcomes for fiscal

years 1979 (the last in which the federal deficit did not exceed 2% of

gross national product) and 1982, as well as to the projected outcomes

for fiscal year 1983 and, on an annual average basis, each of the three

projected deficit paths for 1984-88 shown in Table 4.

       What emerges clearly from this decomposition is that, at least in

comparison with 1979, substantially all of the increase in the

projected deficit for the 1980s is due to a reduction in revenues and an
                                                                       24
increase in defense spending in relation to gross national product.         The

Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (diminished in part by the Tax Equity

and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982) will reduce total revenues by about

1% of gross national product in 1984—88, in comparison with 1979, while the

scheduled military program will raise defense spending by nearly 3%. The

adjustments in both of these trends proposed by the Reagan Administration,

even including the contingency tax plan, are relatively small. By contrast,

all other federal expenditures (other than net interest) will return to

their 1979 level in relation to gross national product under current

legislation, and will decline by a further 1% under   the   Administration's

proposals.        Such comparisons can never serve to resolve issues that

depend so heavily on value judgments, but they at least serve to place

in perspective the nature of the policy choices to be made.

         Difficult as it would be to reduce the federal deficit to

$74-122 billion on average during 1984—88, even this magnitude of budgetary

change would still provide not a falling government debt ratio as in the

earlier postwar decades but merely a stable government debt ratio as in

the 1970s —hardly an enviable era for federal budgets, corporate finance,

or net capital formation. Achieving a more capital intensive economic

technology overall —     that   is, a greater ratio of physical capital to output
— would more likely require over time a rising business debt ratio, and
that in turn would require federal budget deficits small enough to allow

the government debt ratio to begin to decline once again. Nevertheless,

for the medium-run future that more ambitious goal now appears well beyond

reach.

III. The Composition of Government Spending and Liabilities

         The analysis in Sections I and II focuses on the implications for

private capital formation of fiscal policy at the level of the overall

federal budget deficit. These aggregate aspects of fiscal policy probably

capture the most powerful way in which government budget actions affect

private capital formation, but it is hardly the only way. The composition

of many of the major budget categories can importantly affect capital

formation too. Moreover, in recent years several budget categories have

undergone major composition changes that could significantly matter in

this regard. No of these, the composition of the government's spending

and of its liabilities, merit particular attention here.26


A. Composition of Expenditures

         Table 6 shows the ownership composition of the net stock of fixed

nonresidential capital in the United States as of yearend 1981. The U.S.

Government holds only one—tenth of the nation's capital stock, and slightly

more than half of that consists of military installations and equipment.

In comparison to the private sector, or to state and local governments,

the federal government's participation in this context is small.

         Nevertheless, the economy's productivity does not depend on private

capital alone, and "infrastructure" investment of the kind typically

put in place by government programs and subsequently held under government

ownership can make an important contribution in this regard.27 In addition,

a substantial amount of the investment activities undertaken by state and

local   governments rely heavily for financing on grants from the federal

government. In both senses the composition of federal government spending

determines another potentially important aspect of the economy's total

capital formation.

       Table 7 presents a summary of the U.S. Government's fixed nonresidential

investment spending, including both direct spending on military and other

fixed capital as well as grants to state and local governments for fixed

investment purposes. The table shows these investment flows in dollar

magnitudes and in relation to both total federal spending and total private—

sector gross investment in plant and equipment, as actually realized for

every fifth fiscal year since 1955 and as proposed by the Reagan Administra-

tion for the 1984 fiscal year. Direct federal government investment

spending for purposes other than military has remained small in relative

terms throughout this period, while investment—purpose grants to state

and local governments have been somewhat larger, and have steadily risen

in comparison to the private investment total. Both elements represent

contributions to the economic "infrastructure".28 Investment in military

capital has always represented at least half of all federal investment

spending, although there has been great variation over this period. Except

for a bulge in the late 1960s associated with the Viet t'1am War, military

investment as a share of total federal spending declined from the mid l950s

through the 1970s. The increase proposed by the Pagan Administration

for the 1984 fiscal year, however, will reverse part of this trend.

       As a result of the irregular pattern of government investment

spending, together with the small post World War II base, the growth of the

nonmilitary federal government capital stock in the United States has not

slowed in recent years in parallel with the slower growth of the private

capital stock. Table 8 shows the respective constant-dollar growth rates

of the net capital stock held by the private sector, by state and local

governments, and by the federal government (including military and

nonmilitary capital separately) , by five-year averages for 1956—80 and

for 1981 and 1982 individually. Because of the decline in the school—age

population, and the completion of major investments in roads, sewers and

hospitals, the net capital stock owned by state and local governments

has slowed its growth almost to a standstill since the mid 1970s. By

contrast, during the late 1970s and through 1981, the federal government's

net stock of nonmilitary capital grew at a more rapid rate than at any

time since the early 1960s.

       Nevertheless, at no time during the past quarter century — even

during the late 1970s — has the federal government's net stock of non-

military capital grown as rapidly as the private capital stock. In addition,

at no time during this period (except for isolated recession years) has the

federal nonmilitary capital stock grown as rapidly as gross national

product. Although the contribution of publicly owned capital to growth and

productivity is a subject about which little is known with any quantitative

precision, both the government and the private sector can add to the

economy's overall capital intensity. Instead, the U.S. economy has made

do each year with less federal government capital in relation to total

output. Policy changes to increase the economy's government-capital

intensity, or at the least to prevent it from declining further, would

involve significant changes in the mix of federal government spending

between investment and current outlays.


B. Composition of Liabilities

       The outstanding debt of the U.S. Government will at least

double durinc the decade of the 1980s, even on the most optimistic plausible

assumptions about fiscal policy, economic performance, and consequent

budget deficits. Under the "current services" deficit path shown in Table 4,
                                        —31—




the   government's outstanding debt will more nearly triple. In the context

of this large arid rapidly growing stock of government liabilities to be

held by investors, the government's choice of the composition of its

liabilities —     that   is, federal debt management — can also have important

implications for private capital formation.

         The basic reason why federal debt management can affect such

seemingly distant aspects of economic activity as business investment

is that neither borrowers nor lenders in financial markets are indifferent

to the maturity of the debt securities that they respectively issue and hold.

In order to reduce risks associated with the cost and availability of

future   refinancing, businesses funding investments in long—lived plant and
equipment typically seek to finance those investments by issuing long-
term   debt. That preference would not matter if lenders were as willing to

advance funds at long term as at short term, but in fact most lenders

appear to prefer to hold short-term securities. Indeed, after their recent

experience with rapid inflation, high interest rates and volatile bond

prices, many traditional participants in the U.S. long-term markets are

now reluctant to commit funds to extended maturities, turning instead to

short-term instruments and other securities with more stable values. As

a result, businesses seeking to issue bonds to finance fixed capital

formation have found long—term financing more costly and, in many cases,

less available.

         When the U.S. Government issues large volumes of long-term bonds,

it further raises the cost, and further reduces the availability, of long-

term financing for business and other private—sector borrowers. Discouraged

by an unreceptive bond market, a business seeking to finance a new plant,

or new equipment to modernize an old one, can respond in either of two
                                    —32—




ways. One is simply to cancel or curtail its planned investment. The other

is to go ahead with its investment on the basis of short-term financing,

hoping to fund out its liabilities in the future but for the present

accepting the deterioration in its financial structure. The experience

of the U.S. economy during recent years has exhibited both of these patterns.

Not only has net fixed investment declined, but business has increasingly

financed what investment it has undertaken at short term, so that many

corporations' balance sheets have weakened significantly.

       If the government instead issued short—term securities, it would

free the limited supply of long-term lending to go to borrowers in the

private sector. In some cases the result would be additional private

capital formation, while in others it would be a sounder financial structure.

Either way, reliance on short—term financing in federal debt management

would promote a more productive and financially secure economy.

       During most of the post World War II period, the U.S. Government

managed its debt in a manner consistent with leaving as much as possible

of the market's supply of long-term lending for private borrowers. When

the war ended, the outstanding marketable interest—bearing debt held by

private investors consisted mostly of long—term securities. Over the next

three decades, the Treasury typically refinanced maturing issues and

financed new budget deficits by relying on shorter—term securities, so

that the average maturity fell from almost ten years at yearend 1945 to

just under two and one—half years by yearend 1975. The percentage of the

outstanding debt maturing within one year more than doubled over these

three decades, while the percentage maturing in one to five years also

increased, and the percentage maturing in over five years declined

dramatically. Table 9 documents this experience since 1955.

       Since 1975, however, the federal government has pursued exactly

the opposite policy, placing sufficient reliance on long—term securities

to raise the overall average maturity outstanding back to four years by

the end of 1981. Except for a Gongressional delay in increasing the legal

limitation on long—term financing at current interest rates, the average

maturity would have been even greater by the end of 1982. This new debt

management   policy has involved a regular cycle of short- and medium—term
note issues, together with a series of new thirty—year bonds. The out-
standing U.S. Government debt maturing in more than ten years grew from only
$14 billion at yearend 1975 to $73 billion at yearend 1982. The net
increase   in outstanding debt maturing in more than ten years —   that   is,

gross new issues with more than ten years initial maturity, less purchases

by U.S. Government trust accounts, less the amount of outstanding issues

moving from over to under ten years maturity by the passage of time —

was $14 billion in 1981 alone and, despite the legislative delay, another

$7 billion in 1982. In comparison, the entire net volume of corporate

bonds issued each year by U.S. firms in nonfinancial lines of business was

only $24 billion in 1981 and $22 billion in 1982, and much of those totals

consisted of medium—term issues.

       With its post-1975 debt management policy, therefore, the U.S.

Government has been lengthening its outstanding   debt just as rapidly
as the policy of the previous three decades shortened the debt. In doing
so, it has been pre—empting for the government an historically

unprecedented (at least in peace time) share of the economy's long-term

borrowing and lending. The possible offsetting advantages associated

with the post-1975 debt management policy have included whatever effects

the development once again of a large and highly active trading market
                                        —34—




for   long-term U.S. Government securities may have had in stimulating the

market   for long—term corporate securities, and hence making them also
more liquid. Both the increased size of the government's outstanding
long—term debt and the regular flow of new issues may have contributed in
this regard. Nevertheless, this active trading market is      now   in   place,

and any further technical gains that would follow from a      continued average

lengthening of the federal debt are therefore problematical. By contrast,

the economic impact in terms of reduced private capital formation (and

weaker balance sheets) remains.

         The effects of federal debt management policy on capital formation,

on patterns of corporate financing, and even on the overall level of

nonfinancial economic activity, can be substantial. Empirical evidence

suggests that debt management actions of a magnitude comparable to the

recent changes in the U.S. Government's debt management policy have sizeable

effects both in the financial markets and more broadly. In particular,

the evidence suggests that a federal debt management policy emphasizing

short— instead of long—term debt issues would lower yields on both

government and corporate long—term bonds and on corporate equities, would

raise yields on most short-term securities, and would stimulate output and

spending.29 The stimulus to spending would be disproportionately concentrated

in fixed investment, so that such a policy would not only increase the

economy's output but shift its composition toward additional private

capital formation. Because the induced change in the pattern of corporate

financing from short- to long-term borrowing (in response to the change in

relative interest rates) would be larger than the induced increase in

investment spending) ,    such a policy would also lead to an improvement

in the   structure   of business balance sheets.
                                    —35—




       The federal government's management of the composition of its

liabilities therefore constitutes still another dimension of policy choice

that can either foster or impede U.S. capital formation. As is the case

for the composition of federal spending, policies that would enhance the

economy's net capital formation rate would require significant changes

from the policies pursued in recent years.
                                   —36—




IV. Summary of Conclusions

       The widespread public concern that the U.S. Government's budget

deficit will retard the economy's capital formation in the second half

of the l980s is warranted. In the absence of major policy changes, federal

government deficits will probably constitute a serious impediment to any

increase in the U.S. economy's net investment rate, and may even depress

the investment rate still further, during the latter 1980s.

       The source of this effect will be the continuing absorption, by

the federal government, of a large share of the nation's net saving. This

absorption is not a problem when the economy's resources are unutilized,

but it is a potentially serious problem at or near full employment.

Saving used to finance a government deficit in those circumstances is not

available to finance private—sector capital formation. Under current

policies, increased government absorption of saving in the 1980s will

easily outstrip any plausible increases in the saving rate associated

with recently implemented tax changes or other factors. As a result, the

share of the nation's output devoted to net capital formation will at best

remain low.

       A useful summary measure of the impact over time of government

deficits on the financing of capital formation is the government's

outstanding debt as a ratio to gross national product. The u.s. Government's

debt ratio declined steadily from the end of world War II until the early

1970s. The government debt ratio was then stable, on average, from the

early 1970s until the early l980s. It is now rising sharply and, under

either current legislation or the budget policies proposed by the Reagan

Administration, it will continue to do so. This sustained upward movement

 of the government debt ratio will be unprecedented in U.S. experience
                                           —37—




since World War II.

         The reason why a rising government debt ratio bears negative

implications for private capital formation is that government debt and

private—sector debt have historically moved inversely in relation to

gross national product in the United States. A rising government debt

ratio over time therefore implies a sustained contraction of private

debt relative to the size of the economy. If market forces compel the

private sector to reduce its debt position, however, its ability to finance

increased capital formation will be dubious at best.

         -i    alternative   fiscal policy that would at least stabilize the

gOvernment debt ratio over the medium—run future would require limiting

the average federal budget deficit during fiscal years 1984—88 to about

one-third of that likely under current tax and spending legislation, or

about one-half of that proposed by the Reagan Administration. Even then,

however,      a stable rather than declining government debt ratio would only
replicate during the 1980s        the experience of the 1970s. A declining

government     debt ratio (and rising private debt ratio), as during the first
three   decades after World War II,     is probably well beyond reach.
         In    addition to these implications of the overall stance of fiscal

policy in the aggregate, the composition of the U.S. Government's spending

also shapes prospects for capital formation, as does the composition of

the government's liabilities. Recent developments have borne negative

implications for capital formation in both of these respects as well as

in the aggregate. The federal government's direct investment in nonmilitary

fixed capital is not keeping pace with the economy's growth, nor are

federal grants to support capital investment by state and local governments.

At the same time,     the    recent emphasis on long-term borrowing in financing
                                      —38—




the   federal deficit has increased, rather than reduced, the extent to which

government   borrowing interferes with the financing of private   capital

formation.    ppropriate changes both in federal spending priorities arid
in federal debt management would   favorably affect U.S. capital formation,

although in neither case would the likely effects be as large or as important

as a major reduction of the average deficit over time to the level consistent

with maintaining a stable government debt ratio.

*   This paper was prepared for the Wharton/Reliance Symposium on "Removing
    Obstacles to  Economic Growth" held at the University of Pennsylvania,
    Philadelphia, May 1983. The paper draws in part on my earlier research,
    and I am grateful to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the National
    Science Foundation and the Alfred P. SLoan Foundation for support of that
    research. I am also grateful to Arturo Estrella for research assistance;
    to Gerald Silverstein for supplying unpublished U.S. Department of
    Comirterce data; and to James Duesenberry, John Lintner and Michael Wachter
    for helpful comments on an earlier draft.
1. Data are from the U.S. Department of Commerce (Bureau of Economic
    Analysis) and the u.s. Department of Labor (Bureau of Labor Statistics).

2. See Denison (1979) and Kendrick (1979) for comprehensive treatments
    of factors contributing to changes in U.S. economic growth and
    productivity trends. For more specific (and conflicting) assessments
    of the role of fixed capital, see Baily (1981) and Bosworth (1982).

3. This trend has already slowed, however, and it will probably turn
    around during the l980s. One reason is the slower growth, and in
    some cases the contraction, of public school systems associated with
    the declining school—age population. Another is the sharp rise in
    general government operating deficits associated with tax limitations
    or reductions in many states. See Kotlikoff and Smith (1983) for a
    summary of the funding status of state arid local government pensions.

4. The division of gross plant and equipment investment into respective
    components representing net investment and depreciation depends, of
    course, on an accurate estimate of the corresponding depreciation
    rate. In practice, this estimation hinges crucially on issues of
    inflation accounting. See, for example, Shoven and Bulow (1975).

5.    in 1955 the economy's gross stock of fixed nonresidential private
      capital, measured on a constant—dollar basis, consisted of 56.7%
      structures and 43.3% equipment. In 1981 the corresponding composition
      was 48.3% structures and 51.7% equipment.  (Data, here as in the
      following paragraph, are from the u.s. cepartment of Commerce, Bureau
      of Economic Analysis.)

6. For comparison, the deficit in the 1982 fiscal year was 4.2% of gross
    national product.   (The data in Table 1 apply to calendar rather than
    fiscal years.) Estimates attributed to the Administration, both here
    and below, are from the Office of Management and Budget.

7. On the basis of a priori considerations alone, even the sign of the
    saving response to interest rate levels is indeterminate; see, for
    example, Feldstein (1978). For examples of the conflicting conclusions
    reached in the corresponding empirical literature, see Boskin (1978)
    Howrey and Hymans (1978), and Summers (1981).
 8. It is always possible to argue that, even in this context, private
     investment would be greater if the government ran a high—employment
     surplus, but such a claim presumably ignores any accelerator effects
     due to the still further depression of aggregate demand. For evidence
     on accelerator versus interest—rate determinants of investment, see
     Kopcke (1977) and Berson and Roley (1981).

 9. In addition to the claim on resources represented by the financing
     of its own deficit, the government also pre—empts resources when it
     guarantees the debt of private borrowers. The reason is simply that
     government guaranteed debt, like the government's own debt, takes
     precedence in lenders' portfolios over potentially defaultable privat
     debt. In addition to the spending indicated in Table 3, in the 1982
     fiscal year the U.S. Government extended $47.6 billion in direct loans
     and guaranteed a further $53.7 billion of private loans.  (Data are
     from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.) For an analysis of
     the economic effects of federal credit programs, see Penner and
     Silber (1973).

10. Contrary to widespread popular belief, an "accommodative" monetary
     policy in this sense does not mean that the central bank purchases
     all debt issued by the federal government. In a fractional reserve
     banking system, the great bulk of the "monetization" of the deficit
     is done by the commercial banking system. The monetary authority
     purchases just enough of the government debt to provide the necessary
     reserves.

11. In this case private investment could even be higher as a result of
     the monetized deficit if the (temporary) increase in real money balances
     also reduced interest rates.

12. See, for example, Blinder and Solow (1973) and Friedman (1978).

13. Data are from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. The reason
     for omitting the "contingency tax plan" is that, as of the time of
     writing, it appears to have little or no prospect of passage by
     Congress. Moreover, even the Administration's support for its own
     proposal seems questionable.

14. The gross national product values used are those actually realized
     for 1980-82 and those projected by the Administration for 1983—88.

15. The reason for excluding the debt of financial intermediaries is simply
     to avoid double counting.

16. See Friedman (1980) for a discussion of the behavior of the total
     debt ratio during 1918—78. Friedman (1982) sets out several behavioral
    hypotheses that could explain this phenomenon.

17. This capital gain is a key part of the process by which inflation
     transfers resources form the private sector to the government, as
     described in Section I. For a calculation of this capital gain during
     the post World War II period, see Eisner and Piepers (forthcoming).
18. The remaining net sources were equity issues (5.2%) and retained
     domestic and foreign earnings net of inventory valuation adjustments
     (30.5%). Net sources of funds in turn accounted for 56.9% of
     nonfinancial corporations' total sources of funds, with capital
     consumption allowances contributing 43.1%.  (Data are from the Board
     of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.) For a review of nonfinancial
     corporate business financing patterns in the United States, see Friedman
     (198la).

19. It is at least possible, of course, that some fundamental change
     in economic behavior could cause the economy's total debt ratio to
     rise more than just cyclically, thereby enabling the private sector
     debt ratio to remain steady or even rise despite a rising government
     debt ratio. In light of the stability of the total debt ratio documented
     in Friedman (1980, 1982), however, it is not clear what would induce
     such a change during the 1980s; see also the analysis of public and
     private debt ratio interactions in Friedman (1981b). The argument
     here also rests on the assumption that state and local governments
     will continue to maintain about the same debt ratio as in recent
     years.

20. Mortgage debt typically constitutes nearly two-thirds of all debt
     owed by U.S. households.

21. It is also possible that an increase in equity financing could
     make up for the reduced business reliance on debt funds, and thereby
     facilitate an increased capital fonnation rate despite a declining
     business debt ratio. Indeed, during the first half of 1983, net
     new issues of equities by nonfinancial business corporations averaged
     a record $34.0 billion per annum, equal to two—fifths of their total
     issues of equity plus credit market debt instruments, and well above
     the previous record of $12.9 billion set in 1980. (Data are from
     the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.) This surge
     was probably a result of the large increase in equity prices in the
     immediately prior half—year, however. In light of historical patterns
     of U.S. corporate financing, even the continuation of net equity
     issues at this pace —much less at a sufficient pace to make up the
     difference between a rising and a falling business debt ratio —
     appears unlikely.
22. Tobin (1982) has also advanced an analysis along these lines.

23. These calculations again rely on the Administration's estimates of
     nominal income.

24. Different benchmark dates would yield different comparisons, of course;
     see, for example, footnote 25 below.

25. In comparison to the early l960s, however, other expenditures relative
     to income will remain sharply higher. Similarly, in comparison to
     the early l960s, military expenditures have shrunk relative to income.
26. A third and perhaps even more obvious example, which lies beyond
     the scope of this paper, is the composition of government revenues.
     See the papers by uerbach, Hausman, and Shoven in this volume.

27. Investment in human capital is also an important determinant of the
     economy's productivity; this subject lies beyond the scope of this
     paper, however.

28. Of the $285 billion of federally owned net nonresidential capital
     stock (other than military) indicated in Table 6, $231 billion, or
     81% consisted of structures. Similarly, of the $1,813 billion indicated
     for state and local governments, $1,726 billion, or 95%, consisted
     of structures. By contrast, of the $2,849 billion indicated for the
     private sector, only $1,525, or 54%, consisted of structures.

29. See Friedman (198lc) and Roley (1982).
