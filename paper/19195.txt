                                             ABSTRACT

Social capital can facilitate community governance, but not all social capital is alike. We distinguish
bonding social capital (within a village) from bridging social capital (between villages), and we compare
their effects on the management of a common pool resource. We develop a theoretical model and
show that bonding social capital can improve common pool resource management, while the effect
of bridging social capital is mixed. We test these findings using primary data from Yunnan, China
on social capital and firewood collection on communal lands. We find that bonding social capital
decreases the consumption of the common pool resource, and bridging social capital erodes the effect
of bonding. Bridging social capital also decreases the use of the common pool resource by villagers
who are near subsistence levels of consumption. Our results are robust to alternative measures of social
capital and to treating social capital as endogenous.

1 Introduction

   Firewood is the primary source of fuel for heating and cooking in many developing
regions, and its use has caused deforestation. Forests in the Yunnan province of China
have been deemed a ‘biological hotspot’ by Conservation International (2007), and are
under threat from deforestation.   Both firewood collection and illegal logging in Yunnan
have destroyed habitat for endangered species such as the red panda (Xu and Wilkes
2004). Around the world, much community-held forest land is a common pool resource
(CPR). Exclusion is difficult or impossible, and so overconsumption is common.
   Social capital can help make village-level management of CPRs successful, however,
since village members can better detect over-use of the resource and often can enforce
consumption rules more effectively than state or federal government.      Because social
capital can aid information flow and enforcement, it can help communities overcome the
tragedy of the commons often associated with CPRs (Hardin 1968; Acheson 2000;
Bowles and Gintis 2002; Ostrom 1990 and 1999). Empirical evidence is more mixed,
however, and social capital has not always led to better CPR management (Isham and
Kahkonen 2002; Ishihara and Pascual 2009; Pretty and Ward 2001; Varughese and
Ostrom 2001).    In this paper, we consider how social capital affects firewood collection
on community lands in the Yunnan province of China.
   Social capital affects various aspects of the economy (for a good review, see Durlauf
and Fafchamps 2005). While early research often groups all social capital together,
Putnam (2000) distinguishes between bonding and bridging social capital.         Bonding
social capital refers to trust and social networks within a group, while bridging social
capital refers to links between groups. Most studies only consider one of these two
dimensions. Bonding social capital could be measured by ethnic homogeneity (Costa and
Kahn 2003; Easterly and Levine 1997) or higher levels of trust (Helliwell 1996; Knack
and Keefer 1997; La Porta et al. 1997).   It can increase growth or public good provision,
and it can improve co-management of CPRs. Bridging social capital as measured by trust
or networks between communities can improve economic growth and opportunities

                                              2
(Fafchamps and Minten 2002; Palloni et al. 2001; Narayan 1999). A few recent studies
begin to distinguish between the effects of bonding and bridging social capital.                   Several
studies find that bonding social capital has either no effect or a negative effect on
economic outcomes, while bridging social capital can improve economic development,
growth, and employment (Sabatini 2008; Zhang et al. 2011; Lancee 2010; Beugelsdijk
and Smulders (2003, 2009) and Knudsen et al. 2010).
    To our knowledge, our paper is the first to consider how both bridging and bonding
social capital affect the management of a common pool resource. We first modify the
CPR model of McCarthy et al. (2001) to allow for the effect of social capital on CPR
consumption.       We model bonding social capital as enabling risk-sharing within the
village, so greater bonding social capital implies a greater penalty from being excluded.
In effect, the vulnerability to social sanction facilitates enforcement of community
norms.2     Thus, villagers with more bonding social capital are less likely to overuse their
CPR. In contrast, bridging social capital gives villagers an expansive social network
outside the community, so it can reduce an individual’s vulnerability to community social
sanctions and limit the enforcement capability of the community. That said, bridging
social capital can also reduce the stress put on CPR consumption from those villagers
near the subsistence level.        Therefore, while we find bonding social capital clearly aids
CPR management, the effect of bridging social capital is mixed.
    We then test our theoretical predictions using field experiments and primary survey
data collected from 600 households in Yunnan. While social capital may be a
village-wide asset, we measure each household’s expected return from that asset
[following Glaeser et al. (2002), Pugno and Verme (2012), Sabatini (2008), and Zhang et
al. (2011)].      We then measure each household’s consumption of firewood from
communal land, and regress it against the household measures of social capital.


2
  Social sanction relies on the pre-existing social connections between individuals and is very important for
the community enforcement of some informal rules, such as in the case of Rotating Savings and Credit
Associations, or ROSCAS (Anderson et al. 2009, Besley et al. 1993). Social sanction can take different
forms, such as creating a bad reputation, retaliating at the workplace, excluding individuals from a mutual
insurance system, or even damage to personal property.
                                                       3
Yunnan’s great biological diversity is threatened by firewood collection, so CPR
management is crucial to conservation efforts.      It is also ethnically diverse, so the level
of social capital might vary from village to village.
   We collect data directly from 10 randomly-selected households in each of 60 natural
villages in rural Yunnan. Specifically, we interview each household about its income
and expenditure, the amount of firewood it collects on communal land, and the quality
and use of its own private land. Second, to measure trust, we engage villagers in a field
experiment.    Each player is given money and told that any funds sent to an anonymous
village member will be doubled, and that the recipient can choose to return any portion of
the financial gift to the sender. As an indicator of bridging social capital, we use the
percent of days that household members spend outside the township.
   We find that a household’s expected return from bonding social capital reduces its
firewood collection on communal lands.      Its expected return from bridging social capital
decreases consumption of the CPR at low levels of bonding social capital, but erodes the
effect of bonding social capital at higher levels of trust.     We also find evidence that
bridging social capital makes villagers less sensitive to the quality of the CPR. Our
results are robust to alternative measures of social capital and to whether we control for
wealth, expenditure, or cash income. We also find similar results when we instrument
for both types of social capital.
   To be consistent with our model and to identify the effect of social capital in the
presence of unobserved village-level characteristics, we focus on how individual
differences in expected returns from social capital affect household CPR consumption.
When we aggregate our social capital observations to the village level, we find that
higher levels of community bridging social capital increase common pool resource
consumption, and that a greater number of individuals with very low bonding social
capital can worsen the tragedy of the commons.
   Our paper makes several contributions.      First, while previous theoretical literature is
focused primarily on the effect of bonding social capital, we model and contrast the effect

                                                4
of both bonding and bridging social capital.        Second, we explicitly model how social
capital can affect vulnerability to social sanction, which helps determine the community’s
ability to enforce a cooperative level of CPR consumption.             Third, we show the
circumstances under which some types of social capital can erode the community’s
ability to manage CPRs. Fourth, while we follow Schechter (2007) in using a field
experiment to measure trust within a village, we then empirically test whether this trust
affects CPR management.
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly introduces the study
area, Yunnan province.      Section 3 builds a model and generates several testable
hypotheses. Section 4 discusses the primary data for analysis, and section 5 shows the
estimation strategy and empirical results. We conclude in section 6.

2 Background

   Yunnan is a largely mountainous, rural province in southwest China.         It is home to
the headwaters of six major rivers including the Yangtze. The province hosts a high
diversity of plant and animal life, containing 43 percent of China’s protected plant species
and 73 percent of China’s priority protected wild animal species (Yang et al. 2004).
Over 60 percent of the land is forested, and has traditionally been used for logging.
Deforestation is blamed for habitat loss, landslides, and severe flooding in the late 1990s.
   Developing successful community forest management in Yunnan has long been a
problem. After the Household Responsibility System reallocated land to households in
1985, for example, villagers were found to log illegally at night to harvest timber before
their neighbors depleted the forest (Su 2002).      On the other hand, a number of villages
such as Wenming and Mabuchong have good track records of successful community
forest management.     By exploring the nature of local social capital, we hope to be able
to identify characteristics that can help explain why local resource management has been
successful in some villages and failed in others.
   Yunnan is one of the poorest provinces in China.            Not counting the value of
agricultural and forest goods produced for home use, median cash rural income in our
                                               5
data is under 6,000 Chinese Yuan Renminbi (CNY) per household per year (US$1,731 at
an exchange rate of 3.466), or slightly over 2,000 CNY (US$577) per working
individual.3    This amount is only 12.5 percent of the Chinese national GDP per capita in
2006 (World Bank 2012).         Young men from rural Yunnan often work in towns or cities
and send money back to support the rest of the family still in the village. Around 12
percent of household income is from remittances.           On average, our households have one
child under the age of 16, contain slightly fewer than 3 adults, and are 46 percent female.
    Even after the 2006 land tenure reform, all natural villages manage some of their own
communal land.4       The head of each natural village coordinates local land use decisions
largely through village-level meetings. Any income from communal land is divided
among members proportionally by household or by the number of hectares of private
land each household holds. Most households have some privately-owned land after the
2006 tenure reform.       A large majority of households in our sample (80 percent) have
some land for forestry (averaging 1.3 hectares).          All but three households have a small
plot of land for agriculture (averaging 0.5 hectares), and all households in our sample
produce some agricultural product.         Our sample largely consists of subsistence farmers,
with only one quarter of their agricultural produce sold on the market.

3 The Model

    The setting for this paper is a village economy where the community manages
common land for firewood collection. All members have access rights, implying that
the community is not able to exclude members who consume more than the agreed-upon
level of the resource. Each household has a certain level of social connection with the
rest of the community and expects to receive returns from that network when it faces a
negative shock such as an illness in the family.           Similarly, each household expects to
contribute to others when it experiences an unexpected boon such as an extra high

  The term ‘natural village’ refers to a naturally-formed community, which is a sub-unit of an
administrative village. An administrative village is the smallest administrative unit in rural China.

agricultural yield from their individual plot.
   Some families in the village also have ties outside the village, whether through a
family member who sends back remittances, or through friends or relatives that have
since moved to a larger urban center.     Having these outside connections helps a family
cope not only with an idiosyncratic shock but also with a village-level shock such as a
bad crop year, because of access to outside employment income or to informal credit.
   The intuition behind our model is relatively simple.             Bonding social capital
facilitates village-level insurance, which increases the cost to a villager of social sanction
such as being removed from the insurance pool.          In contrast, bridging social capital
enables access to outside insurance, weakens an individual’s vulnerability to social
sanction, and thus mitigates against the effect of bonding social capital.             Even if
monitoring is costly, a village can sustain a cooperative level of CPR consumption by
threatening non-cooperative villagers with social sanction.       The level of supportable
cooperative CPR consumption is then a function of the expected individual returns from
each type of social capital. We also introduce a subsistence level of consumption to
capture the idea that in years a negative income shock, villagers may be forced to
consume more of the CPR than the cooperative level.           In a survival situation, social
sanction may not be a potent deterrent.     On the other hand, having access to an outside
insurance network in this case may reduce the pressure on the CPR, supporting
cooperative CPR management. Thus, our model generates several predictions: that CPR
consumption is decreasing in bonding social capital, and that this effect is mitigated by
bridging social capital.   However, bridging social capital can aid in CPR management if
villagers are close to a subsistence level of consumption.
   In the following section, we first illustrate how bridging and bonding social capital
affect a villager’s expected utility through their vulnerability to social sanction.    In the
next section, we develop a two stage game where communities choose an optimal level of
enforceable consumption as a function of households’ vulnerability to social sanction.
In our first proposition, we demonstrate that community governance with costly

                                                 7
monitoring will not achieve the first-best level of CPR consumption but can improve on
the outcome from no community governance.                 Then we derive two propositions that
suggest how bridging and bonding social capital will affect the level of CPR consumption
that can be sustained by community governance.

3.1 Risk Sharing and Vulnerability to Social Sanction
    Assume N  2 community members share a common source of firewood.                         Villager

i derives utility from consumption of firewood ci and a numeraire good c0i .                    In our

model, villager i’s consumption of the numeraire is subject to an idiosyncratic shock, i ,

such as illness or injury.5         For simplicity, we assume the shock is normally identically

distributed with mean zero and variance   .
                                          2



    Rural communities often have risk-sharing networks (Bramoullé and Kranton 2005,

2007). Assume villager i shares a specific fraction of her total shocks               rA   0,1 with

the N  1 other individuals in the same village.           Villager i also has M i individuals in

a bridging social network who are subject to a normally and identically distributed shock

im  m  1,2, , M i  with mean zero and variance  2 .                 Each individual in this

bridging social network shares a fraction of her total shocks riB   0,1 with the other

bridging members.        Moreover, since fellow villagers also have outside connections,
                                                                                                 N

“friends of friends.” With these forms of risk-sharing, villager i’s consumption of the
numeraire good is then:
                   N           Mi         N
                                                Mn

  For simplicity we do not include a village-level shock in the model; adding a systemic shock would not
affect our results.

Moreover, assume the degree of risk sharing is greater than zero but incomplete, implying

that not all risk can be pooled.         Thus, i  rA and i  riB .

    We follow the idea that the extent of risk sharing is positively related to the
individual’s level of social capital (Carter and Maluccio 2003; De Weerdt and Dercon

2006). Thus, we assume rA is an increasing function of bonding social capital,

                                                                       rA

                                                                       Ai

riB is an increasing function of villager i’s bridging social capital, Bi , or the intensity of

                                                                                      riB

    Assume each villager’s numeraire consumption has a CARA utility function of the

form v( x)   exp( x) , where  is the Arrow-Pratt coefficient of absolute risk

aversion.     Villager i’s expected utility with both of these risk-sharing networks is

defined as EU1i , while her expected utility with only her bridging risk-sharing network

is denoted as EU 2i .            If the villager has access to both bonding and bridging

risk-sharing networks, her expected utility is a function of the variance of consumption,
                                  1
     EU1i  u  ci   v  c0i    12i ,

where the residual variance,  1i2 is a function of the degree of risk-sharing both inside

and outside the village.         If villager i is excluded from the village risk-sharing network,
she can only share risks with those Mi individuals outside the village in her bridging

social network.        Her expected utility, denoted as EU 2i is then a function of the


6
  Think of Ai as the individual’s expected return from the village-level bonding social capital, and Bi as her
expected return from her bridging network’s social capital stock. Each might vary with the individual’s prior
contributions to that type of social capital, or to her exogenous position within the social network.
                                                        9
variance of consumption with the more limited risk-pooling through only her bridging

network, defined as  2i2 .          Her consumption of the numeraire good with shocks is then:

                                Mi
    c0i + 1  M i riB  i  riB  im ,
                               m 1


and her expected utility is:
                                  1
    EU 2i  u  ci   v  c0i    22i ,
                                  2
    Additional mutual insurance reduces the variance of consumption (  22i   12i ) and

increases expected utility ( EU1i  EU 2i ).          In other words, villagers benefit from pooling

their risks with more villagers.            We formally show this result in the proof in Appendix 1.
    We model social sanction as the exclusion of a villager from the risk-sharing network
in the village. Assume that individuals who deviate from the village consensus face
probability η of being excluded, and define the villager’s vulnerability to social sanction

as i    EU1i  EU 2i  .          Substituting     EU1i and EU 2i into the definition of

vulnerability, we solve for how vulnerability changes with bonding and bridging social
capital.   Villager i’s vulnerability to social sanction is increasing with bonding social
capital and decreasing with bridging social capital.              Moreover, the marginal effect of

3.2 Social Capital and Community Governance of CPRs
    We now consider how social capital affects the cooperative level of resource
consumption. We know that individuals have the incentive to extract more CPR than
the socially-optimal level, since each person only internalizes direct costs of consumption
(ignoring the externality imposed on neighbors).              Thus, to achieve the cooperative level
of consumption, a community must have some means of enforcement.                          Here, we
                                                        10
consider community monitoring and social sanction as an enforcement mechanism.
Without external regulation, the community conducts costly monitoring and imposes
sanctions on those who do not follow community rules. The monitoring cost is shared,
and an individual’s probability of being caught consuming more than the cooperative
level of the CPR is an increasing function of the community’s monitoring effort.
   Resource consumption is modeled as a two-stage game: In the first stage, the
community sets a cooperative level of consumption and monitoring to enforce this level
based on social sanction. In the second stage, members of the community can choose to
consume the agreed-on level of CPR under the proposed degree of monitoring or can
deviate and face social sanction.       Once the optimal level of monitoring is determined in
the community’s profit maximization problem, we assume that the level of monitoring is
pre-committed by individuals, following McCarthy et al. (2001).         Monitoring could be
pre-committed in the form of an in-kind or monetary contribution to a joint fund, or by
signing up to help patrol the forest.
   Whether individuals deviate from the consumption level set in the first stage depends
on two conditions: first, whether expected utility from using the cooperative level of CPR
is greater than under deviation given the probability of sanction, and second, whether ex
post consumption is greater than subsistence level.       If an individual with few resources
who lives near subsistence level realizes a large negative income shock, she might
consume more CPR to survive regardless of the threat of social sanction.
   The game can be solved by backward induction.            In the second stage of the game,
each player has two strategies: one is to cooperate and extract the CPR at the level
determined by a joint utility maximization, and the other is not to cooperate, and to
extract the CPR to maximize individual utility from consuming the CPR. Each player
must expend constant marginal cost d to extract and consume each unit of the CPR, such
as the cost of fishing or firewood harvesting.         Following McCarthy et al. (2001), we
specify the utility from consuming the CPR as:



                                                  11
                     N
                          
u  ci   ci  a  b cn   dci ,                                                                           (3)
                    n 1 
where a is the resource capacity, and b is its sensitivity to extraction.
    In the case without a village agreement on CPR consumption, the optimal

consumption of player i is solved by setting u  ci , ci  / ci  0 . We then obtain player

i’s reaction function:

                ad 1 N
ci  ci            cn .                                                                                  (4)
                 2b  2 n i

    Assume all villagers face identical marginal costs of CPR consumption, d.                              If there is
no community rule to limit CPR consumption, we can combine the reaction functions to
obtain the non-cooperative equilibrium consumption for each player ( c ) and for the

group ( C ):
       1 ad                       N ad
c           ,              C           .                                                                    (5)
      N 1 b                      N 1 b
    Next,        we   define      the    level      of    enforceable        cooperative        consumption          as

cˆi i  1,2, , N  and solve for villager i’s level of consumption if she deviates. We

then solve for the expected penalty and the required level of monitoring effort needed to
keep player i from deviating.
    Ignoring penalties for the moment, if all other villagers cooperate, villager i’s
consumption under deviation is:

                ad 1 N
ci  cˆi           cˆn .                                                                                 (7)

of the CPR, the probability of being caught,  i , is an increasing function of total effort

where   0 denotes the efficiency of monitoring.                                     Villager i will not deviate from the
cooperative level of consumption if and only if: 1) the expected penalty is at least as large
as the extra utility from deviation, where her penalty is her vulnerability to social
sanction times the probability she gets caught; and 2) ex post consumption is not lower
than subsistence level.              Thus, we have the two following conditions for cooperation:

           First we consider the case where the subsistence constraint (11) is not binding and

7
  We allow for villagers to contribute to a central monitoring fund, where one’s contribution might partially
go toward self-monitoring. We could equally assume villagers do not contribute to self-monitoring,
implying sii  0 .
                                                                        13
focus on the penalty constraint (10).                          To force player i to cooperate, the monitoring
effort by villagers must be equal to or greater than some minimum effort that just equals
the increase in utility from deviation divided by i’s vulnerability to social sanction:

                               mi
   The community will have two outcomes. Each villager either (a) extracts the

cooperative level, cˆi and pays the monitoring cost, s; or (b) extracts the non-cooperative

level of ci  ci                cn                    without paying any monitoring cost.       For the
                              2b  2 n i

cooperative equilibrium to exist, all villagers must cooperate, which implies they each
must have larger payoffs under cooperation than under deviation.                        We return to the first
stage of the game, where the community chooses the cooperative consumption levels to
maximize total welfare and solve for the sustainable cooperative level of CPR
consumption.           We also derive the explicit conditions needed for the cooperative
equilibrium to exist in Appendix 2. Comparing the sustainable cooperative consumption

of CPRs ( Ĉ ) with the first best level of consumption ( C ) and the non-cooperative

consumption ( C ) leads us to the following proposition.

Proposition 1: The sustainable cooperative consumption of CPRs with social capital and

costly monitoring ( Ĉ ) lies between the first best level of consumption with no monitoring

cost ( C ) and the non-cooperative consumption ( C ), i.e. C  Cˆ  C . In other words,

community governance may mitigate the overconsumption of CPRs, but cannot
completely eliminate it.
Proof: The full derivation is in Appendix 3.
   The main implication of this proposition for empirical work below is that any finding

of reduced actual consumption of firewood ( Ĉ ) must mean a step closer to the first-best

level ( C ), which therefore implies better community management.

                                                                   14
   When the conditions allowing the cooperative equilibrium to exist are satisfied, the
enforceable cooperative level of consumption will be a function of villagers’ bonding and
bridging social capital.   The relationship between player i’s consumption and the two
types of social capital is given by the following proposition.
Proposition 2. If the subsistence constraint is not binding, player i’s consumption of CPR
under the cooperative strategy is decreasing with her bonding social capital and
increasing with her bridging social capital.     Moreover, the marginal effect of bonding
social capital is decreasing with bridging social capital, that is,

cˆi      cˆi             2cˆi
      0,       0 , and         0.                                                (13)
Ai       Bi            Ai Bi

Proof: The full derivation is in Appendix 4.
   Proposition 2 implies that higher individual bonding social capital induces a more
restrictive cooperative level of consumption for that villager, given a fixed level of
bridging social capital. Further, higher bridging social capital reduces enforceability,
implying a larger feasible cooperative level of CPR consumption.             The result also
implies that the combination of high bonding and high bridging social capital might
generate the same level of CPR consumption as a combination of low bonding and low
bridging social capital.   These results may help explain conflicting findings in empirical
research, that demonstrate high bonding social capital cannot always induce lower
consumption of CPRs. If authors neglect the offsetting effect of bridging social capital
on the effectiveness of bonding social capital, they might well observe different effects of
social capital on CPR consumption. Two communities endowed with similar resource
characteristics and bonding social capital but different enough bridging social capital will
have different levels of consumption of CPRs in equilibrium.

   Now we consider the subsistence constraint in (11).           Let i denotes the realized

shock on villager i.   Assuming that shocks are independently distributed with a mean of
zero, the sum of villagers’ realized shock and the sum of realized shocks of each villagers’

                                                                                             n   0      and

such that player i’s ex post consumption under the cooperative strategy is below the

subsistence level, i.e.  cˆi  c0i + i  rA  i  c , user i will then over-consume the CPR at

the level ci  cˆi .         Her total consumption will then equal the subsistence level:


             c  c     i  rA  i  .

                 0i




Then we have the following proposition on the relationship between consumption and
social capital.
Proposition 3: If the subsistence constraint is binding, player i’s consumption of CPR is
decreasing with both bonding social capital and bridging social capital. Moreover, the
marginal effect of bonding social capital does not change with bridging social capital,
that is,

ci      ci             2ci
     0,      0 , and         0.
Ai      Bi           Ai Bi

Proof: The full derivation is in Appendix 5.
       In the case of a large negative shock, a villager with high level of bridging social
capital is more capable of getting financial aid from outside the community, so the
incentive to over-consume the CPR to maintain a subsistence level of consumption is not
as high as for a villager with low bridging social capital.                 Therefore, for individuals
close to the subsistence level of consumption, bridging social capital can be good for
maintaining cooperation in the community governance of the CPR.

3.3 Hypotheses
       From our propositions, we get the following testable hypotheses:
(H1) Bonding social capital increases vulnerability to social sanction, and therefore

                                                            16
decreases consumption of the CPR.
(H2) Bridging social capital decreases vulnerability and thus may erode the effect of
bonding social capital, increasing consumption of the CPR.
(H3) For households near a subsistence level of consumption, bridging social capital can
provide access to outside risk sharing and thus help conserve the CPR.

4 Data

    We survey 600 families in 60 natural villages in Yunnan Province, covering a total of
2,818 people. We select 5 counties in northwestern and southwestern Yunnan Province.8
Then we randomly select 30 administrative villages, with two natural villages per
administrative village, and we randomly select 10 households from each natural village.
In our survey, we ask extensive questions about land use, income, household
characteristics, and purchasing behaviour.              In particular, we are interested in the
consumption of fuel.       We also ask about the amount of time household members spend
outside the village, and village-level characteristics such as the distance to the nearest
road. We use these measures of connection with the outside world as indicators of
bridging social capital.

4.1 Trust Game: Bonding Social Capital
    To determine the level of bonding social capital, we follow Schechter (2007) and
conduct a field experiment to measure villager’s trust of each other.9                   We randomly
select household heads from each village and pair them with another anonymous village
member. To ensure each partner’s identity remains hidden, we conduct the interviews in
the home rather than meeting in a central hall.
    In the game, each player is randomly chosen to be a sender or a recipient.                  We give
all players 20 CNY at the beginning of the game, about the equivalent of one day’s wages.
Then the sender is given a choice of sending 0, 5, 10, 15 or 20 CNY to the anonymous


8
  The counties covered are Yongping, Jianchuan, E’shan, Pingbian and Jinggu.

  The field experiments were conducted for this paper; documentation on the details of the game and
results are available in the dissertation by Gong (2010).
                                                     17
recipient, who they know lives in the same village. They are told that the recipient will
receive double the amount sent, and will then have a choice of how much to send back.
Because fairness is a powerful motivating force in Chinese culture, the sender is also
informed that the recipient also receives 20 CNY, to eliminate equity concerns as a
motivation for sending money. The sender then decides the amount she wishes to send
and puts it into an envelope for the interviewer.         The sender is then asked how much
money she expects to receive back.
     We double the amount in the envelope before talking to the recipient. This recipient
is first asked how much she expects to receive.        Then, after opening the envelope, she is
asked how much he wishes to return. That amount is then given to the sender.
     Although we observe the amount sent by each, we want a comparable measure across
senders and recipients. Thus, we use the amount the sender and recipient expect to
receive as a measure of bonding social capital.        This amount reflects the degree to which
people trust their fellow villagers to behave in a trustworthy manner.              As one might
expect, this figure is highly correlated with the amount sent by the sender (correlation
coefficient of 0.87), while it is less correlated with the amount sent by the recipient.
     As found in other trust games, the majority of our sample sent money and expected to
receive money. The average amount sent was about 9 CNY, and it is only one CNY less
than the average amount returned. Of people who sent a positive amount, the average
amount sent was approximately 11 CNY (more than half of their starting amount). On

   Although we trained players in the nature of the game using tokens, before asking
them to send money, we were still concerned that those players with higher education
may have better understood the game, which may affect the amount they expect to
receive.     We do not have any explicit reason to believe that education improves trust,
and education itself might affect both the amount expected and firewood management.
Therefore, we are concerned that direct use of the amount players expect to receive might
contaminate our results.         So, to generate our measure of bonding, we first regress the
amount expected against education of the household head and a dummy for whether the
person is the sender or the receiver. We then use the residuals as our measure of
bonding social capital.      We also use the amount expected in a robustness test. Results for
this initial regression are given in Appendix 6, Table A1.          Whether the player is a sender
or a recipient does not appear to affect the amount expected, while the coefficient on
education is positive and highly significant.

4.2 Bridging Social Capital
   To capture bridging social capital, we use the percentage of days that the household’s
adult members worked outside of the township.                 We assume that a household member

                                                  19
spending more time outside the township means a greater connection with the outside
world, and therefore a greater potential insurance against village-wide shocks.
   One might be concerned that our bridging measure could affect firewood demand
simply by reducing the cooking requirements of the household.        To test for this concern,
we include the number of household members living at home in the regression for
firewood.   Further, one might worry that our measure of bridging social capital is largely
picking up household wealth, expenditure, or cash income.        In separate specifications,
we include measures for each of these factors to see the effects on results.
   Further, one might be concerned that our measure of bridging social capital is arbitrary.
As alternative measures, we use the number of household members working outside the
township, the percent of members working outside the township, and the amount of
remittances received.    Following Jensen and Oster (2009), we also use cable TV
ownership and phone to proxy for connections with the outside world.           We also later
explore the potential endogeneity of both of our social capital variables.

4.3 Measure of the CPR
   We are interested in observing how the two types of social capital affect the
management firewood collection on communal lands. While we would ideally like to
know how much land is publically held per natural village, we only observe the amount
of communal land per administrative village. Thus, to measure firewood collection, we
use the logged amount of firewood collected on public lands divided by the amount of
forestland in the administrative village to get a measure of firewood collected per forest.
We are missing information on forestland on one administrative village, which drops our
sample size to 580.   Summary statistics are presented in Table 2.

5 Estimation Strategy and Empirical Results

     We follow our theoretical model and estimate household consumption on public lands
as a function of social capital and factors that affect the cost and benefit of collecting
firewood on private land.11 Like Pugno and Verme (2012), Sabatini (2008) and Zhang et
al. (2011) who treat bonding and bridging social capital as an individual characteristic,
we model social capital as the individual’s expected return from the village social
network or community bonding stock. We then compare the effect of bridging versus
bonding social capital on the management of a CPR.                       We have both theoretical and
practical identification reasons for this approach.
     First, we believe that households will make decisions based on their individual
expected returns from social capital, not just based on the common village-level stock.
A household may not know the level of the social capital stock, implying that their


11
   We also tried including the amount of grain harvested, under the assumption that grain stalks might be
used as fuel. However, we were informed that this practice is not common in Yunnan, which corresponds
with the insignificance of its estimated coefficient.
                                                       21
perception of that level, not the level itself, will affect their vulnerability and thus their
CPR use. Further, each household may benefit differentially from social capital, and
these differences will affect household behavior.          We feel the expected amount of money
in the trust game is consistent with the concept of individual vulnerability to social
sanction used in our theoretical model.
     Second, on a practical note, we can better control for the many village-level
unobservables if we compare villagers’ actions to each other.                  For example, if high
levels of social capital result in good CPR management and therefore high resource
quality, one might observe high levels of consumption that do not indicate poor
management but are in fact sustainable.          We find as much within-village variation in our
measure of expected returns from bonding social capital measure as we observe between
villages. We also observe substantial variation in firewood collected on community land
within a village. Thus, we use individual expected return to village social capital to
explain the household decision of how much firewood to collect on communal lands
relative to the consumption of others in the village.          We modify the reaction function in
equation (4) and divide own consumption through by the total per mu natural-village
level consumption.12       Thus, we estimate the following relation:
                                                                                                 (15)
where i refers to villager and v refers to village.       Then c is the (log) quantity of firewood
consumed per mu divided by total village consumption per mu, δI is an intercept term,
which includes village fixed effects, A is bonding social capital, and B is bridging social
capital. The variable p is the cost of consuming firewood on the household’s private land,
which includes the slope of the land and the quality and quantity of the household forest
resource, and x is a vector of household characteristics to control for fuel demand.
Because we have two natural villages with no collection of firewood on public lands, our
sample size falls to 526.
     While we do not explicitly observe the cost of villagers collecting firewood on public

12
   Mu is a measurement unit for land area widely used in China. One mu is approximately equal to 0.165
acre.
                                                     22
  lands, we do have measures of the cost to the household of consuming their private
  resources. Thus, we include the household forest resources (defined as forest plot area
  times yield), the area-weighted average slope of the household forest plots, and their
  area-weighted average distance from road. These variables capture both the benefit and
  cost of firewood collection on private lands (Deng et al. 2011).
      Anecdotally, we heard that firewood demand is affected by whether the family owns
  pigs or not, since food for the livestock is often cooked. Thus, we include an indicator
  variable for pig ownership.               We cluster errors by last name within each natural village,
  to capture possible joint decisions made by a multiple-household family unit. Note that
  many unrelated households have the same last name, so this clustering might slightly
  overstate our standard errors. We first estimate a simple reduced form relation between
  bonding and bridging social capital and the dependent variable (firewood collected on
  public lands per mu relative to the village total).                  We next estimate the model with the
  controls suggested by our theoretical model.                        The results of the simple model are
  presented in Table 3, and the results with controls are presented in Table 4.

     In the first 4 columns of Table 3, we run the regression with bonding SC (model 1),
then bridging SC (model 2), then both together (model 3), and then with an interaction
term (model 4), all without fixed effects.                   The next four columns repeat the same four
models with natural-village fixed effects.                   Independently and together, the two types of
social capital are shown to reduce the quantity of CPR consumed.                                               Without
natural-village-level fixed effects, in models (1) and (3), bonding reduces firewood
consumption on public lands, but this term is only significantly different from zero at the
90 percent level.         In models (2) and (3), bridging SC also reduces firewood consumption,
and this effect is significantly different from zero at a 95 percent confidence level.
While the effect of bonding social capital is consistent with our model, the coefficient on
bridging social capital alone is opposite from that expected if households are not

                                                               24
constrained by subsistence. We explore this subsistence effect in detail later.
   In model (4), we see that the interaction term between bridging and bonding SC is
positive, implying that each type of social capital erodes the effect of the other. This
result is consistent with our theoretical model, which suggests that bridging social capital
may erode the vulnerability to social sanction provided by bonding social capital.
Results are consistent when we include village fixed effects, with a slight increase in the
coefficient magnitudes and significance.
   In Table 4, we introduce controls for: the household’s resource capacity, the cost of
harvesting wood on their private land, and factors that might affect demand for fuel.    As
in Table 3, the models presented in the first columns do not include village-level fixed
effects, whereas the models in the last columns do.     The signs on the effect of bonding
and bridging SC are the same as in Table 3, although the magnitudes of the coefficients
increase with the additional controls.   The signs on the control variables are as expected.
A lower household resource capacity implies more firewood collected on public lands.
The cost of private collection also increases public-land collection: higher slope and less
accessible land imply more firewood collected on public lands.
   In Table 5, we present marginal effects for the models presented in Table 5, where we
calculate the effect of bonding and bridging social capital, each at different levels of the
other. When one level of social capital is relatively low, in the 25th percentile, the other
type of social capital significantly reduces consumption of firewood. Using results with
village fixed effects, consider the 25 percent of households with no measured bridging
social capital. A one CNY increase in their bonding social capital generates an 11
percent decrease in their collection of firewood relative to the village total. For those
approximately 18 percent of households who, in the trust game, did not expect any
money to be sent or returned (no bonding social capital), a one percent increase in the
number of days household members are away (more bridging social capital) decreases the
amount of firewood collected by approximately 3 percent.           When calculated at the
median amount of bridging and bonding social capital, the effect of bonding social capital

                                               25
remains significant, reducing firewood consumption by 6 percent, while the effect of
bridging social capital reduces to one percent.                     At the 75th percentile of the other type of
social capital, the marginal effect of an increase in bonding or bridging social capital is
not statistically different from zero.

5.1 Robustness Tests
    While our measure of bonding social capital is a result of the trust game, we use a
proxy measure for bridging social capital: the percent of days adult household members
worked outside the township. One may worry that our measured effect of bridging SC is
thus either a result of the specific way we measure time outside the village or is capturing
other effects of a household with a migrant member. To test the robustness of these
results, we use a number of other related measures as proxies for bridging SC. These
results are presented in Table 6.

Notes: The measure of bridging social capital in model (1) to (5) is number of household members working away,
percent of household members working away, the amount of remittances (1,000 yuan), ownership of a television, and
ownership of a phone. The measure of bonding social capital in model (6) is the amount of money sender and recipient
expect to receive from their anonymous partner in the trust game and the measure of bridging social capital is the one
used in the main model.     Standard errors in parenthesis are robust and adjusted for clustering within groups of the
same last name within a natural village. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively.



     Whereas our main specification above uses the percent of days worked outside the
township as our measure of bridging social capital, the first model in Table 9 uses the
number of household members working outside the township as our measure of bridging
social capital.        In model (2), we use the percent of household members working outside
the township.           While the exact coefficients on bridging change along with the
magnitudes of our bridging measures, the signs and significance remain the same for both
social capital measures, and the magnitudes of the other coefficients remain relatively
unchanged.         In model (3) we use the amount of remittances sent by household members
                                                              27
to capture a measure of the degree of connectedness to outside communities.            In this
model we separately control for the amount of cash income earned by the household to
ensure we do not inadvertently capture an effect of having extra cash in the household.
Again, we observe consistent results, where both bridging and bonding social capital
reduce firewood collection on public lands, while an increase in one type of social capital
reduces the effect of the other. This latter effect is not significantly different from zero.
   In models (4) and (5), we use access to communications media as a proxy for
connections to the outside world.         Specifically, we ask whether ownership of a
television or a phone affects the amount of firewood collected, while controlling for total
household assets to ensure we are not merely capturing the effect of wealth. We find
that ownership of a television or a phone reduces consumption of firewood on public
lands, and that owning a television reduces the effect of bonding social capital.     We see
a similar trend in the case of phone ownership, but the coefficient is not significantly
different from zero.
   Last, in model (6), we test an alternative to the main specification above, where our
measure of bonding social capital used residuals from a regression on the amount
expected regressed against education.     In model (6), we simply use the amount players
expected to be returned in the trust game, and find our results substantively unchanged.
   To check whether our results are robust to model specification, we test several other
models as reported in Appendix 6, Table A2.          First, one might be concerned that a
household with a larger number of members at home will demand more fuel and, by
definition, have fewer members working outside the township (lower measure of bridging
social capital). In our first alternative model, we include the number of household
members in residence.      We find the results do not change and that the effect of the
number of household members is not significant.       This lack of significance persists over
numerous other specifications, so we leave the number of household members out of our
primary specifications.    Second, since the amount of fuel is determined alongside
household expenditure, we include total household expenditure less expenditure on

                                               28
energy (model 2 in Table A2). We also instrument for total expenditure using household
assets and log of total household assets, and we find little change in our results (model 3).
We also both include the number of households in the village and cluster our standard
errors by natural village and find no qualitative change in our results.
   To address the concern that our results may be driven by the specific form of our
dependent variable, we use consider household firewood collection on its own and per
mu as opposed using the amount collected relative to the total consumption per mu of
others in the natural village. We present these results in Appendix 6, Table A3.       In all
cases, the effects of the two types of social capital remain unchanged.

5.2 Interaction Effects
   In all of the cases above, we find that expected returns to bridging social capital
decrease CPR consumption, which is contrary to the prediction in Proposition 2 but
consistent with Proposition 3 if the household faces a subsistence constraint.     Thus, we
want to test whether the estimated effect of bridging social capital is capturing the fact
that many of our households are near subsistence levels of consumption. By facilitating
insurance against negative shocks, bridging social capital may give households outside
options to meet their subsistence needs (rather than over-use the CPR).
   Our model implies that bridging social capital makes households less vulnerable to
social sanction for overconsumption.     We may expect to see the effect of the decrease in
vulnerability most strongly when the resource is depleted and sanction for
overconsumption is high.       Thus, bridging social capital may reduce households’
sensitivity to the CPR resource quality, making it more difficult to sustain a cooperative
outcome when the resource is already depleted.
   We interact the bridging and bonding measures with CPR quality and household
productive assets, to observe if the overall resource quality or being near subsistence
changes the effect of either social capital on CPR use.    Results are presented in Table 7.
We do not observe the quality of the CPR itself, so we use the forest yield of the land in
the natural village as a proxy.      We use productive assets to measure how close a

                                               29
household is to subsistence. Productive assets may be better than total assets to reflect a
household’s ability to respond to a negative income shock, because total assets not be
fungible and may not increase income (Liverpool-Tasie and Winter-Nelson 2011).
   In Table 7, we first present the results of the interaction terms with bonding social
capital (model 1), with bridging social capital (model 2) and then both (model 3).
Models (4) through (6) repeat models (1) through (3) but include natural village fixed
effects.   First, we see that neither bonding interaction term is significantly different from
zero. By contrast, bridging social capital reduces firewood collection if people are
asset-poor, but also reduces people’s sensitivity to resource capacity.          Households
appear to be relatively insensitive to resource quality (p-stat of 0.259 at average levels of
bridging). While at high levels of bridging social capital, villagers actually collect more
firewood when communal forests are depleted in a rush to consume the resource before it
is gone.   Thus, high levels of bridging social capital may facilitate the tragedy of the
commons.

     As our model predicts, bridging social capital reduces the consumption of firewood
from public lands when the household is asset-poor. At the average level of productive
assets in our sample, and at average levels of resource capacity and bonding social capital,
bridging social capital still significantly reduces consumption of the CPR. At the 75th
percentile of productive assets, bridging social capital no longer has a significant effect
                                                               31
on CPR consumption; at the upper end of productive assets, bridging social capital
actually increases consumption of the CPR, although this effect is not significantly
different from zero. Given that our communities are in some of the poorest regions of
China, the majority of our sample may live close to the subsistence level and has little
ability to absorb negative income shocks.
   In short, while bridging social significantly reduces consumption of the CPR on
average, when forests are depleted or when the household is poor, bridging social capital
no longer limits CPR consumption. By contrast, the effect of bonding social capital is
not affected by resource quality or asset poverty.       As before, however, the effect of
bonding social capital it is limited by higher levels of bridging social capital.

5.3 Endogeneity of Social Capital
   One might well be concerned that bridging and bonding social capital, along with
forest management, are outcomes of underlying individual and community characteristics
and are therefore co-determined.        To address this concern about endogeneity, we
instrument for bridging and bonding social capital.
   Finding variables that influence trust but do not affect forest management except
through trust is difficult.   We target potential instruments that may facilitate village
communication or assistance, or ones that capture household exposure to other,
non-forestry forms of collective action. While all of our instruments pass the exclusion
restriction, none is unassailable.   Therefore, we present results using five different sets
of instruments for bonding social capital – two at the individual level, two using both
individual and village-level instruments, and one set strictly at the administrative village
level.   For these last two sets of instruments, we use township-level fixed effects in both
the first and second stages. We believe our instruments for bridging social capital are
less controversial, and so we stick to a single set of instruments.
   We instrument for bonding social capital first by noting that if a household
experiences a shock that engenders assistance from fellow villagers, the household may
increase its trust.   Thus, we use whether a household had a member who was ill in the

                                                32
previous year. Second, we heard during field work that women often have stronger
village connections than the working men in the household who are often away on the
farm, so we use the number of women in the household to instrument for bonding.                  Last,
we use the amount of money spent on gifts as an instrument.               For this latter variable to
be a valid instrument, gifts must be driven in part by exogenous shocks, such as gifts
induced by weddings or festivals.
     Conceptually, gifts may themselves be driven by goodwill induced by successful
resource management, so our second two sets of instruments for bonding social capital
rely on village-level information.        We first include the standard deviation of housing
assets across the village to capture a measure of observable income inequality.                    We
chose housing assets, which are visible to fellow villagers.           The assumption here is that
larger differences in conspicuous wealth may erode trust within a village.               Second, we
use whether the village has a fishpond. A village with a fish pond will have more
incentive to develop rules regulating its use, which in turn might build management
capacity and trust.     In the first model with village-level instruments, we include the
number of members struck with illness that year, to capture some household-level
variation.   Third, we use the number of households in the village engaged in the
exchange of agricultural labor.      In the one model with only village-level instruments, we
aggregate our individual instruments to the village level in hopes of reducing potential
endogeneity; thus we include the total village expenditure on gifts and the total number of
women in the village.
     The percent of days members of a household spend working outside the township is
likely a function of accessibility and whether the household has surplus labor. Thus, our
instruments for bridging social capital include the number of household members who are
registered under the Chinese national registration (hukou system) as non-agricultural,
making migration easier.13       Second, we include the number of children at home under
the age of 6, assuming that young children increase the need for labor at home. Third,

13
   The hukou system prevents households registered as agricultural from benefiting from public services
such as education or social security in urban centers.
                                                    33
we include household size to capture the amount of labor available.                             In all instrumented
regressions, we control for the number of individuals in the household in the second stage.
Because the percent of days spent outside the township is censored at zero, we estimate
the first stage using a tobit and use both the predicted levels and predicted probability of
observing a non-zero outcome as instruments. We then include these predictions as
instruments in a three-staged least squares regression.                         Results from the first stages are
given in Tables 8 and 9.

     As can be seen in Table 8, the level of trust is positively affected by the number of
sick people in the household and the number of women in the household.                                Higher trust is
also related to expenditure on gifts.                  A higher standard deviation on house values is
correlated with lower trust, and having a fishpond in the village was correlated with
higher trust.        We also observe that trust increases with the number of households
engaged in agricultural labor exchanges, an alternative form of cooperation. In Table 9, it
can be seen that both the household hukou and the number of children under the age of
six affect the percent of days worked outside the village. Given that the error terms for
the various first stage regressions are likely correlated to eachother, we use three-stage
least squares for our regression. Table 10 presents our results for firewood consumption
with instrumented social capital.14

   Because the regression formulation here is slightly different from those presented in Table 4, we also run
these equations as a seemingly unrelated regression for comparison. We get results qualitatively similar to
those in Table 10.

    As can be seen in Table 10, these results are qualitatively very similar to those above
in Table 4, with the instrumented bonding and bridging social capital reducing firewood
collection on public lands, but with each type of social capital offsetting the effect of the
other. Yet the instrumented social capital terms have larger coefficients than in the
earlier OLS results. The large coefficient on each type of social capital in Table 10 is
offset by an equally larger coefficient on the interaction term, with the marginal effects at
the median relatively similar in magnitude to those reported in Table 5.                              All coefficients
on the other variables have similar magnitudes but larger standard errors, as one might

                                                                36
expect.      In all cases, the instruments appear both to be strong and to satisfy the exclusion
criterion.    Further, we see some evidence that bonding social capital is endogenous
when we use individual-level instruments and natural village fixed effects. When we
use village-level instruments, and in all cases for bridging social capital, we find no
statistical evidence that social capital is endogenous.

5.4 Village Social Capital Stock
     One last concern that readers may have with our approach is that instead of directly
measuring the village-level stock of social capital, we use the household-specific
expected returns from social capital to identify the effect of social capital on resource
consumption. One might first be concerned that the expected returns are not necessarily a
good measure of the stock of social capital, in that they will be a function of (1) the actual
stock, (2) individual-specific abilities to capture benefits from that stock and (3)
individual perceptions of possible returns.               Thus, whether the household head is
inherently optimistic or a misanthrope will affect the measure of individual returns from
social capital.    Second, much of the literature on social capital focuses on social capital
as essentially a form of community public good, common to all community members.
Thus, if the individual measures are truly capturing the effect of village level social
capital, then we might see village-level bonding and bridging also affecting CPR
management.
     As noted above, the reason we use the individual-level measures of returns from
social capital is first that this measure is consistent with our model, where we allow
individuals to benefit heterogeneously from the village-level social capital stock.                   We
are also concerned with unobservables at the village level that might bias our results.
That said, we are interested in observing how household consumption is affected by
village levels of bridging and bonding social capital. We first use the sum of the expected
returns from bonding and bridging social capital to proxy for total social capital stock.15

15
   While bonding social capital is often thought of as a village-level stock, each household may have
different levels of bridging social capital stock. That said, one might expect that the village average of
bridging social capital might affect household firewood consumption. In particular, one household’s level
                                                     37
Because of our limited number of natural villages (60), we do not interact bridging and
bonding in this aggregate case. These results are presented in columns 1 and 2 of Table
11. As can be seen, the village-level sum of bonding social capital has no discernible
effect on consumption. We may not observe a clear result because of the identification
problems listed above. However, we see a consistent positive effect of aggregate levels
of bridging social capital on household CPR consumption. We see this effect despite
strong evidence that individual level bridging decreases household CPR consumption.
Thus, having more households with access to outside income sources appears to erode a
community’s ability to sustain CPR management, while allowing each household with
those contacts to reduce their own consumption.
   It is not clear how to appropriately aggregate the individual expected returns to
generate a measure of the village-level stock of social capital.                    Merely summing
individual expected returns may not be appropriate, because having all individuals with
similar levels of expected returns to bonding social capital may reflect a higher stock of
social capital than having half of the individuals with zero social capital and others with
twice the average. Thus, as an alternate aggregation, we measure the stock of bonding
social capital as the number of households in the natural village who have positive
bonding social capital, measured as the number of households who expected more than
zero dollars returned in the trust game. Similarly, we measure aggregate bridging as the
number of households who have a member who spends at least part of the year working
outside the township (columns 3 and 4 in Table 11). Using these measures, we continue
to see aggregate bridging social capital increase CPR consumption, while this measure of
aggregate bonding social capital decreases consumption of the CPR.




of bridging social capital might affect the sustainable cooperative level of CPR consumption of all other
households in the same village. Thus, we also test the effect of the aggregate level of bridging social
capital on household CPR use.

    One can think of this bonding measure as essentially capturing the effect of having a
limited number of misanthropes in the village.                           If households do not expect to gain
anything from the stock of social capital, they may be more inclined to extract the CPR at
non-cooperative levels because they are not subject to social sanction.                               If a large number
of villagers want to extract the CPR at non-cooperative levels, enforcing a cooperative
level of total extraction will be difficult, if not impossible.                          Management may devolve
into the archetypical tragedy of the commons.

6 Discussion and Conclusions

    We find that bonding and bridging social capital appear to act as substitutes, where
either type of social capital reduces consumption of firewood in the absence of the other,
but where high levels of both do not generate CPR conservation. We first develop a

                                                               39
model where social capital facilitates risk-pooling, and we demonstrate how bridging
social capital might erode the effect of vulnerability to social sanction induced by higher
bonding social capital.
   We next empirically test this relationship between bonding and bridging social capital
by comparing household collection of firewood on public lands to our measures of
individual bridging and bonding social capital.     As in our theoretical model, we find that
bonding social capital reduces consumption, while bridging social capital erodes the
effect of bonding.        As in a special case of our model, we observe that individual
expected returns from bridging social capital reduce CPR consumption.        We explore this
relation by interacting both types of social capital with the productive assets of the
household, intended to measure whether the household is near subsistence levels of
consumption. We also interact social capital with resource quality. We find that at
high levels of assets and low levels of CPR resource quality, a marginal increase in
bridging social capital has no effect on CPR consumption. Since we do not find that
households are particularly sensitive to resource capacity, it is particularly concerning
that connections with outsiders further induces consumption of low-yielding resources.
We believe this may reflect a tragedy of the commons argument, where households hurry
to consume a weakened resource fearing that otherwise their neighbors will rush to
consume it first.
   Our findings are consistent with the results of Dayton-Johnson (2000), who finds that
a higher wage, and therefore higher opportunity cost, decreases a community’s ability to
cooperate in maintaining an irrigation system.        We posit another explanation in this
context, where high wages imply a greater ability to make money from outside the village,
thus reducing the vulnerability to social sanction.    Cases collected in Berkes and Folke
(1998) show that strong kinship-based relationships are essential for promoting and
enforcing collective action. They also find that relatively isolated systems, thus those
with low bridging social capital, perform better.
   Last, because we might be concerned that both types of social capital are jointly

                                              40
determined alongside community resource management, we instrument for bridging and
bonding using various household and village characteristics intended to capture
communication and aid within the village, inequality, or experience with other forms of
collective action.   We find no evidence that these factors directly affect firewood
collection. We also find no evidence that bridging social capital is endogenous, while we
see some evidence that bonding might be.
   When we use these instruments, we find similar qualitative results as before, in that
each type of social capital reduces collection of firewood on public lands in the absence
of the other social capital, but that the two types of social capital together appear to act as
substitutes, each decreasing the effect of the other when social capital is high.
In conclusion, we find that when considering a village’s ability to manage a common
pool resource successfully, one may need to consider levels of both bonding and bridging
social capital.   In the choice of community management versus government regulation
to manage a CPR, it is important to understand the effects of the different types of social
capital on the ability of a community to avoid the tragedy of the commons.

cooperative consumption under costly monitoring exists if and only if each user’s
vulnerability to social sanction is close to the average vulnerability.                                             The intuition is that
for each user i, a larger vulnerability to social sanction means lower cooperative
consumption of the CPR and thus lower utility.                                 If user i’s vulnerability is bigger than a
specific critical value, she will deviate from the cooperative consumption, and all the
users will end up with non-cooperative consumption.

For the cooperative equilibrium to be enforceable, we also need the condition that the
utility for each player from cooperative consumption and monitoring must be greater than
the utility from no monitoring together with deviation17, i.e.:

                                        i    is each user’s minimum devotion to monitoring to sustain the

cooperative equilibrium.
Therefore the enforceable consumption for user i is given by (A6) if the condition in (A7)
is satisfied, otherwise the enforceable consumption is equal to the non-cooperative
equilibrium consumption given in (5).

Substituting                 u  ci  cˆi  , cˆi  from equation (8) and ui  cˆi , cˆi  from equation (9) into

the group objective function, we then have:

If the condition (A17) is not satisfied, we then have Uˆ i  Ui , and the cooperative

equilibrium is not sustainable. The consumption level is then the same as:

Now we explore the relationship between the optimal consumption under cooperation

and the vulnerability to social sanction. Using the expression for cˆi in (A13), we can

derive the first derivative of cˆi with respect to  i :

Appendix 3: Proof of Proposition 1

We first derive the first best level of consumption with no monitoring cost ( ci ). Assume

a social planner can costlessly enforce the optimal level of cooperative CPR
consumption.           In this case, the optimal consumption level is the amount that maximizes
the sum of all households’ utility:
                                          N
 c1, c2 ,     , cN   arg max  u  ci , ci  .
                       c1 ,c2 ,   ,cN  i 1


Substituting the specific functional form of utility inform equation (2) and solving the
maximization problem gives the cooperative levels of consumption for each villager and
for the group:

        1 ad                            1 ad
ci           ,                    C          .

                                                      52
Now we compare the sustainable cooperative consumption of CPRs ( Ĉ ) with the first

best level of consumption ( C ) and the non-cooperative consumption ( C ). We consider

the two cases for Ĉ respectively.

Similarly, substituting the expression of Ĉ and C in Ĉ  C and rearranging yields:

In this case, we have C  Cˆ  C .

Simply we have Ĉ  C  C .

Combining the results in case 1 and 2, we show C  Cˆ  C .

Notes: Model (1) controls number of people at home; model (2) controls total expenditure; model (3) instruments total
expenditure using total assets and ln (total assets); model (4) controls the number of households in the administrative
village; model (5) clusters errors at natural village level.   Standard errors in model (1) - (4) are robust and adjusted for
clustering within groups of the same last name within a natural village. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10, 5,
and 1% levels respectively.


As seen in column 3 of Table A2 household assets and log of household assets both pass
the strength of instruments and the exclusion criteria. Further, we see little evidence that
total household expenditure is endogenous.                              In both cases, total expenditure is

                                                                57
associated with a decrease in firewood collection on public lands, implying firewood may
be an inferior good, but the effect of bridging and bonding SC remain unchanged.
In model (4), we include the number of households in the administrative village and its
squared term (divided by 10,000), noting that coordination is likely more difficult over a
larger group.18       As expected, firewood collection by a household first increases and then
decreases in the number of household members.                      That said, these results are only
statistically significant at the 89 percent level.           Last, we test to see if our standard errors
are substantially affected by our choice of unit for clustering (where we have chosen to
cluster by groups of the same last name within a village).                 In model (5), we cluster by
natural village only, and find very similar effects as before.               As other robustness tests,
we include household cash income, total household size, productive assets, and
household head demographics separately. We find no qualitative change in our results.
While in our main results, we consider the amount of firewood collected by the
household relative to the village total, the first two columns of table A3, we present
results using the total firewood collected on public lands as the dependent variable.              In
columns 3 to 5, we use the amount of firewood collected per mu of public lands as the
dependent variable, controlling for consumption per mu by others in the natural village.
In the last model (column 6, Table A3) we follow a procedure informed by a spatial lag
model to instrument for the total of others’ consumption using village characteristics.
Again, the results remain qualitatively the same as those presented in Table 4.

     Regrettably, we do not have the number of households in each natural village.

Notes: The dependent variable in models (1) and (2) is logged amount of firewood collected on public lands. The
dependent variable in models (3) through (6) is logged amount of firewood collected on public lands per area of public
land. Other people’s consumption of firewood is controlled in model (5) and (6), and other people’s consumption is
instrumented by in model (6) using village characteristics such as village resource capacity, total number of pigs, average
slope, and distance to road from forest land. Standard errors in parenthesis are robust and adjusted for clustering within
groups of the same last name within a village. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1% levels,
respectively.
