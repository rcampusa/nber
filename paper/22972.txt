We conduct a laboratory experiment on the determinants of beliefs about own and others’ ability
across different domains. A preliminary look at the data points to two distinct forces:
miscalibration in estimating performance depending on the difficulty of tasks and gender
stereotypes. We develop a theoretical model that separates these forces and apply it to analyze a
large laboratory dataset in which participants estimate their own and a partner’s performance on
questions across six subjects: arts and literature, emotion recognition, business, verbal reasoning,
mathematics, and sports. We find that participants greatly overestimate not only their own ability
but also that of others, suggesting that miscalibration is a substantial, first order factor in stated
beliefs. Women are better calibrated than men, providing more accurate estimates of ability both
for themselves and for others. Gender stereotypes also have strong predictive power for beliefs,
particularly for men’s beliefs about themselves and others’ beliefs about the ability of men. Our
findings help interpret evidence on gender gaps in self-confidence.

1. Introduction

     Beliefs about ourselves and others are at the heart of many economic and social decisions.

One critical area where such beliefs are often found to be biased is abilities of men and women.

Controlling for performance, women are less confident about their own ability in math and

science then men, contributing to differences in financial decision-making, academic

performance, and career choices (Barber and Odean 2001, Buser, Niederle, and Oosterbeek

2014). But what explains these gender gaps in self-confidence? Do they vary by field? How are

beliefs about oneself related to beliefs about others? The existing research typically focuses on

beliefs in limited domains, and on beliefs either only about oneself or only about others, making

it hard to isolate the sources of gaps in self-confidence. In this paper, we try to uncover the

sources of differences in beliefs that women and men hold about their own ability and that of

others in multiple domains of knowledge.

     We do so using new experimental evidence on beliefs that extends earlier findings of

Coffman (2014). In our experiments, participants answer multiple-choice trivia questions in a

variety of categories: art and literature, emotion recognition, business, verbal skills, mathematics,

and sports and games. They are then asked to estimate either their total score on each of the 10-

question category quizzes, or the probability of answering a given question correctly. They also

provide beliefs about the performance of a randomly-selected partner. For some participants,

the gender of this partner is revealed, although we take some pains not to focus attention on

gender. For every participant, we thus have direct measures of their own performance in

multiple categories of knowledge, but also their estimates of both their own performance and

that of a partner. We can also estimate the difficulty of the questions from how many people

answer them correctly, and relate beliefs about performance to question difficulty.

     A preliminary look at the data reveals two striking findings that shape our more detailed

analysis. First, both men and women overestimate performance in all domains, particularly for


                                                                                                 2
difficult questions (for which the share of correct answers is low). Such overestimation occurs

both when evaluating oneself and evaluating others. This suggests that misperception of ability

of both self and others plays a role in belief formation. Second, there are differences in

overestimation across domains. Conditional on both question difficulty and own performance,

men overestimate own performance more in male-typed domains than in female-typed domains.

When evaluating others, participants also overestimate the performance of men more in male-

typed domains than in female-typed domains. This suggests that stereotypes – exaggerations of

true differences in ability between genders -- also play a role in shaping beliefs.

     To understand this evidence, we construct a model that takes into account both

misperceptions of ability related to question difficulty and stereotype distortions and estimate it

with our experimental data. To incorporate misperceptions – which we call Difficulty Influenced

Miscalibration or DIM – we follow Moore and Healy (2008), who analyzed this distortion in a

context unrelated to gender. To incorporate gender stereotypes, we follow Bordalo et al. (2016)

and model belief formation based on Kahneman and Tversky’s (1973) representativeness

heuristic. The model treats beliefs about self and others in a unified framework.

     We then bring the model to the data. For identification, we adopt the perspective that the

effects of DIM on beliefs about performance are orthogonal to those of stereotypes. The former

depends only on task difficulty, whereas the latter depends only on task domain.             Thus,

comparing easy and difficult questions in mathematics should reveal the role of misperceptions.

In contrast, comparing easy questions in mathematics with those in verbal tasks should reveal

the role of stereotypes. Because respondents answer questions of varying difficulty within

categories but stereotypes differ across categories, we can identify both DIM and stereotypes

under this orthogonality assumption. While an approximation, this approach captures the

essential difference between the two hypotheses.




                                                                                               3
     Consistent with Moore and Healy (2008), we find a consistent and strong role for DIM in

shaping beliefs. In evaluating both themselves and others, participants overestimate ability,

particularly in more difficult questions and categories. At the same time, women are better

calibrated than men, providing more accurate estimates of their own ability and that of others.

We also find that gender stereotypes are an important source of belief distortions, in many cases

significantly improving the fit of the model beyond DIM alone. Stereotypes are especially

important in categories perceived as male-typed, such as mathematics and sports. Stereotyping

has more predictive power for men, both in terms of beliefs about their own ability and others’

beliefs about men, than it does for women. Our results thus show that two important but distinct

forces contribute to the often-discussed gender gap in self-confidence.

     Our data and our model speak directly to beliefs about absolute ability: estimated own

performance and estimated performance of others. In many contexts of interest, however, beliefs

about relative ability may best predict decisions – an individual’s estimate of her ranking in a pool

of potential job candidates, or her assessment of her ability relative to peers or competitors. We

consider the implications of our findings for beliefs of relative ability and decision-making using

our data on beliefs about both oneself and others. In our data, men are much more likely than

women to believe their own ability exceeds that of a partner. For both men and women, beliefs

about relative ability and decisions are a function of both the category and the gender of one’s

partner, over and above true gender gaps in performance, suggesting a prominent role for

stereotypes. Moreover, these exaggerated beliefs translate into decisions: in our group decision-

making environment, women contribute answers less often when paired with male than with

female partners, particularly in male-typed categories.

     Our paper follows an enormous literature on beliefs about gender. Coffman (2014) shows

that decisions about willingness to contribute ideas to a group are predicted by gender

stereotypes. Conditional on performance, participants’ beliefs about own relative ability and


                                                                                                 4
decisions to contribute ideas to a group are predicted by the gender-type of the category,

revealing a major role for self-stereotyping in self-assessments of ability. We expand on this work

by formally modeling stereotypes and miscalibration, collecting more data on beliefs about self

and others, including in situations where the gender of one’s partner is known, and estimating

and evaluating a formal model of belief formation.

     Other past work suggests a role for both stereotypes and DIM in shaping beliefs about both

one’s own and others’ ability. Many studies find that gender stereotypes in math and science

influence academic performance (see Kiefer and Sekaquaptewa 2007 and Nosek et al 2009 on

implicit bias and test performance and Spencer, Steele and Quinn 1999 on stereotype threat).

Both experimental and field evidence document a widespread belief that women have lower

ability than men in math (Eccles, Jacobs, and Harold 1990, Guiso, Monte, Sapienza and Zingales

2008, Carrell, Page and West 2010, Reuben, Sapienza and Zingales 2014), although the

differences have been shrinking and now only exist at the upper tail (Goldin, Katz and Kuziemko

2006). Guiso et al. (2008) find that actual male advantage in math disappears in cultures where

gender stereotypes are weaker.

     Research shows that men are generally more overconfident than women, with larger

differences in domains perceived to be male-typed (Lundeberg, Fox, and LeCount 1994, Deaux

and Farris 1997, Pulford and Colman 1997, Beyer 1990, Beyer and Bowden 1997, Beyer 1998,

Coffman 2014). Research on gender differences in competition shows that men are more

confident and more willing to compete in male-typed tasks, but that these differences are reduced

or reversed in female-typed tasks (see Gneezy, Niederle, and Rustichini 2003 and Niederle and

Vesterlund 2007 for the original findings, and Grosse and Reiner 2010, Dreber, Essen, and

Ranehill 2011, and Shurchkov 2012 for the exploration of male versus female-typed tasks).

     Notwithstanding the tremendous amount of work on gender differences in over-confidence,

the sources of such differences remain uncertain, and it is our principal goal is to try to unpack


                                                                                               5
them. From a methodological standpoint, disentangling the sources of gender differences in over-

confidence requires a multi-dimensional dataset. We collect data on beliefs about both own and

others’ ability, across a range of question difficulties and a variety of domains. We examine these

data in light of a theoretical model that allows for identification of distinct contributors to biased

beliefs. This leads to three principal findings. First, beliefs about others are extremely similar to

those about selves; self-motivated beliefs cannot be the principal source of over-confidence.

Second, Difficulty Influenced Miscalibration is extremely important in shaping belief distortions,

for women but even more so for men. Third, stereotypes play a significant role in belief distortion

and, at least in our sample, stereotype distortions are more pronounced for men than they are for

women. It is clear from the evidence that the sources of differences in over-confidence are a

matter of at least two-fold, and there may be other factors that have escaped our scrutiny.

     In Section 2, we describe our experiment. In Section 3, we show some preliminary evidence.

Section 4 then presents a formal model, while Section 5 presents our estimates of the model using

the experimental data. Section 6 looks at beliefs about relative performance and strategic

decisions. Section 7 concludes.



2. Experiments and Performance

2.1 Experimental Design

     We ran two laboratory experiments to gather data on stated beliefs, one conducted at Ohio

State University and one conducted at Harvard Business School (but with most subjects being

Harvard College undergraduates). Our goal is to collect detailed data on beliefs about both own

and others’ ability across a variety of domains and to link these beliefs to strategic decisions. The

full instructions and materials for each experiment are provided in Appendix A.

     Both experiments had the same basic three part structure, closely resembling the

experimental design of Coffman (2014). In Part 1, each participant answers questions in each


                                                                                                  6
category, giving us a measure of their ability in each category. Participants are then randomized

into groups of two. In Part 2, we use the procedure developed by Coffman (2014) to measure

willingness to contribute answers to their group. In Part 3, we collect incentivized data on beliefs

about their own and their partners' ability in each category. The categories vary in their

associated gender stereotype.           At Ohio State, we use Arts and Literature, Verbal Skills,

Mathematics, and Sports and Games; at Harvard, we replace Verbal Skills and Mathematics with

Emotion Recognition and Business.

      Our prior was that Arts and Literature, Emotion Recognition, and Verbal Skills would be

categories that participants considered female-typed, believing women to have an advantage on

average, while Business, Mathematics, and Sports and Games would be considered male-typed.

Coffman (2014) found that participants perceived Arts and Literature as female-typed and Sports

and Games as male-typed, in line with observed performance differences in the sample. Our

priors for Verbal Skills and Mathematics are guided by both observed gender differences on

large-scale          standardized            tests         such          as         the         SAT          (see

http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/research/2013/TotalGroup-2013.pdf                            for

data) and by prior experimental studies that have successfully varied the perceived gender-type

of the task by using verbal versus math tasks (for instance, Shurchkov 2012). Neuroscientists and

psychologists have identified a female advantage in the ability to recognize emotion (Hall and

Matsumoto 2004). We confirm these priors by asking participants at the end of the experiment

which gender knows more about each category. 2

      Participants complete the experiment using a laboratory computer at an individual station

and can work at their own pace. In each part, they can earn points. At the end of the experiment,


2 We ask participants at the end whether they believe men or women, on average, know more about each category.
They use a sliding scale ranging from -1 to 1 to indicate their answer, with -1 labeled as “women know more” and 1
labeled as “men know more”. Indeed, participants report Arts and Literature, Verbal Skills, and Emotion Recognition
as areas of female advantage (means of -0.30, -0.28, -0.18, respectively) and Business, Mathematics, and Sports and
Games as areas of male advantage (means of 0.15, 0.18, 0.50, respectively).


                                                                                                              7
one part is randomly chosen for payment; participants receive a fixed show-up fee and additional

pay for every point earned in the selected part. 3

      The key departure from Coffman’s (2014) experiment is that when participants are

assigned to groups, we randomly vary whether the gender of one’s partner is revealed. This

allows us to collect direct measures of beliefs about male and female performance. To do this, we

must reveal the gender of one’s partner. We sought to avoid messages that explicitly referred to

gender (for instance, "your partner is a woman"), as we worried about possible experimenter

demand effects and making participants aware of the gender focus of the experiment. At Ohio

State, we used photos to convey gender. By providing a photo of a partner, we convey gender but

may also introduce confounds – for instance, by triggering a reduction in social distance between

partners (Bohnet and Frey 1999) or by rendering race or attractiveness top of mind.

      For that reason, in the Harvard experiment, we introduced a novel method for revealing

gender – and only gender. At the moment of assignment to groups, the experimenter announced

each pairing by calling out the two participant numbers. In the treatment where gender was not

revealed, the experimenter simply announced the pairings. In the treatment where gender is

revealed, participants were asked to call out, “Here”, when their participant number was

announced. Because of the station partitions within the laboratory, it is highly likely that in this

treatment, a participant could hear the voice of his or her assigned partner, but not see them. By

restricting to the word, “Here”, we limit the amount of conveyed information (through tone of

voice, friendliness, etc.). In this way, only gender is likely to be revealed. 4 In analyzing the data,



3 At Ohio State, participants earned a $5 show-up fee plus an additional dollar for every point earned in the selected
part. At Harvard, participants earned a $10 show-up fee, $15 for completing the experiment, and an additional $0.25
for every point earned in the selected part. These differences reflect the requirements related to minimum and
average payments at the two laboratories.
4 We validate this approach by asking a subset of participants at the conclusion of the experiment to guess the gender

and ethnicity of their partner. Participants are significantly more likely to identify the gender of their partner in
treatments where the voice is heard (correctly identified in 92% of cases where voice is revealed compared to 67%
of cases where voice is not revealed, p<0.0001); they are not significantly more likely to identify ethnicity (correctly
identified in 47% of cases where voice is revealed compared to 39% of cases where voice is not revealed, p=0.25).


                                                                                                                   8
we group all participants who received a photo or heard a voice as our “knew gender” treatment,

performing an intent-to-treat analysis.

     We designed the experiment to minimize the extent to which participants were focused on

gender. Participants see no questions that refer to gender until the final demographic and

debriefing questions at the end of the experiment. Relative to a paradigm where gender is made

prominent, our findings may underestimate the importance of stereotypes, but we can be more

confident that the effects we observe are not due to experimenter demand.

Part 1 Participants answer 40 multiple-choice questions, 10 in each category. Each question has

five possible answers. Participants receive 1 point for a correct answer and lose 1/4 point for an

incorrect answer; they must provide an answer to each question. All questions appear on the

same page, labeled with their category, in a random order. The goal of Part 1 is simply to collect

a measure of individual ability in each category.

Intervention Following completion of Part 1, participants are told that they have been randomly

assigned to groups of two. Participants in the control condition receive no further information

about their partners. Treated participants at Ohio State are given a photo of the partner, and at

Harvard they hear the partner answer a role call with the single word “here”. At Ohio State,

treatment assignment occurs at the participant level; due to the nature of the intervention,

treatment assignment occurs at the session level at Harvard.

     Following the intervention in each experiment, participants are asked to estimate their own

and their partner's performance in Part 1. For each category, they are asked to guess the number

of correct Part 1 answers both they and their partner had. Participants receive an additional point

for every correct guess, incentivizing them to give the guess they think is most likely to be correct.

Part 2 Participants make decisions about their willingness to contribute answers to new

questions in each category to their group. Participants are given 40 new questions, 10 in each

category. As in Part 1, all questions appear on the same page, in a randomized order, labeled with


                                                                                                  9
their category. For each question, participants must indicate both their answer to the question

and how willing they are to have it count as the group answer. Both partners earn 1 point if the

group answer submitted is correct and lose 1/4 point if the group answer submitted is incorrect.

     To measure willingness to contribute, we use the "choose a place in line" procedure

introduced in Coffman (2014). For each question, participants are asked to choose a place in line

between 1 and 4. The participant who submits the lower place in line for that question has her

answer submitted as the group answer. To break ties, the computer flips a coin to determine

whose answer is submitted. Choosing a lower place in line weakly increases the probability that

one’s answer is submitted for the group. We interpret place in line as willingness to contribute

one’s answer for the group.

Part 3 We collect data on question-specific beliefs from participants. Participants revisit the same

40 questions from Part 2. For each question, they are asked to estimate (a) the probability of their

own answer being correct and/or (b) the probability of their partner's answer being correct.

Keep in mind that participants are not aware of what answers their partner has chosen.

Depending on their treatment, some participants know their partner’s gender and others do not.

     We apply the incentive-compatible belief elicitation procedure used by Mobius, Niederle,

Niehaus, and Rosenblatt (2014), implemented exactly as in Coffman (2014). Participants see

each of the 40 questions they saw in Part 2 again. At Ohio State, for every question they are asked

to provide their believed probability of answering correctly, and their believed probability their

partner answered correctly. At Harvard, we split these belief elicitations into two parts. For 20

of the 40 questions, (5 in each category faced by the participant), they provide their own believed

probability of answering correctly. For the remaining 20 questions, they provide their believed

probability of their partner answering correctly. This is done as a separate section of the

experiment. For each mode of belief solicitation, truth-telling is profit-maximizing regardless of

the participant’s risk preferences (details in Appendix A).


                                                                                              10
     Following the completion of the beliefs sections, participants answer demographic

questions about themselves. Participants receive no feedback throughout the course of the

experiment. When they have completed the study, they receive an answer key that reveals the

answers to each question they saw. They also see what answers were submitted for the group in

Part 2 and which group member submitted them. Participation lasted approximately 90 minutes

and average earnings were approximately $30 per participant.



3. A Look at the Data

     As a first step, we present some raw data from the experiment, focusing on ability and

beliefs. We explore how these measures vary by gender, category, and question difficulty. Table

     Notes: Two participants at Ohio State dropped out when photographs were taken. One participant at Ohio
     State was caught cheating (looking up answers on the internet); she was dismissed. One participant at Ohio
     State was unable to complete the experiment due to a computer failure. All observations from these
     participants and their randomly-assigned partners are excluded from the analysis. P-value is given for the
     null hypothesis of no difference between genders using a two-tailed test of proportions.

     In our sample, men are significantly more likely to have attended a U.S. high school, more

likely to be white, and less likely to be East Asian. Appendix D shows that our results are similar

in a more ethnically-balanced sample of men and women who attended high school in the U.S.

     We begin by exploring average ability and average beliefs across gender and categories. We

use Part 3 data, with question-specific data for each individual. In Figure I, we aggregate the data


                                                                                                           11
by category, asking how stated beliefs compare with observed ability. In Panel (a), we plot men’s

average probability of answering correctly in each category, their average believed probability of

themselves answering correctly, and the average of others’ believed probability of men

answering the question correctly. The others’ belief measure averages across the “partner

beliefs” of all individuals in the known gender treatment paired with a male partner. Panel (b)

presents the corresponding data for women. Categories are ordered by the average gender gap

in performance in a category over the entire experiment, from smallest to largest male advantage.

    The first order observation from Figure I is that stated beliefs, both about self and about

others, far exceed observed ability across all categories. While the average probability of

answering a question correctly is approximately 0.49 (SD 0.50) in our sample, the average

believed probability of answering correctly is 0.63 (SD 0.31). Surprisingly, beliefs about others

also dramatically exceed observed ability, averaging 0.62 (SD 0.25). Differences between


                                                                                                                              12
beliefs about self and about others are quite small in comparison to the large gap between

ability and beliefs in general. Participants greatly overestimate the ability of both themselves

and others across categories – a central fact in these data. 5

     We also observe that categories are of similar difficulty for men and women. In particular,

emotion and verbal are easier categories for both men and women, while art, math, and

business are harder for both genders. There is more divergence for sports, which appears to

be a relatively easier category for men than for women. Overestimation of ability, both for self

and for others, is persistent across the range of category difficulties.

      Finally, men’s beliefs about themselves typically exceed others’ beliefs about them,

particularly as male advantage increases. For women, the opposite pattern emerges: women’s

beliefs about themselves are typically more pessimistic than others’ beliefs about them.

      Figure I reveals several patterns critical to the interpretation of the evidence. Most

important is the substantial overconfidence of the participants not just about themselves, but also

about others. Such evidence is unlikely to be explained just by self-confidence or another form

of motivated beliefs. Rather, it is a general over-estimation of ability. Second, some areas are

more difficult than others, and beliefs about both self and others adjust to differential difficulty.

This too needs to be taken into account. Yet, even in Figure I, some differences between men and

women emerge. Although all participants are overconfident about both themselves and others,

men are relatively more over-confident about themselves than others are about them, and

women are relatively less over-confident about themselves than others are about them.




5 One might worry that beliefs about self anchor reported beliefs about others, leading to our findings. We
attempted to address this concern in our Harvard experiment. Rather than elicit beliefs about self and other
simultaneously, we asked for beliefs about themselves for a subset of 20 questions in Part 3. In a separate
section of the experiment without access to their past answers, participants provided beliefs about their partner
for a separate subset of 20 questions. Even with this design, we observe similar levels of overestimation across
own and partner ability (16 pp for own ability, 14 pp for ability of others).


                                                                                                              13
     In Figure II, we reshape the same data, this time zooming in on differences across genders.

The solid orange line represents the observed male advantage in performance in each category:

male performance significantly exceeds female performance only in math and sports.

Performance gaps are small and statistically insignificant in the other categories.

     The male advantage in self beliefs (the difference in men’s average believed probability of

answering correctly and women’s average believed probability of answering correctly, graphed

as the dashed blue line) is directionally larger than the performance gap in every category.

Relative to the difference in performance, the difference in beliefs about self is particularly

exaggerated for business and sports.

in business and sports. In four of the six categories (art, verbal, math, and sports) participants

believe the male advantage in performance is smaller than it actually is.

     In Figure III, we examine the relationship between question difficulty and beliefs about self.

Figure III plots the believed share of correct answers in terms of self beliefs (y-axis) by the

observed share of correct answers (x-axis), doing this separately for men and women for each

question. Figure III leaves no doubt that men are more self-confident than women, but

particularly so on the more difficult questions. In fact, this has clear implications for the gender

gap in overconfidence.

     In Figure IV, we directly explore the pivotal role that question difficulty plays in determining

this gap. We create two broad buckets of questions: questions of below median difficulty (45%

or more of the participants answered the question correctly) and questions of above median

difficulty. For each category, we then compute the gender gap in overestimation of own ability

for both these easier and harder questions. Overestimation is calculated as the average reported

     The gender gap in overconfidence is largely a function of question difficulty. In fact, the

widely-held view that men are substantially more overconfident than women, particularly in

male-typed domains, holds only for the more difficult questions. For easier questions, the gender

gap in overconfidence is reduced in most categories, even pointing in favor of women in Art,

Verbal, and Math. This suggests strongly that, in our analysis of beliefs, we need to take account

of differences in confidence by gender that depend on the difficulty of individual questions.

     Finally, we point out that, on average, women are significantly better calibrated in our

dataset than men. This is true both when we consider estimates of own performance and that of

others. In Part 3 data, men overestimate own performance by 15 percentage points on average

(i.e. stated believed probability of answering correctly exceeds the observed one by 15

percentage points on average), while women overestimate own performance by 13 percentage

points on average (p=0.02, from regression that clusters observations at the participant level). A




                                                                                                                                      16
similar pattern emerges in self-beliefs of Part 1 scores: men overestimate own performance by

0.29 questions on average while women do so by only 0.06 questions on average (p=0.03).

       In interpreting this evidence, it is helpful to look at men’s and women’s beliefs about others.

We find that women are also better calibrated in assessing the ability of others. In Part 3 data,

women overestimate partner performance by 3 percentage points less than men (11 percentage

points versus 14 percentage points, p=0.07). In Part 1, women overestimate partner performance

by 0.40 questions less than men (0.59 questions versus 0.98 questions, p<0.01). The finding that

women are better calibrated in assessing others, not just themselves, suggests that the gender

gap in beliefs is not only a function of gender differences in self-confidence, but a more general

pattern of gender differences in miscalibration. 6

       This preliminary evidence tells us that we cannot merely look at the basic pictures to

understand the nature of beliefs about gender. Actual ability to answer questions correctly

shapes beliefs – beliefs are not entirely divorced from reality. And, both overconfidence related

to question difficulty, or DIM, and gender stereotypes appear to play a role in shaping beliefs. To

analyze the data, we need to write down a model that describes the various forces that might

influence beliefs about gender. In section 4, we present a formal model of beliefs about gender.

In Section 5, we estimate this model empirically. In Section 6, we further examine the evidence

on stated beliefs and behavior shaped by assessments of relative performance.



4. The Model

       In our model, reported beliefs depart from rationality due to: i) difficulty influenced

miscalibration or DIM and ii) stereotypes. There are two groups of participants, 𝐺𝐺 = 𝑀𝑀, 𝐹𝐹 (for

male         and          female)          and         6        categories          of        questions             𝐽𝐽 ∈


6One concern with this result is that the questions we ask are on average fairly hard (on average, less than half
of the participants answer a given question correctly. The results might be different for very easy questions,
although difficulty is likely a feature of most academic and professional settings.


                                                                                                               17
{𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎, 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒, 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏, 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣, 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚ℎ, 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠}.    Denote               by   𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗   the   probability     that

individual 𝑖𝑖 ∈ 𝐺𝐺 answers the question 𝑗𝑗 ∈ 𝐽𝐽 correctly. We assume that 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 is given by:

                                                                           𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 = 𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 + 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 ,                                               (1)

where 𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 is average performance in category 𝐽𝐽 across the individual’s gender group G.

Component 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 captures individual-specific ability and question-specific difficulty.                                                      At the

gender-category level, the definition 𝔼𝔼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 � = 𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 imposes 𝔼𝔼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 � = 0. Individual 𝑖𝑖 ∈ 𝐺𝐺 is

better than the average member of group 𝐺𝐺 in category 𝐽𝐽 if 𝔼𝔼𝑗𝑗 �𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 � > 0. Question 𝑗𝑗 ∈ 𝐽𝐽 is easier

than the average in category 𝐽𝐽 if 𝔼𝔼𝑖𝑖 �𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 � > 0.



Miscalibration of ability and question difficulty. A large literature documents the fact that

people hold systematically biased beliefs about their own performance. In an experimental

setting similar to ours, although not focused on gender, Moore and Healy (MH 2008) show that

participants robustly and significantly overestimate their own performance in trivia questions

that are difficult, namely where the true share of correct answers is low.

         The psychology of this phenomenon is an open question. People may overestimate their

performance due to self-serving beliefs about own ability, a phenomenon often dubbed

“overconfidence”. Excess optimism for hard questions may also be due to overestimation of low

probability events as in Kahneman and Tversky’s Prospect Theory (1979). 7 In MH (2008), agents

know their average ability in a category, but get a noisy signal of the difficulty of a specific

question or task. Because they are Bayesian, agents anchor beliefs to their known average ability

and discount the weight of the noisy signal. This effect creates overestimation for hard questions,




7 In principle, these forces are not observationally equivalent: “overconfidence” only applies to self-beliefs,
overestimation of low probability event also applies to beliefs about others.


                                                                                                                                               18
but also underestimation for easy questions. Here we do not seek to tease out these specific

mechanisms and refer to their joint operation as “Difficulty Influenced Miscalibration”, or DIM.

      Figure III suggests that beliefs can be well approximated by a (gender-specific) affine
                                                                                                 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷

of answering correctly as an affine transformation of true ability 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 :

𝜔𝜔 ∈ (0,1) participants overestimate ability in hard questions where 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 is low, and may

underestimate it when 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 is high. Perfect calibration in easy questions occurs if 𝑐𝑐 = 1 − 𝜔𝜔 > 0.



Stereotypes. We model stereotypes following BCGS (2016). Beliefs about a group 𝐺𝐺 overweight

its more representative types, defined as the types that are most likely to occur in 𝐺𝐺 relative to a

comparison group – 𝐺𝐺 . Under this approach, stereotypes contain a “kernel of truth”: they

exaggerate true group differences by focusing on the -- often unlikely -- features that distinguish

one group from the other. For example, BCGS (2016) show that beliefs about Republicans and

Democrats in the US exhibit this kernel of truth by overweighting the extreme elements in each

party to the measure of their representativeness relative to the other party.

      In our setup, stereotypes distort the perceived ability 𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 of the average group member. In

each category 𝐽𝐽 there are two types: “answering correctly” and “answering incorrectly”. For

group 𝐺𝐺 (resp. – 𝐺𝐺) the probability of these types is 𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 and 1 − 𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 (resp. 𝑝𝑝−𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 and 1 − 𝑝𝑝−𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 ).

Following BCGS, we say that “answering correctly” is more representative for group 𝐺𝐺 in category

comparisons: the higher is 𝜎𝜎, the more male-female gender comparisons are top of mind. The

case 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃 = 0 describes the rational agent. When 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃 > 0, representative types are overweighted.

This is different from statistical discrimination, which would suggest that individuals 𝑖𝑖 ∈ 𝐺𝐺 are

judged as the average member of group 𝐺𝐺 (overweighting 𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 relative to 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 ) but does not entail

a distortion of 𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 .

average better than women, 𝑝𝑝𝑀𝑀,𝐽𝐽 > 𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹,𝐽𝐽 , the average ability of men is overestimated and that of

women is underestimated. Because gaps in average ability vary across categories 𝐽𝐽, stereotypes

are category-specific. The effect of the gender gap in beliefs is stronger the more gender

9This is a departure from Coffman (2014), who measured the stereotype according to self-reported perceptions
of the gender-type of each category. While the two measures are highly correlated in our data (correlation of
average male advantage in the category and self-reported gender-type perceptions is greater than 0.7), there are
some potentially important discrepancies. In particular, while verbal is perceived as female-typed, men have an
advantage in our sample on average in Part 1 and business is perceived as male-typed, but women perform better
than men in business in Part 3. To the extent that our observed gaps do not coincide with participant expectations
about the gaps in the population, our estimates may understate the effect of stereotypes.

separate influences: difficulty influenced miscalibration 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗  of true ability and the gender

stereotype in category J. Formally, we assume that:

                                 𝑏𝑏
                               𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 = 𝑐𝑐 + 𝜔𝜔�𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 + 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 � + 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃�𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 − 𝑝𝑝−𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 �.        (5)

This equation nests rational expectation for 𝑐𝑐 = 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃 = 0 and 𝜔𝜔 = 1, in which case beliefs only

depend on the objective group and individual-level abilities. If 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃 = 0, but 𝑐𝑐 ≠ 0 or 𝜔𝜔 ≠ 1, then

DIM is the only departure from rational expectations. If instead 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃 > 0, but 𝑐𝑐 = 0 and 𝜔𝜔 = 1,

distortions are driven only by stereotypes.

     We use Equation (5) to organize our empirical investigation. It illustrates the key difference

between stereotypes and miscalibration in our model and identification strategy. Miscalibration,

characterized by the constant 𝑐𝑐 and slope 𝜔𝜔, can be identified by comparing beliefs to objective

ability across questions within a given category 𝐽𝐽 (first and second term in Equation 5). This

effect is orthogonal to gender stereotypes, which are identified by comparing beliefs across

categories (controlling for question difficulty).

     Linking this evidence with the model raises a key issue. Given the natural variation in

performance and gender gaps across samples, which gender-specific performance 𝑝𝑝−𝐺𝐺 is used

when forming stereotypes? For example, stereotypes about a fellow male university student may

be shaped by the comparison with performance of females in the overall population, or by the

performance of female university students. This concern is compounded by the fact that the point

estimate of gender gaps can change signs across Parts 1 and 3. To address this concern, we show




                                                                                                    21
that the overall performance of our model across all categories is similar in different parts of the

experiment. This is the case because our results are driven by the categories (sports and

mathematics), in which gender gaps are large and stable across different measurements. We also

replicate many of our results in a broader sample of online participants where gender gaps may

be more representative of the overall population (see Appendix D).

       As Equation (5) makes clear, our empirical strategy remains qualitatively the same when

analyzing self-beliefs, beliefs about others, and beliefs about specific gender groups. 10 Of course,

the estimated coefficients 𝑐𝑐, 𝜔𝜔, 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃 can well vary across different types of beliefs. For instance, the

strength of DIM as captured by 𝑐𝑐 and 𝜔𝜔 may vary across men and women or across beliefs about

self and others (e.g., self-serving overconfidence should only affect self-beliefs). The stereotypes

coefficient 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃 may be higher if gender comparisons become top of mind when the partner is

revealed to be of the opposite gender. By estimating Equation (5) separately for men and women,

we allow parameters 𝑐𝑐, 𝜔𝜔, 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃, to vary across genders and belief types.



5. Determinants of Beliefs

       As described in Section 2, we record beliefs about own and partner’s performance, both at

the question (Part 3) and topic (Part 1) levels. We now present our estimating equations, discuss

econometric issues, and present the results.

       Equation (5) describes beliefs held by 𝑖𝑖 ∈ 𝐺𝐺 regarding own performance at the question

level (part 3):

                                              𝑏𝑏
                                            𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 = 𝑐𝑐 + 𝜔𝜔�𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 + 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 � + 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃�𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 − 𝑝𝑝−𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 �

In turn, beliefs about own level performance at the category level (Part 1) are:

                                       𝑏𝑏
                          𝑁𝑁𝔼𝔼𝑗𝑗∈𝐽𝐽 �𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 � = 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 + 𝜔𝜔𝜔𝜔 �𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 + 𝔼𝔼𝑗𝑗∈𝐽𝐽 �𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 �� + 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃�𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 − 𝑝𝑝−𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 �.          (6)


10Equation (4) can be equivalently derived by assuming that DIM distortions apply to stereotyped beliefs, in the
             𝑏𝑏                𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠
sense that 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 = 𝑐𝑐 + 𝜔𝜔�𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 + 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 � . In this case, the coefficient in front of the gender gap is 𝜔𝜔𝜔𝜔𝜔𝜔 and not 𝜃𝜃.


                                                                                                                             22
where 𝑁𝑁 is the number of questions in each category. In Equation (6) the DIM parameters 𝑐𝑐, 𝜔𝜔

are measured across individuals with different abilities, not across specific questions within an

individual as in Part 3.

       Beliefs about others are shaped by the same influences as self-beliefs. The belief 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑏𝑏′ →𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 held

by individual 𝑖𝑖′ about the performance of individual 𝑖𝑖 ∈ 𝐺𝐺 on a given question (Part 3) is:

                                 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑏𝑏′ →𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 = 𝑐𝑐 + 𝜔𝜔 �𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 + 𝔼𝔼𝑖𝑖 �𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 �� + 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃�𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 − 𝑝𝑝−𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 �.             (7)

The term 𝔼𝔼𝑖𝑖 �𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 � reflects the fact that 𝑖𝑖′ has no specific information about the ability of 𝑖𝑖 in

question j, so beliefs should depend on the average hit rate of group 𝐺𝐺 for the same question. 11

The average believed score reported in Part 1 for a generic member of 𝐺𝐺 in category 𝐽𝐽 satisfies:

                                𝑁𝑁𝔼𝔼𝑗𝑗∈𝐽𝐽 �𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑏𝑏′ →𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 � = 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜔𝜔𝜔𝜔𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 + 𝜔𝜔𝜔𝜔𝜔𝜔𝜔𝜔�𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 − 𝑝𝑝−𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 �.              (8)

We estimate (7) and (8) using data from participants who knew the gender of their partner.

       A number of econometric issues arise from specifications (5) through (8). Estimation relies

on finding proxies for two objects: i) the gender gap �𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 − 𝑝𝑝−𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 � in performance, and ii)

individual as well as group level ability. We next discuss how we handle these explanatory

variables, starting from the gender gap.

       Under the assumption that 𝔼𝔼𝑖𝑖∈𝐺𝐺,𝑗𝑗∈𝐽𝐽 �𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 � = 0, the gap �𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 − 𝑝𝑝−𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 � is directly observed in

the data as the average performance gap between genders in the sample. With sufficiently large

N, this measure should be reliable. Table II reports these performance gaps measured as the

average number of correct questions (out of 10), separated by gender and topic, for Part 1 and

Part 3 questions. In our sample, men outperform women in sports and math in both parts. Gaps

in the other categories are mixed. In business and verbal skills, men outperform women by a




11According to Moore and Healy, beliefs should be less regressive at the question rather than at the category level
because average difficulty of a category is less noisy than difficulty of a specific question. Similarly, beliefs about self
should be less regressive than beliefs about others because information about others is noisier.

      Fisher-Pitman permutation test for two independent samples.

      The other component of the model is individual ability, which is also measured with error.

The most severe problem arises when dealing with ability in a specific question, as in Equation

(5). We do not observe the objective individual- and question-specific ability 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 ; we instead

observe whether subject 𝑖𝑖 answered question 𝑗𝑗 correctly, denoted by a dummy 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 . Because 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 is

an imperfect measurement of 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 , estimating Equation (5) using 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 involves well-known

econometric issues. First, 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 is noisier than 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 , which causes attenuation bias on the coefficient

𝜔𝜔 on own ability. Second, the noise in 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 can also bias the gender gap coefficient 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃. To address

this issue, we adopt a two stage approach. We first estimate 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 using a set of proxies for

individual-level ability: the individual’s average ability in Part 3 in that category, excluding

a population in many ways similar to our lab sample, men perform better than women in math (527 vs 496 out of
800) and perform equally in verbal questions (critical reading plus writing, 488 vs 492 out of 800), though these
differences are not significant.


                                                                                                            24
question j, 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝐽𝐽\𝑗𝑗 , and the average frequency of a correct answer to that particular question, j, by

all other participants, 𝑝𝑝(𝐺𝐺∪−𝐺𝐺)\𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 . These two proxies do not use information about participant i’s

performance on question j, but still capture her overall ability in the category J and the overall

difficulty of the particular question j. We then implement the first stage regression:

                                𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝐽𝐽\𝑗𝑗 + 𝛼𝛼2 𝑝𝑝(𝐺𝐺∪−𝐺𝐺)\𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 + 𝛼𝛼3 �𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 − 𝑝𝑝−𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 �,

where the gender gap 𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 − 𝑝𝑝−𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 is included from the second stage estimation. The fitted values

𝐼𝐼̂𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 of the above regressions are then used as proxies for true individual- and question-specific

ability 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 . This “instrumental variable” approach helps us reduce biases due to noisy ability

measurement while preserving the interpretation of coefficients as distortions due to stereotypes

or DIM. 13

       Individuals’ ability at the category level, necessary to estimate Equations (6), (7) and (8),

are proxied for with their sample counterparts. Thus 𝑁𝑁 �𝑝𝑝𝐺𝐺,𝐽𝐽 + 𝔼𝔼𝑗𝑗∈𝐽𝐽 �𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 �� in Equation (6) is

proxied by the actual score obtained by individual 𝑖𝑖 in category 𝐽𝐽. Similarly, the ability measures

in Equations (7) and (8) are proxied by the share of correct answers by gender 𝐺𝐺 in question 𝑗𝑗

and in category 𝐽𝐽, respectively.



5.1 Beliefs about own performance

Table III reports the results from specifications (5) and (6) on self-beliefs. Columns I and II use

Part 3 question-level data to estimate (5). We capture ability using the fitted values 𝐼𝐼̂𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 described

above; first stage estimates appear in Appendix C. Columns III and IV present the results for

category-level performance in Part 1.




13 In Appendix C, we perform a robustness check of the two-stage approach described above. We separately add the

proxies for individual ability, 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝐽𝐽\𝑗𝑗 and 𝑝𝑝(𝐺𝐺∪−𝐺𝐺)\𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 to Equation (5). This provides a simpler method to pinning down the
effect of stereotypes; however, we lose the interpretation of 𝑐𝑐 and 𝜔𝜔. Estimated coefficients on the gender gaps are
very similar to the two-stage estimates.

      There are a number of key results. First, DIM is an important determinant of self-beliefs

held by both men and women. We estimate 𝜔𝜔 < 1 (p<0.001) and 𝑐𝑐 > 0 in all specifications,

strongly rejecting the null of rational expectations (𝑐𝑐 = 𝜃𝜃 = 0, 𝜔𝜔 = 1). Together, the estimates

for the constant and the slope imply that participants overestimate their own performance for

difficult questions, where 𝔼𝔼𝑖𝑖 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 is low (around 20%, correct by chance) and underestimate their

performance slightly for easy questions (where 𝔼𝔼𝑖𝑖 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 closer to 1), as 𝑐𝑐 + 𝜔𝜔 < 1 (in Columns III

and IV the intercept must be divided by 10). DIM distortions are smaller in Part 1 than in Part 3

data (namely 𝑐𝑐 is lower and 𝜔𝜔 is higher in Columns III and IV than in Columns I and II). 14

      The estimates also reveal gender differences in DIM. In both Part 3 and Part 1, we estimate

lower constants and higher slopes for women than for men, suggesting that DIM is stronger for

men. This echoes the findings we reported in Section 3 that, on average, men overestimate own

performance more than women do, particularly for more difficult questions. This is consistent




14This is consistent with both the Moore and Healy mechanism (subjects perceive a more precise signal of average
difficulty after observing 10 questions in a subject than after observing a single question) and with overestimation of
small probabilities (which exerts a smaller distortion on the average score from several questions).


                                                                                                                                                                                  26
with previous studies that document that women are less overconfident and better calibrated

than men (Deaux and Farris 1997, Lundeberg, Fox, and LeCount 1994).

      Crucially, we find that stereotypes are a significant predictor of self-beliefs held by men in

both Parts 1 and 3. The effect is large. Specification I shows that a 5 percentage point increase in

male advantage in a question (roughly the size of the male advantage in math) increases beliefs

about own probability of answering correctly by 0.27*5=1.35 percentage points relative to

rational expectations in Part 3. Turning to Specification III on Part 1 beliefs, a 0.75 question

increase in male advantage in a category, again roughly equivalent to the male advantage in math,

increases beliefs about performance in that category by 0.55 questions. If we scale Part 1 results

to the effects for a single question to benchmark against Part 3, we estimate that the same 5

percentage point increase in male advantage increases men’s beliefs of answering a given

question correctly by an estimated 3.7 percentage points. 15

      For women, stereotypes are only a significant predictor of self-beliefs in Part 3. In this case,

the same 5 percentage point increase in male advantage in a category leads to approximately a

1.05 percentage point decrease in believed probability of answering correctly. However, we

estimate no impact of stereotypes on women’s self-beliefs in Part 1 data.



5.2 Beliefs about others’ performance

Table IV reports the results from regression specifications (7) and (8) on beliefs about others’

performance on individual questions (Part 3, Columns I and II) and at the category-level (Part 1,

Columns III and IV). We use data from participants who knew the gender of their partner, and we



15 To compare order of magnitudes across Parts 1 and 3, it is important to keep in mind that Part 1 measures beliefs
of total score on a 10-point scale and Part 3 measures beliefs of probability of answering correctly on a 1-point scale.
Thus, when making direct comparisons, we scale the Part 1 results to translate to an impact on a single question.
Part 1 and Part 3 also vary in other potentially important dimensions. In particular, beliefs are elicited in two
different ways across these parts. In Part 1, participants are incentivized to guess their score by receiving a fixed size
bonus payment for guessing correctly and nothing otherwise. In Part 3, participants are incentivized to guess their
probability of answering correctly using a procedure similar to a BDM.


                                                                                                                   27

separately by gender of the evaluator.

     Table IV reveals some similarities to but also some differences from the self-beliefs

estimates of Table III. First, DIM also plays a role in beliefs about others, overestimating ability

on hard questions and slightly underestimating it on easy ones. These belief distortions are more

severe here than in the case of self-beliefs (particularly on hard questions). This finding could be

explained by the Moore Healy mechanism, because signals of difficulty for others are presumably

noisier than those for self. This finding also suggests that the strong overestimation of own

performance we observe in our data is driven not only by conventional self-serving biases or

“overconfidence”, but also by more general miscalibration in estimating task difficulty and ability.

     Second, stereotypes play a consistent and significant role in shaping stated beliefs about

men, in all sets of elicited beliefs. Once again, the quantitative impact of stereotypes is important,

particularly in Part 1. The evidence on the role of stereotypes for beliefs about women is mixed,



                                                                                                                                                                                    28
just as it was for self-beliefs. In Part 3 data (Column II) stereotypes shape beliefs about women

as predicted by the model (and as they did for self-beliefs). In Part 1 data, however, the effect of

gender gaps goes in the opposite direction: beliefs about women are more optimistic in categories

where women do worse than men (see Column IV).



5.3 Assessing the Relative Importance of Stereotypes

         In this section we assess model performance by comparing model-predicted beliefs to

observed beliefs in our data. What is the role of stereotypes versus DIM in explaining observed

beliefs? To answer, we compute prediction errors in the full model estimated in Sections 5.1 and

5.2, as well as the prediction errors obtained in a DIM-only version of the model in which we force

the stereotypes parameter to zero. We perform our analysis at the category level, distinguishing

beliefs about self from those about others, and beliefs about men from those about women. 16 For

each comparison, we use the estimates from Tables III and IV, averaging over the Part 1 and Part

3 parameters:



                                   (𝑐𝑐, 𝜔𝜔, 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃) Part 3                Part 1

Figure V shows the results for men. The “DIM-only” model takes the above estimates of c and 𝜔𝜔

but forces 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃 = 0. The “Full Model” includes the estimated value of 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃. The key idea here is to




16   Formally, we compute the directional prediction error in both the full model and the DIM-only model:

     Stereotypes are important predictors of both men’s self-beliefs and beliefs about men.

Beliefs tend to be fairly severely under-predicted in the DIM-only model for men (by 12% on

average). This under-prediction is consistently reduced when stereotypes are added to the

model, bringing the mean observed error down to 4%. The improvement from stereotypes

occurs for both self-beliefs and beliefs about men, but the effect is larger for the latter. Beliefs

about men are under-predicted by 14% in the DIM-only model but only by 4% when stereotypes

are also accounted for. Stereotypes are an especially important determinant of beliefs in

stereotypically male-typed categories, namely business, math, and sports.

     Figure VI presents the results for women. Here adding stereotypes to the model does very

little to reduce mean observed errors. The DIM-only model under-predicts observed beliefs for

emotion, verbal, and math and over-predicts observed beliefs in art, business, and sports.

Because the direction of the errors varies across categories, average errors in the DIM-only model

are small, averaging only 3.2% of observed ability for self-beliefs and 0.2% of observed ability for



                                                                                                 30
beliefs about women. Adding stereotypes to the model has no large impact on predicted beliefs

in any category for women. For self-beliefs, average errors decrease slightly from 3.2% to 2.6%

when stereotypes are added to the model; for beliefs about women, errors increase from 0.2% to

2.4% when stereotypes are added to the model. The only exception are beliefs about female

ability in verbal and math, which are better explained by taking stereotypes into account.

     Our data suggest that stereotypes are not a consistent determinant of women’s beliefs about

themselves or of others’ beliefs about women. This finding raises a concern that stated beliefs are

contaminated by social desirability bias, a desire to appear as though one does not hold negative

views of women. While our experiment is designed to minimize this concern (participants report

beliefs about a single participant rather than a gender difference; beliefs are incentivized and

collected anonymously; gender is not emphasized), we cannot fully rule out such contamination.

     We explore this issue further in two ways. First, in Section 6, we link stated beliefs to

strategic decisions about willingness to contribute, asking about the predictive power of these

beliefs. If stated beliefs were not truthful, we might expect beliefs to have less predictive power

for decision-making, and we find some suggestive evidence of this. Second, in a follow-up

experiment, we collected data on social norms surrounding the appropriateness of expressing


                                                                                             31
 beliefs of gender differences in different domains, and correlate this data with our findings on

 beliefs about women. These results are reported in Appendix B.



     5.4 Self-Beliefs and Context

          In this section, we extend our analysis by testing whether participants’ beliefs about their

 own absolute ability are influenced by the gender of their partner. In particular, we ask whether,

 compared to participants who are paired with a male partner, participants paired with a female

 partner state more optimistic beliefs in male-typed domains (and similarly, less optimistic beliefs

 in female-typed domains). This type of context-dependence is a central prediction of BCGS

 (2016). While BCGS (2016) present evidence of context dependence in an abstract laboratory

 experiment (participants make guesses about the color of t-shirts worn by cartoon characters)

 and in field data on political beliefs, here we conduct a more demanding test of context

 dependence with our data. We collect data on absolute beliefs of own ability in a given question

 or domain, where a participant likely has much stronger priors compared to our previous

 experiments. If the same individual believes she is more likely to answer a particular math or

 sports question correctly simply because she is aware her partner is female rather than male, this

 is arguably quite strong evidence of the power of context dependence.

          Such context dependence is a distinctive prediction of our model of stereotype distortions,

 relative to the DIM channel (or rational beliefs). 17 However, this test raises two issues. On the

 one hand, gender may already be top of mind even if the partner’s gender is not known (i.e., it

 might be that 𝜎𝜎 = 1 already in our estimates of Equations 5 and 6). Second, and more important,

 bringing cross gender comparisons to the top of mind may strengthen the social desirability bias.

 For instance, a male participant learning that his partner is female may become reluctant to


17A similar notion has been explored by work on the “Stereotype threat” hypothesis (Steele and Aronson 1995,
Spencer, Steele, and Quinn 1999). However, note that in our experiment, beliefs are elicited after the performance,
whereas the stereotype threat operates by reducing actual performance.


                                                                                                               32
report high self-confidence in stereotypically male subjects such as math, business, or sports. We

keep those caveats in mind as we present our tests.

         In Table V, we repeat the specifications of Table III in Section 5.1 but restrict the sample to

individuals who know partner’s gender. We include a dummy for a known female partner and we

interact it with own gender advantage. If knowledge of the partner’s gender causes gender

comparison to become more top of mind (i.e., if 𝜎𝜎 increases), beliefs about self should go further

in the direction of gender gaps. Men paired with women should be more optimistic about self in

categories with male gender advantage (positive sign on partner female x own gender advantage

in Part 3 for men), and women paired with women should be less optimistic in categories with

female advantage (negative sign on partner female x own gender advantage).

         The evidence is directionally consistent with the predicted signs, but the effects are not

statistically significant. 18 For both men and women in Part 3, the point estimates suggest that a

given increase in own gender advantage produces more than twice as large of an increase in

beliefs about self when paired with an opposite gender partner than a same gender partner. For

Part 1, we estimate that men react approximately 50% more strongly to own gender advantage

when paired with a woman than paired with a man. For women in Part 1, the effect of own gender

advantage is estimated to be directionally positive when paired with a male partner, but

directionally negative when paired with a female partner, consistent with our hypotheses.We can

also pool the data across our male and female participants to increase statistical power (recall

that the above analysis restricts attention only to participants who knew the gender of their

partner, reducing our statistical power relative to Table III). In Appendix C4, we present a

specification that includes all participants who knew the gender of their partner, regressing self-

beliefs on male advantage in the category, a dummy for partner being female, and the interaction

of these two terms. Context dependence predicts a positive sign on this interaction for all

participants, with self-confidence rising in male-typed domains more when paired with a female

rather than male partner. The estimated interaction is unsurprisingly of similar magnitude to the

estimates provided in Table V, but the increased power from the pooled sample allows for the

identification of a marginally significant effect in Part 3 data (estimated interaction of 0.19, SE of

0.093, p-value of 0.05), and a marginally insignificant effect in Part 1 data (estimated interaction

of 0.25, SE of 0.17, p-value of 0.14). Full regression results for this specification are reported in

Table A7 in Appendix C4. Thus, while the effect sizes are modest and not tightly-estimated, there

does seem to be some suggestive evidence of context dependence in our data. Appendix C4, Table

A8 also shows that this effect is not limited to gender: among the sample of participants who

received photographs of their partner, partner ethnicity has a large and significant impact on self-

beliefs.




                                                                                                34
6. Beliefs of Relative Ability and the Consequences for Decision-Making

     Our model and our data deal with beliefs of absolute ability: one’s own and partner’s

believed probability of answering correctly. However, in many decision-making contexts, it is

beliefs of relative ability that may be most predictive. In deciding whether to compete in a

tournament, decisions are a function of whether an individual believes she can outperform her

partner; in deciding whether or not to apply for a job or promotion, decisions are likely a function

of believed rank within the pool of potential candidates. It is then important to check how the

patterns in believed absolute ability we identify translate into beliefs of relative ability. In this

section, we first document how the determinants of beliefs explored in Section 5 – DIM,

stereotypes, and context dependence -- combine to produce gender differences in beliefs of

relative ability. We then take this analysis from beliefs to strategic decisions within a group, and

examine how our participants make decisions about when to contribute ideas.

     In Figure VII, we present data on beliefs of relative ability, focusing on both partner gender

and category. For each participant who knew the gender of their partner, we construct the gap in

average beliefs about own ability and average beliefs about partner’s ability at the category level,

using the Part 3 data. We ask how this believed ability gap between self and partner varies with

partner gender and category. Panel (a) presents believed relative ability for men with male

partners in blue and female partners in red. Panel (b) presents the same measures for women.

     Figure VII clearly shows that the patterns of beliefs documented in Section 5 have important

implications for beliefs about relative ability. For men paired with male partners, believed

relative ability is quite constant across the categories. In every category, men believe they are

roughly 4 percentage points more likely to answer the question correctly than their male partner

is. For men paired with female partners, relative beliefs vary sharply with category. In emotion

and art, men believe they are less likely to answer correctly than their female partner; in business,




                                                                                               35
verbal, and math, the believed ability gap is small but positive; in sports, men believe they are

more than 10 percentage points more likely to answer correctly than their female partner.

                    Compared to the men, women generally have lower beliefs of relative ability – they do not

believe their own performance exceeds their partner’s performance by as much on average. Their

beliefs vary sharply with gender of partner and category. When paired with male partners,

women believe they outperform their partner in the female-typed categories - emotion, art, and

verbal - but believe they are outperformed by their partner in the male-typed categories - math,

business, and sports. But, when women are paired with other women, relative beliefs vary less

consistently with the gender-type of category. Unlike men, who are always more optimistic about

own ability relative to a same-gendered partner, women’s beliefs are mixed. They believe their

female partner outperforms them in some female-typed categories, like emotion and art, but also

in math. Women believe they outperform their female partner on average in verbal and sports.




                                                                                                                     36
      These patterns suggest that decisions are likely to be a function of gender stereotypes,

reflected in responsiveness to both the domain, the gender of one’s partner, and the interaction

of the two. We can test this using our data from the place in line game, asking how reported beliefs

map into willingness to contribute ideas to the group. Such analysis provides insights into the

consequences of beliefs for group decision-making.

      Accordingly, we regress a participant’s place in line on their beliefs about self, their beliefs

about their partner, and on the observed gender gap. We predict that place in line should

decrease in belief of own ability and increase in beliefs about partner’s ability. We restrict

attention to participants who knew the gender of their partner at Ohio State, where we have a

question-level self and partner belief for each question in Part 3. 19 We first regress place in line

on a set of ability proxies: own performance – proxied by the fitted value of 𝐼𝐼̂𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 as described in

Section 5.1 – and ability of the partner, proxied by male advantage in the category, partner female,

and a partner-female dummy interacted with the male advantage in the category. This regression

is captured by Columns I (men) and IV (women) in Table VI. We then add reported beliefs in

Columns II and V, where we add self-beliefs, and in Columns III and VI, where we also add beliefs

about the partner.

      The first specification (columns I and IV) shows that ability proxies are highly predictive of

place in line in the expected direction. Both men and women move forward by 2 places in line

when they answer correctly. When a man is paired with a woman, the man moves forward as

male advantage increases while the woman moves back in line. Adding self-beliefs (Columns II

and IV) captures much of the explanatory power of ability. Self-beliefs are highly predictive: a

10 percentage point increase in believed probability of answering correctly moves a participant



19Recall that at Harvard participants provided either a self-belief or a partner-belief for each question. This prevents
any question-level analysis that includes both self and other beliefs for that sub-sample. In Appendix C, we explore
the robustness of the results in this section to specifications that allow for inclusion of the Harvard participants and
for other approaches to controlling for ability.

forward in line by approximately 0.25 positions. Controlling for beliefs of own ability reduces the

effect of the gender gap but it remains predictive. 20 Finally, adding beliefs about partner ability

(specifications III and VI) shows these beliefs have a modest impact on willingness to contribute

in the expected direction. But, again, male advantage remains predictive.

       This evidence implies that reported beliefs are informative about choice of place in line, but

fail to exhaust the effect of the gender gap. This result may reflect noisiness of reported beliefs

measures, or failure to capture other factors that are predictive of place in line that correlate with

the gender gap. But it is also consistent with reported beliefs being tainted by social desirability

bias, whereby beliefs underreport the role of stereotypes. While one cannot draw a definitive


20 Conditional on own believed ability, men still move forward in line as male advantage increases when paired with
a female partner, though the effect is approximately 50% smaller than in Specification I. Women also continue to show
a response to gender of partner and male advantage conditional on beliefs of own ability. Beliefs of own ability explain
approximately 40% of the estimated effect of male advantage when paired with a male partner.


                                                                                                                                     38
conclusion from this evidence, it highlights the importance of measuring social desirability bias

in reported beliefs. We offer some preliminary work on this in Appendix B.

         We have shown that beliefs about self and others are predictive of contribution decisions.

The marginal effects presented in Table VI, however, fail to give a sense of the impact of these

decisions: what are the consequences of these place in line decisions for the quantity and quality

of answers submitted by male and female group members? We close this section by more

explicitly tackling this issue. We will say that a participant “contributed” her answer if she

submitted a place in line at least as close to the front as her partner. Women contribute 58% of

their answers when paired with male partners and 68% of their answers when paired with

female partners (p<0.01). 21 These differences are largely driven by the more male-typed

categories – business, math, and sports – across which women contribute 67% of their answers

when paired with women but only 50% of their answers when paired with men (p<0.01). We see

a smaller but directionally similar discrepancy for men: men contribute 74% of their answers

when paired with female partners but 69% of their answers when paired with male partners

(p<0.10). Again, most of the difference stems from business, math, and sports, where the

difference is 78% with female partners versus 68% with male partners (p<0.01).

         These contribution decisions also have a modest impact on group performance. We

measure group performance as the fraction of questions for which a group submits the correct

answer. Our design allows us to ask how performance varies across groups that do not know each

other’s gender and groups in which both partners know each other’s gender. While overall group

performance is quite similar across these treatments (groups submit the correct answer to a

question approximately 55% of the time in each), differences emerge in the cases in which we

might expect gender stereotypes to be most relevant. Among mixed gender groups, group




21   In Appendix C5, we present regressions that further explore these contribution results.


                                                                                               39
performance is 3 percentage points better when gender is unknown (p<0.05). This performance

gap comes primarily from the male-typed categories, for which unknown gender groups perform

7 percentage points better than known gender groups (p<0.01).



7. Conclusion

     Despite substantial evidence that, in some domains, men are more over-confident than

women about their ability, sources of such overconfidence are not completely understood. In this

paper, we presented evidence that overconfidence comes from (at least) two separate sources,

and as such cannot be treated as one homogeneous phenomenon that differs by gender.

     Our experimental design enables us to distinguish two factors shaping male and female

beliefs. The first is overestimation of the ability of both self and others, which rises with the

difficulty of the question, what we called difficulty-influenced miscalibration or DIM. The second

is stereotyping. Because we collect data not only on beliefs about self but also on beliefs about

others, and we do so for a variety of difficulties and domains, we can disentangle these hypotheses

and shed new light on the drivers of overconfidence.

     We found that both DIM and stereotypes shape reported beliefs, but their relative

importance varies significantly between men and women. A significant part of men’s greater self-

confidence is due to more severe miscalibration, but miscalibration does not seem to be driven

by self-serving biases. Rather, men are particularly over-confident, as compared to women, on

the more difficult questions, and not differentially over-confident on easier ones. Importantly,

this holds across subjects.

     In contrast, stereotypes play a larger role in explaining differences in confidence in the male

topics such as math and sports. In our data, this occurs primarily for reported beliefs about men.

We also found that both stereotypes and overestimation are reflected in beliefs about relative

and not just absolute ability, and actually influence behavior. The two factors combine to


                                                                                              40
encourage more self-confident behavior of men, and less self-confident behavior of women,

particularly in male-typed fields.

     Disentangling the causes of the gender gap in self-confidence may prove helpful in

interpreting the existing evidence on this gap, but also understanding how this gap could be

narrowed. To the extent that stereotypes shape this gap, the reality that actual performance

differences between genders are narrowing, especially at the upper tail, suggests that stereotypes

might become less prevalent. Moreover, factors that make gender less top of mind would

diminish the effects of stereotypes on beliefs, especially in areas where actual differences remain.

Although we do not understand the causes of miscalibration as well, the Moore-Healy model

suggests that objective feedback about ability will diminish the influence of DIM on self-

confidence. But, if DIM is driven by factors other than information, such feedback might not help.

     Perhaps the central message of our research is that both stereotypes and miscalibration

shape confidence. It is not one versus the other. Women may be less confident both because

they are better calibrated, and because in some areas they are stereotyped as weaker by both

themselves and others. Our findings can help clarify earlier research, which often treated over-

confidence as a homogeneous phenomenon, but also open up avenues for a more nuanced

understanding of beliefs about gender.

Appendix A: Experimental Instructions and Materials (available on request)

Appendix B: Online Experiment on Social Desirability Bias

     The beliefs reported in the experiment may be partially shaped by social norms, which may

discourage a participant from truthfully reporting believed gender differences in performance.

While we use incentives and anonymity to reduce such concerns, we cannot rule them out. To

examine this issue, we ran an experiment online. We had two main goals. First, we were

interested in understanding whether the patterns of beliefs that we observed in our samples of

college students resembled beliefs patterns from a broader population. Second, we wanted to

collect data on the role that social desirability bias might play in determining stated beliefs.

Online Experiment Design

     The experiment is a simplified version of Part 1 of the laboratory experiments we ran. It

was conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We use the same questions from the six categories:

Art, Verbal Skills, Emotion Recognition, Mathematics, Business, and Sports. To reduce the length

of the study, each participant answers a subset of five of the ten questions in each of the six

categories. They are paid $0.25 for every correct answer they submit.

     After, they are asked about their own and others’ performance. Specifically, they are asked

to guess their own score (out of 5) in each category. They are then asked to guess the score in

each category for a randomly-drawn female MTurk worker and a randomly-drawn male MTurk

worker. The order of these two beliefs questions about others is randomized at the individual

level. These beliefs questions are unincentivized.

     Finally, we attempt to understand whether there may be social desirability bias associated

with stating beliefs about gender differences in ability. We adapt the measure proposed by

Krupka and Weber (2013) to elicit norms. Participants are asked: “Suppose someone thought that

[insert gender] knew more about [insert category] than [insert opposite gender]. How reluctant

do you think they would be to announce this to others?”. Participants use a sliding scale with 7


                                                                                                   44
places, with 1 labeled “Not at all Reluctant” and 7 labeled “Extremely Reluctant” to indicate their

answer. Each participant sees six of these questions, one for each category. We randomize at the

participant level whether they see versions of each question that ask about female advantages

(women knew more) or male advantages (men knew more). The key is that we care about how

participants perceive the social acceptability of reporting beliefs of gender differences. We are

not interested in whether participants believe these statements are likely to be true, or whether

they themselves would be reluctant to report such a difference. For those reasons, we phrase the

question as “suppose someone believed X”. And, like Krupka and Weber (2013), we incentivize

participants to provide what they believe the modal answer among other participants will be.

They receive $0.05 for each of the sliding scale questions for which they provide an answer that

matches the modal answer among the other workers that completed the HIT.

     We ran the experiment in February 2016 in two batches. The first batch of 1,000 posted

HITs only collected performance and beliefs data. The second batch, of 800 posted HITS, collected

the same information on performance and beliefs but also asked about reluctance to report

gender differences. Average participation time was approximately 30 minutes and average

earnings were approximately $5.50.

     We present summary statistics in Table A1.

        Notes: We include data from all participants who finished the Qualtrics link, independent of whether they submitted
      their performance for payment on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We posted 1,800 HITs in two batches (1,000 and 800). We
       had 1,019 participants in the first batch and 812 participants in the second batch (we include all participants who take
               the survey, even if they do not later submit it for payment, allowing us to exceed the posted HIT limit).

      Figure A1 graphs the raw data collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Define

exaggeration of believed gaps as the difference between the believed gender advantage in the

category and the observed gender advantage in the category. Larger exaggeration reflects

believed gaps that exceed observed gaps – in the direction of a female advantage in female-typed

categories and in the direction of a male advantage in male-typed categories. The figure below

plots exaggeration across categories, and overlays them with our measures of reluctance to

report a believed male (female) advantage in male (female) typed categories.

advantages in these categories; Math, Business, and Sports have true gaps in favor of men and we report average reluctance to
                                         report male advantages in these categories.

      Figure A1 shows that: i) believed gaps exaggerate true gaps except in math and business, ii)

reluctance to report a gender’s true advantage (men in this case) is large in precisely these two

categories. While hardly definitive, this evidence suggests that social norms may be an important

factor driving stated beliefs.

      C2. Kitchen Sink Regressions for Self-Beliefs in Part 3

             Table A3 presents the “kitchen sink” specifications for predicting self-beliefs in

      Part 3. We predict own believed probability of answering correctly from our measures of

      Part 3 ability: a dummy for whether the individual answered the specific question

      correctly, share of correct answers in category provided by individual in Part 3 on

      questions other than j, and the share of correct answers on question j by all individuals


                                                                                                                                47
other than individual i. While we cannot recover our parameter estimates for DIM from

this specification, the estimates for the effect of stereotypes are similar to the main

specifications presented in Table III, repeated here as specifications I and II.

C3. Gender of Evaluator

Appendix Tables A4 and A5 present the results on beliefs about others separated by the gender

of the evaluator. For the Part 3 data, when we allow the effects of stereotypes to depend on the

gender of evaluators, we find that stereotypes play a larger role when evaluating partners of the

same gender: relative to men, women rely less on stereotypes when evaluating male partners

(estimated coefficient of 0.04, p=0.59), but rely more when evaluating female partners (estimated

coefficient of 0.40, p<0.001). Men, on the other hand, rely on stereotypes when evaluating men,

but not when evaluating women. In Part 1, there are no significant differences in the magnitude

of the stereotypes effect by gender of the evaluator.

C4. More on Context Dependence
         In Section 5.4 we presented results on context dependence in beliefs of own

ability. In Appendix Table A7, we extend this analysis by presenting pooled

specifications that increase statistical power by examining men and women jointly.

Context dependence predicts that both men and women should react more to the male



                                                                                                                           49
advantage in a category, increasing beliefs of own ability, when paired with a female

partner than when paired with a male partner. This is indeed what we find in the Part 3

data, demonstrated by the significant interaction of partner female and male advantage

in Part 3 in specification I. We find a directionally similar result in the Part 1 data,

though it is not significant (p=0.14).

          We can also consider other evidence of context dependence in our data by

considering reactions to partner ethnicity in the Ohio State sample, where participants

received photographs of their partners. While the experiment was not designed to

consider ethnic stereotypes, the fact that a substantial fraction of the Ohio State sample

is composed of Asian and Asian American students may have activated ethnic as well as

gender stereotypes within the experiment. To explore this, we follow our approach to

studying gender. We construct the average Asian advantage within each category for

both Part 1 and Part 3 data (average Asian performance – average performance of all


                                                                                                                            50
non-Asians in sample). We proxy for ability as we did for gender: in Part 1 analysis, we

simply use Part 1 score in category and in Part 3 analysis, we follow our two-stage

approach, creating fitted values, 𝐼𝐼̂𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 in a first stage that is performed separately on the

Asian and non-Asian samples.

          Recall that we have four categories in the Ohio State data: art, verbal skills, math,

and sports. Asians have an advantage on average in math but are at a disadvantage on

average in the other three categories. Compared to the gender gaps, the ethnicity gaps

are quite large: among the 10 questions in Part 1, the gaps are -1.10 in art, -1.55 in

verbal, 1.62 in math, and -1.23 in sports. Our test of context dependence asks whether

non-Asian participants report less optimistic self-beliefs as the Asian advantage

increases when paired with an Asian partner than when paired with a non-Asian

partner. Appendix Table A8 demonstrates that is indeed what we find, both in Part 1

data and Part 3 data.

C5. Willingness to Contribute Analysis

          In Section 6, we explored the differences in willingness to contribute by gender.

Here, we further explore this data using regression analysis and provide robustness

checks on the results we presented. We will say that a participant “contributed” her

answer if she submitted a place in line at least as close to the front of the line as her

partner. Our first set of results present linear probability models predicting whether or

not a participant contributed, exploring the role of gender of partner and gender

stereotype of the category. In all specifications we include a proxy for individual ability,

our fitted 𝐼𝐼̂𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 term from Section 5, in order to account for any role own ability plays in

driving these effects.

          In Specifications I and IV, we look at the unconditional effect of partner gender

and confirm the results reported in the main text in Section 6: both men and women

contribute more answers when paired with female partners than when paired with

male partners. In Specifications II and V, we add the Part 3 male advantage in the




                                                                                                                            52
category and interact it with partner gender. The results reveal that men contribute

significantly more answers as male advantage increases, but only when they are paired

with female partners. Women contribute fewer answers as male advantage increases

when paired with a male partner, but more answers as male advantage increases when

paired with a female partner.

       Of course, whether an answer is contributed depends both upon a participant’s

choose of place in line and her partner’s choice of place in line. Thus, the results from

these specifications likely reflect both adjustments to own place in line and the fact that

partners of different genders choose systematically different places line. For example,

when we observe that women contribute fewer answers in sports when they are paired

with a man than when they are paired with a woman, it could be because (i) the

participant chooses a place farther back in line when paired with a man, and/or (ii) the

male partner chooses a place closer to the front of the line than the female partner. The

last set of specifications (Specifications III and VI) allow us to isolate the impact of force

(i) by including a control for partner’s choice of place in line. We see that conditional on

partner’s choice of place in line, men do not react to the gender of their partner. Women,

however, do adjust their place in line based upon the gender of their partner. They

move significantly back in line as male advantage increases when paired with a male

partner, but significantly less so when they are paired with a female partner.


Appendix D: Robustness Tests
First, we show that results are quite similar when restricted to the sample that attended

high school in the United States. Table A10 shows the results for self-beliefs. The only

difference from our main results is the estimate of the constant for women’s self-beliefs

in Part 1. In the full sample, we estimated a constant of 0.90 (SE 0.20); in the restricted




                                                                                            53
sample, the estimated constant increases to 1.48 (SE 0.24). This suggests that in this

sub-sample, the gender differences in DIM that we observed in the full sample for Part 1

self-beliefs are reduced.

In Table A11, we replicate the results on beliefs about others using only the sub-sample

of participants that attended high school in the United States. The results are very

similar to the results for the full sample.

         In Appendix Tables A12 and A13, we replicate the Part 1 results on self-beliefs

and beliefs about others using the MTurk data. Results on stereotypes for beliefs about

women get much stronger. For men, however, the results get weaker. While the role for

stereotypes in beliefs about men looks similar, the role of stereotypes in predicting

men’s self-beliefs has an unexpected sign, with an increase in male advantage predicted

to decrease men’s beliefs about own ability.
