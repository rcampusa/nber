                                              ABSTRACT

Under the urging of late nineteenth-century humanitarian reformers, U.S. policy toward American
Indians shifted from removal and relocation efforts to state-sponsored attempts to "civilize" Indians
through allotment of tribal lands, citizenship, and forced education. There is little consensus, however,
whether and to what extent federal assimilation efforts played a role in the stabilization and recovery
of the American Indian population in the twentieth century. In this paper, we rely on a new IPUMS
sample of the 1900 census of American Indians and census-based estimation methods to investigate
the impact of federal assimilation policies on childhood mortality. We use children ever born and children
surviving data included in the censuses to estimate childhood mortality and [responses to] several
questions unique to the Indian enumeration [including tribal affiliation, degree of "white blood", type
of dwelling, ability to speak English, and whether a citizen by allotment] to construct multivariate
models of child mortality. The results suggest that mortality among American Indians in the late nineteenth
century was very high - approximately 62% [standardize as % or percent throughout] higher than that
for the white population. The impact of assimilation policies was mixed. Increased ability to speak
English was associated with lower child mortality, while allotment of land in severalty was associated
with higher mortality. The combined effect was a very modest four percent [as above] decline in mortality.
As of 1900, the government campaign to assimilate Indians had yet to result in a significant decline
in Indian mortality while incurring substantial economic and cultural costs.

        The American Indian population was one of the first subpopulations of the United States
                                                                                                 1
recognized by the federal government as vulnerable and in need of state protection. From a pre-

contact population variously estimated at between one and ten million, the American Indian

population in the coterminous United States declined to approximately 600,000 in 1800—when

estimates become more reliable—and continued its rapid decline in the nineteenth century,

reaching a nadir of 237, 000 in the decade 1890-1900 before recovering in the twentieth century

(Thornton 1987, p. 32). Resisting the widespread belief that American Indians were doomed to

extinction, nineteenth-century humanitarian reformers successfully pressed the government to

take an active role in assisting the population. Reformers believed that severing tribal bonds and

promoting the private ownership of land would give Indians an incentive to work and, ultimately,

save the population from continued decline. Under their urging, federal policy shifted from

military subjugation, land cession, and removal efforts to policies promoting acculturation and

assimilation. The apogee of assimilationist policies was reached in the late nineteenth century,

when Congress passed legislation that allotted reservation land in severalty to individual Indians,

promoted Indian citizenship in the United States, and enrolled Indian children in boarding and

reservation day schools, where they were taught English and vocational skills (Dippie 1982;

Hoxie 1984; Prucha 1976; 1979).

        Despite what might have been good intentions on the part of reformers, the campaign to

assimilate Indians resulted in substantial economic and cultural costs for American Indians.

Between1887, when the government passed the sweeping General Allotment Act (or Dawes Act)

and 1934, when the Indian Reorganization Act (or Wheeler-Howard Act) ended allotment, the


        1
          Other nineteenth-century U.S. populations deemed “vulnerable” and deserving special attention from the
federal government included widows and orphans of Civil War soldiers (Skocpol 1995) and recently freed slaves
(Cimbala and Miller 1999).
amount of land owned by American Indians declined by 62 percent. According to historian Janet

McDonnell, two-thirds of American Indians in 1934 remained “either landless or did not own

enough land to make a subsistence living” (McDonnell 1991, p. 121). Allotment also failed in its

goal of converting substantial numbers of Indians into self-supporting farmers or ranchers

(Prucha 1985, p. 48). The reformers could point to some signs of “success,” however. Between

1887 and 1920, the percentage of Indians wearing “citizen’s clothing” increased from 24 to 59

and the percentage speaking English increased from 10 to almost 40 (U.S. Interior Department

1887; 1920). In addition, the percentage of Indians “Taxed” (i.e., recognized as citizens of the

United States and thus liable to taxation) increased from 23.7 in 1890 to 72.9 in 1910 (U.S.

Bureau of the Census 1915, p. 284).

       Although several historians have examined the impact of removal policies on the Indian

population (e.g., Thornton 1984; Campbell 1989), remarkably few researchers have studied the

impact of late-nineteenth century assimilationist policies. When the Wheeler-Howard Act ended

allotment, John Collier, Commissioner of Indian Affairs in the Roosevelt Administration, argued

that in addition to being the cause of Indian spiritual and material decline, allotment was

responsible for an Indian death rate twice that of the white population (Dippie 1982, p. 308).

Collier’s inference that mortality differentials between the Indian and white population resulted

from allotment, however, ignored the multiple environmental, economic and social factors

affecting mortality and long-standing race differentials in mortality. In his population history of

American Indians, American Indian Holocaust and Survival, Russell Thornton notes that

allotment produced a “further deterioration of American Indian economies, societies, and

cultures,” but he does not otherwise connect the policy with Indian demographic change (1987, p.

102). More recently, Nancy Shoemaker’s study of twentieth-century population recovery among
the Cherokee, Yakima, Seneca, Red Lake Objibway, and Navajo suggests that reasons for

population stabilization and recovery varied by tribe, with no discernable relationship between

allotment, education, and demography. The Cherokee and Yakima Nations, both in the process of

being allotted in the late nineteenth century, exhibited dramatically different demographic

patterns, while the Red Lake Objibway, the Seneca Nation, and the Navajo Reservation were

never allotted. Likewise, the Cherokee and Seneca had the highest percentage of students

enrolled in school and the highest percentage of individuals with the ability to speak English, but

had dramatically different fertility levels (Shoemaker 1999, p. 59-62). Shoemaker’s sample,

however, in addition to being limited to five tribes, was not large enough to analyze the impact of

allotment, education, and English-speaking ability at the individual-level. Thus, the effect [or

‘role … may have played’] assimilationist policies may have had on Indian population

stabilization and recovery remains an open and intriguing question.

       This paper examines the impact of federal policy on America Indian mortality with a new

source: a 1-in-5 public use microdata sample of the 1900 census of American Indians. The

sample, part of the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), was created at the

Minnesota Population Center and publicly released in June 2005 (Ruggles et al. 2004). The

census included several questions useful in analyzing the impact of federal assimilationist policy

on the population, including each individual’s degree of “white blood,” tribal affiliation, whether

he or she spoke English, lived in a movable or fixed dwelling, was a citizen by allotment, and

lived in a polygamous marriage. In addition, the census included questions common to the

enumeration of the non-Indian population, including occupation, literacy, marital status, children

ever born, and children surviving, which allow detailed description and analysis of mortality and

fertility. Although these data were collected by the Census Bureau, they were never analyzed or
published. Thus, the public use sample of the 1900 census of American Indians represents an

important new source for the study of American Indian demography at the population nadir.

BACKGROUND

       Pre-contact estimates of the American Indian population—constructed by applying

depopulation ratios to the population nadir figure, extrapolating the nineteenth-century rate of

decline to 1492, or estimating the region’s carrying capacity—are at best rough guesses. Over the

course of the twentieth century, researchers have estimated the Indian population of the

coterminous United States as low as 720,000 (Kroeber 1939) and as high (for all of North

America) as 18 million (Dobyns 1983). Most estimates fall in the range of 2-7 million, implying

a population loss between 1492 and 1900 in excess of 85%. The American Indian population

stabilized in the late nineteenth century, experienced modest growth in the early twentieth

century, and very rapid growth in the last few decades. Much of the recent growth, however,

stems from changes in self-identification in the census. A large proportion of those identifying

themselves as “Native Americans” are not enrolled in American Indian tribes (Thornton 1997).

       As Thornton notes in his population history, all reasons for American Indian population

decline stem in part from European contact and colonization, including introduced disease,

warfare and genocide, geographical removal and relocation, and destruction of ways of life

(Thornton 1987, p. 43-4). Most scholars agree that diseases introduced from the Eastern

Hemisphere, including smallpox, measles, and influenza, were the overwhelming cause of

population decline (Cook 1998). The relationship between epidemic disease and American

Indian population decline is relatively well documented in the nineteenth century. Qualitative

evidence points to at least 27 epidemics among American Indians, including 13 epidemics of

smallpox (two of which were major pandemics), 5 epidemics of measles, and two epidemics of
influenza (Dobyns 1983). Smallpox was especially destructive. The 1801-02 pandemic all but

destroyed the Omaha, the Ponca, the Oto, and the Iowa, and killed a large percentage of the

Arikara, the Gros Ventre, the Mandan, the Crow and the Sioux. The 1836-40 smallpox pandemic

may have been the most severe episode of disease experienced by North American Indians,

killing 10,000 American Indians on the upper Missouri in a few weeks, including virtually all the

Mandans, and one-half of the Arikara, the Minnetaree, and the Assininboin (Thornton 1987, pp.

91-92, 94-95).

       Warfare and genocide were much less important reasons for population loss, although

wars had a large impact on some tribes. With some notable exceptions, such as the Creek (1813-

14) and Seminole Wars (1835-42), most nineteenth-century Indian wars were fought west of the

Mississippi. The Cherokee, who formally sided with the Confederacy in the American Civil War

(1861-65) but contributed soldiers to both sides, may have lost as much as one-third of their

population during the war. The Plains Indians and the United States were engaged in nearly 50

years of constant warfare, culminating in the military subjugation of the Sioux and Cheyenne late

in the century and the massacre of several hundred Indians at Wounded Knee Creek, South

Dakota in 1890. Removal and relocation policies, especially after Congress passed the Indian

Removal Act in 1830, also led to the deaths of thousands of American Indians. The removal and

relocation of the “Five Civilized Tribes” of the American Southeast—the Cherokee, Chickasaw,

Seminole, Creek, and Choctaw—are perhaps the best known, but most tribes in North America

experienced removal and relocation at some point in their history. Justified as the only means to

protect Indians from encroaching whites (while securing valuable land for white settlement),

removal often resulted in substantial population loss. Thornton estimates that the Choctaws lost

15 percent of their population during removal, the Creeks and Seminoles lost about 50 percent of
their populations as a combined result of war and removal, and the Cherokee—along the

infamous “Trail of Tears”—lost an estimated 4,000 out of 16,000 individuals in their relocation

to Indian Territory in the late 1830s. When indirect losses are included, Thornton estimates that

the Cherokee suffered a net loss of 10,000 individuals (Thornton 1984; 1987).

       Finally, changes in ways of life contributed to Indian population decline. Loss of wild

game, relocation, and confinement on reservations resulted in abrupt changes in traditional

means of subsistence, leading to poverty, malnourishment, and greater susceptibility to disease.

The near total destruction of the nation’s buffalo in the late nineteenth century resulted in

widespread starvation of many Plains Indians. Over the course of the nineteenth century, the

number of buffalo declined from approximately 40 million to less than one thousand (Walker

1983, p. 1255).

       Federal policy, while intermittently focused on the military subjugation of various tribes,

the cession of tribal lands for acquisition by non-Indian settlers, and the removal of Indians to

areas in the west outside the path of the expanding non-Indian population, shifted in a more

humanitarian direction as the Indian population declined. The devastation inflicted by smallpox

in the 1801-02 pandemic prompted Thomas Jefferson to have a delegation of Indians visiting

Washington, D.C. vaccinated. Congress first allocated funds for vaccination and health care in

1832. Despite some resistance on the part of Indians and a lack of interest on the part of many

Indian officials, smallpox vaccination was extensive enough in the late nineteenth century to

reduce the severity of epidemics (Thornton 1987, p. 100-01, 172). The rise of intemperance and

venereal diseases among Indians in the mid nineteenth century convinced the government to

expand its efforts at Indian health care beyond combating epidemic disease (Massing 1994).

Funds for Indian health care, however, were extremely limited until 1955, when the government
transferred responsibility for Indian health care from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the

Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (Thornton 1987, p. 237).

       In 1865, a joint special committee of Congress was called to investigate Indian

depopulation. Its report, while placing most of the blame for Indian depopulation on the

expanding non-Indian population, concluded that the Indian population must be “civilized” or

ultimately disappear (Thornton 1987, p. 133). Although the report’s recommendations for

expanded inspections were largely ineffective, historian Francis Prucha argues that the

committee’s report marked “a beginning of a new approach to Indian affairs emphasizing peace

and justice, that was strikingly in contrast with the demands of some military men for the rapid

subjugation of the tribes and military control of the reservations” (1976, pp. 15-16). The two

decades following the Civil War witnessed an upsurge in humanitarian concern for American

Indians. Reformers, many of whom were Protestant Christians, believed that “civilization was

impossible without the incentive to work that came only with the ownership of a piece of

property” (Prucha 1975, p. 228). Doing so required severing tribal bonds and eliminating the

communal ownership of land. Thanks in part to their urging, the great majority of treaties enacted

after mid century included clauses allotting land in severalty to individual Indians. Despite mixed

results, reformers were unsatisfied with this piecemeal approach and pressed for a general act.

       Congress responded in 1887, when it passed the General Allotment Act (commonly

known as the Dawes Act after its sponsor, Massachusetts Senator Henry L. Dawes). The Dawes

Act authorized the President to allot 160 acres of collectively-owned tribal land to each family

head, 80 acres to each single person over 18 years of age, and 40 acres to each single person less

than 18 years of age. To protect Indians during the period in which they were learning to be self-

supporting, the government was to hold title to the allotment in trust for 25 years, after which
ownership of the land would be transferred to the individual or his or her heir in the form of a fee

patent. Indians accepting an allotment were made citizens of the United States. A second

provision of the Dawes Act was to make “surplus” land available for non-Indian purchasers.

Shortly after the Dawes Act was passed, it was amended to allow Indians to lease their land to

non-Indians. The 25-year trust period was effectively ended with the Burke Act of 1906, which

allowed Indians judged “competent and capable of managing his or her affairs” to sell their land

(Hoxie 1984, p. 165).

        According to Leonard A. Carlson, reformers “hoped the Dawes Act would accomplish at

least six specific things: break up the tribe as a social unit, encourage individual initiative, further

the progress of Indian farmers, reduce the cost of Indian administration, secure at least part of the

reservation as Indian land, and open unused lands to white settlers” (1981, p. 79). Or, more

succinctly, in the words of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, the act was intended to turn “the

American Indian” into “the Indian American” (quoted in Washburn 1975, p. 242). By some

measures, in 1900 allotment was a moderate success. Between 1890 and 1900 the total number

of allotments increased from 15,166 (5,554 families) to 58,594 (10,835 families) and the total

number of acres cultivated by Indians increased from 288,613 to 343,351. The increase in

acreage cultivated was not commiserate with the increase in the number of allotments, however,

and was down from the 369,974 acreages cultivated in 1895 despite an additional 19,000

allotments made in the period 1895-1900 (Otis [1934] 1973, p. 139).

        Eventually, allotment was recognized as failing to obtain most of its objectives. Many

Indians sold or leased their land and never turned to farming or ranching. In his study of the

impact of the Dawes Act on Indian farming, Leonard Carlson bluntly observes that “allotment as

a means of promoting self-sufficient farming among Indians was a failure” (1981, p. 159).
Explanations for its failure are varied, but include the unsuitability of much allotment land for

farming or ranching; the lack of capital assistance given to Indians to support the purchase of

farm machinery and needed irrigation projects; ineptitude, corruption, and mismanagement by

the Bureau of Indian Affairs; and cultural resistance of many Indian men to farming. In its goal of

opening unused land to white settlement and use, however, the Dawes Act was a success. In the

ten allotted states, Indian land in trust declined from 82 million acres in 1881 to 16.8 million

acres in 1933. In Oklahoma during the same period, land in trust fell from 41 million to 2.9

million acres. Most of this land passed out altogether of Indian ownership (Carlson 1981, p. 170).

DATA

       We rely on the public use microdata sample of the 1900 U.S. Census of American Indians

(Ruggles et al. 2004) to estimate American Indian childhood mortality in the late nineteenth

century and to assess the impact of federal assimilationist policies on mortality. Because the U.S.

Constitution mandated that only “Taxed” Indians (i.e., Indians severing tribal relations and living

among the general population) counted toward congressional representation, censuses prior to

1890 had excluded the vast majority of “Non-Tax” Indians. Growing interest in management of

the American Indian population, however, resulted in Congress approving resources to

enumerate all Indians on special forms in the 1890, 1900, and 1910 censuses.

Although the Census Office published basic population data collected in the 1890

enumeration—along with ethnographic studies of various Indian Nations—the original census

manuscript records of the 1890 census were destroyed by fire. Interestingly, although the 1900

census of Indian inhabitants was collected, the data were never analyzed or published. The 1900
census is the first surviving census to enumerate all American Indians (Jobe, 2004).2

        Nancy Shoemaker has noted that the enumeration of American Indians in 1890, 1900, and

1910 created special challenges and potential methodological problems related to two causes:

cultural differences and misunderstandings between enumerators and Indians, and the politics

and bureaucracy of colonization (1992). In addition to potential language difficulties, one likely

area of misunderstanding was household structure. Shoemaker notes that in many Indian

societies, a child’s “father” was what Euro Americans would call an uncle, his or her

“mothers”—of which there could be many—what Euro Americans would call aunts, and many of

his or her various other kin relations would be recognized by Euro Americans as unrelated or

“fictive kin.” Although it may have been the case that Indians and well-trained enumerators

recognized these cultural differences and accounted for them on the census forms, we cannot be

entirely sure. Moreover, census instructions to follow the traditional Euro American patriarchal

family structure by entering the household head first and wife second was at odds with the

matrilocal structure of many tribes. Other potential problems arose from the politics and

bureaucracy of colonization. Shoemaker judges the census question on polygamy as useless, for

example, because Indians knew that the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) took a dim view of the

practice, sometimes punishing offenders and making them give up all but one of their wives.

Indian parents might also fear losing their children to government-run boarding schools—giving

them a potential incentive to hide children—while those eligible for allotment might have

counted deceased children and pregnancies in the hope of acquiring additional acreage. Finally, if

an enumerator happened to be an employee of the BIA, he or she may have relied on the agency’s



        2
         A sample of the 1910 Census of American Indians is currently under construction at the Minnesota
Population Center.
population listings to help conduct the census. These relied on a more restricted definition of

family.

          Despite these problems, we have no other source on the American Indian population

comparable in coverage and scope to the 1900 and 1910 censuses. For the most part, enumerators

were chosen for their familiarity with particular tribes and appear to have been diligent in their

efforts. Johansson and Preston, for example, noted that of the seven enumerators hired to count

the Apache and Navajo, four were teachers at local Indian schools. They concluded that

“enumerators were a reasonably accomplished and mature group of men and women whose

occupations gave them some familiarity with the Indians they were interviewing” (1978, p. 7, 6).

In her study of the Cherokee, Yakima, Seneca, Apache, and Red Lake Objibway in 1900,

Shoemaker noted that enumerators were usually mixed-blood Indians, white men married to

Indian women, or BIA employees who were familiar with the language and the culture of the

groups they enumerated, thus minimizing the potential for misunderstandings and error (1999, p.

108). She also noted that although there is evidence that some enumerators tried to fit Indians

into Euro American family patterns, the census still managed to capture distinctive residence

patterns for cultural groups. Shoemaker concluded that the “census is a reliable source so long as

users are aware of potential biases” (1992, p. 11).

          The 1900 Indian IPUMS sample is a 1-in-5 sample of all households in the Indian

Census. All individuals living in sampled household—whether Indian or non-Indian—are

included and data maintained on an individual level. Altogether the sample includes 45,651

individuals identified as members of 226 unique tribal groups. Some of the groups are quite

small and are represented by a small number of individuals in the sample (e.g., the number of

Indians identified as members of the Clatsop tribe in the sample include just 2 men and 3
women). To work with these data, we followed the general classification scheme used by the

IPUMS project and the number of cases to reclassify tribal affiliation into 21 general tribal

groups and one group for all other tribes. For example, we considered individuals identified as

“Apache,” “Jicarilla Apache,” “Lipan Apache,” “Mescalero Apache,” “Payson Apache,” and

“White Mountain Apache” as members of the general group “Apache.” Table 1 tabulates the

sample by general tribal affiliation and sex. The Cherokee and Sioux Nations had the most

members, each representing about 11 percent of sampled population.

MORTALITY ESTIMATES

       The United States Census of 1900 asked questions on the number of live births that an

ever-married woman had in her life (i.e. parity or children ever born) and also a question on how

many of those children were still living (i.e. children surviving). In addition to the standard

questions on sex, age at last birthday, and marital status, the census also asked about the number

of years in the current marriage (i.e. duration of marriage). Unfortunately, it did not ask about the

number of times married. This information can be used to make indirect estimates of childhood

mortality (United Nations, 1983, ch. 3). A study of mortality in the United States in 1900

employed these methods and the original public use sample of the manuscripts of the 1900

census (of approximately 100,000 individuals) as the source of data (Preston and Haines, 1991).

       The indirect estimates make use of the proportion dead among women of different age or

marriage duration categories. These are transformed into a standard life table parameter, q(x),

which is the proportion of children dying before reaching age “x”. The methods use model life

tables as the standard. In this case, Coale and Demeny (1966) Model West level 13 was used as

the standard. It has an expectation of life at birth of 48.5 years for both sexes combined. There

are three approaches: one uses women by age group (the “age model”), one uses women by
marriage duration group (the “duration model”), and one uses the age distribution of surviving

own children (the “surviving children method”).

       The results from these methods applied to the original 1900 public use sample and to the

new American Indian sample are given in Table 2. The table gives the relevant q(x) value for

each age and marriage duration category, the number of children ever born used to make the

estimate, the relevant date in the past to which the estimate applies, and the expectation of life at

birth (e(0)) indicated by that level of child mortality in the West Model life table system. The

West Model was chosen because it fit the American experience in 1900 very well (Preston and

Haines, 1991, ch. 2). For the surviving children method, there is only one life table that fits the

data, so the q(x) values and the e(0) for that life table are given. The surviving children estimates

are only given for the total, white and black populations because, unfortunately, the estimating

procedure would not converge on a solution in the computer program designed for this for the

American Indian population. The cause is likely age misstatement among children. The use of the

duration model presented some serious problems for the American Indian population (and for the

black population as well). The use of marriage duration as a proxy for the exposure to risk of

childbearing assumes, first, that marriage is the appropriate situation in which almost all

childbearing occurs and, second, that remarriage is not common. The first assumption is

reasonable for the United States in 1900 [<I don’t know what (relative) proportions of children

were labeled as illegitimate. Even if slight, one presumes that in the sample illegitimate children

were not accounted for where the mother did not subsequently marry, but presumably they were

when she did? Given that bastard children always demonstrate higher mortality levels, this may

have affected the data even though illegitimacy was not factored in.] but the second assumption

creates problems when there is no question on the number of times married. In particular, when
mortality is high, there is a good deal of widowhood and potential remarriage of widows. Thus

older women who have had more children and a longer period of exposure to risk of child death

would be included in the shorter marriage durations. This problem was noticeable in the

American Indian population for adult women. A partial solution for the problem in the duration

model was to select women who were younger than age 35 at the estimated time of marriage (age

minus duration of current marriage), which is why estimates of the longer marriage durations are

not included in Table 2.

       It is probably best to focus on the value of q(5), the probability of dying before reaching

age 5, since that appears to be the most stable. This estimate applies on average to about 1893 or

1894. This implies an expectation of life at birth for the American Indian population overall of

39-41 years, whereas it implies an e(0) 50-51 years for the white population and of about 42

years for the black population. Thus the American Indian population was at a very serious

mortality disadvantage to the majority white population and even a slight disadvantage to the

black population.

       In the age model, there is some evidence for all groups that the mortality level was higher

for dates further back in the 19th century, at least beyond the estimate for q(3). This is consistent

with a situation of improving mortality over the last two decades prior to the census. This was

true for the American Indian population as well. Overall, however, the mortality situation for the

American Indian population was serious with about 30% of Indian children dying before

reaching age 5 (in contrast to about 17% for the white population) and with an implied

expectation of life at birth approximately 10 years shorter than that for the white population.

Mortality Estimates by Group
       In order to simplify the presentation of the mortality estimates by group, a mortality index

has been created (Preston and Haines, 1991, pp. 88-90; Haines and Preston, 1997). Another

reason is to create a variable suitable for multivariate analysis at a micro level. To achieve this,

an index was created that combines the childhood mortality experience of women of marriage

durations 0-24 years. It consists of the ratio of actual to expected child deaths and can be

calculated either for individuals or for groups of women. Actual child deaths are available

directly from the census. Expected child deaths are calculated by multiplying the children ever

born of each woman or group of women by the expected proportion dead for the duration group

of the woman or group of women (that is, marital durations 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, and 20-24).

The expected proportion dead is calculated from a standard model life table, in this case Coale

and Demeny (1966) West Model level 13, which has an expectation of life at birth of 48.5 years

for both sexes combined. The procedure involves taking the appropriate q(a) for each duration

group (q(2) for women married 0-4 years, q(3) for durations 5-9 years, q(5) for durations 10-14

years, q(10) for durations 15-19 years, and q(15) for durations 20-24 years) and converting it to

an expected proportion dead by rearranging the equations which are used to estimate q(a)'
                                                                                        s from

actual proportions dead and average numbers of children ever born. The procedure allows for

differences in the pace of fertility among the women (United Nations, 1983, p. 82). The details of

the creation of the mortality index may be found in Haines and Preston (1997). West Model

mortality is an appropriate standard for the whole American population since American data

were used in the construction of the original model and since West Model replicates the

experience of the 1900-02 Death Registration Area quite closely (Coale and Demeny, 1966, p.

14; Preston and Haines, 1991, ch.2).
          The index has the advantage of summarizing into one number the child mortality

experience of a whole group of women of varying ages, marital durations, and parities. It has

been investigated elsewhere and found to be robust and econometrically well-behaved when used

as a dependent variable in a regression model (Trussell and Preston 1982). It is not sensitive to a

situation in which fertility has been declining in the recent past, and it is readily interpretable. A

value of unity means that the woman (or group of women) was experiencing child mortality at

about the national average, while values above or below unity mean that the woman (or a group

of women) was experiencing child mortality worse than or better than the national average,

respectively. The disadvantage is that, if mortality was declining in the past, the index will give a

weighted average of the past mortality regimes, with the weights depending on the marital

duration composition of the group in question. Since groups may not be homogeneous with

respect to marital duration composition, this can lead to some bias. Overall, however, the index

seems robust. Further, any mortality parameter desired can be obtained by multiplying the index

by q(5) in the standard table and then finding the appropriate table in the West Model life table

system.

       Table 3 gives the dimensions of race, rural-urban residence, census region, literacy of

husband and wife, English language ability of husband and wife, occupation of husband (using

the 1950 basic occupational stratification scheme), woman’s labor force status, husband’s

unemployment during the previous year, home and farm ownership, and (for the American Indian

Population) tribal group and citizenship status. As was seen in the previous table, the mortality

index shows that the American Indian population had childhood mortality substantially higher

than either the black of the white populations in 1900, although it was approximately equal to

that of the Hispanic population in 1910. Although the American Indian population was
overwhelmingly rural in 1900 (98.2% rural in the sample), this did not seem to operate to

advantage. For the overall American population, rural mortality was about 18% lower than urban

mortality; it was actually higher for the American Indian population (although the sample of

American Indian urban dwellers was very small). Although there were regional variations, only

the South Atlantic region exhibited any particular advantage. Mortality was basically high

throughout the nation, regardless of region. Within the American Indian population, both literacy

and English language ability of either the husband or wife did convey some advantage, as was

true of the American population in general. Despite the fact that the American Indian population

was almost entirely rural and predominantly agricultural (as indicated by the occupation of the

husband), no particular advantage was attached to being a farmer (“Agricultural (excluding

laborers)”), in contrast to the population in general. In this respect, American Indians were

similar to the black population in 1900 (Preston and Haines, 1991, Table 3.7). The experience of

the husband with unemployment at some time in the twelve months prior to the census also

seemed to have little relation to the child mortality of the American Indians, unlike the

experience of the overall population. Another difference is that the fact that a woman in the labor

force was an advantage among American Indians while it was a decided disadvantage to child

survival among the mothers in the population in general. Ownership of a home or farm also

conveyed little edge in terms in terms of child survival to American Indian mothers, while it did

for the majority population. The American Indian population was almost all native born (98.8%),

and little can be inferred from nativity. Among the white population, the native born had a child

mortality advantage of about 23% over the foreign-born population. Finally, known citizenship

by allotment of either the husband or wife was associated with higher childhood mortality,

although status as a “taxed” Indian did not appear to be associated with higher or lower mortality.
       The final panel of Table 3 presents the tribal groups of the women used to estimate

childhood mortality. It is evident that there were substantial differences in the sample sizes from

different groups, with the Sioux, Pueblo, Navaho, Cherokee, Chippewa, and Choctaw being more

substantially represented. There seemed to be advantages to the Cherokee and the Chickasaw,

who had been longer settled in the Indian Territory (later part of the state of Oklahoma) and a

real disadvantage to the Sioux, more recently placed on reservations. The very low index values

for the Navaho and Kiowa appear unrealistic and may be due to data problems.3 Overall, the

heterogeneity of experience among the tribal groups is intriguing and merits much further study.

Multivariate Analysis

       Group differences in child mortality noted above, of course, may reflect other factors.

American Indians who spoke English, for example, may have had higher socioeconomic status

than Indians with no ability to speak English. Lower mortality among the English-speaking

group, therefore, may simply reflect socioeconomic status and be otherwise unrelated to language

ability. On the other hand, the ability to speak English may have facilitated and be associated

with a greater willingness to accept non-Indian medical care and medicine, public health

measures, and changing standards of personal hygiene. To distinguish the relative importance of

social, economic, and residential factors on Indian mortality we employ a multivariate analysis

with the mortality index described above as the dependent variable. Following Preston and

Haines (1991), we weight the regression by children ever born. Inclusion of variables unique to

       3
         Shelia Johannson and Samuel Preston (1978) suggests that a deep cultural reluctance to
speak of the dead may have biased Navajo’s response to the children ever born and children
surviving questions. See also Clyde Kluckhohn, who cites a “peculiarly morbid Navajo fear of
the dead” (1944, p. 242) and Gary Witherspoon, who contends that while the Navajo did not fear
the experience of death, contact with the dead was to be avoided “in order to prevent unnatural
illness and premature death” (1983, p. 571). The Kiowa results are derived from a small
sample—32 mothers of 107 children—and appear unrealistic.
the Indian Census in the multivariate model also allows us to evaluate the impact of federal

assimilationist policies on child mortality. Dummy variables for general tribal group allows us to

control for potential unobserved covariates of child mortality unique to tribal affiliation, such as

each group’s economy, interaction with non-Indian peoples, particular process of allotment, and

history of removal and relocation.

       Table 4 shows the means of variables used in the analysis—weighted by children ever

born—by general tribal affiliation. The mortality index ranges from 0.52 for the Navajo (an

unrealistically low value, implying half the childhood mortality of the non-Indian population) to

2.23 for the Sioux and 2.38 for the Blackfoot. Values for the independent variables vary widely

among tribes. Mother’s literacy ranged from an average of 0 to 71 percent, ability to speak

English from 0 to 84 percent, “full-blooded” Indians from 40 to 100 percent, and polygamous

unions from 0 to 13 percent. Citizenship by allotment in the sample ranged from a low of 0%

among the Apache, Blackfoot, Cherokee, Iroquois, Kiowa, Navajo, Osage, Pima, Pottawatomie,

and Seminole to a high of 43% for the Chippewa (Objibwe) and 52% for the Pottawatomie.

Overall, 16% of households contained a mother or spouse who was a citizen by allotment in

1900. Because of the potential of remarriage to bias construction of the mortality index, we

include mother’s age as a control variable in the model.

       All else being equal, we would expect that mother’s literacy and the ability to speak

English would confer advantages in child survival, while urban residence, participation in the

paid labor force, and spouse’s unemployment would increase child mortality. Plains Indians

suffering from recent wars, confinement on reservations, and the near total destruction of the

buffalo are expected to have higher child mortality (see e.g., Jones 2004). In contrast, tribes with

either little contact with non-Indian populations or long-settled on reservations such as the
Navajo, Cherokee, and Chickasaw are expected to have lower mortality. Given the large

differentials in child mortality between the white and Indian populations observed earlier and the

suspected differences in socioeconomic conditions between full-blood and mixed-blood Indians,

mothers with higher percentages of “white blood” and mothers married to white and mixed-

blood men are expected to have lower child mortality than the reference groups of full-blood

mothers and full-blood spouses.

       Despite the rhetoric of nineteenth-century humanitarian reformers, we have no

expectations for the impact of allotment on child survival. Ordinarily, ownership of land would

confer an advantage in child survival. In addition, there is evidence that some tribes, such as the

Comanche, tended to disperse from traditional bands after being allotted, potentially decreasing

the risk of contracting infectious diseases (Kavanagh, 1989). On the other hand, dispersion of the

population may have disrupted traditional social support networks, potential resulting in poorer

childcare and reduced capacity to manage economic stress. It is important also to emphasize that

allotment was not a uniform process. The selection of allotments among the Crow and Cheyenne

suggests that preservation of kin connections was an important goal (Hoxie 1997; Moore 1987).

Among the Osage, full-blooded Indians tended to select allotments clustered near traditional

Osage villages with little farming potential, while mixed-blood Indians selected allotments based

on soil fertility and crop potential (Vehik, 1989). At White Earth Reservation in Minnesota, the

allotment process was characterized by massive land fraud and limited choice of allotments by

the Anishinaabeg, resulting in dispossession and poverty (Meyer 1991). Widespread evidence of

allotment’s ultimate failure to convert a substantial number of Indians to farming and ranching

suggests that allotment for most American Indians was associated with economic hardship, and

thus higher child mortality. Interestingly, frontier farming also was associated with higher child
mortality for the white population, perhaps reflecting limited food supplies and the hardships of

clearing new land and constructing new homes (Steckel 1988).

       Results of the multivariate analysis are shown in Table 5. Model 1 includes all Indian

women reporting one or more children ever born, married less than 25 years, with a spouse

present in the household. Because of probable data quality problems with the Navajo and Kiowa

enumerations, Model 2 excludes women from those tribes. The results indicate that some of our

expectations were met while others were not. Mother’s literacy, labor force participation, and

urban residence proved to be unrelated to child mortality. As expected, however, the ability of

mothers to speak English was associated with lower child mortality. The most significant factor

appears to have been mother’s and husband’s percentage of white blood. Indian mothers with

50% or more white blood were associated with a .326 lower child mortality index and spouses

with 50% or more white blood were associated with a .333 lower index. In contrast to the non-

Indian population, there appears to be no penalty associated with spouse’s unemployment.

       All else being equal, children of Sioux mothers suffered higher levels of mortality than

the control group of children of Cherokee mothers. The Blackfoot and Seminole also experienced

significantly higher child mortality than the Cherokee, while the Kiowa, Navajo, Paiute, and

Pima experienced lower child mortality. While it is likely that the Navajo enjoyed relatively low

mortality, the results are so extreme as to suggest a probable quality problem with the data. As

noted above, Johansson and Preston contend that Navajos may have underreported infant deaths

for cultural reasons (1978). The results for the Kiowa—which are based on the reported number

of children ever born and children surviving by just 32 Kiowa women—also appear unrealistic. If

these data are unreliable, it is possible that the inclusion of Navajos and Kiowas in the model

biases the overall results. Model 2 in Table 5, however, which excludes the Navajo and Kiowa
populations, returns similar coefficients for each parameter. Finally, the model suggests that

Indian households receiving allotments experienced significantly higher child mortality. Children

of parents receiving an allotment suffered over 20% than other children, all else being equal

Thus, in addition to having a significant economic and cultural cost, allotment had a significant

demographic cost as well.

       Unfortunately, the results in Table 5 are biased to some extent by a lag between the

measurement of the dependent and independent variables. Although child mortality occurs in

years preceding the 1900 census—centered in Model 1 in 1889—most of the independent

variables are measured only at the time of the census (the exception is the allotment variable,

which provides the year citizenship was awarded). Although some of the variables in the model

are time invariant (e.g., tribal group, percentage of white blood), others may have changed (e.g.,

labor force participation, literacy). Model 3 attempts to reduce this probable bias by restricting

the universe to women with marital durations of less than 15 years. Mortality is therefore

estimated to center around a reference year of 1894.2, approximately six preceding the census.

Although based on a much smaller number of cases, the results of Model 3 are similar to Model

2.

       So what was the net impact of assimilation and federal assimilationist policies on

American Indian mortality? Perhaps the most intuitive way to evaluate their impact is to use the

model to predict the result of a 45.6 percent increase in the number of Indian mothers able to

speak English (the mean value for mothers in the model) and a 14.8 percent increase in the

number of Indians receiving citizenship by allotment. Combined, the results (using Model 1 in

Table 5) suggest a very modest 0.06 decrease in the child mortality index, equivalent to a decline

in mortality of approximately 4 percent. We therefore conclude that as of 1900, the government
campaign to assimilate Indians had not resulted in a significant decline in Indian mortality.

Assimilation policies, however, continued for another 33 years. Though unlikely, it is possible

that results from the 1910 Indian IPUMS sample—due for public release in late 2005—will

suggest that assimilation policies were more beneficial in the period after 1900.

       In addition to the ability to speak English and the achievement of citizen by allotment, the

increasing rate of Indian intermarriage with the white and black populations can be seen as an

indirect result of assimilation. As shown in Table 5 above, children of Indians that intermarried

with whites enjoyed significantly lower mortality. Unions between full-blood Indians and mixed-

blood Indians or whites also produced more children (U.S. Census Bureau 1915). Since

encouraging intermarriage was not a goal of federal policy, we have not considered its impact. A

more generous definition of what constitutes the results of assimilation policy would suggest a

more substantial, though still modest, 13 percent reduction in mortality.

NOTES: (a) The mortality index is the ratio of actual to expected deaths to women in
each group. For the calculation of expected child deaths, see text. q(5) is the
proportion of children dying before age 5 for each group. The values for q(5) are
derived by multiplying the mortality index by the q(5) value (.19119) for the
standard life table (Model West level 13.0 for both sexes combined). The standard
error assumes that the q(5) value is the outcome of a binomial process with variance
(p*q/n), where q is the q(5) value, p = (1-q), and n = the number of children ever
born.
(b) The estimate for the Hispanic population is from Gutmann et al. (20000), Table 2.
It is for 1910. The present estimate was scaled back to the 1900 level of mortality,
i.e. West Model level 13 rather than West Model 13.5 which was used for the 1910
estimates.
(c) The census divisions were composed as follows: (1) New England: Maine, New
Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island. (2) Middle Atlantic: New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. (3) East North Central: Ohio, Michigan, Indiana,
Illinois, Wisconsin. (4) West North Central: Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas. (5) South Atlantic: Delaware, Maryland, District of
Columbia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida. (6) East South
Central: Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi. (7) West South Central: Arkansas,
Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma Territory. (8) Mountain: Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado,
Nevada, Utah, New Mexico Territory, Arizona Territory. (9) Pacific: Washington,
Oregon, California, Alaska Territory, Hawaii Territory.
(d) The occupation classification system is that used for the 1950 U.S. Census.
(e) "An Indian is considered 'taxed' if he or she is detached from his or her tribe
and living among white people as an individual, and as such subject to taxation,
whether he or she actually pays taxes or not; also if he or she is living with his or
