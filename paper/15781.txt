                                              ABSTRACT

This paper estimates the impact of cigarette prices on youth smoking in lower-income countries using
data from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS). Country-level heterogeneity is addressed with
fixed effects and by directly controlling for confounding environmental factors such as local anti-smoking
sentiment, cigarette advertising, anti-smoking media messages, and compliance with youth access
restrictions. We find that cigarette price is an important determinant of both smoking participation and
conditional demand. The estimated price elasticity of participation is -0.63. The likelihood of participation
decreases with anti-smoking sentiment and increases with exposure to cigarette advertising. The estimated
price elasticity of conditional cigarette demand is approximately -1.2. Neither anti-smoking sentiment,
cigarette advertising, nor access restrictions have an impact on the intensity of smoking among current
smokers, but exposure to anti-smoking media may reduce the number of cigarettes smoked.

       1. Introduction

       Tobacco consumption has been long established as a leading cause of preventable
death, with 100 million deaths attributed to it during the 20th century, and nearly one
billion deaths projected for the 21st century (World Health Organization, 2008).
Adolescents are a group of special interest to the global anti-tobacco effort because
smoking habits are primarily established in youth. It is estimated that, worldwide, one in
seven teenagers smokes, and a quarter of them have tried their first cigarette before the
age of 10 (The Tobacco Atlas, 2006).
       The regional variation in youth smoking patterns worldwide is substantial and
corresponds to variations in market characteristics including accessibility of tobacco to
youth, media influences, and cultural perceptions of smoking. There are multiple and
often conflicting factors that come together in shaping global youth smoking patterns.
Separating and evaluating their individual effects is important in determining the best
way to target this public health challenge, and is the goal of this study.
       Although tobacco use is among the major health problems in lower-income
countries, most of the evidence on what determines youth smoking comes from a few
industrialized countries and from the U.S. in particular. There is a wealth of research on
the impact of U.S. cigarette prices or taxes but many studies have trouble identifying a
causal price effect due to inability to address state-level heterogeneity. Only recently has
work emerged which controls for regional variations in the public attitude toward
smoking, either indirectly through state fixed effects (DeCicca et al. 2002, Carpenter and
Cook 2008), or through direct inclusion of a state anti-smoking sentiment variable
(DeCicca et al. 2008, Carpenter and Cook 2008). Among the first to employ individual
fixed effects, Tauras et al. (2005) find significant price effects, as do Carpenter and Cook
(2008) in their state fixed effects models. However, these conclusions are not supported
by DeCicca et al. (2002, 2008) who determine that anti-smoking sentiment dominates the
effect of price. This mixed evidence hinders extrapolation of U.S.-based results to other
countries. Even if uniform evidence on U.S. price effects had been available, U.S. results
may not be easily generalizable to other countries due to differences in income, cultural
environment, and individual behavior.



                                                                                             2
       This study is the first to estimate the effect of cigarette prices on youth smoking
using micro-level data from multiple low- and mid-income countries, and as such is the
first to have a global scope. Nelson (2003) uses similar data to evaluate the effect of
advertising bans on cigarette demand among youth in developing countries but does not
control for cigarette price. He finds that advertising bans do not affect youth smoking.
Lance et al. (2004) estimate the effect of price on smoking among adult males in China
and Russia. They find very weak responsiveness of smoking to cigarette prices in these
two countries. Other studies that focus on developing countries rely on aggregate data
(Chapman and Richardson 1990) which raises econometric concerns about simultaneity.
       Our study fills a substantial gap in the existing literature by using micro-level data
from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS). GYTS employs a standardized
questionnaire in multiple countries and across multiple years, providing information on
youths’ smoking behavior and their environments. Until this study, GYTS data have
been used mostly for descriptive purposes rather than for vigorous policy evaluation due
to the lack of exogenous cigarette price measures for most GYTS countries and years.
We overcome this limitation by merging GYTS with cigarette price data from the
Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) World Cost of Living Survey.
       The effect of cigarette prices in the presence of unobserved country-specific
heterogeneity is identified by 1) using country fixed effects, and 2) including a measure
of local anti-smoking sentiment. We further reduce unobserved heterogeneity by
controlling for confounding environmental factors such as the prevalence of cigarette
advertising, anti-tobacco media outreach, and compliance with youth access restrictions.


       2. Data


       The GYTS is a survey developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to track tobacco use of young people
across countries with a common methodology. It has been conducted in 135 low-to-mid-
income countries from the six WHO world regions (Africa, Europe, Americas, Southeast
Asia, Middle East, and Western Pacific) in various years from 1999 to 2006. It captures
prevalence, access, media exposure and attitudes related to tobacco use among



                                                                                             3
individuals in school grades corresponding to ages 13 to 15, although in practice the age
range of the survey is wider and covers individuals between the ages of 11 and 19.
       Our final dataset contains data on 349,930 individuals from 20 countries
corresponding to 118 local sites (i.e. cities/provinces). The countries included in this
study were surveyed in multiple years and provide repeated cross-sections, allowing the
use of country fixed effects. A descriptive summary of the data in this study is shown in
Tables 1a and 1b. A list of the final set of countries and survey years is shown in Table
2.
       The outcome variables in this research are smoking participation and smoking
intensity. Smoking participation is a binary variable equal to 1 if the individual describes
himself as a smoker and has smoked at least one cigarette in the past month. The highest
smoking prevalence rates are observed in Eastern Europe (16%) and Latin America
(12%). Smoking intensity among smokers is based on the average number of days that
smoking occurred in the past month multiplied by the average number of cigarettes
smoked daily, both calculated as the midpoints. In this sample, the average cigarette
consumption ranges from 1.5 to 630 cigarettes per month. Individual-level explanatory
variables include age, gender, parental smoking status, and availability of pocket money.
The average age of the sample is 14 years. Availability of pocket money is captured by a
binary indicator equal to 1 if the subject receives pocket money or personal income at the
time of the interview. Although the pocket money variable provides a proxy for personal
and family income, the data are limited in terms of actual income measures.
       Data on the price of cigarettes over time is obtained from the EIU World Cost of
Living Survey. This survey collects retail price data for a wide range of consumer
products on a bi-annual basis from multiple cities worldwide. Cigarette prices are
available for two different brands, a local brand and a foreign brand, usually Marlboro.
Prices are collected from one or more cities in each country. If for a particular country
cigarette price data come from multiple cities, we use the average national price. Where
the GYTS city survey site matches the EIU city survey site, local city prices are used
instead of the nationally averaged price. Prices are expressed in real 2000 U.S. dollars
and are adjusted using purchasing power parities (PPP) obtained from the World Bank's
World Development Indicators database. The PPP adjusts prices for the local standard of



                                                                                            4
living and allows for more accurate price comparison between countries. In the primary
analysis of smoking demand, we use local-brand cigarette prices, but a sensitivity
analysis using Marlboro prices is performed as well.
       Variables that describe the local environment of each subject include the level of
anti-smoking sentiment (Sentiment), the prevalence of cigarette advertising (Cigarette
Advertising), the prevalence of anti-tobacco media messages (Anti-tobacco Media), and
the observed effectiveness of minimum-age tobacco purchase policies (Youth Access
Restrictions). All of these are constructed from individual survey responses which are
then used to produce aggregate measures at the site level.
       Anti-smoking sentiment has been recognized in the U.S. literature as an important
predictor of attitudes toward smoking and of the smoking pattern itself. Omitting anti-
smoking sentiment from a model of smoking demand can be problematic as it may cause
the error term to be correlated with both smoking status and cigarette prices. In this
paper Anti-Smoking Sentiment is defined as the percentage of non-smokers in the survey
who favor bans on smoking in public places. We base this measure on non-smokers only
(as opposed to all survey participants including smokers) in order to eliminate the
potential for endogeneity bias when smokers’ attitudes are included. In the case of
smokers, it is not clear if sentiment affects smoking or smoking affects sentiment, so
sentiment would be endogenous to smoking. Excluding the attitudes of smokers from the
measure of anti-smoking sentiment helps ensure that the relationship between sentiment
and smoking is one-directional.
       The prevalence of cigarette advertising is determined by the proportion of survey
participants who have been recently exposed to cigarette ads on billboards, newspapers or
magazines. It describes the likelihood of exposure to print media advertising and
contains information on how effective local advertising is in reaching an audience. The
heaviest exposure to cigarette advertising is observed in Poland, Indonesia, and
Argentina, where almost all participants (96%) recently had seen print media cigarette
promotions. The high advertising exposure in Poland is surprising given the existence of
a complete ban on cigarette advertising there, and illustrates the disparity between policy
presence and policy compliance that may take place in some countries.




                                                                                            5
        The outreach of anti-tobacco media campaigns can be interpreted as a proxy for
the enthusiasm of local efforts to reduce smoking. Anti-Tobacco Media is determined by
the proportion of respondents who have been recently exposed to anti-smoking messages
in broadcast and print media. The observed effectiveness of policies against cigarette
sales to minors (Youth Access Restrictions) controls for ease of access to cigarettes, and is
calculated as the proportion of survey participants who recently tried to buy cigarettes but
were turned away by vendors due to age. Although there is substantial variability in this
variable across countries, the average proportion of minors in our sample unable to buy
cigarettes during their most recent attempt is 35%. This means that youth access
restrictions may have relatively weak enforcement in lower-income countries.
        It is important to highlight the fact that the area-level variables Cigarette
Advertising, Anti-Tobacco Media, and Youth Access Restrictions are constructed from
aggregating individual GYTS response data. They are continuous variables intended to
represent the varying levels of policy effectiveness and compliance, and are not merely
binary indicators of policy presence. This is an important distinction since the nominal
presence of tobacco policies like advertising bans or minors sale bans does not provide
information on how well these policies are enforced in different countries. Using
variables that describe levels of policy effectiveness is a considerable methodological
improvement over binary policy indicator variables.
        Country and year fixed effects in the form of country and year dummies are used
to account for any remaining unobserved environmental heterogeneity and for a secular
time trend in smoking. Missing responses for the individual characteristics Age, Male,
Parental Smoking, and Pocket Money are imputed. 1 Summary statistics and descriptions
of all variables are listed in Table 1a.


        3. Methods




1
 Missing observations present a nontrivial problem since they add up to 20 percent of the total number of
observations. To fill in missing values, we use the method of iterative imputation. This method has an
advantage over alternatives like substitution of missing values by sample means or regression methods,
both of which can lead to underestimation of the standard errors and erroneously significant results
(Schafer & Olsen 1998).


                                                                                                            6
         Since roughly 90% of the survey participants in our sample are current
nonsmokers, we use a two-part model to reflect the prevalence of zero outcomes in our
dataset. This model allows for independence between the decision to smoke and the
decision how much to smoke. The first part of the two-part model estimates the
probability of smoking participation with a logit model. The second part of the two-part
model estimates the amount of cigarettes smoked by smokers with a generalized linear
model (GLM) with a normal distribution and a log link. 2
         In the first part of our cigarette demand model, smoking participation is a function
of cigarette price (Price), a vector of individual characteristics (X1), a vector of observed
environmental characteristics (X2) which vary over time, country fixed effects (Country)
which are fixed over time, and year fixed effects (Year).


Pr(Yijt >0)= f(α0+α1Pricejt+α2X1ijt+α3X2jt+α4Yeart+α5Countryj)                                    (1)


         In the second part of the two-part model, cigarette demand conditional on
participation is expressed as


(Yijt |Yijt >0)= f(β0+β1Pricejt+β2X1ijt+β3X2jt+β4Yeart+β5Countryj)                                (2)


where i denotes individual, j denotes country/geographic location, and t denotes year. X1
is a vector of individual-level variables which include Age, Male, Parental Smoking, and
Pocket Money. X2 is a vector of area-level characteristics which include Cigarette
Advertising, Anti-Tobacco Media, Anti-Smoking Sentiment, and Youth Access
Restrictions.
         One econometric concern is the potential multicollinearity between some of the
macro variables, namely Price, Anti-Smoking Sentiment, Cigarette Advertising, Anti-


2
 In general notation, the GLM model can be expressed as g(E(y)) = xβ where the link function g(.) = ln(.)
and y ~ Normal. Specifying a normal distribution in a log-link GLM is similar to but not equivalent to an
ordinary least squares (OLS) regression on ln(y) because it produces more consistent and less biased
elasticity estimates in the presence of heteroskedasticity (Manning and Mullahy 2001, Mullahy 1998,
Tauras 2005, 2006). Tauras (2005) estimates that the bias from using OLS instead of GLM in the
estimation of conditional cigarette demand for U.S. adults can be substantial and can result in more-than-
double overestimation of price elasticity.


                                                                                                             7
Tobacco Media, and Youth Access Restrictions. We use the variance inflation factor
(VIF) to check for multicollinearity and find that it is not an estimation problem, even
though we also find that Sentiment may be slightly collinear to the other macro variables.
To remove any doubt about validity problems from potential multicollinearity, we present
estimates where Sentiment is both included and excluded. In either case, the results are
very similar, suggesting that the minor correlation between anti-smoking sentiment and
the other country characteristics does not interfere with the estimation.
       We address another possible identification concern due to endogeneity of the
price variable, which can potentially arise from both unobserved country heterogeneity
and simultaneity. In the first case, unobserved country characteristics such as harsher
cultural attitudes on smoking may result in lower cigarette demand as well as more
aggressive cigarette taxation and higher prices. Not accounting for such unobservables
may lead to a false or overestimated statement of a causal link between prices and
demand. We minimize the possibility of omitted variable bias by directly controlling for
anti-smoking sentiment and other time-varying environmental characteristics that may
influence smoking such as the intensity of cigarette advertising, anti-tobacco campaigns,
and ease of buying cigarettes. Any remaining country heterogeneity that does not vary
with time is addressed with country fixed effects.
       In the second case, cigarette prices and cigarette demand could be simultaneously
determined. The use of micro-level data in this study considerably reduces this danger
because the smoking decision of a single individual would not affect market demand
enough to change the price level. To further address this concern, we also estimate
models which substitute foreign-brand cigarette prices for local-brand prices. Local-
brand prices are used in our primary models because they are typically less expensive and
are more likely to be purchased when the average individual decides to consume
cigarettes. However, foreign-brand prices are likely to be more exogenous to cigarette
demand for two reasons. First, foreign-brand cigarettes are often imported which means
that their price contains a larger exogenous (not determined by market demand)
component such as transportation costs and import duties. Second, in the event that
foreign-brand cigarettes are produced domestically and are not imported, their prices are
set more or less exogenously by the foreign company which owns the brand. Should a



                                                                                            8
simultaneity bias exist, using foreign-brand prices (which are presumably more
exogenous) instead of local-brand prices should reduce the price effect by removing some
of the simultaneity bias. A comparison between models using foreign versus local-brand
prices shows that neither the statistical significance nor the size of the price effect is
reduced by switching the analysis from local to foreign brands. We interpret this as
evidence that the risk of simultaneity bias in the price estimate is low.


        4. Results


        4.1. Smoking participation


        Table 3a presents results from the models of smoking participation as a function
of local-brand cigarette prices. We show four specifications that vary based on the
included right-hand side variables. The baseline specification (Model 1) looks at the
effect of Price without controlling for either anti-smoking sentiment, media effects, or
enforcement of youth access restrictions. Model 2 includes policy variables such as
media effects (Cigarette Advertising and Anti-Tobacco Media) and youth access (Youth
Access Restrictions) but does not control for sentiment. Models 3 and 4 mirror Models 1
and 2, but also control for Sentiment. Our preferred specification is Model 4 which
accounts both for both smoking-related policy influences and local anti-smoking
sentiment.
        We find that cigarette price is a statistically significant determinant of smoking
participation across all specifications. The effect of cigarette price does not disappear or
become smaller once Sentiment is controlled for. This is in contrast to the some of the
recent findings from U.S.-based studies which find that anti-smoking sentiment
dominates the effect of price on smoking participation (DeCicca et al. 2008). Perhaps
unsurprisingly, accounting for media effects and access restrictions somewhat reduces the
magnitude of the price effect. However, it still does not reduce its statistical significance.
The estimated price elasticity of participation is -0.63 in the preferred specification and
ranges from -0.56 to -0.96 across different models.




                                                                                               9
       Sentiment is shown to be a significant predictor of participation and has the
expected negative sign, confirming that higher area-level anti-smoking sentiment is
indeed associated with lower individual participation. However, unlike DeCicca et al.
(2002, 2008), and more in line with Carpenter and Cook (2008) we find that Sentiment is
not the most influential factor determining smoking participation.
       Another major determinant of smoking participation is Cigarette Advertising.
The local prevalence of cigarette advertising increases the probability of participation,
most likely through higher advertising exposure. We estimate that if cigarette advertising
succeeded in reaching every single individual (so that the proportion of youth exposed to
advertising approached 100% from the current mean of 86%), then the average smoking
prevalence rate would increase by up to 1.8 percentage points, from 10% to almost 12%.
In terms of elasticity, we estimate that the advertising elasticity of participation ranges
from 1.1 to 1.9, implying that a 10% increase in the proportion of people who observe
cigarette advertising is associated with up to 19% increase in the prevalence of smoking.
       We also find that Youth Access Restrictions have a sizeable and statistically
significant effect on smoking participation. If bans against selling cigarettes to youth
were implemented everywhere as well as fully enforced (i.e., if the proportion of
underage youth unable to buy cigarettes increased from the observed mean of 35% to
100%), the smoking participation rate would go down by 6.5 percentage points based on
the estimate from Model 4. This finding illustrates the importance of compliance with
anti-tobacco policies and highlights the discrepancy in outcomes between actual and
desired policy that could arise from inadequate compliance. Indeed, studies from the US
and elsewhere have been inconclusive as far as the impact of youth access policies and
their enforcement on youth tobacco use, and highlight the difficulty of enforcing youth
access policies (Lantz et al. 2000).
       Anti-Tobacco Media is found to reduce smoking participation. Based on the
estimate from Model 4, if anti-tobacco campaigns had perfect outreach and the
proportion of youth witnessing them increased to 100% from the current mean of 83%,
smoking prevalence may decline by about 1.5 percentage points.


       4.2 Conditional cigarette demand



                                                                                              10
       Results from the second part of the two-part model which estimates conditional
cigarette demand are presented in Table 3b. As in the models of smoking participation,
Price remains a significant predictor of conditional cigarette demand throughout all
specifications. The price elasticity of conditional demand is centered around -1.2,
indicating that a 10% increase in Price corresponds to a 12% decrease in the intensity of
cigarette consumption.
       We find no evidence that Anti-Smoking Sentiment, Cigarette Advertising, or Youth
Access Restrictions can influence cigarette demand among current smokers as the
coefficients on these variables are statistically no different from zero. This leads us to
believe that once the decision to smoke is made, not many factors besides cigarette prices
can help explain how many cigarettes are smoked. One exception is Anti-Tobacco
Media, which is shown to be a significant albeit not too large determinant of smoking
intensity. Anti-Tobacco Media has a sample mean of 0.83, meaning that anti-tobacco
messages reach 83% of the current smokers. We estimate that if instead all smokers had
been exposed to anti-tobacco media, the conditional demand for cigarettes would be
lower by 22% or by about half a cigarette daily per smoker at the mean.


       Ordered logit estimates


       To see how prices may affect different types of smokers, we use an ordered logit
model of conditional cigarette demand with four smoker categories: very light smokers (1
– 15 cigarettes per month), light to medium smokers (15 to 100 cigarettes per month),
medium smokers (100 to 300 cigarettes per month) and heavy smokers (over 300
cigarettes per month). Table 3c lists the price responsiveness of the probability of being
in each smoker category. The results are similar across all four specifications. In Model
4, the estimates imply that increasing price by 10% decreases the probability of being a
heavy smoker by 8.7%, decreases the probability of being a medium smoker by about
6.9%, decreases the probability of being a light to medium smoker by 3.4%, and
increases the probability of being a very light smoker by 4%. These estimates show that
higher prices progressively reduce the intensity of smoking for all but the lightest



                                                                                             11
smokers and increase the likelihood of smokers switching down to a lighter smoker
status.
          The results from the two-part model with local-brand cigarette prices can be
summarized as follows. Price is a major determinant of both smoking participation and
conditional cigarette demand and in addition seems to be the only major predictor of
conditional demand. Smoking participation is responsive to more factors besides
cigarette price and can be influenced by anti-smoking sentiment, youth access
restrictions, anti-tobacco media, and cigarette advertising. In addition to raising cigarette
taxes and intensifying advertising and access restrictions, policies against youth tobacco
use could also include efforts to change the prevailing sentiment on smoking in a more
negative direction.

          Using foreign-brand instead of local-brand cigarette prices to check for
simultaneity bias


          In this research, local-brand cigarette prices are preferred over foreign brands
because local brands are usually cheaper and therefore more likely to contribute to the
consumption decision of the average individual. However, we also provide estimates
using foreign-brand prices in order to address concerns about a potential simultaneity bias
in the Price estimates. The presumption is that foreign-brand prices are more exogenous
to cigarette demand because they are either set exogenously by a foreign brand owner, or
contain a larger supply-side component like transportation costs and import duties. In
such case, if simultaneity were a problem, using the more exogenous foreign-brand
instead of local-brand prices should provide a smaller and/or statistically weaker Price
estimate by reducing the simultaneity bias. Results from specifications using foreign-
brand prices are listed in Table 4a for participation and 4b for conditional demand.
Comparing these results to Tables 3a and 3b, we can see that neither the magnitude of the
price elasticities nor their statistical significance is reduced. We take this as evidence that
the risk of simultaneity bias in the original local-brand price estimate is minor. The
results on all other coefficients are similar in sign and statistical significance to those in
Table 3.

       5. Conclusion


       The contribution of this research is to provide insight into the factors that shape
cigarette consumption among youth in developing countries. Besides estimating the price
elasticity of demand, we are also the first to offer a thorough examination of multiple
environmental aspects that may affect smoking, including cigarette advertising, anti-
tobacco media campaigns, and the observed effectiveness of youth access restrictions.
Although other papers have looked at the effect of advertising bans, we are able to extend
our analysis beyond the nominal presence of smoking-related policies and are able to
control for the observed effectiveness of such policies.
       This research has multiple policy implications. It confirms the importance of
cigarette prices in determining youth cigarette use. In our preferred specification, we
estimate that the price elasticity of smoking participation is -0.6 while the price elasticity
of conditional demand is -1.2, yielding a total price elasticity of demand of -1.8. This
estimate is higher than elasticities produced from U.S. data on youth. (Comparable U.S.
estimates range from -1.44 (Lewit et al. 1981), -1.31 (Chaloupka and Grossman 1996), -
1.11 (Chaloupka and Wechsler 1997), -0.83 (Tauras et al. 2005), -0.7 (Ross and
Chaloupka 2003, 2004) to zero (DeCicca et al. 2008)). It is perhaps not surprising that
the price responsiveness of smoking among youth in developing countries is higher than
existing U.S. estimates, for two reasons. First, income constraints are tighter for
individuals from developing countries, resulting in higher price responsiveness. Second,
the average age in our sample is fairly low at 14 years old. The domestic literature
usually focuses on slightly older individuals while also recognizing that the
responsiveness of smoking is higher for younger age groups.
       In addition to confirming the existence of a price effect on youth smoking, we
find that anti-smoking sentiment, cigarette advertising, and youth access restrictions
influence the decision to participate in smoking but not the intensity of cigarette
consumption among current smokers. We also show that anti-tobacco media campaigns
may be effective in reducing both participation and intensity.
