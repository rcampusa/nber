Despite its importance for the analysis of life-cycle behavior, stock ownership by households is poorly
understood. Among other approaches to the investigation of this puzzle, recent research has elicited
the expectations of stock market returns by individuals. This paper reports findings from a study that
collected data over a two-year period both on stock market expectations (subjective probabilities of
gains or losses) and on stock ownership. On average stock market expectations are much more pessimistic
about gains than the historical record of actual gains. Expectations are heterogeneous, and they are
correlated with stock ownership. Over the two years of our data, stock market prices increased, and
expectations of future stock market price changes also increased, lending support to the view that expectations
are influenced by recent stock gains or losses.

1. Introduction

Despite its importance for the analysis of life-cycle behavior and, in particular, retirement
planning, stock ownership by private households is poorly understood. For instance, according to
standard economic theory and the historical record of stock market rates of return, almost all
households should hold at least some common stocks, yet that is not the case. Explanations for
the low level of participation typically center around high risk aversion and/or entry costs
(Haliassos and Bertaut, 1995). But another type of explanation is that households have
expectations of stock market returns that are more pessimistic than historical averages.

Among other approaches to investigate the stock holding puzzle, recent research has started to
elicit private households’ expectations of stock market returns (Dominitz and Manski, 2007).1
Households’ beliefs about future events play a central role in forward-looking models of
decision-making. Examples of probability beliefs that may affect individual decisions abound
(Hurd, 2009). They include beliefs about future labor market experiences, the future value of
retirement portfolios of stocks, bonds, and social security benefits, and beliefs about receiving or
leaving bequests, and health and mortality risks. Obtaining reliable measures of households’
beliefs with respect to future events has been at the center of much research in survey design and
analysis over the past decades. (See Manski, 2004, for an overview of the literature.)

There is now a broad consensus that data about households’ beliefs should be obtained using
probability formats rather than using discrete response alternatives and verbal descriptors such as
“very likely”, “likely”, and “somewhat unlikely.” The idea that probabilistic elicitation of
expectations might improve on the traditional qualitative approaches of attitudinal research
appears to have originated with Juster (1966). After some history in market research,
probabilistic expectations questions have been used successfully in economic surveys since the
early 1990s (Dominitz and Manski, 1997). In the United States, the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS) has pioneered asking questions about subjective probability beliefs on a wide variety of
topics, including general events (e.g., economic depression, stock market prices, weather); events
with personal information (e.g., survival to a given age, entry into a nursing home), events with
personal control (e.g., retirement, bequests). Recent research, reviewed by Manski (2004) and
Hurd (2009), shows that responses to probabilistic expectations questions are predictive for

behavior. Vissing-Jorgenson (2003), for instance, documents that differences in opinion on
future price developments among stockholders are related to the size of equity investments in
their portfolio.

There are several explanations for heterogeneity in stock market expectations. It is not likely that
differences in private information play an important role as they do in other domains like
retirement planning and expected longevity where the personal health situation is an important
predictor of the actual outcome. A more plausible explanation is that households differ in the
way they access and process publicly available information (Hurd, 2009). The importance of
differences in opinion for the operation of financial markets has been stressed frequently
(Mayshar, 1983; Harris and Raviv, 1993; Jouini and Napp, 2007). The model by Kandel and
Pearson (1995) explaining volumes of stock trading around public announcements of corporate
earnings for instance is based upon well-educated research analysts using a differential
interpretation of new information.

Dominitz and Manski (2009) suggest that there are at least three different models to form stock
market expectations.2 Individuals may base expectations upon the notion that stock market prices
follow a random walk with drift; they may believe in mean reversion of stock prices; or they may
believe in persistence of recent price changes. Moreover, individuals could use different models
for different time horizons. The empirical evidence by Graham and Harvey (2001) documents
heterogeneity in stock market expectations by CFOs of US firms, who should be experts because
their expectations are important inputs in their corporate investment decisions. Their evidence
suggests that on average persistence plays a role in the formation of one year ahead expectations
but less so for longer term expectations.

This paper reports on findings from a study that repeatedly collected data on households’
financial markets expectations (subjective probabilities of gains or losses). The data we analyze
were obtained in April 2004 and in April 2006 in the CentER Panel, a representative internet
survey of several thousand households in the Netherlands. Vis-à-vis the studies by Vissing-
Jorgensen (2003) and Dominitz and Manski (2007, 2009), our analysis relies on a broader set of
covariates. Compared to the papers by Hudomiet, Kézdi and Willis (2009) and Kézdi and Willis
(2009), who analyze stock market expectations data collected in the covariate-rich HRS, our
2
  Branch (2004) provides an application in which consumers rationally choose different methods to form estimates of
future price developments creating heterogeneity in inflation expectations. Carroll (2003) argues that expectations are
updated probabilistically, fed by messages conveyed in newspapers and other media which may or may not come to
the attention of the consumer which contributes to expectations heterogeneity.

                                                                                                                     3
sample spans the entire adult population. Our elicitation procedure differs from the approaches
used in other studies: We asked each individual for probabilities at eight points in the outcome
space, four in the gain domain (positive rates of return) and four in the loss domain (negative
rates of return), providing data for a more reliable estimate of the mean and variance of individual
subjective rates of return.3

Comparing stock market expectations at a two-year interval (2004 vs. 2006) is interesting
because of the dynamics of the stock market experiences in this window. Figure 1 shows the
Amsterdam Stock Market Index (AEX) for the period 1996–2010. The first interview was
conducted about one year after the stock market had bottomed out following the dot-com crash of
2001. Experiences of large stock market losses should have been quite salient. In contrast, the
2006 interview was conducted three years into the recovery of the stock market (but well before
the climax that preceded the financial crises of 2008).

To preview our results, the main findings can be summarized as follows. We find that
individuals are much more pessimistic about rates of return in the Dutch stock market than would
be estimated from historical stock performance: the average mean rate of return is barely positive
and the variance is considerable. Individuals holding such subjective expectations are not likely
to buy stocks. The distribution of subjective rates of return shifted to the right, i.e. respondents
became more optimistic, between 2004 and 2006. Actual stock market performance was more
consistently positive prior to 2006 than prior to 2004 which suggests, as has been found in U.S.
data, that individuals focus on recent stock market performance when projecting rates of return.
There was no change in the distribution of the variance in rates of return, making stocks a more
attractive investment. In the Dutch population, the data from the CentER Panel we analyze in
this paper suggest that overall the fraction of stock owners remained fairly constant in this period
(about 12 to 13 percent in both years). There is considerable heterogeneity in expected rates of
return. While some of the variation could be measurement error, some of it is systematic: for
example, women have lower expected rates of return, and active traders have higher expected
rates of return. In regressions, those with higher rates of return are more likely to own stocks, and
those who perceive more risk in rates of return are less likely to own stocks. We conclude that at
the population level the distribution of subjective rates of return in the stock market is adequate to

3
 Dominitz and Manski (2009) use a very similar approach but based upon four points of the subjective subjective
probability distribution, which points differ between individuals as they depend on their estimate of the lowest and
highest possible returns. Hudomiet, Kézdi and Willis (2009) estimate a different model (taking measurement error
explicitly into account) using two points of the subjective probability distribution.

                                                                                                                       4
explain low levels of stock market participation and that it is not necessary to invoke very high
levels of risk aversion.

In the remainder of this paper, we describe the design of the study (Section 2), characterize
response behavior in the probabilistic expectations questions (Section 3), present descriptive
statistics on the relationship between changes in stock ownership and changes in subjective
probabilities (Section 4), and develop and estimate a simple model of individual stock market
expectations (Section 5). We then present an analysis of how these individual-level parameters
correlate with personal characteristics and stock market participation (Sections 6, and 7). Section
8 concludes.


2. Design and administration of the study

The study was conducted using the CentER Panel. The panel consists of some 2000 households
in the Netherlands. The members of the panel are presented with questionnaires of varying
length on every weekend; participation on each weekend is voluntary, but households generally
participate in a large fraction of these interviews over the course of the year. In addition, all
members of the CentER Panel participate in the DNB Household Survey (DHS), formerly known
as the CentER Savings Survey. The DHS is a panel survey that started in 1993 and uses the
CentER Panel as its sample. Data for this panel are collected every year in the spring. They
contain information about employment, pensions, accommodation, mortgages, income, assets,
debts, health, personal and household characteristics as well as economic and psychological
concepts. Questions on subjective expectations for various events using probabilistic formats
have been asked repeatedly in the CentER Panel, both as part of the DHS questionnaire and in
other questionnaires. As a result, the members of the CentER Panel are well acquainted with this
question format.

This paper draws on two components of a larger data collection. The larger study consists of
several long “baseline” interviews and a sequence of short follow-up interviews. The first
baseline interview was conducted in April 2004 as a supplement to the DHS 2004 questionnaire.
It was repeated two years later, in April 2006. These interviews elicited information on stock-
market expectations and trading behavior that was not already contained in the DHS instrument.
In 2004, we also conducted short follow-up interviews with the respondents of the baseline
interview. These follow-ups were conducted at a bi-weekly frequency over about six months,


                                                                                                    5
from April through November. In this paper, we analyze data from the two cross-sections
obtained in the April 2004 and April 2006 baseline interviews, not from the short follow-up
interviews. We match these data with the very detailed data on variables such as education,
employment history and marital status, exposure to risk in other domains as well as income,
saving, and portfolio choice from the DHS panel.

The baseline questionnaires used in 2004 and 2006 collected background variables, including
stock market experience, knowledge of average long-term returns for investment in risky and safe
assets, and past trading history. Both questionnaires contained identical sequences of
probabilistic expectations questions on stock market returns over a one-year horizon. 4
Specifically, we asked for the chances that an investment in a broad investment fund would
generate gains of more than 0, 10, 20, and 30 percent as well as losses of more than 0, 10, 20, and
30 percent, for a total of eight questions. The four questions within each sequence (gains and
losses) were always presented with increasing absolute threshold returns, but the gain and loss
sequences were presented in random order (even though we did not find a significant order effect
in a pre-test of our survey).5 The sequence of gain and loss questions starts with a short
introduction explaining that the respondent has to imagine that he unexpectedly received 10,000
Euro from a rich relative and is thinking of putting the money into a mutual fund invested in
“blue chip” stocks (like those in the Amsterdam AEX stock market index). The wording of the
first question in the gain sequence reads as follows:

Suppose you put the 10,000 Euro in the stock mutual fund and left it in for one year. What are the
chances that you would make money where 0 means absolutely no chance and 100 means
absolutely certain; that is what are the chances that in a year your investment would be worth
more than 10,000 Euro?
The other questions in this sequence use a very similar wording with different numbers and
adjusted to reflect the gain and loss sequence where appropriate. The precise wording and
sequencing is available in the appendix (see also Figure 2).

Table 1 reports the sample sizes achieved in the April 2004 and April 2006 interviews. The
baseline interview was first presented to all panel members in week 17, as a supplement to the

 We have verified that also in the current survey the order of the gain and loss sequences did not make a difference
for response patterns.

                                                                                                                       6
DHS 2004 questionnaire. The majority of panel members that were contacted in week 17
participated right away. Those who did not participate in week 17 were contacted again in week
21. The total number of baseline interviews conducted was 2170.6 In 2006, the design was
similar: Panel members were first approached in week 17, and those who did not participate right
away were re-contacted in week 21. The total number of respondents in 2006 was 2121. About
70% of the 2004 respondents participated again in 2006.

The definitions of the covariates we use as predictors of stock market expectations in our
subsequent analysis are reported in Table 2, along with descriptive statistics. The covariates in
Table 2 include both socio-demographic information (gender, age, marital status, education and
income) as well as the responses to questions on personal traits (trust, risk aversion and
optimism) and behavior (moment of survey participation, recent asset trading, ownership of risky
assets, following stock market) plus the perceptions of historical stock market performance. The
sample composition in 2004 and 2006 is quite similar. There are slightly more men than women,
three quarter of the respondents live together with a partner (including both married and
unmarried couples) and about one in five respondents is older than 65. More than a third has
attained a high level of education (i.e. completed higher vocational training or university). The
majority of respondents has an optimistic view on life and is convinced that most people can be
trusted. The vast majority of respondents are labeled risk averse meaning here that they choose
their current income above a gamble with equal probabilities on a 33% worse lifetime income and
a doubling of the income (i.e. the definition is based upon the first step in the sequence of
questions as developed by Barsky et al (1997)). About a third of the respondents have risky
assets (stocks, bonds or mutual funds) and a slightly higher fraction is following the stock market
at least to some extent although most risky asset holders do not frequently buy or sell these assets.
In both sample years a substantial amount of stockholders provides an estimate of historical
annual stock returns above 12% or below 6%, while close to half of the respondents do not
provide an estimate.

The average subjective probability of any gain was 41.6% in the 2004 data and 50.1% in the 2006
data. These averages reveal considerable pessimism compared with actual historical returns: in



6
  Respondents who participated in the second baseline interview differ in other aspects of their response behavior as
well. Generally, they provide response of lower quality. This is a commonly observed phenomenon in the CentER
Panel and other surveys: Early respondents are more highly motivated and provide “better” response, whereas late
respondents are more reluctant.

                                                                                                                        7
67.8% of the one-year periods between January 1, 1983 and November 28, 2008 the change in the
stock market was positive.7

Table 3 contains the distributions of the responses to the probabilistic stock market expectations
questions. For example, when asked about the chances of a positive return, 84 respondents (3.9%
of respondents) gave a zero chance that the stock market would be higher in a year. When asked
about a stock market gain of more than 10%, 195 respondents (9.0%) gave that event a zero
chance. Item nonresponse rates are considerably lower, 13% to 21%, than for our questions
about historical rates of return in Table 2, which were almost 50%: individuals can express
probabilities of future stock market gains and losses even though they have little, if any,
knowledge of historical gains. At the population level, the overall pattern of responses conforms
to expectations: the distributions of subjective probabilities are shifted towards lower
probabilities for higher gains and for greater losses. In 2004, for example, 1025 respondents said
that the probability of a positive gain was 0.50 or greater, which comprised about 54% of the
valid responses. When the target gain was more than 30%, just 67 respondents said the
probability was 0.50 or greater, which was 4% of the valid responses.

From other studies of probabilistic expectations, we know that the responses to such questions
exhibit rounding to focal values such as 5%, 10%, 25%. In addition, there is commonly heaping
in responses at the values of 0%, 50%, and 100%. We observe the same phenomena in our data.
To illustrate, Figure 3 shows the response distribution to the question on a positive stock market
return (i.e., the first question of the gain sequence) in the baseline interview of week 17 in 2004.
Response distributions for other questions and weeks look qualitatively similar.

Heaping of responses at 50% is sometimes perceived as problematic since it may reflect
phenomena other than just rounding – for instance, 50% responses could reflect “epistemic
uncertainty,” that is, they could disguise a “don’t know” response (see Bruine de Bruin, et al.,
2000, among others). A formal analysis of this behavior would require the specification of a
mixture model that combines separate response processes for “continuous” observations (that
may be subject to mild rounding) and for observations at the focal values of 0%, 50%, and 100%.
Such a model would be beyond the scope of this paper, and we follow the majority of the
literature in taking all responses as they are, without any correction for rounding and heaping
(Manski, 2004; Manski and Molinari, 2010). However, we should note that in our data, the

                                                                                                                8
fraction of 50% responses is lower than in many other surveys. This is most likely due to the fact
that CentER Panel members are experienced survey respondents.


4. Stock market expectations and transitions in ownership

Table 4 shows the average subjective probability of a stock market gain in the 2004 and 2006
cross-sections, the change in the cross-section probabilities, and, in the last column, the change in
the average subjective probability in 2004 to 2006 panel data. The levels and changes are
classified according to stock ownership in 2004 and 2006. For example, there were 1065
respondents who reported not owning stocks both in 2004 and in 2006, and their average
subjective probability of a stock price gain was 41.7 in 2004. There were 990 respondents who
reported not owning in 2004 and in 2006, and their average subjective probability of a gain was
49.3% in 2006.8 Among the 920 persons who were observed in both waves and reported
subjective probabilities in both, the (panel) changes were 7.6%, the same as the cross-section
changes. Because the cross-section and panel changes are similar we will mostly discuss the
cross-section levels and changes.

In the entire sample, the average probability of a stock gain increased by about eight percentage
points. Those who were owners in both surveys were initially more optimistic than non-owners,
supporting the hypothesis that greater subjective probabilities of a gain lead to greater ownership.
Of note is that those who became owners between 2004 and 2006 were initially more optimistic
than those who did not become owners, indicating that they were closer to the margin of purchase
even in 2004. But even more direct confirmation of the hypothesis that expectations lead to
purchases is the large increase in the subjective probability of a gain in that group: 14% in cross-
section and 15% in panel. In a similar manner, those who transitioned from owning to not
owning initially had rather pessimistic expectations, indicating they were closer to the margin of
selling even in 2004. And their gain in optimism was the smallest (marginally) of any group.

These results are not statistically significant, but the overall patterns provide support for the
hypothesis that subjective probabilities of stock market gains lead to stock purchases and sales.
But these results would need to be verified by future research based on larger samples, and,

8
  The number of observations is reduced from the number in Table 3 because we impose the requirement that the
subjective probability distributions of each respondent be weakly monotonic, a condition necessary for estimating
individual-level parametric distributions. Furthermore, the number of observations in the “2004” column differs
from that in the “2006” column because of differing rates of item nonresponse to the stock gain questions in the two
waves.

                                                                                                                   9
particularly, on higher frequency of measurement. For example, an alternative explanation for
the changes in Table 4 is that people buy or sell stocks in response to, say, an income shock, and
then rationalize their actions by changing their subjective expectations.9 We would need higher
frequency data where we could test for the temporal sequence of expectations and actions.


5. A parametric model of stock market expectations

In this section, we develop a model that allows us to characterize respondents’ stock market
expectations at the individual level. Our goal is to obtain estimates of the mean and variance of
the distribution of anticipated stock market returns for each individual. We make the simplifying
assumption that stock market returns are normally distributed; this assumption is a simplification
but not unreasonable as the distribution of AEX returns shown in Figure 4 suggests.10

Let st be the stock market price at time t . Suppose that st evolves according to

                                                 ⎛s ⎞
                                              ln ⎜ t +1 ⎟ = α + vt ,
                                                 ⎝ st ⎠

where α is the rate of drift in stock prices (which, according to Figure 4, would be about 12%)
and the vt are i.i.d. N (0,σ 2 ) . Thus stock prices follow a random walk with drift α per time
period.

  The fact that buyers had initially high expectations and sellers had initially low expectations argues somewhat
against this explanation.
10
   As a robustness check we also fitted nonparametric distributions that will be reported in the Appendix.

                                                                                                                    10
which implies that

                                ln st +τ | ln st : N (ln st + τα ,τσ 2 ) .

Thus at time t the expected percent gain (or gain in logs) will have mean of ατ and variance
τσ 2 and the gain will be constant over time for the same projection period (τ ). Under this
model all information about projected levels is in the current level so that past levels or changes
will not predict future levels. One advantage of this formulation is that the model can be fitted
over any time period.

If people form their expectations according to this model, they will report somewhat higher
probabilities of gains than of losses (assuming that α is positive), and the distribution of
anticipated stock market gains is stationary. The model thus allows us to test for population
stationarity by testing whether the reported average points on the distribution are constant. Note
that if there is heterogeneity in beliefs (variation across people in α and in σ 2 ), the population
distribution of anticipated gains will not be normal, but if each person forms beliefs according to
the model the probability points will be stable.

We have asked about the probability that the stock market will gain x % or more over the next
year which is the same as asking for the probability that

                                               st +τ
                                                     >δ .

δ takes the values 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 and τ is 12 if the unit of time measure is one month.

and j indexes the target probabilities.

We also asked about

                                              ⎛s         ⎞
                                            P ⎜ t +τ < δ ⎟ ,
                                              ⎝ st       ⎠

where δ = 1.0, 0.9, 0.8 and 0.7. The probabilities of these events are

                                           ⎛ ln δ j − ατ    ⎞
                                          Φ⎜                ⎟.
                                           ⎝      τσ        ⎠

                                                                                                       11
Thus we have eight observations on probabilities that depend on just two parameters α and σ .
Note that an alternative formulation would be to treat the probabilities of gain differently from the
probabilities of loss which would mean that we would estimate four parameters

                                            μ g , σ g , μl and σ l ,

where the subscripts indicate that the estimations are over gains only or over losses only.

Suppose that probability expectations are unbiased for the ith person, that is

                                                 ⎛ ατ − ln δ j ⎞
                                        p ji = Φ ⎜             ⎟ + u ji
                                                 ⎝    τσ ⎠

and the u ji have expectation of zero. Then the population will have rational expectations, i.e. the

sample average of the pij will be equal to the average historical probability of a gain of δ or more
over τ time periods. Furthermore, each individual will have the same probability expectations.

For the purposes of the present paper, we focus on the estimation of the parameters α and σ at
the individual level. For each respondent, we use nonlinear least squares, obtaining those values
of α and σ that minimize
                                                                         2
                                         ⎛          ⎛ ατ − ln δ        ⎞⎞
                                      ∑j ⎜ p ji − Φ ⎜ τσ j             ⎟⎟ ,
                                         ⎝          ⎝                  ⎠⎠

where j sums over eight target points.11

In order to obtain stable results, responses at the individual level have to satisfy some consistency
requirements relating to the laws of probability. In particular, we exclude those respondents who
(i) reported probabilities that are not (weakly) monotonically decreasing as the thresholds
increase (in absolute terms) in the gain and loss domains or (ii) whose probabilities for a gain and
loss sum to more than 100%.12




11
  In this paper we impose the same model parameters for gains and for losses.
12
   There are also respondents who report estimates for the probability of a loss and the probability of a gain sum up to
a percentage less than 100. While being inconsistent with a continuous probability distribution, it suggests that these
respondents use a rule of thumb discrete distribution with a non zero probability mass on the stock market providing
a zero annual return.

                                                                                                                     12
6. Heterogeneity of individual stock market expectations

Figure 5 illustrates how the normal probability model is fit to data on four individuals, each of
whom has reported eight points on their distributions of one-year stock market returns. In these
examples the estimated alphas vary from 0.00 to 0.09 and the estimated sigmas vary between
0.02 and 0.06. We fit such models to all respondents in 2004 with valid sequences of subjective
probabilities, and, separately, to all such respondents in 2006.

Table 5 provides the percentiles of the distributions of the estimated mean and standard deviation
(volatility) of stock market returns among our respondents for the 2004 and 2006 surveys.13 The
subjective distribution of stock market returns shifts to the right, i.e. the 2006 respondents are
more optimistic than the 2004 respondents, while the estimated volatility is quite comparable.
The median α increases from 0.3% to 2.1%. The shift in expected returns is in line with recent
investor experiences in the stock market (see Figure 1). Between 2000 and 2003 the AEX-index
experienced a huge loss: from top to bottom the total drop is close to 70%. At the time of the
2004 baseline survey the stock market index had recovered part of this loss, but the recollection
of a few bad investment years was most likely still quite vivid. In 2006 the stock market index
had showed a steady increase for three years in a row. Nevertheless, the level of the index was
still far below its peak levels, which might explain why most respondents were still quite modest
in their expectations. Overall, except for a small increase in optimism the distributions for the
expected return and the volatility of returns are quite stable. This conclusion is confirmed by
Figures 6 and 7 which plot the empirical cumulative probability distribution of the mean and
standard deviation, respectively, of expected stock market returns. The empirical distribution of
the standard deviation is virtually identical in the 2004 and 2006 sample. The distribution of the
mean of expected stock market returns makes a clear shift to the right.

Table 5 also shows that males and those who own risky assets are more optimistic than females
and than respondents who have no risky assets in their portfolio. For example, in 2006 the median
of the alphas was 0.008 for females vs. 0.029 for males, a difference of 2 percentage points. We
also find differences in the cross-sectional distribution of alphas by covariates not reported in
Table 5. The medians of the alphas among respondents with low and high education are 0.016
and 0.028, respectively, for 2006. Remarkably, the cross-sectional distributions of alpha do not

13
  The nonparametric distributions are similar; see Appendix 2. The importance of this similarity is that
nonparametric estimation is less attractive when just a few points on the distribution of returns are elicited, and in
that situation the assumption of normality can be made.

                                                                                                                         13
differ much between age groups in either year. As for the distributions of the sigma, the median
among males is lower than among females, and the median among owners of risky assets is lower
than in the population. Thus both the mean and the variance of expected returns suggest that
males should hold stocks more frequently than females.

Tables 6 and 7 show how the individual-level estimates of expected stock market mean return and
volatility, respectively, are related to personal characteristics and some subjective measures that
aim to capture individual heterogeneity. A median regression of the mean of anticipated returns
on personal characteristics confirms individual heterogeneity in stock market expectations, in
particular for gender. The results indeed show that females are more pessimistic on stock market
returns than males. Age and education matter very little once the personal and subjective
measures are included. The only variation with respect to income is between the lowest income
quartile and the other three. People who classify themselves as optimistic or as trusting have
higher expected returns. Respondents who report lower estimates of annual historical returns (i.e.
below 6% annually) are also more pessimistic about future annual stock market returns.

In explaining the variation in the volatility of the fitted stock market distribution, age is an
important covariate in all specifications: young respondents perceive a higher level of uncertainty
in future stock market developments. This might reflect the fact that young people have a
relatively shorter period in which they might have observed stock markets, and yet they have
witnessed a serious boom and bust. Although trust is significant in the 2006 data and optimism is
significant in the 2004 data, no variables besides age are significant in both years.


7. Stock Market Expectations and Stock Market Participation

Table 8 shows the estimated marginal effects of personal and household characteristics on the
probability of stock ownership. They are based on probit specifications estimated separately on
the 2004 and 2006 data. Being female is associated with a reduction in the probability of
ownership of 0.045 to 0.075 depending on the year and the specification. The patterns of
ownership mostly conform to our priors: older and more educated people are more likely to own;
ownership increases sharply in income. Most relevant for this paper is the strong association
between ownership and the subjective probability of a stock market gain: after controlling for
demographics and personal and household characteristics, an increase in the expected one-year
gain of 0.10 (a one-year 10% gain) is associated with an increase in the ownership probability of


                                                                                                   14
0.029 in the 2004 data and 0.049 in the 2006 data.14 In that the stock ownership rate in the
sample we study here was about 15% in both 2004 and 2006 these changes would increase the
ownership rate by 20-30 percent.15 Furthermore, in 2006 we find a signification negative
relationship between the subjective standard deviation of stock returns and ownership: an
increase in the subjective standard deviation of 0.10 is associated with a reduction of 0.04 in the
probability of ownership.16 These results accord with standard portfolio choice theory.


8. Conclusions

We found that on average the Dutch population holds rather pessimistic views about the stock
market: the average subjective probability of an increase in stock values over a year was just
41.6% in 2004, and 50.1% in 2006. This pessimism, combined with a perceived (and actual) risk
of holding stocks is sufficient to explain the low rates of stock holding in the population. It is not
necessary to invoke very high rates of risk aversion to explain the stock holding puzzle.
The shift to more optimistic views between 2004 and 2006 suggests that recent stock market price
movements have an important influence on expectations, as has been found in U.S. data. This
greater optimism, combined with stability in expectations about the variance in stock price
increases, should have made stocks a more attractive investment, leading to an increase in stock
holdings. Indeed at the individual level we found suggestive evidence (but not statistically
significant) that transitions into stock holding were associated with above-average increases in
expectations of a gain and that transitions out of stock holding were associated with less
optimistic changes in expectations, changes similar to those of people who were not stock owners
in either wave. Nonetheless, the fraction of our sample holding stocks did not change between
2004 and 2006. We cannot estimate the net fraction that “should” have transited into stock
holdings as we would need data on a large range of person characteristics such as risk aversion
and on household characteristics such as wealth and pensions. But respondents perceive that
stock market investments expose investors to very substantial risk. We estimate the median
standard deviation of subjective one-year rates of return to be 0.10. Thus for the median person

14
   Such a change in alpha corresponds to change from the median to the 95th percentile in the 2004 distribution of
expected rates of return (Table 5).
15
   The ownership rates at the bottom of Table 8 vary between specifications because stock owners are more likely to
answer questions about stock market expectations and to give valid answers to subjective probability questions about
stock market gains.
16
   A reduction in the standard deviation of 0.10 is approximately associated with a movement from the 25th percentile
to the 75th percentile in the 2004 distribution of standard deviations (Table 5).

                                                                                                                  15
there is approximately a 0.15 chance of a gain of greater than 10% and a 0.15 chance for a loss of
more than 10%.17 An implication is that a larger shift in the expected return may be required to
observe a shift in ownership rates. Indeed, according to our estimates in Table 8, an increase in
the expected rate of return of 0.02, which is our estimate of the increase between 2004 and 2006,
would increase the stock ownership rate by just 0.006 or 0.010 depending on whether we use the
2004 or 2006 probit results.
To make further progress in quantifying the relationship between expectations and stock trading,
we need higher frequency data. We would like to observe the temporal relationships among
actual stock price changes, changes in expectations, and stock purchases and sales. Nonetheless,
in our view, these results show the promise of asking about subjective probabilities of stock price
movements in household surveys, and of using those responses to understand stock holdings.

Appendix: Nonparametric estimation of subjective return distributions

As a robustness check for the parametric fitting procedure of the means and variances of the
subjective distributions of one-year stock-market returns, we describe in this Appendix a method
for computing such estimates without making parametric assumptions. The basic idea is to
average the historic stock market returns within each of the nine brackets defined by the eight
return thresholds, using the respondent’s reported probability as weights.
From the survey data, we construct probabilities P(r ∈ Ij) for the eight brackets, I1= (-∞,-30%), I2
= (-30%,-20%), …, I9 = (30%,∞), scaling such that these nine probabilities sum to 100%. Our
nonparametric estimate of the expected rate of return is then given by
                                    E(r) = ∑j E(r | r ∈ Ij) P(r ∈ Ij) ,
where E(r | r ∈ Ij) = Rj, the historical average of one-year rates of return that are in interval j,
calculated from the AEX stock market data shown in Figure 1 (but only up to 2004). A
nonparametric estimate of the respondents’ subjective standard deviation, s(r), can be obtained by
taking the square root of the variance given by var(r) = E(r2) – E(r) 2, where
                                   E(r2) = ∑j E(r2 | r ∈ Ij) P(r ∈ Ij) .
This method could also be applied using the data from respondents who did not answer all eight
questions, or whose reported probabilities violated the laws of probability because of non-
monotonicity. Such respondents were dropped from the parametric analysis in this paper, and we
thus also drop them from the nonparametric estimation to make results comparable.
Table A.1 compares the estimates of E(r) and s(r) obtained using this nonparametric method with
the parametric estimates of alpha and sigma reported in the paper. These estimates are remarkably
close in terms of the means, medians, minima and maxima of their cross-sectional distributions in
both years, and they are also highly correlated at the individual level. These results support our
reliance on the parametric estimates.
