       The educational screening hypothesis states that beyond a
certain   point schooling functions as a signalling device to
identify pre—existing talents. We test for the presence of screen-
ing by comparing the schooling and earnings of self—employed workers
and of those employed by others in a sample set of occupations.
We expect those employed by others to pursue additional schooling
to signal prospective employers. We expect self—employed managers
to acquire no additional schooling for signalling purposes. We

expect   other self—employed workers to obtain additional schooling
to   signal potential customers. Our empirical results, based on

1970 Census data, strongly support the case for screening.

However, the relative magnitude of the   screening   portion of school-

ing is relatively modest, lying between approximately 5 and 10 percent.

           Educational Screening and   Occupational Earnings



     The   educational screening hypothesis has received considerable
attention in recent years. Simply stated, it is that beyond a certain
point schooling does not improve an individual's productive capacity but
instead functions as a signalling device to identify his pre—existing
talents. 1   A prospective employer who has no direct way of assessing an

applicant's productive capabilities uses his educational attainment level as

an indicator of his expected productivity. Employers therefore pay

more to the more highly educated applicants (or hire them in favor

of less educated applicants), not because (or solely because) educa—

don enhances their productivity but because it identifies the more

productive workers. A necessary corollary of this, as St,ence (1973)

argues, is that for the job market to remain in equilibrium, the

more educated will in fact have to demonstrate their greater pro-

ductivity on the job. The observed positive relation between schooling

and earnings is then due to the identification or screening function

of education, rather than to a productivity—augmenting process.

      This paper was originally presented at an NBER seminar in Stanford
in March 1977. We would like to thank those present for their comments
and Robert Lipsey for his helpful suggestions. The work for this paper
was supported by the National Science Foundation, Grant No. S0C74—21391.

     l Wolpin (1975) points out, it is not necessary to assume that
there is no productivity effect from schooling, only that beyond a
certain level of schooling the effect is signalling and not productivity
augmentation.

(See    Spence (1973), Arrow (1973), Layard and Psacharopoulos (1974),

Albrecht    (1974), Stiglitz (1975), Wolpin (1975), and Riley (undated)
for variants on this basic argument.)
       Empirical attempts at verifying the presence of screening have
to    date either been misformulated, negative or inconclusive. Taubman

and    Wales (1973)   present one of the earliest tests of screening.

Using    data from the NBER—Thorndyke sample, they estimate earnings
functions for each of seven occupational groups by regressing earnings
on schooling, age, ability (as measured by the Aviation Cadet Qual—
ifying    Test),   and other socio—demographic variables. These earnings
regressions    are then used to predict an individual's expected earnings,

had he been employed in another occupation. Finding that a large

percentage of blue—collar workers earn less than their expected income

in white—collar and other occupations with higher educational require-

ments, they conclude that education acts as a barrier to entry in

these    occupations. The weakness of the Taubman and Wales test is that
they assume that the only characteristics that affect worker pro-
ductivity are the variables they use in their earnings regression.
In fact, these explain only a small part of the variance in earnings.
If there are unobserved traits positively associated with schooling
(perhaps    initiative, for example) and positively correlated with

earnings, then the Taubinan and Wales test only begs the question:

Does   schooling produce these productivity—related traits like initia-
tive and thus augment productivity or do individuals with more
(innate) initiative pursue more     education, in   which case schooling
screens    these traits? The Taubman and Wales test is thus incon-

clusive.     (See Wolpin and Riley for related criticisms.)
                                 —3—




     Layard   and Psacharopoulos propose three hypotheses for testing
the presence of screening. First, the rate of return to uncompleted
courses should be lower than that to completed ones. Second, stand-
ardized educational differentials in earnings should not rise with
age, since employers should have better information about older
employees'   abilities. Third, if screening is the main function of

education, there are alternative testing procedures that can be

done more cheaply than schooling. None of these hypotheses was

empirically confirmed. However, none of these propositions is implied

by the screening hypothesis. The first is really a "credentialt' or

"sheepskin" hypothesis that a diploma per se is used as a screening

device, rather than years of education.2 The second hypothesis also

does not follow from the screening hypothesis. All that the screen-

ing hypothesis contends is that schooling itself does not increase

worker productivity. In fact, higher educated individuals may be

more productive and must be, as Spence argues, for the job market to

remain in equilibrium. Therefore, there is no necessary reason for

earnings differentials between schooling groups not to increase with

age. The third hypothesis is irrelevant to the argument, since the

existence of cheaper alternative testing devices does not contradict

a screening function of schooling.

     Albrecht's test was to compare the   success   of applicants for a



     2
      Eckaus (1973a) finds similar refutation for the sheepskin
hypothesis. When adjusted for hours worked, college graduates have
the same rate of return to schooling relative to college drop—outs
as college drop—outs do relative to high school graduates.
                                    —4—




given   position of those inside an organization with those outside

the organization. His data were applicants for the position of tax

auditor for an Internal Revenue Service office in San Francisco.

He reasoned that the office would have better information on inside

candidates than outside ones. Therefore, if education were used as

a screening device, schooling should have less bearing on the hiring

decisions of inside applicants than outside ones. This hypothesis

was not confirmed. But here too the inference is not warranted.

Education may be directly (though not causally) related to an individual's

onthe—job productivity and still be used as a screening device.

Albrecht's results thus do not refute the screening hypothesis.

       Using data on college graduates working in a large corporation,

Wise (1975) found that earnings were significantly related to the

undergraduate grade point average (CPA). Moreover, when college

quality (selectivity) was controlled for, CPA was still significant.

In fact, earnings increased faster with CPA at the more selective

than less selective colleges. On this basis, Wise concluded that

"college education is not only a signal of productive ability, but

in fact enhances this ability." Again, the conclusion is not warranted

by the results. From Wise's findings, one could alternatively argue

that   a sophisticated employer like a large corporation uses not only
schooling level but college quality and academic achievement to screen
employees,   because innate ability is better identified by these three

factors than by schooling level alone. Moreover, the fact that earnings

rise faster with CPA   at   more selective colleges suggests that the


                                                                             S
                                     —5—




 difference   between an A and   a   B at a more selective school represents

 a greater spread in ability than at a less selective school (also,

 see Lazear (1977)).

      Wolpin presents the most direct test of the screening hypothesis

to   date. Using the NBER—Thorndyke sample, he estimated separate
earnings equations for salaried and self—employed workers, where the
explanatory variables are schooling, experience, and ability. His
reasoning is that students planning to go into their own business will
acquire less schooling than those planning to work for an employer,
since the former will stay in school only long enough to satisfy the
needs of their work, whereas the latter will acquire additional school-
ing   to signal a prospective employer. Wolpin makes four predictions

based   on the screening hypothesis. First, self—employed workers will
have a lower mean schooling than salaried workers. Second, the incre-
ment in earnings from schooling will be lower for self—emoloyed than
salaried. Third, earnings differentials between schooling classes
will decline with experience for salaried workers. Fourth, earnings
profiles by schooling class will diverge with experience for self—
employed workers. None of these hypotheses was empirically confirmed.
       Wolpin's   orocedure avoids the basic objection to the previous

tests that productivity (and hence earnings) should be positively

related   to schooling, irrespective of whether schooling augments pro-
ductivity or functions as a screening device. However, there are other
problems with his tests. First, mean schooling for self—employed
should be lower than that of salaried workers only if the occupational
mixes are substantially the same. In fact, self—emvloyed workers are
                                  —6—




concentrated in occupations requiring more schooling (see below).

In addition, there is reason to believe that in many occupations

self—employed workers will acquire more schooling than their salaried

counterparts to signal prospective clients (see below). Second,

the return to schooling should, in fact, be greater for self—employed

than   salaried workers. The reason is that self—employed workers
(given perfect foresight) acquire only as much schooling as needed
in their occupation. Given the same ability (or distribution of
ability), self—employed workers should receive the same earnings

as salaried workers with more schooling. (See Riley for a 5lightly

different argument.) Third, as we argued above, there is no reason

why age—earnings profiles by schooling class should converge with

age for salaried workers, even if screening takes place. Fourth,

inversely, there is no reason why the profile should diverge with age

for self—employed workers.

       Riley proposes a test of screening though in the paper shows no

empirical results. He argues that in some occupations the direct

observation of an individual's productivity and potential is more

difficult than in other occupations. Therefore, screening would more

likely occur in the former than in the latter occupations. One should

therefore observe a lower rate of return to schooling in the screened

than in the unscreened occupation. Moreover, in the screened occupa-

tions, education credentials are by definition the basis of the initial

wage offer. Therefore, an earnings function should be a better

predictor of earnings in earlier than in later years for scrnened jobs,

and the predictive power of the earnings function should decline in
                                    — 7.-




the screened relative to the unscreened sector with experience. The

problem with this approach is that no independent means is provided

of distinguishing between screened and unscreened occupations, except

by whether or not it fulfills the prediction.


I. An Alternative Screening Test

     In this paper we shall present a new formulation of a screening

test. We shall then test for the presence of screening using data

from the 1970 Census Public Use Sample. Our results generally confirm

the presence of screening.

     Our screening test involves a comparison of the educational

attainment of self—employed workers with those employed by a corpora-

tion or someone else (ttsalariedtl workers) on an occupation by occupa-

tion basis. This procedure will overcome the bias built into Wolpin's

test from not controlling for occupational mix. In addition, it will

allow us to distinguish between occupations with and without customer

signalling. The test will also avoid the identification problem

between schooling as productivity enhancer and    schooling   as an indicator

of ability. The test is direct, since if a portion of schooling

serves to signal a prospective employer, then schooling behavior should

differ between those with and without an employer.

     Suppose S1   years   of schooling are necessary to acquire the requisite

skills   for a given occupation. Students intending to work in this occu-
pation for someone else may, however, pursue S1 +    S2 (S,>O) years   of
schooling, where the additional S2 years are needed to signal a     pro-

spective employer. Students planning to enter business for themselves
                                    —8—



will acquire oniy S1 years of schooling. Standardized for experience,

ability, sex, race, and other demographic characteristics, less educated,

self—employed workers should receive on average the same earnings as

more educated salaried workers.

       The resultant test is not as straightforward as it might appear.

While models of educational screening generally predict that workers

in the screened sector of an occupational labor market will obtain

more   education, ceteris paribus, it   is   not always the case that   the

self—employed   workers   will be the unscreened group. Even though

self—employed workers do not need to screen themselves, if they are

in   an occupation which sells labor services directly to the public,
they are effectively being employed by their customers. Since cus-
tomers can rely on the name and reputation of a firm providing a
service such as that of an electrician or auto mechanic, the self—
employed in these occupations will acquire additional educational
credentials   (vocational diplomas, trade courses, and the like) to

overcome   customer uncertainty about their ability.3
       The key to whether self—employed or salaried workers are the
ones screened in a given occupation depends on the relative amount
of   information those who contract for labor services have on workers'

abilities, independent of workers' educational credentials. In

almost evety occupation those who contract for the labor services of




     31n New Haven, from casual observation we noticed that the
local Pontiac dealership displayed no vocational training certifi-
cates in their service department, whereas our local mechanic did.


                                                                              S
                                     —9—




the self—employed will do so on a different basis than those who
contract for those of the salaried workers. When an occupation
provides services directly to the customer, the customer as con-
tractor will knoi less about the ability of a self—employed worker
than about a firm that hires salaried workers to provide the same
services to the customer as part of its business. The firm can
rely on internal training programs, job histories, and its personnel
files to ensure threshold occupational ability levels regardless
of educational credentials, while the customer hiring directly
will be forced to make a decision with less information about the
self—employed worker. The customer will demand an educational
premium of the self—employed worker to overcome the lack of a direct
measure of ability, something that the salaried worker will let

his firm's reputation cover. In this case, the extra S2 years

of schooling will be acquired by the self—employed worker.

       The only case where one would not expect self—employed to

have more ecuation than salaried workers is in occupations where

the job function is toally    internal to the firm and has   no direct

effect   on whether customers purchase the firm's products or not.
This   would include occupations such as managerial and    administrative
ones, where the labor service goes into the firm      and not   into the

product. One would expect self—employed managers to have less

education   than salaried managers, ceteris paribus, because they are
not being screened by either their customers or their firms.
In   other white—collar and   in   blue—collar occupations, we would

expect the reverse.

II.    Specification of the Model
       With data from the 1970 Census 5% Public Use Sample, we used
the following equation to test for screening:

         S        ÷
                      1Tog(E) +   2I.g() + 3Log(H) +         ÷ 5SEX +

                       + 7S0UTH+ 8SHSA + 9SE(PERM) + $10SE(NEW) +

                llV0c'N +

         where
                S = years of schooling

        Log(E)      logarithm of wage and salary earnngs plus
                   self—employmertt earnings in 1969.
      Log(WW) =     logarithm   of weeks worked in 1969.

       Log(H) =     logarithm   of hours worked per week.5

               A = age in years.

             SEX= dummy variable, with 0 for males.

             PACE = dummy variable, with 0 for whites and orientals
                    and 1 for blacks and others.

         SOUTH     dummy variable, with 1 for residence in any of the
                   17 southern states.

             SMSA = dummy variable, with 1 for residence outside a
                    Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA)




     4The Census defines wage and salary earnings as "wages, salary,
commissions, bonuses, or tips" and self—employment earnings as anon—
farm business, professional practice, or partnershio' earnings. The
sum Df the two was used since some respondents report both kinds of
incon.

       5Hours per week were reported     for a sample census week in 1970
and   are not mean hours per week.
                                     —11—




SE(PERN) =     dummy variable,   with a value of 1 if the respondent
               classified himself as self—employed in both 1970 and
               1965 and was working in the same occupgtion in the
               two years, and a value of 0 otherwise. This is the
               group of 'permanent self—employed.
 SE(NEW) = dummy     variable, with a value of 1 if the respondent
              classified himself as self—employed in 1970 but either
              was not self—employed in 1965 or was working in a
              different occupation, and a value of 0 otherwise.
              This is the group of "newly" self—employed workers.

VOCTRAIN = dummy variable, with a value of 1 if the respondent
           reported receiving vocational training and a value of
           0 otherwise.7

          u = random error term.


       Our   primary interest is in the coefficients of SE(PEM) and
SE (NEW),     since these will indicate whether there is any difference
in educational attainnnt between self—employed and salaried. The
other variables are used -mainly to standardize the samples for
differences in demographic composition and earnings. SEX and RA
should have positive coefficients because of discriminatory pay
practices.      SOUTH and SMSA should also have positive coefficents,

because   of occational differentials in earnings. Aao)        should ha':e a

negative     coefficient,   because of the positive impact of experience

on   earnings. Since productivity is more nearly related to the hourly


     6For those reporting both salary and self—employment earnings,
we used the work status they reported to classify them as self—employed
or not.


     7The areas of vocational training listed by the Census are:
business and office work; nursing and other health fields; trade and
crafts; engineering and science technician and draftsman; agriculture
and home economics; and "other fields.'
                                    —12—



wage rate than    annual   earnings, Log(WW)    and Log(H) have been included
in the equation in addition to Log(E).8 Our hypothesis that employer

screening occurs in managerial occupations is then that the coefficients

of   SE(PERM) and SE(NEW) are negative. The hypothesis that customer
screening occurs in professional, sales, craft, operative, unskilled
and service occupations is that the coefficients of SE(PERM) and

SE(NEW) are positive.

      There   are two possible sources of bias in the estimate of earn-
ings. The first is that self—employment earnings may be underreported.9
This will bias upward the coefficients on         SE(PERN)     and SE(NEW), since
it will understate the actual level of earnings for a given level of
schooling (and age). The second is that the self—employment earnings
reported in the Public Use Sample may include a return to capital


       The reason is that:

           Log(w)    Log         = Log(E)   —
                                                Log(WW)   —
                                                              Log (H)


      where w   is the   hourly wage rate. The approximation sign is used
because II is   estimated from a sample week.


     9Computations done by Ono (1972) showed that wage and salary
earnings reported in the Public Use Sample equalled 100 percent of
National Account totals and non—farm self—employment income in the
Public Use Sample was 99 percent of the National Accounts total
(Table 4). However, the National Account estimate of self—employment
income is based on tax return data, where there is substantial leeway
for underreporting.




                                                                                    .
                                  —13—




invested in a small business in addition to labor earnings. This
will bias downward the coefficients on SE(PERM) and SE(NEW), because
it will overstate the level of self—employed labor earnings for a
given level of schooling (and age). To overcome both problems, we
estimated a second equation, substituting the logarithm of total
personal income (Log(Y)) for Log(E). This may not fully overcome
the first bias, since an underreporting of self—employment earnings
may be reflected in an underreporting of total personal income. More-
over, the use of total income, which should capture the property
income of both salaried and self—employed workers, may not fully
overcome the second bias. The reason is that the self—employed may

have a greater tropensity to invest, since they own their business,

or that they may be wealthier to begin with, which may be a dominant

reason   that they have their own business.
     Another   bias   in the test is caused by the uncertainty students

have about whether they will be salaried or self—employed. A reason-

able presumption is that any student in doubt about his future employ-

ment status will acquire more schooling rather than less to keep both

options open. This will bias the coefficients on SE(PER) and SE(NEW)

upward. However, it is for this reason that we       split   our self—employed

group    into two samples. The first group, SE(PERN), has the most
stable businesses and would presumably have been more certain when
young about their future employment status (for example, managing a
family business). The second, SE(NEW),      are   the ones with relatively

new businesses, including many who recently switched from salaried

positions.     This group would probably have been less certain when
                                     —14—




yoimg   about their future etnploytnent status. In occupations without
customer screening,   we would predict a higher but less significant

coefficient   on SE(NEW) than on SE(PERM)
     The Public Use Sample, unlike the NBER—Thorndyke sample, contains
no information on ability. But this should not bias the test, unless
the dis tribution of ability or its covariance with earnings is differ-
ent among self—employed than among salaried workers. As far as the
distribution of ability, there is no a priori reason        to suspect a

difference between self—employed and salaried workers. As far as the

covariance of ability and      earnings,   we would expect earnings to be

directly related to ability for self—employed workers throughout their

working career and    for   salaried workers in their later working years.

For salaried workers in their early working years, we would expect

earnings to be pegged to schooling in screened occupations. But, by

the corollary of the screening hypothesis, ability must vary directly

with schooling for the signalling process to remain in equilibrium.

Thus, for young salaried workers we would also expect earnings to be

positively related to ability.

     The vocational training variable VOTRAIN will allow us an addi-

tional test for employer screening. The screening thesis maintains

that schooling (after a certain point) serves to signal on—the—job

productivity but does not augnnt it. However, vo'atiOnal training,

by its very   definition,   is geared to providing job—specific skills.




      101n occupations with customer screening, the uncertain group
would behave like the more certain self—employed group and acquire
the additional schooling needed for setting up their own business.
Therefore, no prediction is offered on the relative magnitudes of the
coefficients of SE(PERN) and SE(NEW) in these occupations.
                                      —15—




Therefore, on prima facie grounds, we should expect a different rela-
tion between schooling and earnings for those with and without voca-
tional training. In particular, we would hypothesize two different
sets of relations for white—collar and blue—collar workers.
       White—collar (professional and technical, administrative, sales
and    clerical) workers are generally drawn from a pool of high school

graduates and college matriculants (see below). Suppose employers

screen the available pool of high school and college students on the

basis of schooling level, grades, and other indicators of ability

(references, for example) and hire          the most able for white—collar
positions    with the   intention   of training them (programmers, for example).

Those not hired, the less able, may attend a specialized vocational

school   (a computer programming institute, for example) to acquire
specific    job—related schools.     Employers may then hire from a second
pool   of prospective candidates, those who graduate from vocational

institutes, and select on the       basis    of demonstrated capabilities.

Employers will pay a premium to the first group for their greater

(signalled) ability and to the second group for their already acquired

job—specific skills. On net, the two          groups   may have comparable   earn-
ings, but    the second group will    have more years of    schooling. In

terms of our model, then, we would predict a positive coefficient on

VOCTPAIN.

       Blue—collar (skilled and craft, semi—skilled and operative,
unskilled,   and service) workers are generally drawn from a pool of
high school drop—outs and graduates (see below). In their case we
                                        —16—




might expect   self—selection to occur during high school with the less

academically capable pursuing vocational training in high school and

'dropping   Out" and   the   more capable pursuing an academic program and
graduating. Enmloyers        hiring for blue—collar jobs may then hire

from    two pools. They may hire high school graduates or near graduates
on the basis of their greater demonstrated ability with the intention
of training them, and        they   may also hire high school drop—outs with
vocational training on the basis of their acquired skills. Here too
the two groups should have comparable earnings——the first because         of

their   greater (signalled) ability and the second for their job—specific
skills. But the second group will have less schooling. In terms of
our model, then, we would predict a negative coefficient on VOCTRAIN.

III. Results
       We extracted full samples of 39 out of the 439 occupations in the
1970 1/100 Census Public Use Sample. The occupations we chose met
the following two criteria: (1) the number of self—employed in the
occupational sample exceeded 50 and (2) the number of salaried in the
sample exceeded 50. Fifty—four occupations fulfilled these two criteria.
Of these we selected 39 to be fairly representative of the broad spec-
trum of skill levels in the occupational hierarchy."
       Table 1 shows the mean schooling level for self—employed and

salaried as well as the percent self—employed and occupation size for




            is not to suggest that these are the only occupations where
we suspect screening occurs, only that these are the ones we can most
easily test for the occurrence of screenIng.

each of the 39 occupations. The percentage self—emi,loyed varies

considerably across occupations and ranges from 3 to 91 percent,

though half the occupations lie in the 10 to 30 percent interval.

(For the labor force as a whole, about 7 percent are self—employed.)

No systematic relation is apparent between the percentage self—

employed and position on the occupational hierarchy. Schooling

levels generally decline down the occupational ladder. For the

professional and technical group, mean schooling varies between 12

and 18 years of schooling for both the salaried and self—employed

groups; for the managerial and administrative group, the range is

12 to 15 years; and for the sales and clerical group, the range is

also 12 to 15 years. In only 2 of the 19 white—collar occupations

is the mean schooling level less than 12 years. For the skilled

and craft group the range in mean schooling levels is 10 to 12 years;

for the onerative and semi—skilled groui the mean schooling level

rounds to 10 years for each occupation; for laborers the mean schooling

level is 9 years; for farmers it is 11 years; and for service workers

the range is 10 to 11 years. In only 1 out of the 21 blue—collar

occupations   does the mean schooling level exceed 12 years.
     The mean schooling levels of salaried and self—employed workers,
unadjusted for differences in earnings and demograhic characteristics,
follow the hypothesized pattern in some groups but not in others. In
the professional and technical group, riean education is higher for
self—employed workers in 4 occupations and lower in 2. In the managerial
and administrative grouD, mean schooling is lower for the self—ennloyed

in 4 occupations and higher in only 1. In the sales and clerical

group schooling is higher for the self—employed in 2 occupations and

lower in 4.       In the craft and skilled group, schooling is higher     in
6 and lower in 3. In the operative group, it is higher in 1 and

lower in 3. In the laborer, farm and service groups it is higher in

3 and lower in 4. The actual schooling levels are fairly close between

salaried and self—employed workers. In fact, in 30 of the 39 occupa-

tions, schooling levels are within a half a year of each other for the

two groups.

       Occupational size varies considerably among occupations. The

largest occupation in the sample is managers and administrators N. E. C.

(not   elsewhere classified) with over two—and—a—half million members,
and the smallest farm managers with 37,000.       About   16 percent   of the

labor force is represented in this sample and ahout 22 perent of the

self—emDloyed.      About 80 percent of the self—employed in our sample
fall in the category managers and administrators N. E. C.

is   significant in all occupations except nine. The coefficients are

generally highest in professional and managerial occupations, lower

for sales and   clerical workers,   and     lowest   for blue—collar workers.

This   indicates that the returns to schooling are greater for white—
collar workers than for blue—collar ones. (See Eckaus (1973), Wolff
(1977) and Wolff and Bushe (1976) for similar          results.) The coefficient

of Log(Y) is significant in all occupations except five. The coeffi-

cient value of Log(Y) and its significance level is greater than those

of Log(E) in 34 out of the 39 occupations, but the coefficient values

of Log(Y) and Log(E) are highly correlated.

       The signs of the   coefficients of SE(PERN) and SE(EW) conform
very closely to prediction. In the professional and technical group,
14 out of the 16   coefficients are positive in Forms 1        and   2. In the
managerial   group, the coefficients are negative in 8 out of 10 cases

in   the two Forms. In the sales and clerical group, the coefficients
are positive in 8 out of 11 cases for Form 1 and 7 out of 11 cases for
Form 2. In the craft and skilled group, the signs are positive in 17
out of 18 cases, and in the operative and semi—skilled group in 8 out

of   10 cases. In the laborer and service groups, the coefficient signs
are mixed, with 5 negative and 7 positive.
       The coefficient values and their significance level vary consider-

ably among occupations, though the two are highly correlated. Self—

employed accountants acquired, on average, over half a year more

schooling than salaried accountants, as did the permanently self—

employed dentists and the newly self—enmloyed photographers compared

to their salaried counterparts. Self—employed health administrators
                                       —24—




averaged more than two years less schooling than salaried health
administrators, and self—employed managers N.E.C. about a year less
schooling than salaried managers. Permanently           self—employed   insurance
agents, brokers,         and underwriters   spent, on average, a half year
more in school than their salaried counterparts, while self—employed

estimators and investigators spent about a year less in school. Self—

employed bakers, carpenters, decorators and window dressers, electricians,

jewelers      and watchmakers, construction and maintenance painters, dress-
makers and      seamstresses, and welders and flame—cutters acquired between

a half and about one—and—a—half more years of schooling than their

salaried      counterparts. The coefficents are significant at the 5 percent

level and have the predicted sign in about 30 percent          of the cases in
the   professional and technical group, 50 percent of the cases in the

managerial group, 40 percent of the cases in the sales and clerical

group, 60 percent of the cases in the craft group, and 50 percent of

the cases      in   the operative group.

        In   the managerial and administrative group, the coefficient of
SE(NEW) was predicted to be higher than that of SE(PERM). This is the
case in only 3 out of the 5 occupations. The coefficents of SE(PERN)
and SE(NEW)      in   Form 1 have   the same sign as the coefficients of SE(PEEN)
and   SE(NEW)    in Form 2 in all cases except one. The coefficients of
SE(PERM) and SE(NEW) are less in Form 2 than in Form 1 in 33 percent
of   the cases.       This suggests an upward bias on the coefficents in the

labor   earnings Form.       However, the coefficient values are quite close

in   the two    Forms,   indicating that the bias is snail.

                                                                                    .

        The VOCTRAIN variable also behaves closely to prediction. Among

white—collar workers the coefficient of VOCTRAIN is positive in 74

percent of the cases, and of the positive coefficients significant at

the 5 percent level in 79 percent of the cases. Among blue—collar

workers the coefficient of VOCTRAIN is negative in 100 percent of the

cases   and   of these significant at the 1 percent level in 86 percent

of the cases. Among the white—collar workers, 47 percent of the coef-

ficient are above .5, indicating that vocational training increased

the average stay in school by at least half a year for this group.

Among   the blue—collar workers, 86 percent of the coefficients are
less than —.5 and 29 percent less than —1, indicating an appreciable
shortening of schooling with    vocational training.


IV    Conclusion
      The screening hypothesis states that certain classes of workers
obtain more schooling than that necessary for the specific or general
skills required in their work in order to signal employers or customers
who may contract their services. Among those working for someone else,
extra   schooling will be acquired to signal a prospective employer.

Among self—employed managers, no additional schooling will be obtained,

since   their services are administrative and not contracted by   anyone

else. Among other self—employed workers, extra schooling will be pursued

to   attract prospective clients. Their schooling 7il1 exceed that of
salaried workers in the same occupation in order to compete successfully
against the firms in which the latter are employed.
      The ermirical results provide broad suPPort for the screening
                                            —26—



hypothesis.       In the managerial and      administrative   group, the evidence
strongly supports the case          for   employer screening. This is particularly
true for the category managers N.E.C., who comprise 22 percent of the
sample labor force and        80   percent of the self—employed workers in the
sample.    The actual magnitude of the screening portion of ecuation is
relatively modest——between a half and a full year of schooling out of
12 to 15 years. In the        professional     and technical, sales and clerical,
craft and      skilled,   and operative    and semi—skilled groups, the results
indicate   a pervasive     pattern of customer screening. Here too the rela-
tive   magnitude of the screening portion of schooling is modest. Among

skilled and semi—skilled workers, where we might expect minimal employer

screening, between a half and a full year of schooling out of 10 to 12

years constitutes the signalling portion.
       Additional corroboration of the screening hviothesis is provided

by the results for the vocational training variable. In the case of

blue—collar workers, we hypothesized that some self—selection occurs

during the high school years. The more (academically) able complete

high school, while the less able acquire vocational training and 'drop

out. In the case of white—collar workers, we hvothesized that the

more able are hired directly by an et1oyer from high school or college,

while the less able continue their schooling in some vocational program.

In both cases, the acquisition of specific job—related skills serves as

a   substitute for the greater ability signalled by formal schooling. An
employer   pays   those with vocational training a premium        for their acquired

skills   and   those   with formal    a premium for their greater ability.
                                     schooling

This hypothesis was also confirmed by our empirical results.
