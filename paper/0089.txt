In some applications of the di stributed lag model, theory ruires that
all lag coefficients have a positive sign. A distributed lag estimator
which provides estimated coefficients with positive sign is developed
here wi-ich is analogous to an earlier distributed lag estimator derived
from "othness prior s" which did not assure that all estimated coef-
ficients be positive. The earlier estimator with unconstrained signs
was a posterior mode of the coefficients based on a spherically normal
"smoothness prior" in the d+l order differences of the coefficients.
The newer estimator with constrained sign is a posterior mode of the
logs of the coefficients based on spherically normal "smoothness prior"
on the d+l order differences of the logs of the coefficients. The
meaning of both categories of prior is discussed in this paper and
they are compared to prior parameterizations of the lag curve. Both
varieties of "smoothness prior", in contrast to the parameterizations,
allow the coefficients to assume any "smooth" shape subject to the
sign constraint. The sign-constrained estintor has the additional
advantage that it easily forms asnptotes. Moreover, the sign con-
strained estimator is easily implemented. The estimate can be obtained
by an iterative procedure involving regressions with dumiiy observations
similar to thnse used to find the unconstrained sign estimator. An
illustrative example of the application of both estimators is given
at the end of the paper.

                                I. Introduction

Linear distributed lags are widely used in econometrics to model
relationships between economic variables when the relationships
are not well described in terms of a simple correlation between
contemporaneous values of the variables but are rather distributed
over time. Typically the response of an economic variable y to
variations in another economic variable x may be sluggish and delayed.
For instance, a response in terms of personal consumption expenditure
(y) to government policy which influences disposable personal income
Cx)   may be felt for a period of years following the policy action.
In the absence of a theoretical structure for the relationship, it is
often valuable to assume that it has a simple linear form.
    A tine series y at time t is said to follow a 'tlinear distributed
lag" on another tine series x if:

              y   .E .1 xt-i. +
               t 1o               c
                                      t                                (1)

where the .1 are     constant coefficients (which will have to be estimated)

A   is the "lag   length" and     is astationary stochastic process with
zero   mean   and independent of x. In this paper we will be concerned with
the   question: how can we represent our prior knowledge concerning the

vector of distributed lag coefficients            iO X-l? Since the distributed
                                             —2—




lag model has many parameters, the representation of this prior knowledge
is an essential element of our modeling. A number of parametrizations
or   prior distributions has      been suggested     for   economic applications
arid   we will discuss their meaning. In particular, we will discuss a prior

distribution on which we call            "normal   smoothness priors" (Shiller     [1973])
and    will   develop a variant   of   it   which we call "log normal smoothness
priors". These priors can be used to derive estimators of the coefficients
which have desirable properties. The new prior yields an estimator which

has    the   property that all the .,        iO, A-i, are specified to   be greater

than    zero. The earlier   prior      yields an estimator with unconstrained

sign.

        We will also present here an illustrative example of an estimation

problem using the constrained sign estimator as well as the unconstrained

sign    estimator.

     II. The Estimation Problem arid Traditional       (Parametric)   Approaches to it
            The literature on the estimation of distributed la is very extensive
     since it is a fundamental problem for econometric modelling. We cannot
     do justice to the litrature here. The reader is referred to two articles
     which survey the literature: &i1iches [1965] and Sims [19 74]. However,
     we do wish to make sane comparison between the traditional parameterizations
     and a Bayesian approach with regard to their assumed prior knowledge.
             The term "distributed lag" in economics we first coined by
     Irving Fisher   in   the 1920's who used this model to represent the response
     of   interest rates to inflation rates. The distributed lag model may        also   be

     called a "linear     transfer function" model   or "linear filter" model. Such

     linear model have been used extensively in many branches of science and

     engineering. What distinguishes our econometric problem from these          other
     applications   is just the nature of the vague prior knowledge concerning

     the coefficients coupled with the shortage of data available in most

     economic applications.

            When the relation (1) is structural (i.e. will continue to hold even

     after policy makers interfere with x) then we generally expect the lag

     coefficients      to trace out (if plotted against i) a ttsimplett or "smooth"

     curve. Given that (1) is a structural relation, then we can assess

     our   prior beliefs regarding the     by asking what would we expect about

     the result of an experiment in which    x0 is given a unit shock by policy
     makers without changing x in    other time periods. The increment in       y
     caused by   the shock will be .      If the structural relation from x to y
     is   a sluggish one, we would expect the curve       will he a smooth one which
tails off for high t. We may          not,     however, wish to rule out the

possibility that   the   curve may    be   bijrodal    or   have negative values over

some   interval, etc. The minimal kind             of prior Imowledge that we

generally will wish to assume is that the curve is probably fairly
simple.
       Sims (1974) has    emphasized      that if a random economic time series
   is projected on current         and lagged      values of another time series
    there is no reason to expect a "smooth" distributed lag even                if   the   time
series themselves   are smooth. This should caution those who estimate

distributed lags in cases in which there is no theoretical structure.

However, cases in which (1) is likely to be useful for policy purposes are

likely to be confined to those cases in which (1) in a

relationship with a simple, stable form.

       The   problem is to   estimate .        iO, A-l given n observations      of y,

                                   and
             ;-+2                        given a matrix X whose coluirns are curTent


and lagged values of x, X. .x              .   .      Then we may write:
                              ij    t—n+i-j+1


                               Y=X+                                                         (2)

where iB is the vector o'l' xa) and                    c is spherically normally distributed

with precision h (i.e. with variance cY2l/h) and is independent of x. The

likelihood function of        is then:



                                         exp(— h(Y-X)'(Y-X))                                (3)

The maximum likelihood       estimate of           is then the ordinary   least squares

estimate
                                     —5—


        The   problem with the maximum likelihood estimate is that it is
not based on any (proper) prior knowledge regarding the coefficients.
Since economic time series are usually short and X exhibits multicollinearity
the problem is significant. If the values          are   plotted   against i,
the    shape   one typically gets in jagged and erratic, with coefficient

frequently changing sign.

        The simplest way to represent the assumption that the coefficents

lie on a smooth curve is to parametrize the ,
                                                     1g(i,a,b,c,..)       and

to   reduce the problem to the estimation of a smaller group of parameters
a, b, c,. The most popular such parametrization is that proposed by
A].nion [1965], in which the f3 are assumed to lie on dth degree

polynomial in i.      Thus, Ay where A is a matrix with d+l independent
coluims whose 1th element is given by a polynomial in          of degree d

or   lower. The constrained maximum likelihood estisrte a of            is then
                          The estimates of     will if plotted against       then
lie    on the familiar class of polynomials (a straight line if thi, a

parabola if d2,      etc.).   While the coefficients are   assured   a more simple shape,

they    are probably constrained too much by this procedure. For instance,
the coefficients cannot then "tail off". A polynomial can approximate an
asymptote in a region only by "oscillating" around it, the number of
slope changes limited to d.
       The Almon procedure can easily be improved by substituting a different
matrix A. Any parametrization of which is linear in the parameters
i.e.    =Ay can be estimated as easily. For instance, piecewise linear

distributed lags have been thus implemented. An       improvement on the A]on
                                         —6—




procedure    would clearly be to assume an A matrix which can more easily

produce as>miptotes. We might hypothesize an A matrix whose columns

consist of negative powers of i, for instance.

        While   such linear   parametrizations may be convenient and useful,

they    have a united ability to represent prior information. By setting
 3=Ay' where A has m independent columns, we constrain the coefficients
  to lie on an (mt) order linear manifold. There is no linear manifold
which well represents the kind of prior }iiowledge we have regarding the
 coefficients. This kind of constraint always allows the coefficents
 to change sign m-l tines or to fit rn-i "outliers". We cannot prevent
 erratic shapes without keeping rn very small, in which case the lag has been
 constrained    to lie on an elementary class of shapes.
        Other   parametrizations which are nonlinear have    been suggested
which    are less convenient computationally but are in some cases more

 accurate as representations of prior knowledge. These include Koyck's

 geometric lag and its generalization the rational lag of Jorgenson which

 has a rational generating function,and Solow's negative binomial distributed

lag.

         Some of   these parametrizations (e.g. the rational lag) may create
problems   because they do not prevent certain inprobable      lag structures   and
make   assumptions about the tail of the lag distribution (for which the
data may carry no information) which do not have any intuitive economic
interpretation. When one uses the rational lag parametrization it is often
found that the estinated lag oscillates in sign or explodes rather than
tails off for high i. Before using any parametrization, one must always
ask what   the constraints mean in     economic terms   and whether   these constraints
are    appropriate   for the application.

III.    Bayesian Approaches to Distributed Lag Estimation

        An   alternative approach to distributed lag estimation is
a Bayesian    approach   which uses probalilistic prior information rather
than parametrization       (see e.g., Learner [1972], Cleveland [1974],

Shiller [1973]): This approach has the advantage that we do not impose

arbitary constraints      which we do not believe in. A Baye5ian estimation
procedure generally allows the estimated coefficients to take on any form,
the prior beliefs       only influence the estimates rather than constrain

them and allow the data to overwhelm the priors in any direction              in
which   the data is strong.

        We are interested here in Bayesian priors which represent only

the belief that    the        trace out a "smooth"    curve,   and which carry     no
information about the size of any         one   coefficient considered separately.

One class of such priors which was suggested in an earlier paper

(Shiller, [1973]) we call, "Smoothness priors". The priors are designed
to effectively break the near multicollinearity among the lagged variables               that

often   produces erratic coefficient estimates even when the standard error of
the regression in small, yet otherse carry no information, These priors
put a zero mean spherically normal distribution on the d+l order difference
u of the coefficients:
                                 u   R

where   R is a (X-d-lxX) matrix which forms         d+l   order   differences of   the
coefficients and which has rank A-d-1EP. The ij th element of R is zero
if j-i>d+l or if i>j and is otherwise equal to (_i)J1() . Given
this prior on u, we take an uninformative prior f() constant on any
d+1 of the ,      and   get   with a change of    variables a prior which is
uninformative on any of the ft, taken separately:
                                     —8—



                              f(s)     exp   —
                                             22
                                                'R'R

       If the prior variance         is small, then the priors assert that the

coefficients will in some sense "hang together". In the limit, as

goes to zero, our priors approach the Aixion prior that the coefficients

lie on a d degree polynomial2. It is irnporrtant to emphasize, however,

that the priors are not well described is asserting that the coefficients

lie near a d degree polynomial. One could have alternatively assumed, as did

Maddala (19Th), that a0+a1i+.. .adi E1 where c. is spherically normally
distributed and the coefficients a ,a              a    are independent of c: and
                                                    d
have a flat marginal distribution. The Maddala prior would assert that the

coefficients can not deviate far from some polynomial and is indifferent as

to how irregular are the deviations of the coefficients from the

polynomial. The smoothness prior, on         the   other hand   asserts,   if    is
relatively small, that the can deviate dramatically from any polynomial
if it does so gradually, i.e., in a "smooth" manner. If do then the priors
will readily allow     the lag curve to assume any shape        which does not require
the adjacent coefficients to be much different. If dl the priors allow

any   shape   in which the slopes do not change quickly, i, .e. it does not like

"jagged" shapes. These may      be    understood as "flexible curve" priors.

A flexible curve is a     rubber   ruler used   by draftsmen    to interpolate   points.

In a sense, the first degree smoothness prior allows any distributed lag

shape which could easily be drawn using a flexible curve, that is,

which does not require that     the    curve be bent too hard.
                                        —9—


       This prior, when applied to the likelihood function (3) yields a

posterior by Bayes Lw1, assuming for the mcnent h is given, which is

multivariate     rionrial:
                                    n
                                    2
                                                                  2
                   f(IX,Y,h) _- exp         (—hC(Y—X)'(Y—X)+1< B'R'R]                 (5)




where K=     .    One   may take   the   mean (or mode)     as   an estihate of .

This   will be our    estimator with unconstrained        sign. The estimate

can be obtained by regressing Y and           X matrices augnented with dummy
observation. Defining:


                               xjXl              1o
                                                                                      (6)


then the posterior mean can be found by regressing the auT1ented matrix
Y on the augnented matrix X:

                                   (x'x+K2R'RY- x'Y                                   (7)


       The great advantage of this procedure over parametrizat ions is
most evident in cases in which the standard error of the regression is
small and the X matrix exhibits near-multicollinearity. In this case,
ordinary least squares will either fail altogether to produce a unique
estimate or will produce a jagged erratic estimate. A parametrization

will of course      always produce a lag      curve which   lies in the class of elementary

shapes that the parametrization allows, even if this produces a much higher
standard errcr. The smoothness priors estimate, on the other hand,
effectively deals with the multicollinearity by smoothing the curve,
                                   — 10    -



but at the same time allowing the curve to take on any simple shape.
If the true lag curve is a simple curve which does not lie near the class
of curves specified by the parametrization estimates, than the smoothness
estimate will have a much better fit. Moreover, the estimate
could not have been seen at all in the ordinary least squares estimate.
One cannot visually "smooth" the ordinary least square estimate to
produce a rough smoothness prior estimate, since in so doing one would
not be taking into account the nature of the multicoilinearity in the X
matrix. These properties of the estimators as compared with the AJinon
estimator are illustrated in a case with a Iciown    lag   curve in Shiller,
[1973] and   in Wilson [1975].

      The smoothness prior estimate with unconstrained sign        has proven
very useful, but suffers from a couple of problems at least in certain
applications: 1. it is of-ten difficult to specify the      parameter K is not

unit free   and   2.   the prior allows coefficients to change sign, whereas in
many applications we believe the coefficients should all be positve or
all be   negative.

       The first problem, that of choosing K, has led some authors to a

ridge regression approach to the problem: Hill and Johnson [1975],

Learner [19714] and Maddala [19714]. It is true   that   the kind of prior

information we have in applications of distributed       lags may indeed be
of   the same vague nature as that which many   think justifies the kind
of judgemental    approach inherent  the ridge regression procedure.
                                      in

The difference between our estimator     and the original ridge

estimator is then merely that our priors relate to the differences of
                                   — 11   —




the coefficients rather than their levels,
     It is quite possible, on the other hand, that we can in fact easily
specify a proper prior on sane function of the coefficients which is
unit free, such as their ratio. Even though we rray have no prior notion
as to the magnitude of the difference               -      we   may have prior
information that, say,    should not differ from                     by more than n%.
     The natural extension of smoothness priors to              deal   with these
problems is then a prior on the d+l order difference V of the logs
of    the coefficients, (as mentioned in Shiller          [1973]):

                             V     Rb

where b log(s).

       We then give V a spherically normal distribution with zero mean.

If we   now choose flat   priors   on d+l of the blog                 constant, then we

get, with a change of variables, a prior on the b which is uninfoniative

on    any b1   considered separately:


                             f(b) exp(- —-- b'R'Rb)                                       (9)
                                               2
        This   expression, with   a change    of   variables, implies a prior

distribution      on which is a partially degenerate (uninformative)
multivariate log normal distribution. The marginal prior on any
considered separately is the Jeffreys (1961) uninformative prior
f(.)o l/.          If R is a matrix which forms first differences (i.e. d0)

then the priors assert that, in effect, any         lag shape is probable for
which the proportional change between          adjacent coefficients is not too high.

If   is very small, the priors reduce to the zero degree      Almon contraint.

If dcl, then the priors assert that the rate of change between adjacent
coefficient should not change too fast, thus the prior also asserts
that the lag curve should not be too "jagged". If dl then as + 0

the priors approach the Koyck constraint that the coefficients should lie

on a geometric distribution, If d2, the limiting case as + 0 is the

constraint -that the lag curve be proportional to a noniial density

(or its inverse), These limiting constraints are likely to be more

acceptable than the polynomial constraints.

     The log smoothness priors have the additional property that the prior

conditional variance of    given adjacent coeficients il' l' etc.,
is small when the adjacent coefficients are small and large when the

adjacent coefficients are large. The priors thus "tighten" up in

regions in which the coefficients are small, as in the tail of the lag

distribution; and assert that a single large coefficient in the tail

is very improbable. The priors thus embody essentially what Learner [1972]

has called the "principle of proportionality" in distributed lag priors

In contrast the variance of      conditional on il' F3j+l...     is   independent

of
         i÷l•• with    priors which are multivariate nonrial on the coefficients

themselves rather than their logs.

     Combining (9) with (3) and substituting eb for , we get, by Bayes

Law, the posterior of b:


               f(bIX,Y) hr/2    exp-     [(Y_Xe(Y_Xeb) K2b'R'Rb])                   (10)


which is, unfortunately, not   an easy distribution to deal   with.



                                                                                           .

A modal estimate of b may, however,                  be found with an iteretive procedure.
We can write an expression which give the posterion mode                         i.1icitly.
It will      be   convenient to write the expression in terms of
which will be our constrained            sign       estimate.     By differentiating (10)
with respect to b, setting to zero and substituting we get an iinplicit
function for the mode b . Substituting b( log

where K is a/ and the matrix diag ( ) is defined as a diagonal matrix
whose             element is          If the ordinary least squares estimate is
positive,        then   as K + 0   the estimate         approaches the ordinary least
squares      estimate. This property           of   the estimator of        is the result of

having      chosen   as an estimate the mode          of   the posterior distribution of b

rather than        of   the posterior distribution of .             In   general, the limit

of c as K goes to zero is the constrained maximum likelihood                         estimator in
which      all   elements are forced to be positive.

       An understanding        of the behavior of          the estimator is facilitated

by considering the isoensity contours of the prior distribution of

and   b.    The siuplest case, in which has                only   two elements

and   when d0 is shown in Figure 1. In Figure la, the isodensi-ty

for normal smoothness priors appear as a series of parallel lines. The

center line, representing the prior mode, is a 1.f5° line which passes

through the origin. In Figure lb we see the isodensity curves of the

log normal smoothness priors, i.e., the prior on blog( ),                      but   expressed
                                           - lL -


in   terms    of rather than b. These are       a series of   straight   lines in the
positive quadrant      only    which converge at the origin. Learner [1975] has

discussed both classes of isodensity contours; the first he calls

"cylindrically uniform priors" and the second "conically uniform priors".

A discussion of these contours is of course more general than a discussion

of the prior      distribution since more than      one prior density can have

the   same set of contours.
        In   each case, the mode of the posterior distribution will lie on the

locus of tangencies of the isodensity contours with isolikelihood contours.

This locus has been called the "information contract curve" [Learner, (1975)]

or   "curve decolletage". Just where along the curve the mode occurs depends
on K.
        The likelihood contours are concentric ellipses centered on the
maximum likelihood estimate. In Figure 1, these are drawn for a
(somewhat pathological) case in which the maximum likelihood estimate would
make         negative and 2 positive. For Figure la the curve of tangencies
is a straight line connecting the maximum likelihood estimate with the
tangency of an      isolikelihood   ellipse with the center    line   of the isodensity
contours. Modes can occur only on the segment (shaded darker) connecting
the maximum likelihood estimate to the 5° line. The higher the value of K,
the closer the Bayesian estimate will be to the 145° line, for low K, the
estimate     of     is still   negative, but for K sufficiently tight both
coefficients      must lie in the positive quadrant.

       For   log   normal smoothness priors, on the other hand, the locus of
tangencies     lies on an      ellipse which passes         through the maximum likelihood

estimate and the origin, arid which has the same eccentricity as the

likelihood ellipses (for proof, see Learner [1975]). Not all points on

this   ellipse are eligible modes however; only that                part (which is shaded

dark)   which likes in the positive quadrant between                the maximum likelihood

estimate and       the Ll.5°   line   qualifies. As K approaches zero the estimate

approaches the cons-trained maxiiaun likelihood estimate (i.e., the                tangency
of   a likelihood ellipse with the vertical axis).

       As K approaches infinity, the estimate approaches the 5° line.

For this case, when dO, both estimators have the same limit as K -'-

but this result does not hold with higher d.

        Had we specified the same prior on the ratios of the coefficients but

instead required the individual coefficients to be negative rather than

positive, we would find a mode which lies instead on the section of the

tangency ellipse which lies in the negative quadrant between the 5°

live and the maximum likelihood estimate, (also shaded darker in

Figure ib). Here, as K                00 -the estimate would approach zero. Had

the maximum likelihood estimate appeared elsewhere, negative modes

might not exist.

        It should be noted, that the above two dimensional example is somewhat

misleading, It should be remembered               that      the three dimensional generalizations

of   the priors are not symmetrical cylinders or cones but "flattened"
cylinders and cones. That is, -the isolikehood cylinder in the three
dimensional case        with dO has       an   intersection with the plane
                                          - 17   —




   +       +        constant   which is an ellipse, not a circle. In three

dimensions     the curve of tangencies for normal smoothness            priors with d 0

will    not, in genex.l, be a straight line.
        One problem   which might arise in estimation is that            in the
                                                                        even

positive quadrant the modal          estimate    may not be unique. If the X matrix is
of the right form, we might          find a dependency among the equations

defining        (expression (11)) so that        a unique maximum cannot       be found.
This    situation   would be   analogous   to that     in which   the Alnon   procedure
fails when A'X'XA      cannot be inverted. In addition, it is also possible

under some circumstances        that the posterior distribution may have more
than   one local maximum.       It might be a good idea to search for all local

maxima in order to     find    the   global maxijiuim.   However,   even in    cases   where

multiple modes may     arise,   we are    likely     to be satisfied with the mode
which   lies closest to the prior mean.

IV.     An Iterative Procedure
        A Gauss-Newton type iterative procedure to find the constrained estimate
was chosen which is easily implemented once we have a computer program
which implements the unconstrained estimate .      Though   our estimate will
be the mode of b, it was thought convenient to deal directly with .
That   is, our estimate    will maximize the expression:

                 (Y—X)'(Y—X) + K2 1og()'R'R 1og()                               (12)
with   respect to .   To do this, we will approximate the second term in

the expression by a quadratic function of     in the vicinity of a guess

         If we chose this approximation to be a positive definite quadratic

form in (s-c) where c is a constant, then the miniiaim     of   the

approximation to the expression (12) can be found by an ordinary        least
squares   regression involving matrices auented   by dummy      observations.
Along   Gauss-Newton lines, we substitute the first degree Taylor approximation

                 log(s)   ]og(') +    diag()_1(_)                               (13)


into   (12):




        (Y—X)'


                                                                                (lL.)




The maximum i1) of (1L1) is then given by:




                                                                                        S
          [X'X]X'Y                                                              (15)
                              - 19   -




where:

                                                                    (16)
           [icdiagy']                        [_iuog(U
If one already has a program which implements simple smoothness

priors, it is a very easy matter to have the program build these
matrices as well. The procedure, then, will be to form an initial
guess (O) for the posterior mode, and then form X and Y based on
this guess, and regress Y on X to get a revised guess

      is then used to form new matrices X and Y to yield a new
estimate           The process is repeated until           up to
some tolerance. When this occurs, expression (11) is satisfied

by         and j+l is the posterior mode

     In each iteration we can say that we are approximating the
prior distribution of      by a normal distribution, that is, the

Taylor representation of Rlog: R(log)+diag(-'))
rather than Rlog itself is assumed spherically normally distrib-
uted with zero mean and with variance .
     In   terms of the isodensity contours displayed in figure 1,
we see that the approximation substitutes a system of parallel

lines for the system of intersecting lines in lb in such a way
that the isodensity contour of the approximation which passes

through the guess        coincides with the actual isodensity
contour in lb which passes through this point.
     If the regression program prints standard errors of the
coefficients, then these too will have an interpretation in
                              — 20   —




terms of the aDtroximating normal Eriors. Under the assumlDtion
that the estimated standard error, of the regression is the

true standard error, then the standard error of the coefficients

printed by the program will be the posterior standard errors
based on the approximating normal prior. If the standard error
of the regression a is not known but is given a prior distri-
bution f(a)      1/a then, under the assumption that the ratio

K a/ is known, the marginal posterior of each coefficient
will have a student distribution with scale parameter equal to

the standard error printed and degrees of freedom as printed

by the program (see Zellner [1971]).

    The iterative procedure may be compared with the Newtor-Rapheson
Method. The complete Newton step for maximizing (12) would be:

(i+l)         XtX +   K2diagR'Rdiag()
          _K2diag_2diag(RcRlog) ]_l
        x [XY -       2K2diagR'Rlog']                            (17)


which cannot in general be implemented by a regression technique
involving dummy observations, so that the procedure is less
convenient from our point of view. However, we note that if we
choose our initial guess 0) so that Rlog0 0 (i.e. so that
the guess is itself a truncated Koyck, normal density etc.) then
the two procedures will be identical for the first iteration.

If in subsequent iterations Rlog$ remains small, subsequent

iterations will also be similar, and our iterative procedure will

show approximately quadratic convergence.

V.   An Illustrative Exanp1e

     To illustrate the application of the estimator based on

log smoothness priors, we have chosen an example in which simple
smoothness priors do not perform as well as we'd like. This
is a case in which we expect the coefficients to be positive

and yet the final estimated coefficients (estimated without

endpoint constraints) do not "tail off at the end but instead
become negative. The equation estimated is a term structure

equation developed originally by Modigliani and Sutch which
relates long term interest rates to a distributed lag7on

past short term rates of interest. Modigliani and Sutch

hypothesized that long term interest rates are determined by
expectations of future short rates of interest which in turn

are related to a long distributed lag on past short rates of

interest. The distributed lag, they asserted, should be
smooth except that the first coefficient in the distributed lag

(i.e. that corresponding to the contemporaneous short rate

of interest) might differ substantially from the others due
to an impact effect of the current short rate. They estimated
the relation with the Almon polynomial constraint that did not
constrain the first coefficient of the lag. The relation was
improved and reestimated using the estimator based on first

degree smoothness priors in Modigliani and Shiller £1973]   ,   and
was also discussed in Shiller [1973]. It was discovered at
this time that if the distributed lag is extended to 2

quarters, that the 'tail" of the distributed lag becomes

negative.    Prior information that coefficients should not be
negative was then incorporated in an ad hoc manner by merely
truncating the lag after 16 quarters. It would be interesting

to see, then, what kind of lag curve our log smoothness prior
estimate will produce when the lag is extended over the entire

24 quarter period and estimated without endpoint priors.4
    The unconstrained sign estimate     of the distributed
lag with K     20 and d   1 appears (except for the first

coefficient) in figure 2a.5 The shape is roughly as expected
except for the negative coefficients in the tail. If the curve
is reestimated using endpoint priors, then the lag curve is

still negative in the tail but heads up at the end.

    An Almon procedure using a third degree polynomial constraint
produces an estimate which is similar to that in figure 2a in

that the final coefficients are negative. An Almon estimate
using a third degree polynomial constraint with the far end
point tied to zero also produced negative coefficients in the

tail. Among these procedures, the best way to impose non-
negativity in the tail appears to be to truncate the lag
distribution, i.e. choose a shorter lag length A.

    Ordinary least squares produced the typical jagged erratic
estimate of the lag coefficients. The coefficients frequently
alternated in sign, and ranged from -.15 to .24. No semblance
of the above estimates could be seen in the ordinary least square

estimate.
                            —24 -



    Using the absolute value of the estimate in figure 2a as
an initial guess, the iterative procedure described above was
used to find the constrained sign estimate    with d = 1 and
with K = 20.   In each iteration the absolute value of the

coefficient estimated in the previous iteration was used as

the guess .    The first two iterations still produced
negative values in the tail, but all negative values disappeared
by the third iteration. The coefficients had all converged to
two decimal place accuracy. by the sixth iteration. The
estimated lag curve, which appears in figure 2b, looks like a

truncated geometric (Koyck) lag. This is not surprising,
since a value of K = 20 represents a tight prior. Based on the

standard error estimated at .28 in the first simple smoothness

prior estimates, this prior variance on the second differences
of the logs of the coefficients is only        .014. That is,
the priors assert that the ratio of a pair of adjacent

coefficients should probably not differ from the ratio of the

next pair of coefficients by more than 1 or 2%. In our estimate,
V   Rlog has its largest (in absolute value) element just after
the hump, where it reaches -.008. All elements of V are negative,
so the estimated curve does deviate systematically from a

geometric lag. althrough not to a great degree.
    In order to view the effects of a weaker log smoothness

prior, K was changed from 20 to 3 and the iteration continued,

using as a starting guess    the estimate that had been reached
                            0
                                  — 25 —




with    K        20, and again substituting in each iteration the
absolute value of the estimate from the previous iteration
as the guess            Negative values of the coefficients in the
tail of the lag distribution immediately reappeared in the
first iteration. Since by the second iteration the negative
coefficients did not seem to be getting smaller, the tail

coefficients were changed to small positive numbers in the

guess        that was used for the third iteration. There were then
no negative coefficients estimated in the third iteration,

and convergence to two place accuracy was again achieved by
the sixth iteration. The estimate appears in figure 2c.

The estimate no longer appears as a geometric lag, but rather

has a humped shape which resembles (except for the tail) the

shape which appears in 2a. The priors which produced 2c are
much weaker than those which produced 2b:         if      .28 then
  =         is   about .1; i.e. our priors assert that the ratio of
a pair of adjacent coefficients should probably not differ
from the ratio of the next pair of adjacent coefficient by

much more than 10%. In the estimate the largest (in absolute
value) element of V =        Rlog   is -.041. Apparently the likeli-
hood function does not carry much information on V          Rlogt3,

so that the estimates of V will come out close to the prior

mean. This means that even with very loose priors, the
estimated distributed lag will appear relatively smooth. The
smallest (in absolute value) elements of V were those which
                           — 26 —




correspond to the tail of the distribution, apparently because
the likelihood function carries very little information about

the ratios of such small coefficients.
    Figure 2c illustrates well some of the best properties of

the estimator with constrained sign. It should be remembered
that no constraints were placed on the lag of any kind and the
priors were uninformative on each coefficient considered

separately. The prior did not contain information that the
final coefficients were small. The asymptote which appears here
is the result of the interaction of the likelihood function
with the prior information that coefficients must not be

negative plus the information that no single coefficient should

be large in the neighborhood of other small coefficients. It
should not be concluded that an asymptote occurs only when the

unconstrained estimate is negative in the tail. Experience
with the estimator shows that asymptotes will also arise when
the final coefficients are positive. The estimator with con-

strained sign naturally forms asymptotes (especially when d
or higher) in cases where the final coefficients are small, and
thus makes the estimates much less sensitive to the error of

setting A, the lag length, too high.

VI.    Conclusion


      Both estimators:    with unconstrained sign and   with
constrained sign, should be useful in different applications.

The unconstrained sign estimator may be used in cases in
which there is no theoretical presumption that all distributed

lag coefficients should be positive. Since the unconstrained
sign estimator has more straightforward properties and does not

require an iterative procedure, it may also be the choice in
cases in which there is a presumption that all lag coefficients

be positive. It can also form asymptotes, although it depends
on the data more to make this happen. Information that all

coefficients should be positive can also be used in an informal

"Bayesian't approach by estimating the coefficients for several

different lag lengths and choosing a truncation point that
leaves all coefficients positive.
      In cases in which we know all coefficients are positive we

may also wish to consider whether the log normal smoothness

prior might not represent our prior information sufficiently
better to warrant the greater computational burden of the
constrained sign estimator. It is easier to specify the

parameters of the log smoothness prior since they are expressed
in percentage terms and are hence unit free. The estimator
is less sensitive to an overstatement of the lag length since

it easily forms asymptotes. Since the estimator essentially
                           — 28 —




embodies Learner's principle of proportionality, isolated large
coefficient estimates in the tail of the lag distribution are

effectively prevented. So little damage is caused by over-
estimating the lag length A that one might use for A one's

upper bound to the possible true lag length in the estimator.
Finally, the limiting behavior of the constrained sign estimator

as the tightness of the prior goes to zero is probably more

acceptable than is the case with the unconstrained sign estimator.
The limiting constraints with the log Smoothness prior are,
for d   1 the truncated geometric (Koyck) constraint, for d     2

a truncated normal density constraint, rather than polynomial

constraints as is the case with smoothness priors.

    complete, we can take the spherically normal prior on
    u R where R is a (X-d-l+h+t xA) matrix whose
    element is zero if j-i>d+l-h or if i>j+h and otherwise
    equals (-l)' (!.)        where h    1 if the head is
    constrained and is zero otherwise, t = 1 if the tail is
    constrained and is zero otherwise. These priors then
    include the zero "coefficients" beyond the lag and
    approach the Almon constraint as        Henceforth in this

    the endpoint priors in the smoothness priors case (footnote

    Wasserman, which took the form of a MACRO file on the
    TROLL system. The MACRO, which is entitled &SHILLER, is
    available to users of the TROLL system, but cannot be
    used separately from the system. The dependent variable
    is a version of the Federal Reserve Board new issue yield
    series, formed by splicing an older unpublished series to
    their published series which starts in 1960. The independent
    variable is the 4 to 6 month prime commercial paper note.
