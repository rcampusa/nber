                                               ABSTRACT

Stringent regulation for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions will impose different costs across geographical
regions. Low-carbon, environmentalist states, such as California, would bear less of the incidence
of such regulation than high-carbon Midwestern states. Such anticipated costs are likely to influence
Congressional voting patterns. This paper uses several geographical data sets to document that conservative,
poor areas have higher per-capita carbon emissions than liberal, richer areas. Representatives from
such areas are shown to have much lower probabilities of voting in favor of anti-carbon legislation.
 In the 111th Congress, the Energy and Commerce Committee consists of members who represent
high carbon districts. These geographical facts suggest that the Obama Administration and the Waxman
Committee will face distributional challenges in building a majority voting coalition in favor of internalizing
the carbon externality.

Introduction

        Faced with ongoing world population growth and per-capita income growth, the world’s

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could double over the next 50 years.1 Scientists are calling for

a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. “Very roughly, stabilization at 500 ppm requires

that emissions be held on average near the present level of seven billion tons of carbon per year

over the next 50 years, even though they are currently on course to more than double.”2 Since

carbon dioxide will increase for at least the next decade or longer, this means that future

emissions, e.g. by 2030 and thereafter, will have to be below current levels.


        The Obama Administration has announced its intention to pursue more stringent climate

change mitigation legislation than President George W. Bush’s Administration. The current

Administration has explicitly stated that GHGs represent a threat to public health.3                         To

significantly reduce GHG emissions will require more forceful steps than past actions such as

raising the CAFE standards for new vehicles, encouraging electric utilities to produce more

power using renewable sources, or encouraging the use of low carbon fuels. Direct control

policies often have unintended consequences (Holland, Hughes and Knittel 2009). To avoid

these, economists have advocated transparent anti-carbon incentives such as a carbon tax or a

comprehensive carbon dioxide cap and trade system.                   In fact, both market-based (carbon

pricing) solutions and non-price policies may be required to achieve the enormous changes

implied by the carbon stabilization goal. Since GHG mitigation is a global public good, a severe

free rider problem arises (Sunstein 2007) if these policies are not very widely or homogeneously

adopted. In mid-2009 the direction of carbon regulation is unclear and as this paper shows, will

certainly be constrained by the political reality that the incidence of regulatory costs arising from

carbon regulation is highly skewed.


           In this paper, we examine the geography of carbon emissions across the United States

and argue that several basic facts are relevant for understanding who will bear the incidence of

carbon regulation. Certain ‘high-cost’ geographical areas are likely to be hotbeds of political

opposition to climate change regulation. As defined by the basic theory of pressure groups,

groups that face both high potential costs of regulation and low transaction costs of organizing

will lobby their congressional representatives to block or mitigate such regulation even if this

regulation is globally efficiency-enhancing. Recent research on carbon regulation has focused

on which income groups will bear the costs of the regulation.4 This research uses computable

general equilibrium models to prospectively examine how alternative climate policies will affect

heterogeneous consumers’ welfare.


          We also pursue a complementary approach by examining the geographical distribution of

carbon emissions. Using a county-level dataset based on 2002 carbon emissions (the Purdue

University Vulcan data set), we study the variation in carbon emissions across the United States.

The variation is extreme: across the 1,559 counties with at least 25,000 residents in 2002, the

average carbon emissions per-capita is 7.66 tons, the median is 3.28 tons, and the standard

deviation is 16.9 tons.5 With such geographical variation, any meaningful carbon policy will

impose high costs on some and have a smaller impact on others.                                 Therefore, political

    A ton of carbon dioxide equals 0.367 of a ton of carbon; conversely a ton of carbon is 2.73 tons of carbon dioxide.
       Thus, the average emissions of 7.66 tons of carbon is equivalent to 20.87 tons of carbon dioxide.
compromises to build a coalition in support of climate legislation will likely reduce the economic

efficiency of whatever legislation emerges.


       To further explore the second-best constraints, we analyze the geographical distribution

of carbon emissions relative to the political leanings and demographic characteristics of the

voters in each area. We document that counties with high carbon emissions per-capita are more

likely to be poorer and represented by a conservative (based on voting records). Assuming that

counties with high carbon emissions will have the most trouble in substituting away from carbon,

these areas will more heavily bear the cost of carbon regulation. Conservative, poor, rural areas

will face a higher carbon bill under a cap and trade system than liberal, rich, urban areas. This

compounds the regressivity of any energy tax or cost increase, making it a political necessity that

some offset be designed.


       Based on data from the League of Conservation Voters (www.lcv.org), Democrats in

congress are much more likely to vote “pro-environment” on key pieces of legislation than are

Republicans. However, a lack of unity in the Democratic Party due to the geographical realities

of carbon emissions will affect the types of legislation that emerge from congressional house

committees. Based on the 110th Congress, fifteen Democrats in the House represented districts

with per-capita carbon emissions above the nation’s median, and had personal ideology scores

(based on voting data) above the median representative’s “conservativeness”.        Such “swing”

voters could determine what types of legislation pass in this new congress.


       We explore voting behavior from 2007 on anti-carbon legislation to demonstrate that the

constraints defined in this paper are economically significant. We show that representatives in

high carbon districts are more likely to vote against regulation, a behavior captured in the self-
interest hypothesis of Stigler (1971) and Peltzman (1975).                  Liberal representatives, whose

constituents have high per-capita incomes and whose district features low per-capita carbon

emissions, are the most likely to vote in favor of anti-carbon legislation.


        We anticipate that our analysis will motivate economists to consider the theory of the

second-best in helping design policies to tackle carbon emissions.6 Much debate exists on the

relative merits of a carbon tax or cap and trade regulation and the best method to inject revenues

derived from pricing carbon back into the economy.7 However, economists must also take into

account the constraints imposed by the existing carbon emitting infrastructure. This includes not

only existing electricity generation facilities (which produce about one-third of carbon

emissions) but also the transportation and industrial and urban/suburban infrastructures (which

account for the majority of non-generation facility emissions).




Geographical Carbon Data


        We use the 2002 Vulcan carbon emissions data set.8                Carbon is measured in tons per-

capita (not carbon dioxide). The data are based on production, not consumption.9 We begin our

empirical work by presenting a series of maps (see Figures One through Six) to highlight the

  An alternative approach for studying the geography of carbon dioxide emissions is presented in Glaeser and Kahn
    (2008). They estimate residential household production of carbon dioxide for a standardized household as a
    function of how much gasoline, electricity and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions from producing this
    power and home heating a household would consume in each of 63 major cities.
geography of per-capita carbon production.         The first map displays the total per-capita

geography. The coastal states, such as California, Oregon, and Washington stand out as low-

carbon areas largely due to their proximity to large Northwest hydroelectric facilities and natural

gas. In contrast, the Midwest and South have higher than average per-capita emissions largely

due to their coal intensive electric generation. In the next set of maps, we disaggregate the total

carbon emissions into five major sectors; electric utilities, commercial, mobile, residential, and

industrial. Commercial sector per-capita emissions are high in the Northeast and low in the

South, in stark contrast to the geographic distribution of total per-capita emissions (see Figure

Two). Industrial sector emissions are concentrated around Texas (see Figure Three), whereas the

highest emissions in the mobile sector occur around Tennessee (see Figure Four). Residential

emissions are focused in Northeast (see Figure Five), and low in much of the Southeast, whereas

utility-sector emissions are focused in the Rocky Mountain area and the Midwest (see Figure

Six). Clearly, the level and geographical distribution of the most important emissions sources

varies greatly by region. This suggests that piecemeal legislation dealing source-by-source could

yield economically less efficient results than comprehensive legislation, since distributional

issues can be aggregated and dealt with comprehensively. On the other hand, reaching national

agreement becomes more difficult given this heterogeneity, so regional solutions (like RGGI in

the Northeast) becomes more likely.


       To establish some facts about the geographic distribution of electric utility generated

GHG production, we use electric utility level data from the EPA’s 2006 EGRID database, which

contains data on more than 4,700 power plants from calendar year 2004.


         “eGRID, or Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database, contains
         emissions and resource mix data for virtually every power plant and company
         that generates electricity in the United States. Emissions data from EPA are
             carefully integrated with generation data from EIA to produce useful values
             like pounds per megawatt-hour (lbs/MWh) of emissions, which allows direct
             comparison of the environmental attributes of electricity generation.”10
           We use eGRID’s carbon emissions factor, measured in pounds of carbon dioxide per

megawatt/hour, for each plant. Given vast outliers in the data, we assign all plants to the 1st

percentile of the empirical distribution if the plant’s emissions factor is less than the 1st percentile

and we assign all plants to the 99th percentile of the emissions factor distribution if a plant’s

emissions factor exceeds the 99th percentile. For each state, we calculate its average carbon

dioxide emissions factor by constructing a weighted mean using the plant’s power generation as

the weight. We also calculate the breakdown of power production by fuel type for each state. At

the national level, the average commercial power plant emits 1,358 pounds of carbon dioxide per

megawatt hour. In 2004, 48 percent of electricity was generated by coal-fired power plants. As

shown in Table One, this average masks huge statistical variation. For example, California’s

average emissions factor is 697 pounds per megawatt hour while Indiana’s is 2,091 pounds per

megawatt hour. In the Midwest, a significant share of electricity is generated by coal power.

For example, in Ohio and Missouri, coal’s share is over 86 percent.


Consider one coal fired power plant in Missouri:


            “The cars arrive at places like Meramec, a 56-year-old, 850-megawatt power
            plant in south St. Louis County. The cost of building the sprawling plant has
            long since been paid off by its owner, AmerenUE, an investor-owned utility.
            Because Meramec generates electricity from cheap fuel, it produces cheap
            power. And because Meramec’s operational costs are low and most equipment-
            replacement costs have been recouped, AmerenUE often underbids competitors
            in selling excess electricity out of state. These profits give Missouri consumers
            an extra discount. From 1987 to 2007, AmerenUE and its predecessor, Union
            Electric, did not raise electric rates, while power production rose about 65
            percent.”11

           Our point is that certain parts of the country are (or should be) well aware that they have

benefited from cheap coal-based power. Residents of such areas, and shareholders of such

companies, have a strong financial incentive to oppose legislation (or lobby for free permits) that

will raise the price of consuming power generated from coal.12 A carbon permit price of $50 per

ton of carbon dioxide is predicted to raise the price of gasoline by 26 percent (assuming a price

level around $2.50 per gallon without the carbon price) and the price of residential natural gas by

25 percent and the price of utility coal by 384 percent (see Stavins 2008, Table 3). A carbon

dioxide price of around $50 is about what is needed for low/no carbon generation to become

viable, e.g. nuclear power plants or coal IGCCs with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). A

$50 price is forecasted to occur by 2030 under the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act

proposed in 2007.


County Carbon Regressions


           We now present some cross-county correlates of 2002 per-capita carbon emissions. In

our first set of regressions, we seek to parsimoniously describe what correlates with counties

having high carbon emissions. We use county level weighted regressions with per-capita carbon

emissions as the dependent variable and measures of political ideology and household income as




12
     We recognize that shareholders of companies that rely on coal will bear part of the incidence of higher fossil fuel
      prices bought about by carbon legislation. Given worldwide financial markets, there is no obvious connection
      between one’s location and one’s financial stake in different companies. In this paper, our focus is on the
      geography of the costs of carbon. We are implicitly assuming that the ownership of carbon intensive companies
      is uniformly distributed. If residents of low-carbon producing areas, such as California, owned large
      percentages of carbon intensive companies (such as by owning shares in St. Louis coal companies), then we
      might observe California’s representatives voting against carbon legislation. As we will show, we do not find
      evidence of this.
the independent variables.13 County income data is derived from the 2000 Census of Population

and Housing.


            Congressional representative political ideology is measured with Voteview which is a

broadly used dataset from political science literature. Keith Poole’s Voteview data provides us

with the roster of the House of Representatives in each congress. Our measure of representative

ideology is the first factor from “dwnominate”.14 Poole and Rosenthal estimate this factor from a

principal-components factor analysis of all congressional roll call votes (not simply

environmental votes).15 A more positive score indicates voting a conservative ideology. In the

political science literature, this is the most commonly used measure of legislator preference (see

Heckman and Snyder 1997).16


            Table Two reports the cross-sectional county regression results based on equation (1).


Carbon = β1 + β2*log(Income) + β3*Ideology + U                                                           (1)


            As shown in columns (1) and (2), conservative ideology is positively correlated with

county carbon emissions, and per-capita income is negatively correlated with carbon emissions.

Each of these results is statistically significant. In column (3), when both are included in the

regression, the ideology measure is no longer significant but income remains statistically

significant. In column (4), we re-estimate equation (1) but now use the log of county per-capita

carbon emissions as the dependent variable. We find a statistically significant income elasticity

of -0.6. The conservative ideology effect is positive and statistically significant. A one standard

deviation increase in a county’s representative’s conservative ideology is associated with a five

percent increase in county carbon emissions.


       Table Three disaggregates total county emissions by sector.          In each regression, the

dependent variable is the county’s per-capita level of emissions from a specific sector. Richer

urban counties have statistically significantly lower industrial, utility and transport emissions.

Incomes are higher in cities and in such relatively dense areas, people use public transit more and

this conserves on greenhouse gas production (Glaeser and Kahn 2008). The evidence

demonstrates that conservative, poor districts emit more carbon than liberal, rich districts on a

per-capita basis. We find no evidence of statistically significant interaction terms.       Looking

across the sectors, we see that transportation emissions are higher in more conservative areas.

Again, this may reflect the low use of public transit in such counties.


       Major liberal cities such as Portland, San Francisco, and Boston are not hotbeds of

manufacturing activity or coal-fired electric power generation. This is no accident. These cities

self-select (via Tiebout sorting) an educated population of amenity-seeking residents who vote in

favor of regulations to promote “greenness”. Of course, geography also plays a big role in this

carbon intensity as well. The Northeast is remote from coal fields and the Northwest is well

endowed with hydro resources. In 2009, these areas feature relatively low average carbon

factors in part due to regulation’s direct effects (such as California’s energy efficiency

standards), greater access to adaptation strategies such as a built up public transit network, and in

part due to regulation pushing energy-intensive manufacturing away. This suggests that liberal
cities will face a lower total carbon bill for complying with new climate legislation. Such areas

have already taken steps to “decarbonize,” and are naturally lower in carbon by geographic

advantage.


The Political Economy of Congressional Support for Carbon Mitigation


           We adopt a simple cost/benefit framework to analyze support for carbon mitigation

legislation. The political economy literature indicates that economic self interest, constituent

preferences and representative ideology influence voting patterns (Peltzman 1984, Pashigian

1985, Levitt 1996). On the benefits side, we assume that liberal representatives gain greater

benefits from voting against climate change legislation.                      They may personally favor such

regulation and will recognize that their constituents will also support such legislation.


           On the cost side, we focus on differences in per-capita carbon emissions across counties

and congressional districts. If a geographical area features higher per-capita carbon production,

then we assume that this area would face a higher cost from enacting carbon legislation. We

appreciate that economic incidence issues arise. These are beyond the scope of this paper.

Consumers of carbon intensive goods and owners of assets whose value is derived from fossil

fuels (i.e. shareholders of coal power plants) will bear part of the incidence of carbon

regulation.17        Tracking the geography of such final consumers and asset owners is very




17
     Carbon pricing in the energy sector in many locations can have a first-order effect in determining how legislation
       is enacted. Our data measures carbon emissions at the source of release but the incidence will be determined by
       substitution opportunities at the point of consumption. For instance, being a dirty plant when most plants in the
       relevant supply curve are dirty will mean that carbon costs will be directly passed to consumers because the
       whole supply curve shifts. In contrast, being a dirty plant when there are ample substitution opportunities
       means that plant’s relevant position in the supply curve will change and the plant workers and owners will bear
       the costs of carbon pricing.
difficult.18 Our per-capita state carbon emissions measure is highly correlated with state

endowments of coal. Based on 2007 data, the top five producers of coal measured in thousands

of short tons are: Wyoming (454), West Virginia (153), Kentucky (115), Pennsylvania (65) and

Montana (43). These five states account for 72 percent of total U.S coal production.19                          Each of

these states features much higher per-capita carbon emissions than the national average of 5.35

tons. Per-capita carbon emissions in these states in 2002 stand at: 34.8 in Wyoming, 16.82 in

West Virginia, 9.36 in Kentucky, 5.47 in Pennsylvania, and 9.25 tons in Montana. These facts

suggest that areas endowed with coal and fossil fuels use these resources in their own production

activities. Thus, our carbon measure in part reflects endowment effects.


           We also examine whether combating climate change is a normal good by testing whether

richer areas are more likely to support climate legislation. This simple model predicts that

geographical areas featuring conservative leaders of poor, rural areas that are carbon intensive

are the least likely to support climate change mitigation regulation.


           To test for the role of per-capita income, per-capita carbon and overall ideology in

explaining carbon mitigation voting patterns, we use recent voting data from the 110th Congress.

In the 110th Congress, representatives voted on various bills that had direct implications for

mitigating climate change. We rely on the 2007 League of Conservation Voter (“LCV”)

Scorecard to help us identify key carbon legislation.




18
     If asset holders in low carbon states, such as California, consistently hold a “carbon-heavy” stock portfolio, then
        this would represent an omitted variable in our congressional regressions we report below. In this case, we
        might observe California’s representatives voting against carbon mitigation legislation.
19
     http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/coal/page/acr/table6.html
           The first bill we look at is House Roll Call 555. In 2007, the League of Conservation

Voters included this as a key vote in their scorecard.


                      “Conservationists have long asserted that the pollution reductions
             necessary to curb global warming will require more than voluntary initiatives.
             For instance, H.R. 2643, the Interior-Environment appropriations bill, included a
             nonbinding Sense of the Congress resolution, sponsored by Representative Norm
             Dicks (D-WA), that endorses mandatory limits on global warming pollution.
             Representative Joe Barton (R-TX) offered a motion to strike the resolution from
             the bill. On June 26, 2007, the House rejected the motion by a 153-274 vote
             (House roll call vote 555). NO is the pro-environment vote. This marked the first
             time that the House had gone on record endorsing mandatory global warming
             pollution limits.”20
           We recode this variable to equal zero if a representative voted “yes” and to equal one if a

representative voted “NO”. Intuitively, a “one” will equal a pro-environment vote. The second

bill that we look at is House Roll Call 827. This bill is also singled out by the League of

Conservation Voters in its 2007 Scorecard.


                      “To be effective, an energy bill must reduce our dependence on fossil
             fuels, protect the environment, and take meaningful steps to solve global
             warming while creating jobs and saving money. H.R. 3221 met these criteria. It
             set new efficiency standards for appliances, lightings and buildings. It also took
             important steps toward restoring sound stewardship of public lands and helping
             America’s fish and wildlife, public lands, coasts, and oceans adapt to global
             warming. During consideration of H.R. 3221, a comprehensive energy bill,
             Representatives Tom Udall (D-NM), Todd Platts (R-PA) and Ciro Rodriguez
             (D-TX) introduced an amendment requiring utilities to produce at least 15
             percent of their electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020. This
             amendment would save consumers $16.4 billion on energy bills through 2030
             and create tens of thousands of new jobs. At the same time, it would slash global
             warming pollution by 180 million metric tons per year by 2030—equivalent to
             taking more than 29 million cars off the road. On August 4, 2007, the House
             approved the amendment by a 220-190 vote (House roll call vote 827). YES is
             the pro-environment vote.”21

           The final bill that we study is Roll Call 835, this was voted on in August 4th, 2007 (HR

2776). It is the vote on the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2007. It

amends the Internal Revenue Code provisions relating to renewable energy sources and energy

conservation.”22


           Figure Seven presents a map of Congressional support for anti-carbon legislation. For

each state, we calculate the share of votes cast in favor of these three bills. For large states such

as California, this ratio is more meaningful than for sparsely populated states such as North

Dakota. The map shows the coastal divide. The coastal pacific and the East Coast feature much

higher anti-carbon voting shares than the Midwest.


           We examine whether representative’s voting on each of these roll calls is a function of

the District’s per-capita carbon, per-capita income and the representative’s ideology.


Prob(Vote in Favor of Carbon Mitigation) = F(Income, Carbon Endowment, Ideology)                        (2)


Columns (1-3) of Table Four reports estimates based on stata’s dprobit command. The

dependent variable equals one if the representative voted the pro-environment position. The

explanatory variables include; the representative’s overall ideology, per capita carbon emissions,

and per capita income as the independent variables. The results in each of the regressions are

statistically significant and accord with our basic hypothesis: conservative representatives from

poor, carbon intensive districts are the least likely to vote in favor of environmentally “friendly”

energy legislation in the 110th Congress. Consider the regression results for Bill 827. A

doubling of a congressional district’s carbon emissions per-capita lowers the probability that a

representative votes in favor of this bill by 17 percentage points.23 Doubling this district’s per-

capita income increases the probability that a representative votes in favor this bill by 62

percentage points. Increasing the ideology measure by one standard deviation (more

conservative) reduces the probability that a representative votes in favor by 59 percentage

points.24


           In the fourth column of Table Four, we average the voting across the three bills and

estimate a linear probability model. The results are quite similar to the previous results. We use

the regression results from Table Four’s column (4) and predict the probability that a

representative votes in favor of energy legislation. In the data appendix, we report this ranking

sorted from “brownest” to “greenest”. This ordering shows the names of which representatives

are least and most likely to vote in favor of anti-carbon legislation as a function of their district’s

carbon emissions, district per-household income, and the overall ideology of the representative.

We recognize that the legislation the 111th Congress will vote on is unlikely to be identical to the

legislation that the 110th Congress voted on. This index is useful for sorting the representatives




23
     This marginal effect may not represent the causal effect of per-capita carbon production on congressional voting
       patterns. As we discussed earlier, we observe a positive correlation between state coal mining activity (a proxy
       for endowments) and state per-capita carbon emissions. This suggests that our carbon measure may be a proxy
       for a bundle of factors that all reflect self interest in stopping climate change mitigation legislation. To
       guarantee that the marginal effects reported in Table Four represent “causal effects”, we would need to be
       confident that district unobservables, such as the district residents’ stock holding in fossil fuel intensive
       industries and ownership of carbon intensive firms, is uncorrelated with the observables we include in the
       econometric models.
24
     We recognize that a sparsely populated county featuring a dirty power plant would count as having huge per-
      capita carbon emissions based on the approach used in the Vulcan data set. We have re-run the results in Table
      Four where we measure a county’s per-capita carbon production net of electric utility emissions. The results are
      quite similar to the ones reported in Table Four.
into those whose own ideology and district characteristics give them the highest predicted

probability of supporting legislation.


       In Table Five, we show that similar political economy patterns are observed in the U.S.

Senate. We estimate some simple regressions to provide some facts for U.S. senators based on

their voting in the 110th Congress. In Table Five’s column (1), the dependent variable is the log

of a state’s per-capita carbon emissions. We regress this on a senator’s conservative ideology

score and the log of the state’s household average income, a dummy variable indicating whether

the senator is a Democrat. Carbon emissions are higher in states with more conservative senators

and in poorer states. Interestingly, emissions are higher in Democrat states.


       We present senate voting results in columns (2) and (3) based on two key pieces of

climate legislation identified in the 2007 League of Conservation Voters Scorecard. On June 21st

2007, the senate voted 65 to 27 in favor of HR 6 (which we call “Bill 226”). Part of this

comprehensive energy legislation proposed to raise automobile fuel efficiency standards to 35

miles per gallon by 2020. On June 14th 2007, the Senate voted on Bill 211 (a “Yes” is the pro-

environment vote). Senator Jeff Bingaman introduced an amendment to establish a 15 percent

national renewable energy standard by the year 2020, to which Senator Pete Domenici countered

with an amendment that would have allowed conventional and polluting sources of energy to

qualify for credits under the national standard.       This amendment would have effectively

eliminated any increase in renewable energy production. The vote on Bill 211 was to table the

Domenici amendment (see the 2007 League of Conservation Voters Scorecard page eight). As

shown in columns (2) and (3) of Table Five, carbon intensive states and conservatives vote

against these bills. Perhaps surprisingly, state income is statistically insignificant, which stands

in contrast to the house results presented in Table Four.
Carbon Politics and the Composition of the 111th Congress


        The November 2008 election, led to marked changes in the House of Representatives, the

leadership, and the composition of key committees. The media has noted the transition that has

taken place in the Energy and Commerce Committee leadership. Michigan’s John Dingell has

been replaced by Henry Waxman. This transition has been predicted to increase the likelihood

that this committee will pursue meaningful carbon regulation.


        Committee composition shifts have implications for the legislation drafted in the Energy

and Environment Sub-Committee, within the Energy and Commerce Committee. In Table Six,

we present carbon and ideology averages for different subsets of the 111th Congress using the

Vulcan and Voteview data sets.      The subsets of the congress featuring high average carbon

levels and high conservative ideology scores are the least likely to vote in favor of carbon

legislation.


        The average Republican in congress represents a district whose carbon emissions are

seven percent higher than the average Democrat in congress. This differential grows for the key

committee members. The average Republican member of the Energy and Commerce Committee

represents a district whose carbon emissions are 21 percent higher than the average Democrat on

this committee. While the ideological average differences between Republicans and Democrats

do not vary much across these subsets, the carbon differential is largest in the important Energy

and Environment Sub-Committee.         The average Democrat on this committee represents a

district whose per-capita carbon emissions are 31 percent higher than the average Democrat in

Congress, and the average Republican on this sub-committee represents a district whose
emissions are 20 percent higher than the average Democrat on this committee. These numbers

tell a clear story that the Energy and Environment Sub-Committee consists of members of both

parties who represent carbon intensive districts. This poses a challenge to adopting legislation

that will provide meaningful reductions in carbon emissions.



Conclusion


       This paper has utilized several independent data sets to take a new look at the geography

of carbon emissions across the United States and the geography of voting patterns on recent

congressional legislation intended to address climate change. By combining data on county per-

capita carbon emissions, county demographic data, and congressional voting data, we have

uncovered several facts which will likely play an important role in constraining climate

legislation. Economists and policy makers will need to address these constraints if they want to

help design climate legislation that will have a meaningful effect on controlling carbon emissions

and be passed by members of congress.


       First, there are regions of the nation such as the Pacific West and the Northeast with

much lower per-capita carbon emissions than Midwestern states.       Constituents of these “low-

carbon” states will face lower direct costs from any anti-carbon legislation. Whether such

constituents would face high “general equilibrium” costs remains an open question and is

directly a function of what other costs will be imposed to allow for meaningful controls on

carbon emissions in the U.S. and abroad.    While we have focused on spatial differences in the

cost of achieving climate mitigation goals, climate change mitigation will offer differential

benefits depending on geography. A coastal liberal city such as San Francisco will gain greater

benefits from mitigating climate change and will face lower costs to comply with any new
carbon legislation. Representatives from such areas face a Coasian challenge to provide implicit

cross-subsidies to other regions where the costs of carbon control will be substantially higher.


           Second, per-capita carbon emissions are higher in poorer counties and hence are unlikely

to support climate legislation due to the costs that such legislation will impose on them. Based

on voting in the 110th Congress, we find evidence of congressional self interest. Representatives

whose districts are richer and less carbon intensive (based on production data) vote for climate

change mitigation legislation. This finding has direct implications for the need for a climate

policy that controls carbon emissions while addressing the distributional effects across space of

new carbon regulation.         However, one chilling effect is our robust finding of a large ideology

effect.     Holding district per-capita carbon and income constant, conservatives tend to vote

against climate change mitigation legislation.


           Finally, we have explored the composition of the key committee in the 111th Congress

that is charged with drafting climate legislation.        The imperative to design legislation that

recognizes the need to arrive at a second-best solution, where winners compensate losers, is

highlighted by the fact that the select members of these Committees are from districts with much

higher per-capita carbon emission than the average members of the House from the same

political party.


           The consequences of the existing carbon geography, voting preferences, and the

distribution of income would suggest that there are at least three potential policy outcomes:


      1)    Deadlock. This could create highly watered down legislation and environmentally
           ineffective policy. For instance, after the first year of experience with the European
           emissions trading system, there was an oversupply of permits and the price plummeted.25

25
     See for instance, Ellerman and Buchner (2007)
      2) Price offsets for carbon-intensive regions. This could yield a transfer of wealth with little
         change in behavior. For example, there could be free allowances to producers
         proportional to historic emissions. This could be counterproductive if there is no change
         in which plants are producing energy as it might just raise prices to consumers, thereby
         increasing producer surplus with little change in production (except through consumers
         using less energy).26
      3) Anti-regressive policies. In contrast to free distribution of allowances, this could involve
         rebates and/or other tax or income offsets used to protect low income consumers. It
         could also involve policies providing subsidies for out-of-the money but cleaner
         investment.
          Our work documents the geographical challenges faced by the Obama Administration in

getting climate legislation passed and provides an important set of constraints for economists to

consider. Since industrial, transportation, and utility emissions are not geographically correlated,

these sectors may offer a pathway to negotiating compromises. Economists who seek to mitigate

the carbon externality would gain from openly acknowledging the spatial distributional impacts

introduced by efficiency enhancing policies and recognizing that place-based politicians and

their constituents are sensitive to these effects.
