Four Facts Concerning Competition in U.S. Generic Prescription Drug Markets

NBER Working Paper No. 26194

JEL No. I10,L10,L65

                                          ABSTRACT

We establish four facts concerning competition among U.S. generic drug suppliers, using
IQVIA’s National Sales Perspective™ 2004Q4 – 2016Q3 data. We define a unique product
market (“molform”), consisting of the combination of a molecule active ingredient and a route of
administration formulation, aggregated over different dosages and strengths. We find: (i) supply
exhibits substantial churning in entrants and exits; (ii) volume-weighted use concentrates in older
generic molform cohorts; (iii) the extent of competition is greatest for the oldest molform cohorts
and is smallest for the youngest molform cohorts. With a median of one competitor, the extent of
competition in the youngest molform cohort is very limited; and (iv) supplier-molform annual
revenues are typically small, are largest for relatively young drugs, but are heavily right skewed.
These four facts provide an empirical platform on which to construct and empirically evaluate
hypotheses regarding generic drug market structure, performance, and possible policy reforms.

  I.     INTRODUCTION

       Off-patent ‘generic’ prescription drugs are a dominant

component of the United States’ medicinal armamentarium.      In

2017, 90 percent of retail and mail order prescriptions in the

United States (U.S.) were dispensed as generic drugs, and for

those molecules for which a generic was available, the generic

penetration rate was 97 percent (M. L. Aitken and Kleinrock

2018).    Vigorous demand for generic products is buttressed by

state laws and regulations requiring generic substitution when

available, with limited exceptions.

       The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires

manufacturers to obtain approval to market a drug.    On-patent

‘branded’ prescription drugs are marketed under the pioneer’s

FDA approved New Drug Application (NDA) that specifies its

chemical composition, safety and efficacy in treating disease,

and manufacturing procedures to comply with good manufacturing

practices.    Generic competition with a branded drug occurs after

the branded product has lost patent or market exclusivity.      FDA

approval of a generic manufacturer’s Abbreviated New Drug

Application (ANDA) requires its sponsor to establish

pharmaceutical and bioequivalence to the brand and compliance

with good manufacturing practices; establishing safety and

efficacy of the generic is not required.    Thus, once generics

are approved and certified by the FDA, competition among them,

                                  4
and between them and the brand, primarily involves price and

assured availability and only minimally entails quality.

     Observed differences between generic and brand pricing are

a function of several factors.   First, the development process

of generic drugs is generally less costly than for the brand.

Generic manufacturers also exploit technological developments

and cost efficiency improvements since the original product was

approved, enabling the generic manufacturer to attain lower

variable production costs.   Consequently, generics are

frequently considered to be a commodity-type product with low

marginal costs.

     Second, like all consumer products, the number of unique

competitors marketing a product affects its price.   A

substantial existing literature documents the marginal impact of

additional numbers of generic entrants on generic price in the

24 months following initial loss of exclusivity (LOE) in largely

orally formulated branded drugs (Berndt and Aitken 2011; Berndt

and Newhouse 2012).   Other research finds the extent of generic

entry in the 24 months after LOE is in large part determined by

pre-LOE sales volume (higher sales volume pre-LOE is associated

with more entry post-LOE) and by product formulation (less entry

among non-orally formulated drugs compared to oral

formulations)(Conti and Berndt 2014).



                                 5
     However, despite the very robust competitive entry and

price competition exhibited by commonly used drugs in the 24

months post-LOE, not all post-LOE pioneer drugs face competition

from generic competitors.   Post-LOE entry by generic competitors

may be frustrated or forestalled by the brand through various

“pay for delay” agreements, or by successful line extension

launches by the brand manufacturer (Drake, Starr, and McGuire

2015; McGuire et al. 2016; Drake and McGuire 2016).   Various

recent reports have raised questions regarding the adequacy of

supplier competition in mature generic drug markets years after

initial LOE.   Government investigations have focused on factors

associated with drug shortages involving largely old, injectible

generic drugs (Conti and Berndt 2014; Collins and McCaskill

2016) and relatively rare, but highly visible, high prices and

dramatic price increases (Collins and McCaskill 2016; Alpern,

Stauffer, and Kesselheim 2014) involving generic drugs facing

little if any market competition (Conti and Berndt 2014; Alpern,

Stauffer, and Kesselheim 2014; Silverman 2014).   Former

Commissioner Gottlieb has interpreted the role of the FDA to

include ensuring competition over generic drugs’ lifecycle (U.S.

Food and Drug Administration 2017).   The Trump Administration’s

Blueprint to Lower Drug Prices suggested additional efforts the

FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of

Justice (DOJ) might pursue to ensure and sustain robust generic

                                 6
drug competition over time (U.S. Department of Health and Human

Services 2018).

  Few studies have examined empirical levels and trends in the

extent of generic drug supply.     In this paper, we quantify

competition in U.S. generic product markets using national sales

prescription drug data.     We are particularly interested in

understanding the nature of mature competition among generic

drug products in the later years following initial LOE to assess

whether the intense competition observed immediately following

LOE is sustained over time.     Our goal is to provide an empirical

platform on which to construct and empirically evaluate causal

hypotheses and inform ongoing policy discussions (Dave et al.

2017). 1

  II.      EMPIRICAL APPROACH

     Using national prescription drug sales and supplier data,

we quantify and report statistics addressing the following

questions: (i) How extensive is supplier churning (entry and

exit) in branded and generic markets?; (ii) How old are the

generic drugs commonly used by American consumers?; (iii) How

many competitors does a typical generic product face and how

does this vary by vintage?; (iv) How large are annual

manufacturer revenues per generic product market, and how does




                                   7
this vary by vintage? And (v) How do these relationships change

over time and differ by generic product formulation?

     Using commercially available data from IQVIA (formerly IMS

Health and QuintilesIMS) National Sales Perspective™ (NSP)

database, 2004Q4 – 2016Q3, we examine the universe of

prescription drugs sold nationwide (Berndt, Conti, and Murphy

2017).   NSP data derive from a projected audit of purchases from

manufacturers or wholesalers to pharmacies, clinics, hospitals

and other distribution outlets, covering 100 percent of the

national unit volume in all major classes of trade and

distribution channels.    The data provides information on each

prescription drug by specific chemical and brand name,

formulation and name of the drug’s labeler (FDA’s terminology

for the holder of the drug’s NDA or ANDA) which we interpret

here as the name of a given drug’s manufacturer. 2   The branded

status of a drug is a variable assigned by NSP quarterly to

account for loss of patent exclusivity and generic entry over

time.    NSP includes ‘branded’ drugs - those on some patent or

other exclusivity and sold by only one manufacturer – and

‘generic’ or ‘biosimilar’ drugs – those with LOE and sold by one

or more manufacturers.    NSP distinguishes between ‘oral’,

‘injectible’ and ‘other’ product formulations.    ‘Other’ products

include drugs formulated as topicals and inhalants.



                                  8
     We define product markets at the molecule-formulation

level, “molform”.    This product market definition takes a

molecule (e.g., atorvastatin) and aggregates up over the various

strengths of its dosage forms (e.g., over 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg

strengths of an oral tablet).    Different forms of a molecule

(e.g., injectibles and oral tablets) constitute different

‘molforms’ and consequently different product markets.    This

definition implies that different manufacturers selling the same

molform are competing in the same product market.    It also

implies different manufacturers selling different molecules that

are used for the same or similar clinical purpose are not

competing in the same product market.    For example, the various

oral tablet dosage strengths of the statin drug rosuvastatin

(brand name Crestor™) used to treat LDL-cholesterol are in a

different product market than the various oral tablet dosage

strengths of the statin drug atorvastatin (brand name Lipitor™)

also used to treat LDL-cholesterol.

     Consequently, in our empirical framework, product markets

are assumed to exhibit significant within market cross-price

substitutability but limited between market cross-price

substitutability.    This definition generally conforms to product

market definitions adopted by the FTC in enforcing its

horizontal merger guidelines jointly developed with the DOJ

(Whinston 2007).    However, it is important to note that this

                                  9
economic price-substitutability defined market definition may

not conform to product market conceptions used in clinical

practice.   For example, the statin drugs rosuvastatin and

atorvastatin might be considered by some physicians as being

clinically substitutable, although our approach deems them to be

in separate product markets.

Additional details regarding variable definitions and analyses

     NSP defines a drug as being “generic” at the quarter-year

the branded molform loses patent or other exclusivity.     The data

vendor’s assignment of ‘generic’ to a molform does not imply

that the product faces intra-molform competition from another

manufacturer.   There are two types of manufacturers marketing

‘generic’ molforms in our sample: manufacturers marketing the

molform under the branded manufacturer’s FDA approved NDA and

ANDA.   NSP designates the former ‘branded’.    Branded drugs are

marketed either by the originator branded manufacturer or

through a license to another manufacturer (e.g., Pfizer holds

the NDA to market the molform EpipenTM and Pfizer has licensed to

Mylan the right to market EpipenTM.   Mylan is the sole

manufacturer of EpipenTM in our sample).   The latter are commonly

termed in the gray literature and in legal proceedings as

‘authorized generics’(Berndt et al. 2007).     NSP also designates a

branded drug with LOE and facing same-molecule generic

competition as a “branded generic” drug.   ‘Branded generics’

                                10
include molforms that are slight reformulations of the

originator product or combine the originator molecule with

another already generic molecule(s) under the originator’s NDA

(so-called supplemental NDA).   In our empirical framework, we

enumerate brands, branded generics and generics available post-

LOE in our manufacturer count of a given product market and

alternative estimates of within product market size.   Branded

generics and generics are both considered ‘generics’ in our

analysis.

     Our principal metrics for analyses are: (1) the number of

unique manufacturers of a molform in a quarter-year; (2) the

market size of a molform proxied by its quarterly and annual

number of standard units sales volume and its inflation-adjusted

sales revenues; and (3) two other product characteristics – the

quarter and year of its original U.S. launch date (we term this

drug ‘vintage’)(Lichtenberg 2009), and the product market’s

formulation which we interpret as a measure of its

manufacturer’s fixed and variable costs of production.

     As a measure of sales volume, NSP reports “standard units”

measuring the number of smallest dosage form single items (such

as vials, syringes, bottles of tablets/capsules) contained in a

unit or shipping package purchased by pharmacies or other

distribution outlets.   These units are ‘standardized’ to

approximate per prescription volume comparisons between orally

                                11
formulated and non-orally formulated drugs.     Although “standard

unit” is an inherently ambiguous metric, we are unaware of any

better or more commonly utilized metric of drug product volume

sold nation-wide (Berndt and Dubois 2016).

     The “dollar sales” reported by NSP is the total amounts

paid for purchases of a molform from a specific manufacturer by

quarter, converted into 2016Q1 U.S. dollars using the Gross

Domestic Implicit Price Deflator, indexed to 1.000 in 2016Q1

(“Federal Reserve Board Economic Data” 2018).     The invoice-based

dollar metrics reflect the amounts paid by retail pharmacies,

hospitals and clinics, whether purchased directly from a

manufacturer or indirectly via a wholesaler or chain warehouse.

Invoice line item discounts are included, but prompt-payment,

bottom-line invoice and 340B discounts are excluded (Dusetzina et

al. 2017; M. Aitken et al. 2016).   Drug rebates paid by the

manufacturer to an insurer or intermediary are not reflected in

these invoiced revenues and are generally not publicly

available.   To the extent sales from wholesalers include

wholesaler margins and exclude off-invoice rebates paid by

manufacturers to pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs), third

party payers, pharmacies and insurers, the NSP data overstate

net revenues received by manufacturers.

    NSP contains two variables denoting “manufacturers”, “Corp”

and “Mnf”.   “Corp” is the alphanumeric name of the corporation,

                                    12
including its subsidiaries, identified on the sponsor-owned-FDA-

approved label appearing in the Orange Book (the NDA or ANDA

applicant), while “Mnf” is the product’s manufacturer, such as

the “parent” corporation of a multi-corporation firm.    Here we

employ “Mnf” as the principal identity of generic drug supplier,

although we also undertake sensitivity analyses utilizing

“Corp”.    Our results are not materially different using “Corp”

rather than “Mnf”.

    For each generic molform quarterly observation, we count the

number of unique Mnfs having positive unit volumes during that

quarter.    We measure competition in each molform by the number

of distinct manufacturers having positive sales volumes in that

quarter.    The number of competitors includes the branded or

branded generic manufacturer for the molform when available.

     We consider an entry to occur in the first period in which

the Mnf makes a positive sale in the respective molform market,

following at least one quarter of zero sales.    Similarly, we

consider an exit to occur at the last quarter year in which the

Mnf makes a positive sale in the molform market, followed by one

or more quarters of zero sales.    When calculating quarterly

entry and exit rates in quarter t, we define the denominator as

the count of Mnfs in quarter t-1 aggregated over all molform-

Mnfs.



                                  13
     Market shares measured in standard unit volumes are

similarly defined by molform.    We aggregate standard unit

volumes for each molform-manufacturer pair and for each molform.

Molform-Mnf sales measured in standard unit volumes are then

expressed as a fraction of total molform sales at time t.

Shares are defined between 0 and 100 where the max value is 100.

     Product market vintage is also defined by molform.    This

definition presents some challenges as drug launches occur at a

molecule-dose-formulation level, yet we observe product markets

at the molform level.    Consequently, a product market may have

multiple launch dates.    To address this concern, we define the

vintage of a product market as the earliest reported U.S. launch

date for a given molform.    This launch date is a variable

reported by the data vendor, and corresponds to the year of the

molform’s launch into the U.S. market as a branded drug.      This

assignment rule worked well for the vast majority of product

markets, 81.5% of the sample, where for the same molform a

generic and a brand were observed in the dataset.    For the

remaining 18.5% of the sample, where no brand product was

observed in the dataset or where the brand had a launch date

that followed the generic, a manual search of the FDA’s Orange

Book revealed that in most cases these products were very old

drugs (approved in the 1950s or earlier) or combinations

involving very old drugs.    For these molforms absent further

                                 14
information, we faced the choice of identifying the product

molform launch date as the earliest of (i) the launch date of

the generic recorded in NSP (‘Option 1’), or (ii) the launch

date of the brand even if NSP indicated the launch date of the

brand occurred after that of the generic (‘Option 2’).    In

operationalizing these options, we found Option 1 always entails

a greater age than Option 2, with the size of the age difference

being small and stable.   We chose to use Option 2 for the main

analysis.   In sensitivity analyses, we used the Option 1

definition of product market vintage and reran all analyses.

There were no material differences in results.

     We identify five vintages among molform drug markets and

assign each molform to one of five vintage cohorts in each year:

< 15 years; 15-19 years; 20-24 years; 25-34 years; and 35+

years.   Thus, in 2004, the youngest cohorts contain products

launched before 2004 – relatively recent, newly generic products

- while the oldest set of cohorts in 2004 includes molforms

launched before 1969.

  III. RESULTS

Sample Descriptive Statistics

     517-652 manufacturers sold 1982-2655 unique branded and

generic molforms between 2004-2016 (Table 1).    The number of

unique manufacturers and the number of unique molforms increased

                                15
between 2004 and 2016.   In all years, about half of unique

molforms are oral (50%), the remainder are split between

injectible (22%) and ‘other’ formulated drugs (27%).

Approximately two thirds of our full sample of 4,289 molforms

(including non-unique molforms) are generics, the remainder are

brands.

                               INSERT TABLE 1

     The 2721 generic molforms in our sample can be further

disaggregated into: (i) markets with a branded product but no

branded generic (n=801); (ii) markets with a branded generic but

no branded product (n=334); and (iii) markets with no brand and

no branded generic (n=1586).    Thus, generic drug markets with no

branded competition are the most common generics in our sample

and generic markets with a branded generic but no brand, are the

least common in the sample.    Moreover, generic molform markets

with only a brand (n=1568 from Table 1) occur with about the

same frequency in our data as markets with no brand and no

branded generic (n=1586).   In total, the sample includes 334

molform markets with a branded generic, 2387 (801 + 1586)

generic markets with no branded generic, and 1568 branded

markets with no generic and no branded generic.

     Brands comprise a larger share of annual sales revenue

compared to generics in all years, but they decrease in


                                  16
importance over time from 83% of annual sales revenue in 2004 to

74% in 2016.   While orally formulated generics comprise the

largest category of generic sales revenue in all years, this

share declines from 67% in 2004 to 49% in 2016.   At the same

time, injectible and other formulated generic drugs become

increasingly important to annual sales revenue: injectible sales

revenue increase from 23% of total in 2004 to 38% in 2016 and

other sales revenue increases from 10% in 2004 to 13% in 2016.

The relatively rapid growing share of injectibles likely

reflects the increasing launch and use of small molecule

specialty drugs and biologics over our study period.

     Finally, the descriptive statistics of standard unit

volumes are opposite that of revenue shares.   While branded and

generic revenue shares average 76% and 24% between 2004 and

2016, branded standard unit volume shares average 23% and 77%,

respectively; both generic volume and generic revenue shares

increase over time, while those for brands decline.    In terms of

formulations of total standard unit volumes, oral molforms

steadily dominate at 78%, others constitute a stable 21%, and

injectibles account for only 1%.

     Figure 1 reports generic product market ages over our study

period.   We find that the average generic drug age rises over

our study time period from approximately 20 years in 2004 to 25


                                17
years in 2016.   Oral drugs match the overall trend, whereas non-

oral drugs do not: injectible drugs exhibit an average age of

approximately 18 years in 2004 and climb to 26 years in 2016.

Other drugs are younger than oral and injectible drugs

(approximately 15 years in 2004), appear to become slightly

younger by 2013 and then age slightly back to about 17 years by

2016.

                            INSERT FIGURE 1

     With these drug characteristics as background, we now

present four facts involving more disaggregated statistics on

the sample.

FACT 1: Branded and Generic Drug Products Exhibit Substantial

Churning (Entry and Exit)

     Manufacturer entry and exit in drug markets is robust,

particularly among generics.    Table 2 displays quarterly exit

and entry rates separately for branded and generic product

markets.   The numbers in the cells are percentages and each

percentage point corresponds to about 60-70 absolute quarterly

entrants or exits.   On average, entry rates are about 3 percent

for generics, 1 percent for brands, and for exit rates, about 2

percent for generics and 1 percent for brands.    Entry rates in

both branded and generic product markets are greater than exit

rates and increase over time, but recently entry rates have

fallen and exit rates have increased.

                                  18
                          INSERT TABLE 2

     Greater entry/exit upheaval and churning appears to occur

in generic compared to branded drug markets.   Specifically,

total quarterly churn (entry plus exit) rates are non-trivial

and exhibit relative stability at about 4 to 5 percent, but the

entry vs. exit composition differs between branded and generic

product markets: branded entry rates are slightly U-shaped over

time, while branded exit rates fall until about 2013 and then

increase thereafter.   In contrast, generic entry rates increase

from 2006 until 2013, and then decrease, while generic exit

rates generally increase until 2011, and are flat thereafter.

The total brand plus generic entry rate falls from about 6

percent in 2004 to under 4 percent in 2016, while the total

brand plus generic exit rate increases from about 3 percent in

2004 to 4 percent in 2011, and then falls to about 3.5 percent. 3

    Any observed entry breaks in Table 2 occur between 2011 and

2013, coinciding with the “patent cliff” in 2011-2012 as a large

number of “blockbuster” drugs lost patent and other

exclusivities, and implementation of Generic Drug User Fee

Amendment Acts (GDUFA-I) in 2013 (Berndt, Conti, and Murphy

2018).   While the difference between brand and generic entry

rates is much smaller in 2016 than earlier, the difference in




                                19
brand and generic exit rates is observed to increase

substantially beginning around 2011.

FACT 2: Generic Drugs Commonly Sold in the U.S. are Increasingly

Older Products

     In Figure 2, we report volume-weighted shares for each

molform in the five vintage cohorts.   In all years, the greatest

volume share is achieved by the two oldest cohorts of generic

drugs – molforms age 25 through 34 years and molforms aged 35

years and older.   In addition, volume shares of these oldest

products have increasingly dominated domestic generic markets.

Specifically, the sum of volume shares attained by the two

oldest vintage cohorts of generic drugs was about 52 percent in

2004 and almost 75 percent by 2016. Moreover, around 2009, the

volume shares of molforms aged 25 through 34 years appeared to

dramatically decrease in volume, while those aged 35 and older

increased in volume.

                          INSERT FIGURE 2

     The volume share of the youngest generic product markets is

not only the smallest of the five vintage cohorts, it appears to

be getting even smaller over time; in 2004 the volume share of

generic product markets under 15 years was about 9 percent, in

subsequent years it rose slightly to about 10 percent, and by

2016 it had fallen to less than 3 percent.   Volume shares

                                20
attained by the second youngest cohort of generic product

markets (15-19 years) did not fare much better, beginning at

about 14 percent in 2004, increasing to just over 18 percent in

2010, and then falling back to about 9 percent in 2016.   The

volume share of the middle aged generic product markets (ages

20-24) was generally stable after 2006, increasing slightly from

about 13 percent in 2006 to about 16 percent in 2016.

     In summary, newly genericized drug products have not been

that successful in penetrating U.S. generic markets.    This is in

rather marked contrast to the older cohorts of generic drug

whose U.S. volume shares have grown quite steadily over time.

     Finally, as seen in Appendix Figure A1 these vintage trends

in volume shares observed over all formulations are similar to

those occurring for orally formulated molforms.   In contrast,

the oldest cohorts among the injectible and especially the other

molforms do not increasingly dominate volume shares, but instead

it is the second oldest and middle age vintage cohorts among

these formulated generic drug products that increase in volume

share over time.   The youngest cohorts (< 15 years) fare the

poorest in garnering volume market share overall and across each

of the product formulations.




                                21
FACT 3:   Competition in Generic Molform Markets is Typically

Limited and is More Robust Among Older Compared to Younger

Product Markets

     We calculate the mean and interquartile range of number of

manufacturers by molform vintage cohort, and display these

calculated values in Table 3.

                          INSERT TABLE 3

     As measured by means (Table 3), competition among generic

manufacturers is most intense for the oldest cohorts of generic

drugs, and least intense for the youngest generic drug cohorts.

At about 7, the mean number of manufacturers for the oldest

drugs (35+ years) is larger than for any other vintage cohort,

and at about 2 manufacturers, it is smaller for the youngest (<

15 years) than for any other vintage cohort.   However, for the

oldest (35+ years), second oldest (25-34) and youngest (< 15

years) vintage cohorts the mean number of manufacturers is

falling over time, while for the younger but not youngest (15-19

years) and middle age (20-24 years) generic drugs the mean

number of manufacturers generally increases over time.   After

2012, the mean number of competitors in the 15-19 year and 20-24

year vintage cohorts is greater than that for the 25-34 year

cohort.   After 2013 the mean number of competitors for the 15-19

and 20-24 year cohorts reaches between 5 and 6, with at 6 the


                                22
20-24 year cohort facing almost as many competitors as the

oldest (35+ years) cohort.

     In each time period, median values for each vintage cohort

are generally smaller than their corresponding mean values.

However, we do observe some differences across vintage cohorts.

The median number of manufacturers in the oldest vintage cohort,

at between 4 and 6, is only slightly smaller than the

corresponding mean number of manufacturers which range from

above 6 to almost 8.   In contrast, for the youngest vintage

cohort (< 15 years), the median number of manufacturers is 1

throughout the 2004-2016 time period, while the mean number of

competitor manufacturers is relatively stable at about 2 – twice

the median value.   Hence the ratio of mean to median is largest

for the youngest vintage, and smallest for the oldest vintage,

with the other vintages having mean/median ratios in between.

     In summary, the extent of competition is greatest for the

oldest cohorts of drugs (35+ years) and is smallest for the

youngest cohort (< 15 years).   Indeed, with a median of but 1

competitor, for the youngest cohort the extent of competition is

very limited.

     To evaluate whether this characterization of competition

also holds for each molform formulation, in Appendix Table A1 we

report the annualized mean and interquartile range of


                                23
manufacturer counts in each vintage cohort separately by

formulation.

     For the most populous oral formulations, although time

trends are not monotonic, mean numbers of competitors are larger

in 2016 than in 2004 for the three intermediate vintages, but

for the youngest (< 15 years) and oldest (35+ years) vintages

the mean numbers are smaller in 2016 than in 2004.    Across all

vintages, the mean number of competitors is largest in the

oldest vintage and smallest in the youngest vintage.    In all

vintages, the median number of competitors is less than the

mean, with medians relatively stable in the < 15 year, 25-34

years, and 35+ year vintages, but increasing in the intermediate

15-19 year and 20-24 year vintages.

     For injectable formulations, again time trends are not

monotonic, means and medians are quite similar for all vintages,

with the ratio of mean to median evaluated at overall averages

being less than 2 for all vintages.

     For other formulations, only for the oldest cohort (35+

years) are time trends in mean and median number of

manufacturers monotonic, with the oldest generic drug vintage

cohort facing a smaller number of competitors over time.




                               24
FACT 4: Manufacturer Generic Drug Product Market Annual Revenues

are Typically Small, are Largest among Younger Generic Drugs,

but are Heavily Right Skewed

     Table 4 reports mean, median and interquartile range of

annual revenues per generic molform-Mnf (in thousands) overall

and by formulation.

     We observe that in early years, median annual sales

revenues are $500K-$600K, they rise steadily and by 2016 have

almost tripled to about $1.5 million in 2016.    In contrast, the

25th percentile annual sales are relatively stable from 2004

through 2013, ranging between $36K - $56K, but then increase

more sharply, doubling and reaching $110K in 2016.    The 75th

percentile annual sales are relatively stable between $4.0 -

$4.7 million through 2010, then increase more rapidly between

2011 and 2013 to about $5.4 - 6.8 million and then hold steady

at about $8 million thereafter.

                          INSERT TABLE 4

     More striking is that in every year mean revenues per

molform-Mnf are at least several times larger than even at the

75th percentile, indicating that sales revenues per molform-Mnf

are extremely right-skewed.    In the early years, annual mean

sales revenues were about 2.3 to 2.8 times larger than at the

75th percentile, and even as the 75th percentile level of sales



                                  25
increased sharply in 2011-2013, so too did the mean, which by

2016 was just over $15 million annually.

     Again in all three product formulations, sales revenues per

molecule-manufacturer are highly right-skewed, with the

difference between mean and median being the largest in the

other formulation.    In all years, injectible generic drug

product markets exhibit larger median, mean and 75Th percentile

annual sales revenue per manufacturer compared to oral and other

formulated drugs.    In summary, the aggregate trends in sales

revenue per molecule-manufacturer appear to be driven largely by

orals and injectibles.

     Table 5 reports these annual revenue statistics

disaggregated by product market vintage.

                              INSERT TABLE 5

     A striking finding is that while for all vintages except

the youngest, the ratio of mean annual revenues to median annual

revenues, evaluated at the average over all years, ranges

between 12 and 17, indicating substantial skewness.    However,

for the youngest cohort – those < 15 years – this mean/median

ratio reaches an astonishing value of about 30.    Thus, it is in

the youngest vintage of generic drugs where the dispersion in

annual revenues is relatively largest – a very few recent

vintage generic drugs are extremely successful, but most are


                                 26
not.    Indeed, as seen in Table 5, for the youngest vintage,

median annual revenues have fallen by over 50% between 2004 and

2016, from $875,000 to $371,000.      In contrast, for the oldest

vintage, between 2004 and 2016 median annual revenues have grown

four-fold – from $351,000 to $1.44 million.

       In terms of mean annual revenues, for the three oldest

vintages, there have been steady increases up through 2013-2014

followed either by stable or slightly declining trends.      Peak

annual mean revenues occurred earlier for the younger vintages –

in 2006 for the youngest (< 15 years) and in 2011 for the

younger (15-19 years) vintage.

       Hence, all generic drug vintage cohorts exhibit substantial

right skewness, and a small number of very successful generic

molforms make mean revenues look much more attractive than

median values.    However, it is the younger generic drug market

vintages that display the most enormous heterogeneity in annual

revenue streams.    In general but especially in recent years,

older generic vintage drugs have experienced greater revenue

growth than have the younger vintages.




                                 27
  IV.    DISCUSSION

     The four descriptive facts about U.S generic product

markets we report in this study raise several issues important

for further empirical evaluation and policy discussion.

    First, we report that considerable product churning (exit

and entry) occurs, with entry rates decreasing and exit rates

increasing in recent years.   This raises the question of what

role, if any, the Generic Drug User Fee program has had in

creating barriers to entry and incentives to exit.   Berndt,

Conti and Murphy (2018) examined the changing features embodied

in the GDUFA-I (2013) and GDUFA-II (2017) using recently

released public data from the FDA (Berndt, Conti, and Murphy

2018).   The analysis of that data yielded three findings: (i)

generic drugs and their base ingredients are increasingly and

overwhelmingly manufactured outside the U.S.; (ii) most ANDA

sponsors hold small portfolios of ANDAs with the median number

being one.   However, a small number of ANDA sponsors each holds

hundreds if not thousands of ANDAs.   In 2017, the largest 1

percent of ANDA portfolio holders accounted for 5,475 of the

7,966 (68.7 percent) claimed approved ANDAs; (iii) The fee

structure of GDUFA-I (set per drug and per establishment and

levied annually) likely erected barriers to entry, and created

scale and scope economies for incumbent manufacturers.    User


                                28
fees were changed under GDUFA II in part to mitigate these

incentives.   The authors hypothesized that the GDUFA I fee

schedule may have created incentives for existing generic

manufacturers to consider exiting drug markets, particularly

when annual product revenues did not outweigh the new fixed

costs imposed by GDUFA I annual fees.    The increase in exit

rates reported in this paper is consistent with the observed

recent decline in the number of net active manufacturing

facilities, based on manufacturer voluntarily-supplied data to

the FDA. Future research that examined these questions

empirically could shed light on the effects of regulatory

policies on U.S. generic product markets.

     Second, our finding that over the entire 2004-2016 time

period, the number of generic manufacturers per molform is

typically two or smaller across product vintages and

formulations suggests that mature U.S. generic drug markets

should be considered in steady state typically to involve only a

small number of generic competitors.    This analysis extends

preliminary research (Berndt, Conti, and Murphy 2017) in which

we reported that aggregated over all generic product vintage

cohorts, the distribution of the number of manufacturers was

right-skewed, with a small number of molforms having extremely

large number of competitors, resulting in the mean number of

competitors being considerably larger than the median.

                                29
     These findings contrast sharply with evidence presented by

previous studies suggesting generic competition is significant,

commonly involving four or more suppliers in the first 24 months

after loss of patent protection and other exclusivities (Berndt

and Aitken 2011; Berndt and Newhouse 2012).   The research

findings reported here are also generally consistent with

recently published research based on selected claims data

encompassing a more limited set of generic drug markets (Dave et

al. 2017).

     Over the last few years policy makers and the FDA have

raised concerns regarding the adequacy of competition among

selected generic drug markets.   These discussions have led to

the FDA implementing policies to encourage more competition

whenever the number of generic competitors is less than three

(U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2017).   Our findings suggest

increased FDA scrutiny over markets with limited competition may

be a larger task than commonly appreciated.

     Third, we find that the revenues received for a small

number of generic drug products by their manufacturers appears

to have been much larger than for most generic products.     The

occurrence of this phenomenon in the last decade suggests the

possibility that relatively high revenue generic drugs might

concentrate among those awarded 180-day exclusivity from


                                 30
successful patent challenges and thus face no or only an

“authorized” generic competitor.      Certain older products

enjoying high revenues might be those with no competitors,

slight reformulations of older pioneer products that confer some

advantages to consumers or prescribers, or those benefiting from

price increases during shortages due to temporary exits for

which demand still exists.

     From a regulator’s perspective, it could well prove

challenging to sustain or encourage competition in generic drug

markets where the underlying reason for limited suppliers is

very strong brand loyalty to the ‘improved’ line extension

product, or slack demand due to therapeutic obsolescence,

regardless of product vintage.   To contribute to a better

understanding of supply dynamics and their amenability to

potential policy intervention, it would be useful if future

research examined in detail revenue outliers (revenues in the

75th percentile or higher and in the 25th percentile or lower)

relative to the mean and median by vintage cohorts and their

characteristics.   Another potentially informative investigation

could involve a decomposition into various therapeutic classes,

such as oncology, respiratory, infectious disease, and

neurodegenerative illnesses (Berndt, Conti, and Murphy 2017).




                                 31
     Lastly, an intriguing issue raised here relates market

competition to drug price increases.     Previous research has

reported high and growing prices among selected generic drugs,

related to a limited number of manufacturers (Collins and

McCaskill 2016; Alpern, Stauffer, and Kesselheim 2014; Silverman

2014).    Given the limited and possibly declining generic

molecule competition we observe generally, why have prices for

generic drugs not risen more rapidly than has been observed?

     Two hypotheses come to mind.     First, the increased

consolidation in recent years from merger and acquisition

activity involving wholesaler purchasers, retail chains,

insurers and PBM firms may have increased demand side buying

power, putting downward pressure on generic manufacturers’

prices.    By exercising this increased monopsonistic buying power

and combining it with PBMs’ powerful utilization management

tools, purchasers may increasingly be able to play generic

manufacturers off against each other, intensifying generic price

competition.

     Second, it may be that many generic molecule markets are

contestable, whereby firms hold an option to enter or re-enter.

In contestable markets, the threat of entry disciplines

incumbent firms, resulting in pricing outcomes that resemble

highly competitive, multi-manufacturer markets, even when the

number of actual competitors is small. 4 Once a generic

                                 32
manufacturer receives an approved ANDA, it can retain it

indefinitely even if it temporarily discontinues producing the

product.    The threat of reentry by temporary exiting firms might

facilitate contestability.    This possibility and the role of the

Generic Drug User Fee legislation in 2013 and 2017 in affecting

temporary or permanent exit merit more research.

       In summary, U.S. generic molecule markets typically

experience substantial entry and exit “churn” rates, generating

surprisingly modest annual revenues (although in recent years a

small number of molform markets have earned substantial revenue

streams).    The median number of generic manufacturers in molform

markets is between 2 and 3 indicating that U.S. generic molecule

markets are highly concentrated and that manufacturers typically

face very limited competition.    Although much recent attention

has been placed on generic entry and use patterns among newer

generic drugs, the most commonly used generic drug products are

older drugs, many of which launched in the 1990s ‘blockbuster’

era.    The research findings reported here suggest that dynamic

patterns of entry, exit, and revenues achieved by generic

prescription drugs in U.S. markets are complex, vary by vintage,

and are worthy of further scrutiny.

1
 These authors use MarketScan™ retrospective claims data to
examine prices and market competition for drugs classified as
either single or multi-source between 2008-2013, excluding entry
and exit of new brands, and entry of generics following the
brand’s loss of exclusivity between 2008-2013. The data contain
retail and mail order pharmacy claims, but likely understate
sales through long term care, hospital, and federal facility
channels.

 The FDA’s Orange Book identifies the ANDA applicant, noting the
actual manufacturer may differ from the ANDA applicant (also
called labeler) due to manufacturing outsourcing to contract
manufacturers. The ANDA applicant may differ from the marketer,
due to licensing actions. Our use of the term “supplier” should
therefore be interpreted as the entity selling and marketing a
molecule dosage form.
3
 Based on manufacturer-supplied data reported to the FDA, Berndt
ER, Conti RM, Murphy SJ, 2018, op. cit., find that the number of
net active pharmaceutical ingredient and final dosage form
manufacturing facilities has declined between 2013 and 2017.
