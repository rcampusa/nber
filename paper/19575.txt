This paper addresses the interactions between globalization, the quality of democracy, and economic
convergence using simultaneous estimation techniques. To reflect process, we use multi-dimensional,
de facto, and continuous measures of democracy and globalization. To reflect context, as defined by
space (geography) and time (history), we control for the distance to the income frontier. Using this
measure of development, we extend the test for the two-way relationship between democracy and
globalization put forward by Eichengreen and Leblang (2008) for the period 1870-2000. Focusing
on the more recent wave of globalization (1970-2005), we find a two-way relationship between democracy
and globalization and also significant two-way relationships with development. In the restricted sample
of non-OECD countries, however, democracy hurts development.

1. Introduction

How do globalization, democracy and development interact with each other? In answering
this question, we bear in mind that the interaction between globalization and governance is
always context-specific, as defined by space (geography) and time (history). Moreover, we
take into account that policy and institutional responses must necessarily change as the nature
of globalization itself changes. More specifically, we believe that the complex interaction
between globalization & democracy is best understood by having a closer look at all of its
constituent elements, possibly on a case by case basis. In this respect, the measures of
democracy commonly used in empirical research suffer from the rudimentary manner in
which democracy is conceptualized and measured, e.g. a regime characterized exclusively by
electoral competition and political participation.

To account for the democratic process, which is likely to depend on slow moving cultural
factors, we average two measures of the quality of democracy: political rights and civil
liberties, which are de facto and continuous measures of democracy as opposed to the de jure
and dichotomous ones typically employed. Similarly, we use the KOF index (Dreher, 2006;
Dreher et al., 2008) in order to account for different degrees and types of globalization, as it
offers a continuous and multi-dimensional measure of the process. Finally, in order to take
into account the economic context, as well as possible feedbacks from democracy and
globalization to development, we include an equation determining the distance to US GDP
per capita.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical analysis on the simultaneous
interactions between globalization, democracy and development. Indeed, the empirical
literature has typically focused on the links between pairwise combinations of these three
variables. We confirm the two-way interaction between democracy and globalization found in
Eichengreen and Leblang (2008) for a much longer time period (1870-2000). Besides, we
show strong two-way relationships between globalization and development, as well as
between democracy and development. However, over the period 1970-2005, the results seem
to be more sensitive to the economic context, as some estimates vary between OECD and
non-OECD countries. Overall, our results suggest a self-reinforcing process, in particular
when the sample is reduced to the OECD group.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a framework for the
links between Globalization, Governance and Economic performance. Section 3 discusses the
data and the issue of identification. Section 4 presents a simultaneous system estimation of the
reciprocal effects of each of our three variables on the other two while sensitivity and
robustness checks are found in Section 5 and in the Appendix. Section 6 goes back to the
evidence, providing examples of the effects of history and geography. Section 7 summarises
the results and concludes.

2. Globalization, Governance & Economic Performance: An Interpretative Framework

In earlier work, Macedo (2001) found that trade openness reduced perceived corruption and
claimed that this was the way in which globalization improved governance.1 The result held
1
 Related work, subsequently published as Bonaglia et al. (2011), considers the hypothesis that “there is an effect
of globalization on governance”, by looking at how openness affects the quality of domestic institutions.
Specifically, this study surveys available theoretical explanations of causal relationships between globalization


                                                        2
for OECD and non-OECD countries, even after correcting for the endogeneity of perceived
corruption.2 Similarly, Eichengreen and Leblang (2008) showed a long-term positive two-way
relationship between globalization and democracy. However, the dichotomous nature of the
democracy variable limits the interpretation of their results. Using the same method with a
more detailed (and continuous) democracy index, we confirmed this estimation, although with
a weaker link running from globalization to democracy3.

Indeed, as Lopez-Cordova and Meissner (2005) pointed out, the existing literature on the
topic has suffered from econometric problems that may explain the difficulty of reaching a
consensus. Endogeneity, as well as the difficulties of finding valid instruments challenge a
number of previous results. The same problem applies to the analyses of the interactions
between economic growth and democracy or globalization, although the different estimations
of positive relationships seem to be more consistently found. Here, we use a simultaneous
equation estimation method of the relationships among democracy, globalization and income
convergence, using a sample of 89 countries over the period 1970-2005. Indeed, under the
assumption that these three variables interact with each other, treating them separately might
induce endogeneity and/or omitted variable biases. Furthermore, our method may offer an
insight into the dynamics of globalization and so provide interesting economic-policy lessons
of relevance to developing countries.

The mutual relationship between globalization, governance and economic performance can be
described as follows. A nation’s resource endowments and its productivity determine how fast
it can grow and the level of its economic well-being in terms of income per capita, both in
absolute terms and relative to the income frontier. Feedbacks are possible: a richer country
growing fast may invest more resources in scientific research and technology development
and thus enjoy higher productivity levels than a poorer, slow-growing economy. Through
trade, capital flows or migration, globalization can influence the level of endowments
available in an economy, or even, through international technology transfers, its productivity.
Conversely a country’s endowments of natural resources, labor, and capital, as well as its
geographic location and efficiency of its production structures may determine how much it
trades with the rest of the world in terms of goods, services and assets.

Similarly, a country with good governance, namely a democratic state with high-quality
institutions, effective corruption-free accountable bureaucracies, and a flourishing civil
society may likely increase the quality, if not the quantity, of its most important endowment:
its own people. Once more, cause and effect can be swapped: well-endowed countries may
evolve towards democratic forms of government more easily, or, at least, they may be able to
afford investment in more resources to build well-functioning institutions. These interactions

and governance. Trade policy, competition by foreign producers and international investors, and openness-
related differences in institution building costs are three major transmission mechanisms through which
openness affects a country’s corruption levels. Examining a large sample of countries covering a 20-year long
period, robust empirical support is found for the fact that increases in import openness do indeed cause
reductions in corruption, a crucial aspect of governance. The magnitude of the effect is also quite strong. After
controlling for many cross-country differences, openness’ influence on corruption is quite close to that exercised
by the level of development.
2
  Using three averages corresponding to the periods 1984-89, 1990-94, and 1995-98 of the ICRG index of
perceived corruption (available yearly for 119 countries), the most parsimonious specification reported in
Macedo (2001, p. 243) includes only import openness, per capita GDP (both in logs) and an index of political
rights and this explains almost 50 per cent of the variability in the corruption index. A 10% increase in imports
openness results in 0.03-point change in the corruption score (0.34 x 0.1). This is a sizeable effect, especially
when compared to the 0.09-point changes due to a 10% increase in log income per capita.

have been at the core of economics, and if not constantly, have always attracted economists’
interest. However, how globalization and governance interact to affect economic performance
have not become topical questions until recently.

3. Data and identification

3.1. Democracy

As mentioned, the measures of democracy commonly used in empirical research of the G&D
nexus suffer from one notable limitation, namely the rudimentary manner in which
democracy is conceptualized and measured, e.g. a regime characterized exclusively by
electoral competition and political participation (see Przeworski et al., 2000).

Garoupa and Tavares (2009) show that higher income increases the survivability of
democracy and a history of democratic instability, as well as the international political
context, helps predict how regime transitions impact on democracy. However, they do not
pursue the definition of democracy per se while Eichengreen and Leblang (2008) use a
definition that is essentially de jure in nature, labelling a country as democratic if its
governments are designated through competitive elections - elections in which more than one
party competes and the winning party is not always the same.

The extension of suffrage, for example, would not appear in this dichotomous variable. Yet a
negative interaction between democracy and debt default has been found for the period of the
classical gold standard. Specifically, Flandreau and Zummer (2004, p. 44) find that the
extension of suffrage reduces the default probability with an elasticity of 0.5 for the whole
sample and of 1.3 for capital-poor countries. They note that contemporaries saw democracy
and parliaments as a source of greater stability because they put checks and controls on the
sovereign and imply a greater implied ability to tax. This contradicts the widespread view that
the repression of democracy facilitated the operation of the pre-1914 international monetary
system by making external adjustment easier.

Some of these points also apply to the related literature attempting to find the nexus between
democracy and growth. For example, Tavares and Wacziarg (2001) define democracy in
purely procedural terms.4 As a result of this tendency to measure democracy in a purely
political and formal manner, quantitative studies may misrepresent the effect of democracy on
globalization or misinterpret the aspect of democracy responsible for that effect. The concept
of democratic capital proposed by Persson and Tabellini (2006), where own history of
democracy and that of democratic capital accumulation among neighbouring countries help to
determine the rate of economic growth, is another way of introducing quality considerations.5


4
  Wanting to clearly distinguish democracy from other characteristics of political systems, they use the Freedom
House indicator of political rights, based precisely on this procedural definition of democracy. They add that all
previous studies focus on the direct effect of democracy on growth, conditional on other growth-determining
factors and they question this procedure: “In theory, if a comprehensive institution such as democracy matters, it
should matter indirectly through its effect on variables that in turn determine economic growth. Existing
theoretical arguments point to links between democracy and a number of societal characteristics that influence
growth. However, none of those arguments suggest that democracy has a direct impact on growth”.
5
  See Persson and Tabellini (2005, 2007). Eichengreen and Leblang (2008) use the age of democracy variable
with good results , while Giuliano and Nunn (2013) show the transmission of democracy from the village to the
Nation-state using Ancestral Characteristics Database to calculate a variable local democracy, which is a
significant determinant of democracy at the country level.


                                                        4
Along these lines, our approach is that political rights and civil liberties are essential
ingredients of democracy. To enhance the quality of the democracy measure, we decompose
it into those two main components6. First, the key elements of civil liberties (CL) include
freedom of thought, religion, association, free press and respect for the rights of minorities.
We derived these elements from the Freedom House Civil Liberties index, which is computed
for almost all countries and “related and disputed territories” for the period 1972 onwards.

Second, political rights (PR) are associated with free and fair elections for the executive and
legislative branches of power, freedom to constitute political parties, freedom of association,
independence from political, religious and military authorities, real possibilities of the change
of power and other related aspects of the political system. All of these and other features of
political rights are taken into account by the Political Rights Index, which is published by
Freedom House and covers the same period as that of the CL index.

Economic liberties are excluded from the simple average of CL and PR, which is published
by Freedom House as the Freedom index. Indeed, the multi-dimensional nature of the
globalization index features some of these economic liberties. Thus, the results would be
biased, displaying an automatic correlation between the two due to their common
components. This problem, however, does not seem to concern the political rights and civil
liberties indices.

In sum, we posit democracy to be a multidimensional reality and stress the importance of its
de facto nature. This entails a trade-off, as refining the measure of democracy implies a
smaller sample period (1970-2005) when compared to that of Eichengreen and Leblang
(2008), which covers the period 1870-2000. Although this might make the results more
sensitive to sample bias (because the number of countries is much bigger than the number of
years), the loss is not as large as might appear because of the missing values problem in the
data7.

3.2. Globalization

To account for globalization, we use the KOF index (Dreher, 2006; Dreher et al., 2008). Its
main advantage is that it presents a multi-dimensional and continuous measure of the
globalization process for 123 countries over the period 1970-2005. It includes three types of
globalization. First, economic globalization is decomposed into actual flows (trade, foreign
direct investments, and portfolio investments) and restrictions on trade and capital (hidden
import barriers, mean tariff rare, taxes on international trade, and capital account restrictions).
Second, political globalization is measured by the number of embassies, membership of
international organizations, and participation in UN Security Council missions. Third, social
globalization is decomposed into personal contact (tourism, foreign population, transfers),
information flows (internet users, telephone mainlines, daily newspapers), and cultural
proximity.

The value ranges from zero to ten, a higher score corresponding to a more “globalized”
country. The KOF index is probably closer to reality than measures focusing on only one
dimension (or aspects of it), namely the economic dimension. As far as we are aware, such a

6
 The results from the 2007 and 2010 drafts are available from the authors upon request; see also Macedo (2013).
7
  The Eichengreen and Leblang sample covers 135 years for 202 countries (taking into account name and border
changes) but no regression includes more than one third of the maximum number of observations (about 27K).
In this regard, using our measures of democracy cuts the sample size by half rather than by two thirds.


                                                      5
multi-dimensional and continuous index of globalization has not been used before in other
studies linking it with democracy variables. Box-plots for globalization, democracy and
development show, as expected, that the level of globalization, democracy and development
are much higher and have lower dispersion in OECD countries than in non-OECD countries8.

3.3. Stationarity

   In order to deal with the issue of a possible panel co-integration, stationarity tests have
been carried out for the three endogenous variables (democracy, globalization and income
gap). We implement three different types of panel unit root tests: two first generation tests,
namely the Imbs et al. (2003) test (IPS); the Maddala and Wu (1999) test (MW) and one
second generation test – the Pesaran (2007) CIPS test. The latter is associated with the fact
that previous tests do not account for cross-sectional dependence of the contemporaneous
error terms and failure to consider it may cause substantial size distortions in panel unit root
tests (Pesaran, 2007). Tables A.1 and A.2 in the Appendix report the results of the panel
stationarity tests (summary statistics for the globalization, democracy, and convergence
variables for different samples are also presented). In all tests the null hypothesis is that of
non-stationarity of the variable. It appears that only the KOF index suffers from non-
stationarity, which implies that co-integration is not a problem here.

3.4. Identification

The issue of endogeneity of the regressors is usually dealt with in the literature by using
instrumental variables (IV). Yu (2005), for example, uses measures of justice independence
and the use of death penalty to account for democracy. Milner and Kubota (2005) use a
secondary schooling measure and the political-party system’s age to instrument for
democracy, and economic crises, pressures by international organizations and a measure of
economic ideas to instrument globalization. However, these analyses make no mention of an
over-identification test, which is the main problem in our case. Lopez-Cordova and Meissner
(2005) use gravity/geographic information to instrument globalization but, facing an over-
identification problem, simply gather these variables into a single instrument (without being
able to control for its validity).

Consequently, we try the different instruments suggested by the literature. However, taken
individually, very few prove to satisfy the independence requirement. This problem becomes
even clearer when using combinations of instruments, as almost none satisfies the over-
identification test. Apart from the widespread difficulty in finding instruments for democracy
and globalization in the literature, one could mention two reasons specific to our analysis.
First of all, the multi-dimensional aspect of the KOF index of globalization makes it even
harder to find a variable that is not correlated to this index. Secondly, the same goes for
convergence and economic growth (many instruments can be thought to impact growth
independently of their effects on globalization or democracy).

Keeping in mind these difficulties, fuel export dependence and colonial origin (in each case
represented by dummy variables, which are not, when used on their own, ideal instruments)
are used to instrument democracy. The investment rate is used to instrument economic
convergence. Finally, inflation and the logarithm of the distance to the rest of the world are
alternatively used to instrument globalization. Nonetheless, several of these specifications

8
    These are available from the authors upon request.


                                                         6
suffer from weak identification. Moreover, it is worth noting that for two equations, namely
explaining globalization with the income gap, and explaining the income gap with democracy,
no valid instrument was found.

In the Appendix, Tables A.3 and A.4 we provide a comparison of the different estimation
methods in order to assess the robustness of our estimation method, using a two-step
Difference GMM approach a la Arellano and Bond (1991) and a System GMM approach a la
Arellano and Bover (1995). These estimators deal effectively with the endogeneity problem
by using a set of instruments for the endogenous variables. The former uses lagged levels as
instruments for the equation in differences; in addition to that, the latter uses lagged
differences as instruments for the additional equations in levels. Democracy seems to have a
positive effect on globalization; convergence displays a positive role on democracy, and
globalization a positive impact on both democracy and convergence. However, the difficulties
encountered when trying to find valid instruments suggests that these results should be treated
with great caution. This leads us to use a simultaneous equations approach as our baseline
specification.

4. A System Equation approach

In this section, we use a system equation approach to study the reciprocal effects of
globalization, democracy and development by taking the problem of bi-directional causality
into consideration. Our estimation method accounts for the problem of endogeneity as it
estimates the relationships simultaneously by applying the standard Three-Stage Least Square
method (3SLS).9 The 3SLS method uses all the information provided by the exogenous right-
hand-side (RHS) variables to instrument the endogenous (LHS) left-hand-side variables. As
such, it avoids the potential pitfall of having to find “good” instruments within a single
equation context.10 Moreover, when different interdependence equations are specified, it
seems more natural to make use of a simultaneous equation approach.

In order to provide consistent estimates, the 3SLS method requires a set of exogenous
variables specific to each endogenous variable for each equation. Therefore, we include the
number of currency crises in the year in the globalization equation, and the investment rate in
the development equation. We also include dummy variables standing for legal and colonial
origins, as well as for fuel export dependence, the number of democracies in the world,
population density, and a measure of urban population in the democracy equation. Other
control variables, common to at least two equations, are also used. These are gravity controls
(distance, area, and population), inflation and regional dummies. We recognize that the 3SLS
method may be more sensitive to the existence of spurious correlations or multi-collinearity
among the regressors in one equation, thereby "contaminating" the remaining equations. In
our sample, this does not seem to be an issue.

Accordingly, we define the following simultaneous system (1) of three equations:



9
   At the first stage, endogenous variables are instrumented by all exogenous variables in the system; at the
second stage an efficient estimate for the covariance matrix of the disturbances is obtained; and at the final stage
a GLS-type estimation uses this covariance matrix in a regression of the dependent variables on the instrumented
values of endogenous variables and on the exogenous variables, with some identification restrictions.
10
    To deal with the potential endogeneity problem, Eichengreen and Leblang (2008) adopted a GMM-
Instrumental variable approach where each relationship is estimated individually.

where, for each country, Globalization stands for the KOF index of globalization. Democracy
is the Freedom House index variable averaging political rights (PR) and civil liberties (CL).
Development represents the ratio of a given country’s GDP per capita over that of the United
States while {Zi} denotes a set of appropriate control variables for each equation.11

Tables 1, 2 and 3 display, respectively, the estimations for all the countries pooled together,
for the OECD countries, and for the non-OECD countries. For the whole sample, we observe
strong positive two-way effects between democracy and globalization on the one hand, and
between globalization and development on the other hand. This is a strong result for the
analysis of our topic. Furthermore, democracy impacts positively on development. The
feedback effect from the income gap to democracy is positive and statistically significant.

As for the remaining regressors, we observe that fuel export dependence negatively affects the
level of democracy. This may be related to a Dutch Disease and Natural Resource curse story
as such natural resources are predominantly located in developing countries whose quality of
institutions is to some extent low and corrupt and rent seeking behaviours can easily emerge.
Inflation seems to negatively impact development and this can be justified on the ground of
the literature on seignoriage consequences and the “invisible tax” that erodes wealth. In line
with the growth literature, investment and size matter for development as attested by the
positive and statistically significant coefficient on investment rate and area, whereas
population has the reverse effect.




11
   We followed Eichengreen and Leblang (2008) benchmark’s identification strategy very closely. Similarly to
their study, we used a set of control variables for globalization and democracy: the equation for globalization
includes size variables, (as larger countries tend to be less open to trade), a distance variable, regional dummies
for Latin America, Middle-East, Africa and Asia, a variable equal to the number of currency crisis, and the rate
of inflation; the equation for democracy includes regional dummies, a dummy for fuel exporters and a number of
institutional controls: the number of prior transitions to dictatorship, the constitutional age, the number of other
democracies in the global system, dummies for the socialist legal system, colonial heritage (British, French and
Spanish), the percentage of the population living in urban areas and the population density.

Overall, there seems to be a ‘contagion effect’ of the extension democracy, captured by the
(lagged) number of democratic countries, as it affects positively the level of civil and political
rights. This effect only derives from the non-OECD part of the sample (Table 3).
Interestingly, population density affects negatively democracy, but urbanisation acts as a
counteracting force for developing countries.

Other controls reflect the impact of history and geography. On historical and cultural aspects,
the socialist legal origin affects negatively democracy, but within the OECD group the effect
is positive, suggesting that former socialists when provided with a strong policy anchor (for
example, the process of EU accession) can overcome past legacies. In contrast, the English
colony dummy is uniformly positive in all samples. The Spanish colony dummy is also
positive for developing countries, while the French colony dummy is never significant.

The geography dummies (Latin America, Middle East, Africa and Asia) tend to show a
negative effect of on globalization and democracy for the sample of non-OECD countries.
Distant countries tend to be less globalized, but this geographic factor does not seem to hinder
convergence forces within the OECD group. Also, large developing countries tend to be less
globalized, but they have higher convergence to the income frontier.

Tables 1a, 2a and 3a provide the calculated cross-elasticities for globalization, democracy and
development - derived from the estimates for a country presenting mean values of these three
variables. In the full sample (Table 1a), the largest effect is the impact of globalization on
development (+1.33). As an illustration, an increase in the globalization index from the non-
OECD mean (around 37, cf. Appendix) to the OECD mean (around 68, or a factor of 1.83)
would narrow the distance to the frontier from the level of Colombia in 2005 (around 17) to
almost that of Chile (around 43, i.e. a factor of 2.4). A similar increase in the globalization
index would induce an increase of 24% in the democracy index. All these results are obtained,
ceteris paribus, keeping the other variables constant.

When taking into account higher order effects reflecting the simultaneity relations could
actually produce even higher values. Using an iterative method, we computed the long-run
elasticity between globalization and democracy, leaving out the effects on the income gap for
simplicity. When globalization increases by 1.83 as in the previous example, the long-run
effect on democracy is now 60% (i.e. more than double the first round effect), roughly
equivalent to going from the mean of non-OECD to the one of OECD. The mutually
reinforcing effect would, in turn, make Globalization converge to a level close to that of the
US (or a compound increase of 2.1 instead of 1.83).

Looking at the mean effects, for OECD countries (Table 2a), the positive two-way
relationships between democracy and globalization, as well as between democracy and
development, remain. In particular, the latter effect is much stronger. In contrast,
globalization has a much smaller effect on the reduction of the income gap.

development is almost as large as for the full sample (1.23 vs. 1.33), while the elasticity of
development with respect to globalization is larger than in the full sample (0.51 vs. 0.38).
However, the interaction between democracy and development changes dramatically: the
elasticity of democracy with respect to development becomes negative, and there is no effect
of development on democracy.

 5. Sensitivity and Robustness checks

      Seemingly Unrelated Regression Estimation

 Our first exercise consists in re-estimating our system (1) using the SURE method with an
 iteration procedure over the estimated disturbance covariance matrix and parameter estimates
 that converge to stable maximum likelihood results (Zellner, 1962, 1963; Zellner and Huang,
 1962). Results are displayed in Table 4 above. Generally, speaking for all countries, OECD
 and Non-OECD there are not major changes compared to our baseline, which is reassuring.

 We also carried out sensitivity analysis with two dynamic panel estimates, the Arellano and
 Blundell’s first-difference GMM and the Arellano and Bover’s system GMM. These results
 are available in Annex Tables A3 and A4. Probably due to weak instruments, the results are
 less significant than the 3SLS, but still do not change qualitatively the main conclusions of the
 baseline estimates.

 Decomposing the Globalization Index

 Given that our globalization index is an aggregation of several components as discussed in
 section 3.2, we now run our system (1) with three stage least squares for each of the three
 main components of the total index: i) economic globalization; ii) social globalization; and iii)
 political globalization. This can provide some further and useful insights driving the main
 results discussed in section 4. We begin with the full sample, whose results for the three main
 variables of concern are displayed in Table 5.12 Most estimates are in line with previous

 12
   For reasons of economy of space the coefficient estimates on other regressors have been omitted from Tables
 5-7 but they are available from the authors upon request. Overall, the sign, statistical significance and economic
 interpretation do not qualitatively change throughout the different exercises conducted.


                                                                 14
results, but when the dependent variable is the political globalization this has a negative and
statistically significant effect on democracy. Thus, political globalization (notably captured by
membership to International Organizations) by itself is not sufficient to generate an increase
in political and civil rights whereas both economic and social globalization seem to be more
effective in generating democracy.

  Note: vide note Table 5.


For OECD countries (Table 6) economic globalization, measured by actual flows and
restrictions on trade and capital, does not seem to impact the level of development. One
reason may be due to the fact that these countries are at or close to the technological frontier
and all marginal gains from increase economic globalization are almost exhausted. As before,
all the remaining estimates are in line with previous results.

For non-OECD countries (Table 7), the component driving the negative impact of democracy
on development in Non-OECD countries is social globalization (bottom left panel). The
change in the sign is probably due to the fact that social globalization is driven by elites and
consumer behaviour that may not affect the supply-side of the economy.

6. Back to the Evidence: From General to Context-Specific Interactions

To sum-up our results, Figures 1 and 2 reflect the empirical findings of this paper with respect
to the relative strengths of the links between Globalization, our benchmark measure of
Democracy, and Development. Considering the full sample, a clear positive two-way
relationship appears between Globalization and Development (measured by the income gap),
between Globalization and Democracy, as well as Democracy and Development.

            Figure 1: Summary of interactions (KOF Index): all countries and OECD




                                              Development




              Globalization
                                                                                Democracy




These results support Eichengreen and Leblang (2008)’s findings and the hypothesis of a
positive two-way relationship between democracy and globalization. However, they are not
likely to be uniform across time and space; in particular, the impact of democracy on
globalization varies with resource endowments and global economic conditions.13 Indeed,
they noted that “general conclusions, not surprisingly, remain elusive. But the evidence here
is a start.” (p.5).

In our estimates, OECD countries are also characterized with positive two-way relationships
between economic convergence and freedoms on the one hand, and between freedoms and
globalization on the other hand.

Concerning non-OECD countries, two features are particularly interesting. First,
Globalization appears to interact positively with both Democracy and Development, both
ways. Second, a negative relationship links Democracy and Development, with a strong
negative impact of Democracy on the Income gap. Further work is therefore needed to
understand the long-run dynamics and sustainability of this global system, in particular the
mechanisms that could enforce or reinforce the expected positive effect of Globalization on
both Development and Democracy.

  See Huang (2006) for a model suggesting a long-run relationship between economic development and political
development based on the inherent technical features of different production factors.

Finally, we reflect the importance of history and geography discussed in section 4, by
summarizing the impact of these controls on Globalization, Democracy and Development for
the full sample. Unlike the English and Spanish colony dummies, the socialist legal origin
negatively affects democracy (Figure 3)14. Figure 4 shows the effects of geography: countries
from Latin America, Africa and Asia show a lower convergence to the income frontier but a
higher KOF index of globalization, while countries from Middle East and Africa have a
negative impact on democracy.

7. Conclusions

In this paper, we analyse for the first time simultaneously the interactions between
globalization, democracy and development for 89 countries over the period 1970-2005. Our
starting point is the two-way robust relation between democracy and globalization found in
Eichengreen and Leblang (2008). We extended their analysis by using multi-dimensional and
continuous measures of democracy and globalization, as well as integrating the relationships
between these two variables and the income gap relative to the US.

Two main results of our work should be highlighted. When separated into two groups, clearly
distinct patterns emerge for developed and developing countries. Introducing the income gap
as a third endogenous variable confirms the two-way interaction between democracy and
globalization found in Eichengreen and Leblang (2008) both for developed and developing
countries. Globalization displays significant positive effects on both democracy and
development in non-OECD countries. Our analysis, however, indicates a strong negative
impact of democracy on development in non-OECD countries. This may reflect the
hypothesis that globalization’s effects on democracy are mediated by slow-moving cultural
values, probably leading to a dynamic asymmetry between globalization and democracy,
moderated by the stage of economic and institutional development.


14
  A complementary explanation of the democracy-globalisation interaction can be based on the manner in which
diversity, be it socio-cultural or economic, is addressed by a given society. This is detailed in Macedo (2013).
