                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper I analyze the relationships among investment, q, and cash flow in a tractable stochastic
model in which marginal q and average q are identically equal. After analyzing the impact of changes
in the distribution of the marginal operating profit of capital, I extend the model to include measurement
error and analyze the cash-flow coefficient in regressions of investment on q and cash flow. In empirical
studies, the estimated cash-flow coefficient is generally positive and larger for rapidly growing firms.
Such findings are typically interpreted as evidence of financial frictions facing firms. I derive closed-form
expressions for the cash-flow coefficient that are positive and larger for faster growing firms, yet there
are no financial frictions in the model.

      Empirically estimated investment equations typically find that Tobin’s  has a
positive eﬀect on capital investment by firms, and that even after taking account
of the eﬀect of Tobin’s  on investment, cash flow has a positive eﬀect on invest-
ment. Intepretations of these results, of course, rely on some theoretical model of
investment. Typically, the theoretical model that underlies the relationship between
Tobin’s  and investment is based on convex capital adjustment costs.1            In such a
framework, marginal  is a suﬃcient statistic for investment, and, as a consequence,
other variables, in particular, cash flow, should not have any explanatory power for
investment, once account is taken of marginal . The fact that cash flow has a pos-
itive impact on investment, even after taking account of , is interpreted by many
researchers as evidence of financing constraints facing firms.         That interpretation
is bolstered by the finding that the cash-flow coeﬃcient is larger for firms, such as
rapidly growing firms, that are likely to be financially constrained.
      In this paper, I develop and analyze a tractable stochastic model of investment,
, and cash flow and use it to interpret the empirical results described above. As in
Lucas (1967), I specify the net profit of the firm, after deducting all costs associated
with investment, to be a linearly homogeneous function of capital, labor, and invest-
ment. Lucas showed that this linear homogeneity implies that the growth rate of the
firm is independent of its size. More relevant to the analysis in this paper, Hayashi
(1982) showed that this linear homogeneity implies that Tobin’s , often called aver-
age , is identically equal to marginal . This equality of marginal  and average 
is particularly powerful, because average , which is in principle observable, can be
used to measure marginal , which is the appropriate shadow value of capital that
determines the optimal rate of investment. In addition, this linearly homogeneous
framework relates the investment-capital ratio to  and most empirical analyses, in
fact, use the investment-capital ratio as the dependent variable in regressions.
      To analyze the response of investment to  requires a framework with variation
in  and in optimal investment. In this paper, I develop a model in which an exoge-
  1
    Lucas and Prescott (1971) and Mussa (1977) first demonstrated the link between investment
and securities prices, which are related to Tobin’s , in an adjustment cost framework.



                                             1
nous Markov regime-switching process generates stochastic variation in the marginal
operating profit of capital, which leads to stochastic variation in  and in the optimal
investment-capital ratio. With this stochastic specification and the linear homogene-
ity of the profit function described above, the model is tractable enough to permit
straightforward analysis of the eﬀects on  and investment of changes in the marginal
operating profit for a particular firm. The model can also be used to compare  and
investment across firms that face diﬀerent interest rates, diﬀerent depreciation rates,
and diﬀerent stochastic processes for the exogenous marginal operating profit of capi-
tal. I apply this framework to analyze the impact on marginal  and investment of a
mean-preserving spread in the unconditional distribution of the marginal operating
profit of capital, as well as the impact of a change in the persistence of the Markov
regime-switching process generating these marginal operating profits.
   As mentioned earlier, a common feature of adjustment cost models of investment
is that marginal  is a suﬃcient statistic for investment. Since average  and marginal
 are identically equal in the linearly homogeneous framework used here, average  is
also a suﬃcient statistic for investment. In particular, cash flow should not add any
explanatory power for investment after taking account of average .        This feature
holds in the model I present here and might appear to be an obstacle to accounting
for the empirical cash-flow eﬀect on investment described above. To overcome that
obstacle, I introduce classical measurement error in Section 5 and derive a closed-form
expression for the plim of the cash-flow coeﬃcient in an investment regression. That
expression indicates that if  is measured with error, then, as found empirically by
Devereux and Schiantarelli (1990), the cash-flow coeﬃcient can be larger for firms
that grow more rapidly.    However, because the model has perfect capital markets,
without any financial frictions, the finding of positive cash-flow coeﬃcients that are
larger for faster-growing firms cannot be taken as evidence of financing constraints.
   The interpretation of cash-flow coeﬃcients and the role of measurement error in
this paper build on and tie together two strands of the literature.        One strand,
represented by Cooper and Ejarque (2003), Gomes (2001), Alti (2003), and Abel and
Eberly (2011), develops formal theoretical models of capital investment decisions and


                                           2
uses the formal model as an environment in which to analyze the cash-flow coeﬃcient.
The second strand, represented by Erickson and Whited (2000) and Gilchrist and
Himmelberg (1995), focuses on the role of measurement error in inducing a spuriously
positive cash-flow coeﬃcient.   All of the aforementioned papers in the first strand
provide examples in which the cash-flow coeﬃcient can be positive even when capital
markets are frictionless. Thus, the finding of a positive cash-flow coeﬃcient cannot be
viewed as evidence of financial constraints. In all of these studies, however, average
 is not identically equal to marginal , so investment regressions using average 
in place of marginal  suﬀer from misspecification.     In the current paper I avoid
this specification error by adhering to the Hayashi condition so that average  is
identically equal to marginal . Therefore, average  is an appropriate regressor in a
linear investment equation when the adjustment cost function is quadratic. In this
case, a nonzero cash-flow coeﬃcient will arise if average  is measured with error,
as emphasized in the second strand of the literature.    Relative to that strand, the
contribution of the current paper is to use a formal model of investment to show
analytically that cash-flow coeﬃcients arising from measurement error will be larger
for firms that grow more rapidly.
   Because the analysis of the model relies on the equality of marginal  and average
, I begin, in Section 1, by re-stating, and extending to a stochastic framework,
the Hayashi condition under which average  and marginal  are equal. Section 2
introduces the model of the firm and analyzes the valuation of a unit of capital and
the optimal investment decision in the case in which the marginal operating profit
of capital is known to be constant forever. More than simply serving as a warm up
to the stochastic model, Section 2 introduces a function that facilitates the analysis
of the stochastic model that follows in later sections. I introduce a Markov regime-
switching process for the marginal operating profit of capital in Section 3 to generate
stochastic variation in  and optimal investment. In Section 4, I analyze the impact
of changes in the stochastic properties of the marginal operating profit of capital,
specifically, changes to the unconditional distribution and changes to the persistence
of this exogenous random variable. In order to account for the positive impact of cash


                                          3
flow on investment, even after taking account of , I introduce classical measurement
error in Section 5. I derive the plim of the coeﬃcients on  and cash flow in investment
regressions and I show that if  is measured with error, the cash-flow coeﬃcient is
larger for firms that are growing more rapidly. Concluding remarks are in Section 6.
The proofs of lemmas, propositions, and corollaries are in the Appendix.


1     The Hayashi Condition
Before describing the specific framework that I analyze in this paper, it is useful
to begin with a simple, yet more general, description of the conditions under which
average  and marginal  are equal. Consider a competitive firm with capital stock
 at time , where time is continuous. The firm accumulates capital by undertaking
gross investment  at time , and capital depreciates at rate , so the capital stock
evolves according to
                                            
                                                =  −                                     (1)
                                             
    The firm uses capital,   0, and labor,  ≥ 0, to produce and sell output at
time . I assume that the price of capital goods is constant and normalize it to be
one. Define  (   ) = max  (     ) −  , where  (     ) is revenue net
of wage payments to labor and net of any investment adjustment costs. For now, I
will simply assume that   (   ) is concave in  and  . Letting  ( ) be the
stochastic discount factor used to discount cash flows at time  ≥  back to time ,
the value of the firm at time  is
                                              ½Z     ∞                            ¾
                      ( ) = max                     (   )  ( )             (2)
                                {  }        


subject to equation (1). The following proposition presents conditions for the equality
of average  and marginal , which are essentially the same as in Hayashi (1982),
though the method of proof is diﬀerent from Hayashi’s proof and the framework is
generalized to include uncertainty and possible non-separability of costs of adjustment
from other components of the revenue function.



                                                     4
Proposition 1 (extension of Hayashi) If   (   ) is linearly homogeneous in 
and  , then for any  ≥ 0,  ( ) =  ( ), i.e., the value function is linearly
homogeneous in  , so that average , 
                                         ( )
                                          
                                               , and marginal , 0 ( ), are identically
equal.

    For the remainder of this paper, I will assume that  (   ) is linearly homoge-
neous in  and  so that average  and marginal  are equal.


2     Model of the Firm
Consider a competitive firm that faces convex costs of adjustment that are separable
from the production function.        The firm uses capital,   0, and labor,  ≥ 0,
to produce non-storable output,  , at time  according to the production function
 =   (   ), where  (   ) is linearly homogeneous in  and  , and  is the
exogenous level of total factor productivity. If the amount of labor is costlessly and
instantaneously adjustable, the firm chooses  at time  to maximize instantaneous
revenue less wages    (   ) −   , where  is the price of the firm’s output at
time  and  is the wage rate per unit of labor at time . The linear homogeneity
of  (   ) and the assumption that the firm is a price-taker in the markets for its
output and labor together imply that the maximized value of revenue less wages is
Φ  , where Φ ≡ max [   (1 ) −  ].     The marginal (and average) operating
profit of capital, Φ , is a deterministic function of  ,  , and  , all of which are
exogenous to the firm and possibly stochastic.                Therefore, Φ is exogenous to the
firm and, henceforth, I will treat Φ as the fundamental exogenous variable facing the
firm, comprising the eﬀects of productivity, output price, and the wage rate.
                   
    Define   ≡   
                        to be the investment-capital ratio at time . Therefore, equation
(1) implies that the growth rate of the capital stock,  , is

                                           1 
                                     ≡         =   − ,                                 (3)
                                            

so that for  ≥                                µZ               ¶
                                                        
                                   =  exp                                          (4)
                                                    


                                                5
Finally, I will specify the stochastic discount factor,  ( ), to be simply exp (− ( − )),
so that net cash flows are discounted at the constant rate .
       At time , the firm chooses gross investment,  . The cost of this investment has
two components.        The first component is the cost of purchasing capital at a price
per unit that I assume to be constant over time and normalize to be one. Thus, this
component of the cost of gross investment at rate  is simply  =    , which, of
course, would be negative if the firm sells capital so that   0.
       The second component is the cost of adjustment,  (  )  , which is linearly ho-
mogeneous in  and  . I assume that  (  ) ≥ 0 is strictly convex, at least twice
diﬀerentiable, and attains its minimum value at  0 , so that 0 ( 0 ) = 0.        I assume
that the minimum value of the adjustment cost is zero, that is,  ( 0 ) = 0. The most
common specifications of  0 are  0 = 0 and  0 = .2 When  0 = 0, the adjustment
cost function is viewed as a function of gross investment relative to the capital stock;
when  0 = , the adjustment cost function is viewed as a function of net investment
relative to the capital stock.       Here I will simply assume that  0   + , which
implies 0 ( + )  0. In addition, I assume that for some   , 0 (  ) = −1. The
strict convexity of  (  ) implies that     0 .
       The total cost of investment, which comprises the purchase cost of capital and the
cost of adjustment, is [  +  (  )]  . For a given  , the total cost of investment
is strictly convex in   and attains its minimum value at   .           After choosing the
optimal usage of labor, the amount of revenue less wages and less the total cost of
investment is
                               (   ) ≡ [Φ −   −  (  )]  .                  (5)


2.1       Constant Φ

Consider the case in which the marginal operating profit of capital, Φ , is known to be
constant forever. The analytic apparatus developed in the case of certainty will prove
   2
    Cooper and Ejarque (2003) and Zhang (2005) choose  0 = 0; Alti (2003) and Treadway
                                                                                ³ ´ (1969)
choose  0 =  (though Treadway’s formulation of adjustment costs is simply  ̇ which is
minimized at ̇ = 0, i.e., when   = ); Hall (2004) considers both  0 = 0 and  0 = ; and
Chirinko (1993) and Summers (1983) consider arbitrary  0 .


                                                 6
to be useful in later sections when Φ evolves according to a Markov regime-switching
process.
       I begin by defining , which is an admissible set of values for Φ, the constant
marginal operating profit of capital, as3

                          ≡ {Φ :  (  ) +    Φ   ( + ) +  + }                                     (6)

The lower bound on  ensures that there is a value of   such that  (   )  0
when   0, so that the value of the firm is positive.4 The upper bound on Φ keeps
the value of the firm finite when it is positive.5

2.1.1      The Value of a Unit of Capital

With a constant marginal operating profit of capital, Φ, constant depreciation rate,
, and constant discount rate, , the optimal investment-capital ratio,   , is constant
also. In this case, the value of the firm in equation (2) can be written as
                                             Z     ∞
                          ( ) = max                [Φ −  −  ()]  −(−)                          (7)
                                              


Dividing both sides of equation (7) by  and using equation (4) with  =  − 
                                                                                           ( )
yields an expression for the average value of a unit of capital,  ≡                        
                                                                                                   ,   which is6

                                                         Φ −  −  ()
                                          = max                                                              (8)
                                                          +−

The value of a unit of capital shown in equation (8) equals   (   )  divided by
the excess of the interest rate, , over the growth rate,  − .
   3
     Since 0 (  ) = −1 and 0 ( + )  0, the strict convexity of  (  ) implies that     +  and
that  (  ) +   is strictly increasing in   for all      . Therefore,  ( + ) +  +    (  ) +  
so that  is non-empty.
   4
     Since   minimizes  +  (), it maximizes Φ −  () − . The restriction Φ   (  ) +  
implies that Φ −  () −   0 for some , whereas if Φ were less than or equal to  (  ) +   , then
Φ −  () −  would not be positive for any .
   5
     If (1) Φ −  () −   0 and (2)  −   , the value of the firm, with   0, would be positive
and infinite because the growth rate of [Φ −  () − ]  , which is  −, would exceed . The upper
bound on Φ ∈  implies that if  ≥  + , then  () +  ≥  ( + ) +  + , so Φ −  () −   0.
   6
     The expression in equation (8) holds only if the integral in equation (7) is finite, which requires
the growth rate of capital,  − , to be less than . The optimal value of  is smaller than  + .

Rewriting equation (9) yields

                           Φ − ( + ) −  () − ( +  − ) 0 () = 0                                 (10)

To characterize the optimal investment-capital ratio, it will be useful to define a
function  ( Φ ) as

                            ( Φ ) ≡ Φ −  −  () − ( − ) 0 ()                                 (11)

where  is an arbitrary constant greater than or equal to  + . The optimal value
of , characterized by equation (10), satisfies

                                           ( Φ  + ) = 0                                           (12)

where the value of  in  ( Φ ) is set equal to  + . The following lemma presents
several useful properties of  ( Φ ).

Lemma 1 Define  ( Φ ) ≡ Φ −  −  () − ( − ) 0 () and assume that Φ ∈ 
and  ≥  + . Then:

   1.  ( Φ ) is an increasing, linear function of Φ.

   2.  ( Φ ) is a decreasing, linear function of  for     , where 0 (  ) = −1.

   3.  ( Φ ) is strictly quasi-convex in .

   4.  ( 0  Φ ) = Φ − , where  0 ≡ arg min  ().

   5.  (   Φ )  0, where 0 (  ) = −1.

                                                      ) is a local maximum. However, if  (b      ) = 0 and
b   + , then 00 (b

   7. There is a unique   ∈ (   ) and a unique   ∈ ( ∞) such that  (   Φ ) =
       (   Φ ) = 0. Also, Φ −   −  (  )  0  Φ −   −  (  ).

    Figure 1 illustrates  ( Φ ) as a function of  for given values of Φ ∈  and
 ≥  + .      If the adjustment cost function  () is quadratic, then  ( Φ ) is
quadratic in  and is a convex function of . In general, however,  ( Φ ) need
not be convex in , but it is strictly quasi-convex in .               This figure shows that
 (   Φ )  0   ( Φ ), and that  (   Φ ) =  (   Φ ) = 0.              Since
Φ −   −  (  )  0 (statement 7 of Lemma 1), the optimal investment-capital ratio
cannot equal   .8
    The following proposition characterizes the optimal investment-capital ratio   ,
where the superscript "" indicates the optimal value of  under certainty with a

     Statement 7 of Lemma 1 implies that if  =   , then   (   ) =  (     ) =
[Φ −   −  (  )]   0 and hence the value of the firm would be negative. Therefore, consistent
with footnote 6, the optimal value of  cannot equal     + .

       Corollary 1 states that a firm with a higher deterministic constant value of mar-
ginal operating profit of capital, Φ, will have a higher optimal value of the investment-
capital ratio. It also states that a firm with a higher user cost of capital,  + , will
have a lower optimal value of the investment-capital ratio.9

       Corollary 2 states that  (Φ  + ) is an increasing convex function of the marginal
operating profit of capital, Φ, and a decreasing function of the user cost of capital,
 + .

Corollary 3   (Φ  + ) T  0 ≡ arg min  () as Φ T  + 

       The parameter  0 is the value of the investment-capital ratio  at which the
adjustment cost  () takes on its minimum value, which is zero. Corollary 3 states
that in the case in which the marginal operating profit Φ is known with certainty
to be constant, the optimal value of  will equal  0 if and only if Φ =  + .10 If
Φ   + , the optimal investment-capital ratio exceeds  0 , and if Φ   + , the
optimal investment-capital ratio is less than  0 .

     See equation (25) in subsection 3.4 for a general expression for the user cost of capital. In the
absence of adjustment costs,  ( ) and  in that equation would both equal one and the user cost
                                                                                   
of capital would equal  + , which is the Jorgensonian user cost ( + )  −       , when  is
constant and equal to one.
  10
     If Φ =  + , the firm will maintain a constant level of the capital stock if and only if  0 =
, so that the adjustment cost function  () attains its minimum when net investment is zero.
Alternatively, if Φ =  +  and  0 = 0, the firm will undertake zero gross investment and the capital
stock will shrink at rate .

3     Markov Regime-Switching Process for Φ
In this section I develop and analyze a model of a firm facing stochastic variation in
the marginal operating profit of capital, Φ , governed by a Markov regime-switching
process. Specifically, a regime is defined by a constant value of Φ . If the marginal
operating profit of capital at time , Φ , equals , it remains equal to  until a
new regime arrives. The arrival process for new regimes is a Poisson process with
probability  of a new arrival during a short interval of time .                    When a new
regime arrives, a new value of the marginal operating profit of capital, Φ, is drawn
from a distribution with c.d.f  (Φ), where the support of  (Φ) is in , defined in
equation (6).      (Φ) can be continuous or not continuous, so the random variable
Φ can be continuous, discrete, or mixed. The values of Φ are drawn independently
across regimes.
    The Markovian nature of Φ implies that the value of the firm at time  depends
only on the capital stock at time ,  , and the value of the marginal operating profit
at time , . The value of the firm  (  ) is

which is the maximized sum of three terms. The first term is the present value of
 (   ) = [ −   −  (  )]  over the infinitesimal interval of time from  to  + ,
which, ignoring the infinitesimal probability that Φ and hence   change during that
interval, is [ −   −  (  )]  . The second term is the present value of the firm at
time  + , conditional on Φ remaining equal to  at time  + , weighted by the
probability, − , that Φ+ = . The third term is the present value of the expected
value of the firm at time  +  conditional on a new regime for Φ at time  + ,
weighted by the probability that a new regime will arrive by time  + .
    The Hayashi conditions in Proposition 1 hold in this framework so that the value
of the firm is proportional to the capital stock. Therefore, the average value of the

capital stock,       
                            , is independent of the           capital stock and depends only on . I
will define    () ≡  (  

                                    to be Tobin’s , or       equivalently, the average value of capital.
Since average  and marginal  are identically equal in this framework,  () is also
marginal .
                                       ( )
    Use the definition  () ≡           

 =   −  changes during the interval [  + ] so that  = (  −)(−)  , and
perform the first integration on the right-hand side of equation (13) to obtain

is the unconditional expected value of a unit of capital, which is also the unconditional
expected value of both average  and marginal .
    The maximization in equation (15) has the first-order condition

                                          1 + 0 () =  ()                                       (17)

Thus, the optimal value of  equates the marginal cost of investment, comprising
the purchase price of capital and the marginal adjustment cost, with marginal  and
average .
  11
     Use the definition of  in equation (16) and the fact that for small ,  ∼             = 1 + 
to rewrite equation (14) as  () = max  [ −   −  (  )]  + (1 − ( +  +  −   ) )  () +
() (1 − ( +  −   ) ) .   Next subtract  () from both sides of the equation, and then
divide both sides of the resulting equation by  to obtain 0 = max  [ −   −  (  )] −
( +  +  −   )  () +  (1 − ( +  −   ) ) . Taking the limit as  approaches zero, and re-
placing   by simply  yields equation (15).

3.1    Marginal  and Average 

In this subsection I present alternative expressions for marginal  and average .
Because the model presented here is a special case of Proposition 1, marginal  and
average  are identically equal. Nevertheless, it is helpful to examine diﬀerent expres-
sions for marginal  and average  and to understand why these expressions, which
at first glance look diﬀerent, are equivalent.
   Marginal  at time  is commonly expressed as the expected present value of the
stream of contributions to revenue, less wages and investment costs, of the remaining
undepreciated portion of a unit of capital installed at time , which is
                               ½Z       ∞                                        ¾

                    () =                                            |Φ =     (18)
                                               

   Average  at time  is the value of the firm at time  divided by  . Dividing

ditional expected value of marginal q. The value of average  is

   Proposition 1 implies that  () ≡  (). However, at first glance, the expressions
for  () and  () in Proposition 3 do not appear to be equivalent. The first term in
the expression for  () is  −  () + 0 () discounted at rate  +  +  and the first
term in the expression for  () is  −  −  () discounted at rate  +  +  − . To

see that these expressions are equivalent, multiply  () by  +  +  −  and subtract
the result from  () multiplied by  +  +  to obtain

                ( +  + ) [ () −  ()] +  () =  [1 + 0 ()] +  ( − )                        (20)

Since Proposition 1 implies that  () ≡  () and hence  = , equation (20) implies
 () = 1 + 0 () if  6= 0, which is the first-order condition in equation (17).12


3.2        Optimal Investment

In this section I exploit the first-order condition for optimal investment in equation
(17) to analyze several properties of optimal . The optimal value of  depends on
 (), which depends on . For now, I will treat  as a parameter and defer further
analysis of  to subsection 3.3.
       To analyze optimal , substitute the first-order condition for optimal  from equa-
tion (17) into equation (15) to obtain

                   0 =  −  () − ( +  + ) − ( +  +  − ) 0 () +                              (21)

Using the definition of  ( Φ ) in equation (11), rewrite equation (21) as

                                      (   +  + ) = −                                           (22)

       Equation (22) characterizes the optimal value of  when there is a constant in-
stantaneous probability, , of a regime switch. Of course, when  = 0, this equation
is equivalent to equation (12), which characterizes the optimal value of  under cer-
tainty. The optimal value of  when  = 0 is shown in Figure 2 as point A where
 (   + ) = 0. The introduction of a positive value of , which introduces sto-
                                                                   (1  )

on optimal  in equation (22).             First, the introduction of a positive value of  in-
creases , from  + to  + +, which reduces the value of  (  ) by  (1 + 0 ())
  12                                                                                          −(0)+
       If  = 0, the expressions for  () and  () in Proposition 3 become  () =           ++      and
          −(0)+
 () =    ++ ,    respectively, so  =  and  () and  () are consistent with each other.

at each value of , which induces the downward shift of the curve shown in Figure
2. This downward shift of the curve reduces the value of  for which  (  ) = 0,
as illustrated by the movement from point A to point B. The value of  for which
 (   +  + ) = 0 is the optimal value of  that would arise if the firm were to
disappear, with zero salvage value, when the regime switches. Thus, not surprisingly,
the introduction of the possibility of a stochastic death of the firm reduces the value
of a unit of capital and reduces the optimal investment-capital ratio. However, if the
new regime does not eliminate the firm, there is a second impact on optimal  of the
introduction of a positive value of . Specifically, if the firm receives a new draw of
Φ from the unconditional distribution  (Φ) when the regime changes, then  is the
expected value of a unit of capital in the new regime. With   0, the term − on
the right-hand side of equation (22) is negative, so that  (   +  + )  0 at the
optimal value of . Reducing the value of  (   +  + ) from zero to a negative
value requires an increase in , as shown in Figure 2 by the movement from point B


                                          15
to point C. To summarize, the introduction of stochastic variation in future Φ has
two opposing eﬀects on the optimal value of . For some values of  the introduction
of uncertainty will increase the optimal value of , and for other values of  it will
decrease the optimal value of .
   Define  (   +  ) to be the optimal value of  for given values of  +  and
 if Φ =  and  = . Formally,  (   +  ) is defined by

                                  ( (   +  )    +  + ) = −                     (23)

and  (   +  )   +  + .                    Of course, this definition is meaningful only if
min  (   +  + )  −. The following lemma identifies an interval of non-
negative values of  for which this definition is meaningful.

Lemma 2 If 0 ≤  ≤ 1 + 0 ( + ),   0, and  ∈ , then there exists a unique
 (   +  ) ∈ (    +  + ) for which  ( (   +  )    +  + ) = −.

   Note that  ( 0  +  0) =   (  + ), which is the optimal value of the investment-
capital ratio, , in the case in which Φ =  with certainty forever.
   The following lemma and its corollary list several properties of the optimal investment-
capital ratio  (   +  ) and 0 ( (   +  )).

   Lemma 3 and its corollary show that for any  ∈ [0 1 + 0 ( + )] and  ∈ ,
both  (   +  ) and 0 ( (   +  )) are increasing functions of  and , and
decreasing functions of  + . The impact of a higher value of  depends on the size
of . This result is easiest to describe for the case in which  = , so that  equals
the unconditional expected value of a unit of capital. In this case, an increase in 
hastens the arrival of a new regime in which the expected value of a unit of capital
is . For values of  that are small enough that 1 + 0 ( (   +  ))   = ,
hastening the arrival of a new regime increases the value of a unit of capital, thereby
increasing optimal  and the optimal value of 0 (). Alternatively, for values of 
that are large enough that 1 + 0 ( (   +  ))   = , hastening the arrival
of a new regime means an earlier end to the current regime with a high .                 As a
result, capital is less valuable and the optimal values of  and 0 () decline. Finally,
the corollary shows that 0 ( (   +  )) is strictly convex in . This convexity
will be helpful in subsection 4.2 when I analyze the impact on the value of a unit of
capital of a mean-preserving spread in the unconditional distribution  (Φ).


3.3     The Unconditional Expectation of a Unit of Capital

Equation (22) is a simple expression that characterizes the optimal value of . How-
                                        R
ever, this expression depends on  ≡   (Φ)  (Φ), which is the unconditional
expectation of the optimal value of a unit of installed capital. In this subsection, I
prove that  is the unique fixed point of a particular function and show that this prop-
erty helps analyze the impact on optimal investment of changes in the distribution
 (Φ) and changes in .
   Define                                           Z
                                 () ≡ 1 +              0 ( (Φ   +  ))  (Φ)   (24)

as the unconditional expectation of the marginal cost of investment, including the
purchase cost of capital and the marginal adjustment cost, where  (   +  )

                                                              17
is defined in equation (23) as the optimal value of the investment-capital ratio if
Φ =  and  = .             Since the value of a unit of capital when Φ =  is  () =
1+0 ( (   +  )), optimal behavior by the firm implies that  satisfies  () = .

Lemma 4 Suppose that the support of the distribution  (Φ) is contained in . The
                        R
function  () ≡ 1 +  0 ( (Φ   +  ))  (Φ) has the following three properties:
(1)  (0)  0; (2)  (1 + 0 ( + ))  1 + 0 ( + ); and (3) 0  0 ()  1 for
 ∈ [0 1 + 0 ( + )].

   Lemma 4 together with the continuity of  () leads to the following proposition.

Proposition 4 Suppose that the support of the distribution  (Φ) is contained in .
Then  is the unique positive value of  ∈ (0 1 + 0 ( + )) that satisfies  () = .

   Lemma 4 also leads to the following corollary, which will prove useful in analyzing
the eﬀects of changes in the distribution  (Φ) and changes in 

Corollary 5 For any ∗ ∈ [0 1 + 0 ( + )],  [ (∗ ) − ∗ ] =  [ − ∗ ].

   Corollary 5 helps determine the impact on  of changes in the distribution  ()
or in . Let 0 be the initial value of  before the change in  () or in . Then
any change that increases  ( 0 ) will increase , and any change that decreases  (0 )
will decrease .


3.4      Marginal Profit and the User Cost of Capital

Jorgenson (1963) demonstrated that the optimal capital stock in a firm’s dynamic
optimization problem can be characterized by a static condition equating the marginal
profit of capital and the user cost of capital. His seminal derivation was conducted
in the absence of costs of adjustment. Here I illustrate the concepts of the marginal
profit of capital and the user cost of capital in the presence of convex adjustment
costs.
   First, consider the user cost of capital. In the absence of adjustment costs (and
in the absence of uncertainty), Jorgenson showed that the user cost of capital is
                 
( + )  −     
                       ,   where  is the purchase price of capital at time . To extend

                                                18
the concept of user cost to the framework in this paper, I make two modifications to
that concept: (1) replace  by the shadow price of capital,  ( ), and (2) replace
the change in  by the expected change in the shadow price of capital, which is
 ( −  ()), since there is an instantaneous probability  that the value of  will
change and induce a new value of , which has an expected value of . Therefore,
the user cost of capital,  ( ), is

             ( ) = ( + )  ( ) −  ( −  ( )) = ( +  + )  ( ) −                     (25)

                                              
    The marginal profit of capital,          
                                                  ,   is obtained by diﬀerentiating   (   ) in
equation (5) partially with respect to  to obtain

                              (   )
                                            =  − [ (  ) −   0 (  )]                         (26)
                                

The marginal profit of capital in equation (26) comprises two components: (1) the
marginal operating profit of capital,  ; and (2) the reduction in the adjustment
cost  (  )  associated with an increase in  for given  . This reduction in the
adjustment cost is − [(
                        
                            ) ]
                                   = − [ (  ) −   0 (  )], where the derivative is computed
holding  fixed.
                                                             (  )
    Equating the marginal profit of capital,                   
                                                                          ,   in equation (26) and the user
cost of capital,  ( ), in equation (25) yields

                      − [ (  ) −   0 (  )] = ( +  + )  ( ) −                        (27)

Use the first-order condition in equation (17) and the fact that  () ≡  () to replace
 ( ) in equation (27) by 1 + 0 (  ) to obtain

                   − [ (  ) −   0 (  )] = ( +  + ) (1 + 0 (  )) −                   (28)

Finally, use the definition of  ( Φ ) in equation (11) to rewrite equation (28) as

                                   (      +  + ) = −                                      (29)



                                                      19
which is identical (since  = ) to the first-order condition in equation (22).


4     Changing the Stochastic Properties of Φ
In this section I consider the impact of changing the stochastic properities of the
marginal operating profit of capital, Φ. Specifically, I consider three changes: (1)
replacing the original distribution  () by a distribution that first-order stochasti-
cally dominates the original distribution; (2) introducing a mean-preserving spread
on  (); and (3) increasing , the arrival rate of a new value of Φ, which reduces the
persistence of Φ.


4.1    2 (Φ) First-Order Stochastically Dominates 1 (Φ)

In this subsection, I analyze a change in the distribution  (Φ) from 1 (Φ) to 2 (Φ),
where 2 (Φ) first-order stochastically dominates 1 (Φ). Let  be the unconditional
expected value of a unit of capital when the distribution of Φ is  (Φ),  = 1 2. Also,
let  (Φ    +  ) be the optimal value of  for given Φ when the distribution of Φ
is  (Φ), and let Γ () be the induced distribution of the optimal value of  when
the distribution of Φ is  (Φ),  = 1 2.

Proposition 5 If 2 (Φ) strictly first-order stochastically dominates 1 (Φ), then
2  1 and Γ2 () strictly first-order stochastically dominates Γ1 ().

    Proposition 5 states that moving to a more favorable distribution of Φ that first-
order stochastically dominates the original distribution will increase , the average
value of a unit of capital.    The increase in  will increase the optimal value of 
at each value of Φ, and because the distribution of Φ becomes more favorable and
optimal  is increasing in Φ, the distribution of optimal  also moves toward larger
values in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance.


4.2    A Mean-Preserving Spread on  (Φ)

Now consider the eﬀect on optimal investment of a mean-preserving spread on the
distribution  (Φ). This question was first addressed in a model with convex costs

                                             20
of adjustment by Hartman (1972) and then by Abel (1983).                           In both papers, the
production function is linearly homogeneous in capital and labor and the firm is
perfectly competitive, so that, as in this paper, the marginal operating profit of
capital, Φ, is independent of the capital stock. Hartman and Abel both found that
an increase in the variance of the price of output leads to an increase in the optimal
rate of investment.13 The channel through which this eﬀect operates is the convexity
of Φ ≡ max [   (1 ) −  ] in   and  . This convexity implies that a mean-
preserving spread on   or  at some future time  increases the expected value of
future Φ and thus increases the expected present value of the stream of future Φ ,
which increases (marginal)  and hence increases investment. In the current paper,
I analyze a diﬀerent channel for increased uncertainty to aﬀect investment. To focus
on that channel, I analyze mean-preserving spreads on the distribution of Φ directly.
Since the expected value of Φ remains unchanged by construction, any eﬀects on
the optimal value of  will operate through a diﬀerent channel than emphasized by
Hartman (1972) and Abel (1983).

Proposition 6 A mean-preserving spread of  (Φ) that maintains the support within
 increases .

         The proof of Proposition 6 is in the Appendix, but it is helpful to examine a key
step to get a sense for what is driving the result. As shown in the Appendix, this
result relies on the fact that 0 ( (Φ   +  )) is convex in Φ, even though 0 ()
may not be convex in  and  (Φ   +  ) may not be convex in Φ. Notice that
                                                         0 ((Φ+))
0 ( (Φ   +  )) will be convex in Φ if                   Φ
                                                                              = 00 ( (Φ   +  )) ×
(Φ+)                                                                                 (Φ+)
     Φ
                 is increasing in Φ. However, neither 00 ( (Φ   +  )) nor                 Φ
                    1
=    (−(Φ+))00 ((Φ+))
                                          is necessarily increasing in Φ.           But their product,
      1
−(Φ+)
               ,   is increasing in Φ, as in statement 5 of Corollary 4, so 0 ( (Φ   +  ))
is convex in Φ. Therefore, a mean-preserving spread on Φ increases the unconditional
expected value of 0 ( (Φ   +  )) and hence increases .
    13
    Caballero (1991) showed that the positive impact of uncertainty on optimal investment can be
reversed by relaxing the assumption of perfect competition or by relaxing the linear homogeneity of
the production function in capital and labor.


                                                    21
Corollary 6 If 000 () ≤ 0 for   ≤  ≤  +  + , then a mean-preserving spread of
                                                           R
 (Φ) that maintains the support within  increases  ≡   (Φ   +  )  (Φ),
the unconditional expected value of .

      As shown in the proof of Corollary 6 in the Appendix, a mean-preserving spread
of  (Φ) increases the unconditional expected value of the investment-capital ratio
through two channels. First, if 000 () ≤ 0, then  (Φ   +  ), is (weakly) convex
in Φ, so that a mean-preserving spread of  (Φ) (weakly) increases the expected value
of  (Φ   +  ). Second, a mean-preserving spread of  (Φ) increases  which also
                R
increases  ≡   (Φ   +  )  (Φ). In the special case of quadratic adjustment
costs, 000 () ≡ 0, so the first channel is absent, but the second channel is suﬃcient
for a mean-preserving spread of  (Φ) to increase the unconditional expected value
of the investment-capital ratio.


4.3       A Change in Persistence of Regimes

Now consider a change in the persistence of regimes governing Φ. With a constant
instantaneous probability  of a switch in the regime, the expected life of a regime is
1

  ,   so an increase in  reduces the persistence of the regime.

                                                   
Proposition 7 If  (Φ) is non-degenerate, then       0, so that an increase in the
persistence of regimes (which is a reduction in ) increases .

      The following informal argument may provide some helpful intuition. An increase
in  increases the frequency with which new values of Φ are drawn from  (Φ) and
thus reduces the unconditional variance of the average value Φ over a given horizon.
This reduction in variability reduces , somewhat analogously to Proposition 6. The
formal proof, which is in the Appendix, does not rely on this loose analogy but is less
intuitive.
      The following corollary exploits the fact that in the case of quadratic adjustment
costs, the optimal value of  is an increasing linear function of  ().

                                                                           
Corollary 7 If  (Φ) is non-degenerate and if  () is quadratic, then     
                                                                                 0.

5        Measurement Error and the Cash Flow Eﬀect
         on Investment
The model developed in this paper focuses on three variables that are often used
in empirical studies of investment, specifically, the investment-capital ratio, , the
value of a unit of capital, , which is Tobin’s , and cash flow per unit of capital,
Φ. This model, like most existing models, uses the first-order condition for optimal
investment, 1 + 0 () =  () (equation (17)), to draw a tight link between  and .
This link is often described by saying that  is a suﬃcient statistic for , meaning that
if an observer knows the adjustment cost function and the value of , then the value of
 can be computed in a straightforward manner without any additional information
or knowledge of the values of any other variables.              Indeed, if the adjustment cost
function,  (), is quadratic, the marginal adjustment cost function is linear, and
optimal  is a linear function of .
       The empirical literature has a long history of finding that  is not a suﬃcient
statistic for .     In particular, at least since the work of Fazzari, Hubbard, and
Petersen (1988), researchers have found that in a regression of  on  and Φ, estimated
coeﬃcients on both  and Φ tend to be positive and statistically significant.                   The
finding of a positive significant coeﬃcient on cash flow, Φ, is often interpreted as
evidence that firms face financing constraints or some other imperfection in financial
markets. This interpretation of financial frictions, as they are sometimes known, is
bolstered by the finding that for firms that one might suspect to be more likely to
face these frictions, the cash flow eﬀect tends to be more substantial. For instance,
as the argument goes, firms that are growing rapidly may encounter more substantial
financial frictions, and it turns out that the cash-flow coeﬃcient is often larger for
such firms.14
       In this section, I will oﬀer a diﬀerent interpretation of the cash-flow coeﬃcient.
I will demonstrate that if  is observed with classical measurement error, then the
coeﬃcient on  is biased toward zero and, more importantly, the coeﬃcient on cash
  14
    For instance, Devereux and Schiantarelli (1990) state "The perhaps surprising result from table
11.7 is that the coeﬃcient on cash flow is greater for firms operating in growing sectors." (p. 298).


                                                 23
flow, Φ, will be positive, even though the coeﬃcient on Φ would be zero in the
absence of measurement error in . The fact that measurement error in  can aﬀect
the coeﬃcient estimates in this way been pointed out by Erickson and Whited (2000)
and Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995), though the particular simple expressions I
present in this paper appear to be new.          More novel, however, is the analytical
demonstration that the cash-flow coeﬃcient will be larger for firms that grow more
rapidly.
   The finding that measurement error in  can lead to a positive cash-flow coeﬃcient
does not use the particular model in this paper, other than the result that  and Φ are
positively correlated with each other. I derive this result in subsection 5.1. Then in
subsection 5.2, I use the model in this paper to demonstrate that cash-flow coeﬃcients
are larger for firms that have higher growth rates. Although the literature interprets
the empirical finding of larger cash-flow coeﬃcients for more rapidly growing firms as
evidence of financial frictions, the model here has no financial frictions whatsoever,
and yet leads to the same finding. Therefore, the finding of positive cash-flow coeﬃ-
cients, including larger coeﬃcients for firms that are growing more rapidly, does not
necessarily show that financial frictions are important or operative.


5.1    Coeﬃcient Estimates under Measurement Error

In this subsection I analyze the impact of measurement error on the estimated coef-
ficients on  and cash flow in investment regressions. To isolate measurement error
from specification error that might arise by fitting a linear function to a nonlinear
relationship, I assume that the adjustment cost function is quadratic so that optimal
 is a linear function of . In particular, the adjustment cost function is

                                          1
                                 (  ) =  (  −  0 )2                        (30)
                                          2

where   0 and, as discussed earlier,     0   + . The first-order condition for
optimal  in equation (17) implies that

                                                  − 1
                                    = 0 +                                      (31)

Assume that the manager of the firm can observe , Φ, and  without error, but
people outside the firm, including the econometrician, observe these variables with
classical measurment error. Specifically, the econometrician observes the value of a
                                                                e =  + =  0 + −1

                  = Φ +  , where the observation errors  ,  , and  , are mean
zero, mutually independent, and independent of , Φ, and . Erickson and Whited
(2000) oﬀer a useful taxonomy of reasons for measurement error in , and except for
diﬀerences between marginal  and average  (which are non-existent in the model
presented here), those reasons could apply here.
   Consider a linear regression of e

       Equation (35) shows the impact of measurement error in .                      If  is perfectly
measured, then 2 = 0 and, regardless of whether cash flow is measured with error,
                                                  1
equation (35) immediately yields  =             
                                                      and  = 0. Thus, if  is perfectly measured,
 equals the derivative of the optimal value of  with respect to  in the first-
order condition in equation (31). In addition, the estimated eﬀect of cash flow on
investment,  , is zero. Erickson and Whited (2000) use measurement-error consistent
GMM estimators and find empirically that the cash-flow coeﬃcient is zero and that
investment is well explained by , when properly removing the eﬀects of measurement
error.
       If  is measured with error, so that 2  0, then,  , the estimated coeﬃcient on
, is smaller than 1 , the true derivative of  with respect to . Moreover, if 2  0,
then  , the estimated coeﬃcient on cash flow can be nonzero; in fact, if  and
cash flow are positively correlated, the estimated cash-flow coeﬃcient,  , is positive.
Much of the investment literature interprets a significantly positive coeﬃcient on
cash flow in a regression of investment on  and cash flow as evidence of financing
constraints.15 Yet equation (35) demonstrates that measurement error in  will lead
to a positive coeﬃcient on cash flow, provided that  and cash flow are positively
correlated, even if there are no financial frictions. This argument is not restricted to
the particular specification of the firm in this model, and has been made less formally
  15
    As discussed earlier, notable exceptions include Abel and Eberly (2011), Alti (2003), Cooper
and Ejarque (2003), Erickson and Whited (2000), Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995), and Gomes
(2001).

by, for example, Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995).16 The model in this paper allows
the analysis to go one step further and to account for diﬀerences in the estimated
cash-flow coeﬃcients for firms with diﬀerent growth rates, as I discuss in the next
subsection.17


5.2       Larger Cash-Flow Coeﬃcients for More Rapidly Growing
          Firms

Proponents of the view that positive cash-flow coeﬃcients are evidence of financing
constraints bolster their view by showing that firms that are likely to face binding
financing constraints are likely to exhibit larger, more significant positive cash-flow
coeﬃcients. For instance, they argue that firms that are growing more quickly are
more likely to face binding financing constraints.             Empirical evidence that rapidly
growing firms have larger, significant positive cash-flow coeﬃcients is then presented
as evidence of financing constraints.            However, the model in this paper oﬀers an
alternative interpretation.           Equation (35) shows that the cash-flow coeﬃcient is
                    (Φ)
proportional to      (Φ)
                             ,   which is the population regression coeﬃcient of  on Φ. The
                                                     (Φ)                    0
analog of this coeﬃcient in the model is              Φ
                                                           , which equals  ((Φ+))
                                                                                 Φ
                                                                                            because
                                                       0
                                                      ((Φ+))      1
 (Φ) = 1 + 0 ( (Φ   +  )).         Since           Φ
                                                                       = ++−  (statement 1 of
                 (Φ)           1
Corollary 4),     Φ
                         =   +−(−)
                                       ,   which is increasing in the growth rate of capital,
 − , for given  + . Therefore, the cash-flow coeﬃcient is increasing in the growth
rate of the firm.
       To use the model to compare the investment behaviors of a slowly growing firm
and a rapidly growing firm, I will consider firms that face diﬀerent unconditional
distributions,  (Φ), of Φ, that endogenously lead to diﬀerent growth rates.                     The
following proposition states that the firm with the more favorable  (Φ) in the sense
of strict first-order stochastic dominance will grow more rapidly and will have the
  16
      Gilchrist and Himmelberg, p. 544, state "More generally, anything that systematically reduces
the signal-to-noise ratio of Tobin’s Q (for example, measurement error or ‘excess volatility’ of stock
prices) will shift explanatory power away from Tobin’s Q toward cash flow, thus making such firms
appear to be financially constrained when in fact they are not."
   17
      Erickson and Whited (2000) derive an alternative expression for the estimated cash-flow coeﬃ-
cient and demonstrate that to the extent that measurement error in  imparts downward bias in  ,
the cash-flow coeﬃcient will be higher for firms with more variable cash flows.

                                                  27

higher cash-flow coeﬃcient, which is proportional to                      Φ
                                                                               ,   even though there are no
financial frictions in the model.

Proposition 8 Consider two firms with identical quadratic adjustment cost functions
but with diﬀerent unconditional distributions of Φ, 1 (Φ) and 2 (Φ), which imply
diﬀerent unconditional values of capital,  1 and 2 . If 2 (Φ) strictly first-order
stochastically dominates 1 (Φ), then

    1.  (Φ  2   +  )   (Φ  1   +  ),

         2 (Φ)       1 (Φ)
    3.     Φ
                       and
                         Φ
                               ,
       R                   R

                                     Φ
                                           1   (Φ).

    Proposition 8 states that the firm with distribution 2 (Φ) is the faster-growing
firm, whether the speed of growth is measured by the investment-capital ratio at any
given value of Φ (statement 1) or by the unconditional expectation of the investment-
capital ratio (statement 2).           This proposition also states that the firm with the
                                                         (Φ)
distribution 2 (Φ) has the higher value of               Φ
                                                                 for a given value of Φ (statement 3)
                                                                 (Φ)
and the higher unconditional expected value of                    Φ
                                                                         (statement 4). Therefore, the
                                                                           (Φ)
firm with distribution 2 (Φ) has the higher value of                       (Φ)
                                                                                      and hence the higher
cash-flow coeﬃcient. To summarize, the firm that is growing more rapidly has the
larger coeﬃcient on cash flow, even though there are no financial frictions in this
model.


6        Concluding Remarks
This paper develops a model of a competitive firm with constant returns to scale to
provide a tractable stochastic framework to analyze the behavior and interrelation-
ships among optimal investment, , and cash flow. As first shown by Hayashi (1982),
average  and marginal  are identically equal in this framework. Within the class of
models for which average  and marginal  are equal, the model presented here places
only one additional restriction on technology, namely that adjustment costs, which

                                                        28
are a function of investment and the capital stock, are additively separable from the
production function for output, which is a function of capital and labor. For con-
venience, the model specifies a constant discount rate and a constant depreciation
rate of capital. Finally, the analysis of the stochastic model is greatly facilitated by
the simple Markov regime-switching specification for the marginal operating profit of
capital.
   The model developed here is tractable enough to analyze various aspects of optimal
investment behavior in a framework that is consistent with empirical analyses that
use average  to measure marginal  and that specify the investment-capital ratio
as a function of . When the marginal operating profit of capital follows a Markov
regime-switching process, I present analytic expressions for the optimal investment-
capital ratio and the value of a unit of capital that are closed-form up to a single
undetermined scalar constant.
   After demonstrating various properties of optimal investment and , I use the
model to analyze the eﬀects of three changes in the stochastic environment facing
the firm. First, a favorable shift in the unconditional distribution of the marginal
operating profit of capital, in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance, increases
the expected value of a unit of capital, and shifts the distribution of the optimal
investment-capital ratio in a first-order stochastically dominating way.     Second, a
mean-preserving spread of the unconditional distribution of the marginal operating
profit of capital increases the average value of a unit of capital, as in the existing
literature, though the channel through which the eﬀect operates is diﬀerent than
in previous studies.   Third, an increase in the persistence of regimes increases the
average value of a unit of capital.
   To address the common empirical finding of a positive coeﬃcient on cash flow in
a regression of the investment-capital ratio on  and cash flow, I introduce classical
measurement error. Consistent with existing arguments, I show that measurement
error in  can lead to a positive coeﬃcient on cash flow. However, I use the model to
go a step further and demonstrate that the model can account for the finding of larger
cash-flow coeﬃcients for firms that grow more rapidly. Proponents of the importance


                                          29
of financing constraints point to the positive coeﬃcient on cash flow as evidence of
the importance of these constraints. Moreover, they argue that larger cash-flow co-
eﬃcients for firms likely to be constrained, such as rapidly growing firms, support the
interpretation that positive cash-flow coeﬃcients indicate the importance of financing
constraints. However, the model presented here has no financing constraints at all,
yet in the presence of classical measurement error, it predicts coeﬃcients on cash flow
that are both positive and larger for firms that grow more rapidly.

Proof. of Lemma 1:            (1) Inspection of the definition of  ( Φ ) in equa-
tion (11) immediately reveals that  ( Φ ) is an increasing linear function of
Φ.    (2) Diﬀerentiating  ( Φ ) with respect to  yields  = − (1 + 0 ()),
which is negative for     .        (3)    Diﬀerentiating  ( Φ ) with respect to
 yields  ( Φ ) = − ( − ) 00 ().     Since  () is strictly convex, 00 ()  0.
Therefore,  ( Φ ) is strictly decreasing in  for   , strictly increasing in
 for   , and minimized with respect to  at  = .                  That is,  ( Φ )
is strictly quasi-convex in . (4) The adjustment cost function  () attains its
minimum value, which is zero, at  =  0 , so  ( 0 ) = 0 ( 0 ) = 0.           Therefore,
 ( 0  Φ ) = Φ −  −  ( 0 ) − ( −  0 ) 0 ( 0 ) = Φ − . (5)   Since 0 (  ) = −1,
 (   Φ ) = Φ −  −  (  ) − ( −   ) 0 (  ) = Φ −  −  (  ) +  −   =
Φ −  (  ) −    0 since Φ ∈ .           (6) Since  ( Φ ) = − ( − ) 00 ()
and  ( Φ ) is strictly quasi-convex in ,  ( Φ ) is minimized with respect
to  at  = .        Therefore, min  ( Φ ) =  ( Φ ) = Φ −  −  () ≤
Φ − ( + ) −  ( + )  0, where the first inequality follows from 0 ( + )  0,
00 ()  0, and  ≥  + , and the second inequality follows from the assumption
that Φ ∈ .      (7)  (   Φ )  0   ( Φ ) and the strict quasi-convexity of
 ( Φ ) in  imply that  ( Φ ) = 0 for exactly two distinct values of , de-
noted   and      , with        and    .  (   Φ ) = 0, for  =  ,

                                             33
implies Φ −   −  (  ) = ( −   ) [1 + 0 (  )]   =  .                               Since 1 + 0 ()  0 for
    , it follows that Φ −   −  (  )  0 for   ∈ (   ) and Φ −   −  (  )  0
for   ∈ ( ∞).

is known with certainty to be constant and equal to Φ, that is,   (Φ  + ), is a root of
 ( Φ  + ) = 0. Statement 7 of Lemma 1 states that this equation has two roots:
  ∈ (    + ) and   ∈ ( +  ∞) and that Φ −  −  (  )  0  Φ −  − (  ).
Since   (     ) = [Φ −   −  (  )]   0, the root   cannot be the optimal
value of . Therefore, the smaller root,   , is the optimal value of the investment-
capital ratio when Φ is known with certainty to be constant and equal to Φ.

Proof. of Lemma 4: To prove property (1), let  = 0 and use the definitions of  ()
                                            R
and  (   +  ) to obtain  (0) = 1 +  0 ( (Φ 0  +  ))  (Φ). Lemma 2
implies that  (Φ 0  +  )    and the convexity of  () implies 0 () is strictly
                            R
increasing so  (0)  1 +  0 (  )  (Φ) = 1 + 0 (  ) = 0.
    To prove property (2), let  = 1 + 0 ( + ) and use the definitions of  () and
                                                    R
 (   +  ) to obtain  (1 + 0 ( + )) = 1+  0 ( (Φ 1 + 0 ( + )   +  ))  (Φ).
The definition of  (  ) implies that  (   +  + ) =  (   + )− (1 + 0 ()).
In particular, this equation holds for  =  + , so that  ( +    +  + ) =
 ( +    + )− (1 + 0 ( + )). Since Φ ∈  ≡ {Φ :  (  ) +    Φ   ( + ) +  + },


                                                          37
 ( +    + ) =  − ( + ) −  ( + )  0.          Therefore,  ( +    +  + )
 − (1 + 0 ( + )) ≤ 0, which, along with  (   +  + )  0 for   , im-
plies  ( 1 + 0 ( + )   +  )   + . Therefore, the convexity of  () implies
                         R                                                 R

    To prove property (3), it is helpful to first prove that  (   +  )   + 
for all  in [0 1 + 0 ( + )].          The proof of property (2) above includes a proof
that  ( 1 + 0 ( + )   +  )   + .          Therefore, statement 2 of Lemma 3,

i.e.,        
                        =        0, implies that  (   +  )   +  for all  in

Use statement 2 in Corollary 4, i.e.,  ((Φ+))

                   R       
obtain 0 () =  ++−(Φ+)    (Φ)  0. Since  (Φ   +  )   + ,
                                    0

++−(Φ+)
                    1. Therefore,    ()   
                                                 (Φ) = 1, which completes the proof
that 0  0 ()  1 for  ∈ [0 1 + 0 ( + )].
Proof. of Proposition 4:                   The function  () is continuous over the domain
[0 1 + 0 ( + )] and has the three properties listed in Lemma 4. Therefore, there
exists a unique positive value of   1 + 0 ( + ) that satisfies  () = . For that
            R
value of ,  [1 + 0 ( (Φ   +  ))]  (Φ) =  = .
Proof. of Corollary 5: Suppose that  (∗ )  ∗ . Property 3 of Lemma 4 implies
that  ()   for all  ∈ [∗  1 + 0 ( + )].        Therefore, the unique value of  for
which  () =  is less than ∗ , so  − ∗  0 when  (∗ ) − ∗  0.               A similar
argument proves that  − ∗  0 when  (∗ ) − ∗  0.
Proof. of Proposition 5: Let ∗ =  1 , which implies that
    R
1 =  [1 + 0 ( (Φ ∗   +  ))] 1 (Φ). Since 0 ( (Φ ∗   +  )) is strictly in-
creasing in Φ (statement 1 of Corollary 4), the assumption that 2 (Φ) strictly first-
order stochastically dominates 1 (Φ) implies that ∗ =  1 =
R                                           R
 
   [1 + 0 ( (Φ ∗   +  ))] 1 (Φ)   [1 + 0 ( (Φ ∗   +  ))] 2 (Φ) ≡ 2 (∗ ),
using the definition in (24). Therefore, Corollary 5 implies that 2  ∗ = 1 .
    Define  ( ∗    +  ) to be the value of Φ for which  (Φ   +  ) =  ∗ .
Since  (Φ   +  ) is strictly increasing in Φ and strictly increasing in , it follows


                                                   38
that  ( ∗    +  ) is strictly increasing in  ∗ and is strictly decreasing in . Note
that Γ1 ( ∗ ) = 1 ( ( ∗   1   +  )) ≥ 2 ( ( ∗   1   +  )) ≥ 2 ( ( ∗  2   +  ))
= Γ2 ( ∗ ), where the first (weak) inequality follows from the assumption that 2 (Φ)
first-order stochastically dominates 1 (Φ), and the second inequality follows from the
facts that  2  1 ,  ( ∗    +  ) is strictly decreasing in , and 2 (Φ) is increas-
ing. Since 2 (Φ) strictly first-order stochastically dominates 1 (Φ), the inequality
Γ1 ( ∗ ) ≥ Γ2 ( ∗ ), which holds for all  ∗ , holds strictly for some  ∗ . Therefore, Γ2 ()
strictly first-order stochastically dominates Γ1 ().

a convex function of . Therefore, a mean-preserving spread of  (Φ) increases
             R
the value of  0 ( (Φ ∗   +  ))  (Φ), which increases the value of  (∗ ) ≡
    R
1 +  0 ( (Φ ∗   +  ))  (Φ), so that  (∗ )  ∗ . Corollary 5 implies that

and 000 () ≤ 0. Let 1 (Φ) be the original distribution and let 2 (Φ) be the new dis-
tribution obtained from a mean-preserving spread on 1 (Φ) that maintains the sup-
                          R

the facts that          ()2

Corollary 5 implies that an increase in  also reduces .
Proof. of Corollary 7: If  () is quadratic and convex with a minimum value of 0
attained at  =  0 , it can be written as  () = 12  ( −  0 )2 where   0. Therefore,
0 () =  −  0 .        The first-order condition in equation (17) can be written as

1 +  −  0 = , which implies that 1 +  −  0 = . Therefore,                           

where the inequality follows from   0 and Proposition 7, which states that                            
