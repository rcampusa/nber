           Forecasting Recessions Under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Law



                                   ABSTRACT

        The targeted deficit reductions of the Gramm—Rudman—Hollings (GRE)

   law are to be temporarily suspended in case of an official determination

   that real economic growth either (a) has been less than one percent in

   the two most recent reported quarters, or (b) is projected to be less

   than zero in any two consecutive quarters out the next six. This amounts

   to a particular definition of recession. But business cycles are best

   identified by the consensus of movements in the principal economic

   aggregates. Not all recessions are associated with real GNP declining

   or growing less than 1% for two successive quarters. Also, GNP estimates

   are subject to long sequences of revisions that are often large.

        We show that, for these reasons, conditioning a suspension of

   deficit cuts upon specific changes in preliminary data for real GNP involves

   very long lags in recognizing recessions. The recessions would be largely

   over before they were identified. We also show that forecasts of real

   GNP, based on the consensus among groups of professional forecasters,

   can reduce these lags considerably. This is so despite the fact that

   early and accurate predictions of business cycle peaks are rare, and

   false warnings occur.

                                1.   Introduction

     The Grani-Rudman-Hollings (GRH) law passed by the Congress in December

 1985 establishes a process whereby the Federal budget deficits are to be

gradually phased out by the fiscal year (FY) 1991. A series of targeted

ceilings on the unified budget deficit is instituted, beginning with $172

billion for Fl 1986 and $11t billion for Fl 1987 and proceeding by decrements

of $36 billion per year to zero in FY 1991. The planned reductions are to be

achieved by spending and tax measures agreed upon by the legislative and

executive branches of the U.S. government. However, if an agreement is not

reached, the target for any FY is to be achieved through an automatic across-

the-board spending cut in all eligible defense and nondefense categories.

Early in 1986 a lower court ruled that the sequestering provision of GRH is

unconstitutional; this ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court on July 7,

1986. This does not pertain to the issues discussed in this paper.

     Section 2514 of the GRH law provides for "Special Procedures in the Event

of a Recession." It states that the Congressional Budget Office (CEO)

Director shall notify the Congress at any time (a) if the CBO or the Office of

Management and Budget (0MB) "has determined that real economic growth is

projected or estimated to be less than zero with respect to each of any two

consecutive quarters" within a period of six successive quarters starting with

the one preceding such notification, or (b) "if the Department of Commerce

preliminary report of actual real economic growth (or any subsequent revision

thereof) indicates that the rate of real economic growth for each of the most

recent reported quarter and the immediately preceding quarter is less than one

percent."

    Upon receiving the CEO Directors notification, both Houses commit
                                         2




 themselves to procedures designed to suspend several GRH provisions. These

 concern the maximum deficits for the current and the next fiscal year, and the

 corresponding spending and revenue levels.

      In short, the targeted deficit reductions are to be suspended when a

 recession is either (a) forecast by CBO or 0MB or both, or (b) reported as

 being under way by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in the U.S.

 Department of Commerce. This is important since the spending cuts and/or tax

 increases needed to produce the deficit reductions might seriously aggravate

the recession. And the probability that a recession will occur at some time

during the long period between the present and the end of FY 1991 must

certainly be viewed as rather high.

     This paper addresses three questions in the following order:

(1) How accurately and promptly has the Commerce report that real GNP growth

    fell below 1% in two consecutive quarters identified previous business

    recessions? This is an attempt to trace the implications of provision (b)

    above with the aid of historical data.

(2) What can reasonably be expected from the past record of economic

    forecasters with respect to their ability to predict a recession defined

    as two consecutive quarters of' decline in real GNP? This is a similar

    attempt to trace the implications of provision (a) above.

(3) How do the foregoing results compare with alternative signals of recession

    based upon leading indicators and employment data?



                   2. Defining and Recognizing Recessions

    The conditions under which the deficit reductions otherwise mandated

under GRH would be suspended imply two   alternative   definitions of a business

recession. One of these requires at ieast two consecutive quarters during
                                               3




 which "real economic growth" stays below zero: this refers to the CBO or 0MB

 forecasts. The other, used with reference to the BEA reports, is a sequence

of at least two quarters with growth rates of less than one percent. It is

clear from the language employed in some earlier sections of the law that the

criterion in both cases is growth of GNP in constant dollars.1 The difference

between the two definitions suggests that the legislators may have thought

that forecasts of negative growth were more likely to identify actual

recessions than forecasts of very low but still positive growth.

of   defining and recognizing recessions from data limited to the quarterly

series on output of the U.S. economy (GNP in constant dollars). One

difficulty here is that some generally recognized recessions have not been

marked by two consecutive declines in this series. Thus in 1960 total U.S.

output fell in the second and fourth quarters but not in the third quarter,

and in 1980 it fell in the second quarter only (Table 1).          In these cases,

then, the criterion of two successive declines in real GNP would have produced

no recognition of a recession at all. However, in both these instances the

criterion of two quarters of less than one percent growth was met, which may

account for the alternative definition in the GRH. Nevertheless, any

individual indicator series, even one as comprehensive and important as GNP,

can measure only some of the aspects of aggregate economic activity. Also,

all such series contain measurement errors that are in part independent and




1Both the House Amendment and the Senate Amendment in section VI ("Economic
Conditions") of GRH contain similar provisions regarding the predicted and
actual real growth rates. The House version also referred to the event that
the average rate of unemployment for two consecutive months is one percent
above the same two months for the previous year, but this particular trigger
was dropped in the Conference greement (see Congressional Record-House,
December 10, 1985, p. H—11710).

 revealed by data revisions. For these reasons, business cycles are better

 identified from the consensus of' key macroeconomic indicators for employment,

 production, real income and real sales than from any single one of these

 series. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has always relied on

 this principle in developing its much tested and widely accepted chronology of

recessions and recoveries. The peak and trough dates in our tables are those

determined by NBER.

     Table 1 compares the recessions as dated by MBER (columns 1-3) with

periods of two or more consecutive quarters during which the economy grew less

than one percent (SAAR). Ten such sequences of low or negative growth rates

occurred in the presently available historical series of real GNP for 1914882

(part A, column 14), whereas the number of concurrent business cycle

contractions is eight. Thus the GRH definition that counts low rises along

with declines in total output yields two additional "recessions." One of

these relates to a mild two-quarter slowdown that preceded the downturn of'

January 1980 by about a year, a serious discrepancy. The other merely

involves a single-quarter interruption of' the 1981-82 decline in real GNP.

When the two episodes are excluded, the peak signal dates from the historical

series (mid-months of quarters preceding the low-growth periods, see column 5)

are found to be on the average coincident with the business cycle peaks. The

range of these timing comparisons is from a lead of LI months to a lag of' 6

months, the standard deviation is 3 months (column 7).

     For a time, the earliest estimates for G\JP were published in the last

month of the quarter as the "flash report," based on very incomplete data and

often subject to large revisions. Iow the first report is published in the

first month of the following quarter, and in he earlier years the publication

lags were longer. In Table 1, the ef'fective   data   release dates are taken to
                                       5




 fall in the month following the second quarter with real growth of less than

one percent (column 6). The recognition lags, measured from the reference

peak dates to these data release dates, are listed in the last column of the

table; excepting the two false signals noted before, their range is +4 to ÷iL,

with a mean of +8 and standard deviation of 3 months. For six of the seven

recessions, the recognition lag was at least 6 months. These results are

about what one would expect, given the requirement of at least two successive

quarters of very low or negative growth, the roughly coincident cyclical

timing of real GNP, and the informational delays involved.

     Of course, the data used in Table 1, part P. were not available to anyone

who would have tried to recognize recessions at the time they occurred. Part

B of the table is based on preliminary data that would have been available to

contemporary observers. Quarterly estimates of real GNP began to be published

regularly in 1959 and so for 1948-58 only the rates of change in current-

dollar GNP are used. Price changes were moderate in this period (except in

1950), and indeed the results are identical with those based on the present

data for real GNP (compare the first four lines, columns 5-8, in parts A and B

of the table). Preliminary data based on incomplete information often have

large extrapolative components and they share with forecasts the tendency to

underestimate actual change (Cole 1969; Zarnowitz 1982), but here the early

estimates produce results that are very close to those obtained with the last

revised estimates. The mean signal and recognition lags in part B are 0 and

+8, respectively, the same as in part A, while the standard deviations are

somewhat smaller.

    To sum up, mere monitoring of the data on real GNP growth cannot produce

prompt recognition of recessions. The typical range of the delays involved in

the process is about 6—9 months, by 4hich time the recession itself may nearly
                                       6




 be over. (Business cycle contractions since 19148 ranged from 6 to 16 months

 and averaged 11 months.) The length of the recognition lags is very little

 affected by whether a recession is defined as two consecutive quarterly

 declines in real GNP or as two quarters of growth below one percent. Also,

 the conclusion that the lags tend to be long relative to the length of

 recessions holds regardless of whether preliminary or revised data are used.

      The events that must occur for the deficit cuts to be suspended are

exactly stipulated in GRH, but there appears to be nothing specific in the law

about the mechanism for ending a decreed suspension. Presumably, the deficit

reductions will resume when the legislators recognize that the conditions

which triggered the suspension no longer exist, but how promptly would this

happen in response to what signals? Suppose that the recognition that a

recession is over required two consecutive quarters of positive growth in real

GNP to follow each of the sequences listed in Table 1, column 14.   Then

substantial delays in recognizing a recovery would be likely; for the eight

business cycle troughs of 19149-82 such lags would have ranged from 5 to 10

months and averaged 8 months, using the present data. A better rule to follow

would be to assume that the recovery is on as soon as it is known that output

increased at an annual rate of more than one percent for a single quarter

after a period of a recognized recession. This criterion would have come

fairly close to most of the trough dates of recessions, reducing the average

recognition lag to 3 months. However, some false signals of troughs would

have resulted, as illustrated by the rise of real GM? in 1182 (see Table 1

notes h and 1.)




                         3. Forecasting Recessions

    The meaning of the long recognition lags listed in Table 1 is that any
                                        7




 signals from the actual data on real GNP growth would have been much too tardy

 for the purposes envisaged in the recession-related provisions of GRH.    If

 Congress had to rely on such signals, it would be likely to suspend the

 deficit cuts at best only late in a recession. By then the fiscal tightness

 required by GRH would have already done its harm in contributing to the

 business contraction. The suspension might still help in hastening the end of

 the decline, but it could also be sufficiently mistimed to overstimulate the

economy during the following recovery and expansion.

     Clearly, it is only timely and accurate forecasts of an approaching

recession that could provide the right warnings when needed. Studies have

repeatedly shown that combining predictions from diverse sources and methods

often results in significant gains in accuracy. That is, the consensus

forecasts from surveys are typically more accurate than most of the individual

forecasters polled (Zarnowitz 198Z), when accuracy is measured over a

considerable period of time. The record of such group averages in predicting

the major macroeconomic variables is often as good as or better than that of

the principal econometric forecasting models (McNees 1973, 1979). These

research findings are based on the median forecasts from the surveys conducted

quarterly since 1968 by the American Statistical Association (ASA) and NBER.

For this paper we shall use the consensus forecasts of' real GNP gro' th both

from the ASA—NBER quarterly survey and from the well-known Blue Chip Economic

Indicators monthly survey. The results should compare reasonably well with

what might be expected from the CBO and 0MB forecasts that are required under

the GRH law.

     Fifteen of the quarterly ASA-MEER surveys since 1968 can be linked to

recessions as defined by GRH (Table 2). Six of these predicted that real GNP

would turn down and fall for at least two consecutive quarters during the year
                                          8



 ahead, while nine predicted that a decline shown by the preliminary data for

 one or more previous quarters would continue for at least one more quarter.

 Estimates of actual change are listed for two quarters (Q1, Q) preceding the

 quarter Q1 in which the survey was taken (columns 4-6). The median survey

 forecasts of real growth in the five successive quarters covered by each

 survey (Q1-Q5) are shown next (columns 7-11). Signal leads or lags (column

 1i) measure the intervals between the peak dates implied by the configurations

of the estimates and forecasts (column 12) and the business cycle peak dates

determined by MBER (column 1). Recognition leads or lags (column 15) measure

the intervals between the survey release dates (column 13) and the business

cycle peak dates.2

        The first signals of peaks that did subsequently occur and the

corresponding recognition lags are included in the averages shown on the

bottom line. The other entries in the last two columns are put in parentheses

and excluded from the averages. Most of these are secondary signals that

merely confirm the initial ones, but in 1979 a recession was repeatedly

predicted that did not happen in that year and these signal and recognition

leads, marked F, are also excluded. It is important to note, however, that

these false warnings could not be readily recognized as such at the time and

might have been seriously misleading, although a brief recession did occur in

1980.

        The forecasters as a group did not perform well in predicting the 1969—70

recession, according to the present criteria. In t'Iovember 1969 their average

forecast for 1V69 was -1.2% which correctly captured the timing of the peak,



2The survey questionnaire is mailed by the ASP. in the middle month of each
quarter to a list of persons who are professionally engaged in forecasting the
course of the economy. The replies are sent to and examined by the 'JBER, and
regular reports on the results are released in the third month.
                                             9




 but the predicted decline was to last one quarter only. In February 1970 no

 further downward movement was anticipated. The May 1970 survey is the first

 to qualify under the criterion of two consecutive quarterly declines. Hence

 the recognition lag was 6 months, whereas the corresponding recognition lag in

Table 1 was 14 months.

     The survey taken in February 19714 predicted negative growth rates for

both 1714 and 11714. Hence the forecast yields a lag of 14 months at the

business cycle peak of November 1973, much less than the recognition lag of 8

months based on preliminary actual data (Table 1 part B) Moreover,

according to the presently available revised data the recognition lag was 14

months   (Table 1, part A).

     This brings up an important point. The GNP data are subject to long

series of revisions which are frequently large relative to the quarterly

changes. Compared with the "final" figures, the preliminary estimates of

growth in the nation's output are sometimes about as much in error as the

earlier forecasts of growth. In large part, the measurement errors involved

are occasioned by major benchmark revisions related to censuses taken at

intervals of several years or by changes in the base year of the constant

price estimates. Neither the forecasters nor the data compilers themselves

can be reasonably expected to predict such revisions. Since the final data

may not be known for years, they can hardly be of much help on a current basis

to economic analysts and forecasters.

     During 1979, when economic activity ceased to grow after four years of'

expansion, many economists repeatedly predicted a downturn too soon. Thus the

surveys of February, May,     and august   1979 produced median forecasts of

declines that did not happen (F). But the same episode also produced the

earliest correct peak forecasts in the November 1979 survey as the long-
                                       10




anticipated downturn materialized at the beginning of 1980. The signal and

recognition leads of 5 and 1 months, respectively, contrast with       of 1 and

9 months in Table

     Finally, the downturn of July 1981 was not anticipated earlier that year,

although in May the forecasters as a group predicted zero growth for 1181 and

in August predicted zero growth for 11181. The first forecast of at least two

successive quarters of decline was issued in November and then showed negative

growth for three quarters, starting with 1181. The signal and recognition

lags for this recession are —5 and ÷5 months, respectively, which is still

much better than the corresponding lags of 1 and 9 months recorded in Table 1.

     The overall averages in Table 2 are a signal lead of 4 months and a

recognition lag of 3 months. The corresponding measures yielded by the actual

data for the same period are mean lags of 1 and 9 months in Table 1A and of 2

and 8 months in Table lB. This suggests a significant gain from the

forecasts, which however is qualified by the false signals that on balance

weigh much more heavily against the forecasts than against the data.

     The Blue Chip surveys, initiated in 1978, cover only the recessions of

1980 and 1981—1982, but they have the advantage of being monthly and hence

very up-to—date. The 27 surveys that produced average predictions of

recessions as defined by GRH are listed in Table 3, which follows the same

rules and has the same format as Table 2.

    Although their sources as well as frequency are quite different, the two

sets of forecasts show similar patterns. In Table 3 again there is a sequence



3Recall that real GNP declined only in one quarter (1130) during the short
recession of Jan.—July 980 so that the 'less than 1% growth" rule must be
invoked in Table 1 to identify this particular peak. But the same rule, when
applied to the present revised data, vLeids in this case a read of 6 months!
(Table 1, part A). This is because these data show zero growth in 179 and a
slight decline in 1179.
                                       11




of false signals of peaks in 1979 that ends in November when both surveys gave

 the earliest correct warning of the January 1980 downturn (the recognition

 lead is here slightly longer for Blue Chips because of faster processing).

Blue Chips then produced a somewhat longer sequence of' timely signals. Both

surveys erred in August-September 1980 in forecasting that the recession would

continue in the second half of the year. Blue Chips issued a correct

prediction of the July 1981 peak in August, i.e., with a lag of one month

only, whereas ASA-NBER did so in December, with a recognition lag of 5

months. For the two recessions of the early 1980s, the averages of the

earliest signals are -5 and 0 for Blue Chips and -5 and ÷2 for ASA-NBER.

     Finally, let us note that neither group predicted any two-quarter

declines in real GNP since the end of the last recession in Iovember 1982.

This may be counted as a significant plus for the forecasters since the

slowdown from mid—198Z through 1985 was accompanied by severe difficulties in

several important economic sectors, much uncertainty, and large revisions of

the GNP data.



                          i4 Alternative Approaches

     Table 4 compares the above results with some alternatives. Signals of

recession from reported data on real GNP growth under the GRH definition are

very tardy (column 2). The evidence from surveys of' forecasters looks

reasonably good, suggesting that some recessions can be predicted at about the

time of their occurrence or with short lags (columns 3 and 4). But this

result must be tempered by the recognition that (1) the time series of

forecasts cover few recessions and so are not very informative on this point;

(2) the variation of the leads and lags obtained is relatively large (see the

reported standard deviations); and (3) the forecasters produced some
                                            12




 potentially misleading false signals.

      It is therefore of interest to consider also some other possible

 approaches to signaling recessions, which could provide inputs into the

 forecasts by the agencies involved in the GRH process. A few years ago, the

authors developed a system of recession and recovery signals based upon

smoothed rates of change in the government indexes of leading and coincident

indicators (Zarnowitz and Moore 1982; reprinted with an update in Moore 1983,

chapter 1!).     This   system produces sequentially, on a current monthly basis,

early warnings and confirmations of business cycle turning points. The first

signal of a peak (P1) is observed when the smoothed rate of growth in the

leading index falls below 2.3%, while the corresponding rate for the

coincident index is nonnegative (L <      2.3; C    0);   the second (P2) is defined

by L <   -1.0,   C < 2.3; and the third and last (P3) by L <   0, C < -1.0. The Fl
criterion results in very early signals which, however, turn out fairly often

to be false (F); P2 substantially reduces both the lead times and the

frequency of the F's; and P3 is associated with short or intermediate lags but

seems to eliminate the F's altogether. Table , column 5, lists the lags for

P3 and shows them to average 2 or 3 months. A particular advantage of this

approach is the low variability of the lags over time.

     Each of the post-World War II business cycle downturns in the United

States was accompanied by increases in the overall unemployment rate of at

least 0.5% averaged over spans of six months. An index combining six selected

series published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics relating to marginal

employment adjustments (e.g., average work week, layoffs, initial unemployment

claims) is compiled monthly by the ColumbIa Center for International Business

Cycle Research (CIBCR). Smoothed rates of growth in this index produce

relatively accurate semiannual (January and July) forecasts of changes in the
                                      13




average rate of unemployment over the ensuing six-month periods (Moore

1985). A by-product of these CIBCR projections is a set of signals of'

recessions reproduced in Table i4, column 6. Five of these are timely (—1 to

+3 months) and three are lags of 6-7 months; two forecasts, dated 7/56 and

1/67 gave false peak warnings. The averages are lags of 3_14 months.   The

unemployment criterion of recession has two advantages: the unemployment rate

is not subject to revision and it is a concept widely understood by the

public.



                                 5. Summary

Our results lead to the following conclusions:

1. There are serious problems with the definition of recessions adopted in

    the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law. Business cycles are best identified by the

    consensus of movements in the principal economic aggregates, as is done in

    the widely used chronology maintained by the National Bureau of Economic

    Research. Not all recessions are associated with, or well identified by,

    real GNP either declining or growing less than 1% (SAAR) for two

    consecutive quarters. GNP estimates are subject to long sequences of

    revisions that are often large, which aggravates the situation.

2. The record of preliminary estimates of real GNP published by the Department

    of Commerce shows that most recessions would have been at least half over

    by the time they would be recognized by the criterion of slow growth

    specified in the Grainin Rudman law. Hence the suspension of deficit cuts

    according to this criterion may come too late to play an effective anti—

    recession role.

3. Tests of the alternative criterion based upon forecasts of two successive

    declines in real GNP, using records of consensus forecasts by economists,

    yield more satisfactory results. Most recessions would have been recog—
                                        14



    nized just a few months after they began. Occasionally, however, pre-

   mature or false warnings have occurred.

4. Leading indicators of aggregate economic activity can also assist the

   makers and users of forecasts in reducing the length and variability of

    the lags in recognizing recessions. Indicators that are specifically

    designed to anticipate changes in employment and unemployment may provide

    additional services of this type.

5. Although rLo criteria for recognizing recoveries from recessions are

    specified in the Gramm—Rudman law, tests of two possible procedures show

    that most recoveries could be identified shortly after they began.
