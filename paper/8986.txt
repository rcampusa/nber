                                              ABSTRACT

        Prior research has uncovered a large and positive correlation between education and health. This
paper examines whether education has a causal impact on health. I follow synthetic cohorts using
successive U.S. censuses to estimate the impact of educational attainment on mortality rates. I use
compulsory education laws from 1915 to 1939 as instruments for education. The results suggest that
education has a causal impact on mortality, and that this effect is perhaps larger than has been previously
estimated in the literature.

1         Introduction

Access to health care insurance,1 expenditures on health care,2 and even income levels3 have been

shown to have little eﬀect on health. On the other hand, there is a large and positive correlation

between education and health (Grossman and Kaestner 1997). This correlation is strong and

significant even after controlling for diﬀerent measures of socio-economic status, such as income

and race, and regardless of how health is measured (morbidity rates, self-reported health status

or other measures of health). Given that the measured eﬀects of education are large, investments

in education might prove to be a cost-eﬀective means of achieving better health,4 if education

indeed helps us to be healthier. But prior research has not ascertained whether the relationship

between education and health is causal.

        The purpose of this paper is to determine whether education has a causal eﬀect on health,

in particular on mortality. The negative relationship between education and mortality, the most

basic measure of health, has become well established since the famous Kitagawa and Hauser

(1973) study, which found significant diﬀerences in mortality rates across educational categories

for both sexes. More recent studies (e.g. Christenson and Johnson, 1995, Deaton and Paxson,

1999) confirm these findings. Elo and Preston (1996) control for a variety of other mortality

factors such as income, race, marital status, region of residence, and region of birth. Rogers et

al. (2000) further control for access to health care, insurance, smoking, exercise, occupation, and

other factors. Figures 1 and 2 document this relationship using consecutive census data for the

US: in all cohorts, those who survive have higher education than those who do not.

        The existing literature has explained this correlation in three ways. One controversial hypoth-

esis is that education increases health, either because education makes people better decision-
    1   See Newhouse (1993).
    2   For example see Filmer and Prichett (1997).
    3   Grossman (1975) shows that income does not aﬀect health beyond a certain threshold.
    4   This was first suggested by Auster et al (1969).




                                                           1
makers (Grossman 1975) and/or because more educated people have better information about

health (Kenkel 1991, Rosenzweig and Schultz 1981). Another possibility is that poor health re-

sults in little education (Perri 1984, Curry and Hyson 1999). Finally, this correlation could be

caused by a third unobserved variable that aﬀects both education and health, for example genetic

characteristics or parental background. Many studies have attempted to include these factors.5

However, Fuchs (1982) argued that discount rates (which no study controls for) would also explain

the correlation: people who are impatient invest little in education and health, while people who

are patient invest a lot in both.6 Of course, these theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

      In this paper I address this issue using a unique quasi-natural experiment: between 1915 and

1939, at least 30 states changed their compulsory schooling laws and child labor laws. If compulsory

schooling laws forced people to get more schooling than they would have chosen otherwise, and

if education increases health, then individuals who spent their teens in states that required them

to go to school for more years should be relatively healthier and live longer. The intuition that

compulsory education laws provide a natural experiment was put forward first by Angrist and

Krueger (1991). They argued that because compulsory education laws forced individuals to stay

in school until a certain age, those born in later quarters would stay in school longer. Although

they were criticized for their choice of quarter of birth as an instrument,7 the underlying principle

                                      8
is appealing and implementable.

      No other papers have used natural experiments to measure the eﬀect of education on mortality.

A few studies (Berger and Leigh 1988, Sander 1995, and Leigh and Dhir 1997) have used instru-

mental variable (IV) estimation with other measures of health, such as blood pressure, smoking
  5 Wolfe and Behrman (1987), Duleep (1986) and Menchik (1993) find no education eﬀect once controls are

added.
  6 Fuchs (1982) and Farrel and Fuchs (1982) examined this issue but their evidence is inconclusive. Munasinghe

and Sicherman (2000) do find that time preference plays an important role in the determination of smoking.
  7   See Bound, Jaeger and Baker (1995) and Bound and Jaeger (1996).
  8  Harmon and Walker (1995) look at the eﬀects of the laws in the UK. Meghir and Palme (1999) used Swedish
data. Acemoglu and Angrist (1999) used US laws to determine the size of the social returns to education.




                                                      2
or exercise.9       But these studies are inconclusive because each paper’s choice of instrument is

questionable. For example, all of these studies use parents’ background/education as instruments,

but we know these are correlated with children’s health,10 and furthermore, we know that health

shocks during childhood or gestation have persistent health eﬀects into adulthood.11 Income and

education expenditures in state-of-birth could serve as instruments (Berger and Leigh 1988), but

again they might be correlated with state expenditures on health, state industrial composition

and other state characteristics that aﬀect health.

       Using the 1960, 1970 and 1980 Censuses of the US, I select those individuals who were 14 years

of age between 1915 and 1939. I then construct synthetic cohorts and follow them over time to

calculate their mortality rates. I then match cohorts to the compulsory attendance and child labor

laws that were in place in their state-of-birth when they were 14 years old. The census data have

not been used to calculate mortality rates before in economic analyses.12 This method could be

used to analyze mortality experiences in periods where no other data are available.

       Several IV estimations are presented, including an original two-stage procedure for grouped

data that can be applied when the first stage can be estimated at the individual level but the second

stage can only be estimated at the aggregate level. This procedure, inspired by the traditional

two-stage least squares (2SLS) method, can easily be applied to other cases as well.

       The results provide evidence that suggests there is a causal eﬀect of education on mortality

and that this eﬀect is perhaps larger than the previous literature suggests. While GLS estimates
   9 Berger and Leigh (1988) estimate the eﬀect of education on blood pressure using the NHANES I. They use

state-of-birth, income and education expenditures per capita from year-of-birth to age 6 in state-of-birth, and
dummies for ancestry as instruments for education. They also estimate the eﬀect of education on disability with
NLS data, using IQ and family background measures as instruments. In both cases schooling is significant. Using
a sample of older persons from the 1986 PSID, Leigh and Dhir (1997) use parental education, background, and
state-of-residence at age 16 to instrument for education in regressions for disability and exercise. Alternatively,
they include direct measures of time preferences and risk aversion. Education was not always significant. Finally
Sander (1995) examines the eﬀect of schooling on the odds of quitting smoking using the General Social Survey.
He uses parental schooling as an instrument for schooling and finds that the eﬀect of schooling is quite large for
whites.
  10   Development studies show that family background aﬀects children’s health (see Strauss and Thomas, 1995).
  11 For examples see studies that looked at the consequences of the Dutch famine on the health of adults conceived
during the famine, such as Hoek, Brown and Susser (1998) or Roseboom (2000).
  12   However this methodology is used in epidemiology. For example see the work by Haines and Preston (1996).

suggest that an additional year of education lowers the probability of dying in the next 10 years

by approximately 1.3 percentage points, my results from the IV estimation show that the eﬀect is

much larger: at least 3.6 percentage points. However the results also suggest that the OLS and

the IV estimates are not statistically diﬀerent.

      This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in this project, including

a description of how the census is used to obtain mortality rates. Section 3 shows that compulsory

attendance and child labor laws had an impact on the educational attainment of individuals, and

presents evidence that these laws are good instruments. Section 4 presents the general econometric

framework used for analyzing mortality. The results are presented and discussed in Section 5, and

conclusions are given in section 6.


2       Data

I use the U.S. censuses of 1960, 1970 and 1980, which are one percent random samples of the

population.13       The census provides information on age, sex, race, education, marital status,

urban location, state of residence and state of birth. My samples include all white persons born

in the 48 states,14 that were 14 years of age between 1914 and 1939, with no missing values for

completed years of education.15

      I use the censuses to follow “synthetic cohorts.” Although I do not observe the same individuals

over time (so I cannot observe individual deaths), I do observe the same groups over time, which

allows me to estimate group death rates. I aggregate the censuses into groups defined according

to their gender/cohort and state-of-birth (descriptive statistics in Table 1). Using the 1960, 1970

and 1980 censuses, I can calculate two 10-year death rates for each group: one for 1960-1970, and

another for 1970-1980. For example, the 1960-1970 death rate for a group is the number of people
  1 3 The data come from the IPUMS 1960 general sample, the 1970 Form 2 State sample (originally 15% state

sample), and the 1980 1% Metro sample (originally B sample).
 14   Hawaii and Alaska were not then part of the Union.
 15  For consistency across censuses, I recoded completed years of education to be a maximum of 18 years instead
of 20 in 1980.



                                                       4
alive in 1960 (N60 ) minus the number of people alive in 1970 (N70 ) divided by the population in

1960 (N60 ).

       One issue that arises in estimating death rates by groups is measurement error. As Figure 3

shows, because of random sampling the number of deaths will be overestimated about half the

time and underestimated half the time for all cohorts. As a result, some estimated death rates are

negative. In the data, we observe more negative death rates for younger cohorts and fewer negative

death rates for older cohorts (see Figure 4A); this is a pattern we should expect. As we can see in

Figure 3B, with a zero death rate (no change in the population), two successive samplings of the

same population result in a negative death rates half the time. When the death rate increases (as

the population ages), the likelihood that the second sample will contain more observations than

the first falls, resulting in fewer negative death rates.We also observe fewer negative death rates

for states with large population (Figure 4B), which is also to be expected since the sampling error

is smaller for larger populations.

       The negative death rates are not a source of concern for two reasons. First, the estimated death

rates will result in consistent estimates of the true death rates.16              Second, average cohort death

rates from the censuses are very similar to those obtained from individual data from the NHEFS

described below (see Figure 4C). Note that the graph suggests there is evidence of age heaping:

for ages that are multiples of 10, the death rates fall, because individuals tend to over-report their

age and chose a multiple of ten when doing so.

       I also used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic Follow-up

Study, 1992 (hereafter NHEFS). This survey followed 14,407 individuals who were between 25 and

74 years of age when interviewed for the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

(NHANES I) between 1971 and 1974. The NHEFS followed individuals and recorded whether

they had died by 1985. The sample is composed of whites17 that were 14 years of age between
  1 6 Also note that IV estimates are only consistent, not unbiased, estimates of structural parameters. A consistent

estimate of the dependent variable is suﬃcient for the IV estimators to be consistent.
  17   Other researchers have suggested that blacks had significantly diﬀerent school experiences during the begining



                                                          5
1914 and 1939, who were alive in 1975 and followed successfully, with no missing observations for

years of completed education (N=4554). Table 1 shows the summary statistics for this data.

       The data on compulsory attendance and child labor laws come from a number of sources.

There are eight years of state-level data (1915, 1918, 1921, 1924, 1929, 1930, 1935 and 1939) on

these laws,18 and some additional information for other years. I imputed missing observations

by using the older values. I also collected data on state-level factors that contributed to the

growth of secondary education from 1915 to 193919 or that could aﬀect mortality. These include

state expenditures on education, number of school buildings per acre, percent of the population

that was living in urban areas, percent of the white population that was foreign born, percent

of the population that was black, percent of the population employed in manufacturing, average

annual wages in manufacturing per worker, average value of farm property per acre, and number

of doctors per capita (See Lleras-Muney 2001 for information on data sources).

       Each individual is matched to the laws and state characteristics that were in place in their

state-of-birth when they were 14 years old. I choose this age because it is the lowest common

drop-out age across states. This procedure assumes that individuals went to school in their state-

of-birth. Inevitably some individuals were mismatched. However, Card and Krueger (1992) show

that mobility was low during this period. Also Lleras-Muney (2001) shows that mobility seems to

be uncorrelated to these laws and that restricting the sample to those that are still living in their

state-of-birth does not change the eﬀect of the laws.20
of the century. See Card and Krueger (1992). Also, Lleras-Muney (2001) suggests that compulsory schooling laws
and child labor laws did not aﬀect blacks.
  18   Acemoglu and Angrist (1999) have gathered similar data. The data for this project was collected independently.
  19   The state-level variables were suggested by the work of Goldin (1994) and Goldin and Katz (1997).
  20 I regressed mobility between state-of-birth and state-of-residence in1960 as a function of education, compulsory
education laws and all other covariates used in this paper. The F statistic of joint significance of the laws has a
value of 1.17 (p value of 0.3151), suggesting the laws cannot explain mobility. Also Lleras-Muney (2001) shows
that restricting the sample to those that are still living in their state-of-birth yields estimates of the eﬀect of the
laws that are statistically identical to those presented here.

3       Did Compulsory Attendance and Child Labor Laws aﬀect
        schooling? First Stage

The validity of the methodology proposed in this paper rests on the crucial assumption that com-

pulsory attendance laws and child labor laws can be used as instruments. This section estimates

the first stage, showing that the laws are good predictors of educational attainment both at the

individual and aggregate level. I also provide additional evidence here that the laws are good

instruments. These results will then be used in the two-stage (IV) estimations in Sections 4 and

5.

3.1      Compulsory Attendance and Child Labor Laws

Since their inception in Massachusetts in 1852, compulsory attendance laws have been complex.

They specify a minimum and a maximum age between which school attendance is required; a

minimum period of attendance; penalties for non-compliance; and the conditions under which

individuals could be exempted from attending school, such as the completion of a given grade,

mental or physical disability, distance from school, and so on. The most common exemption

was for work. Work permits were available even for young children, generally even younger

than the minimum dropout age specified by compulsory education laws. Child labor laws, which

extensively regulated the employment of minors, also included several conditions for the granting

of such permits and for exemptions.

      Child labor laws and compulsory attendance laws often were not coordinated. Each stipulated

diﬀerent requirements for leaving school. For example, in 1924 in Pennsylvania, the ages for com-

pulsory attendance were 8 to 16, but the child labor laws allowed 14 year-olds to get work permits

and leave school.21       Continuation school laws, which forced children at work to continue their

education on a part-time basis, were the only laws that attempted to bridge this gap. Compul-

sory attendance laws and child labor laws were in place in all states by 1918, and were modified
 21   During this early period work permits eﬀectively allowed children to leave school. See Woltz (1955).




                                                         7
frequently thereafter.

      There is little agreement regarding the eﬀectiveness of these laws.22           Previous studies (in-

cluding my own)23 suggest that only three of the many aspects of these laws had an impact

on individual educational attainment: the age at which a child had to enter school (enter age),

the age at which the child could get a work permit and leave school (work age), and whether or

not the state required children with work permits to attend school on a part-time basis (con-

tsch). Following Acemoglu and Angrist (1999), I combine the age at which a child had to

enter school and the age required for work permit into a single variable, childcom, defined as:

childcom = work age − enter age. This variable is the implicit number of years that a child had

to attend school, given that the entering age and the work permit age were enforced. It takes the

values of 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. The other variable, contsch, takes the value of 1 if continuation

school laws were in place. Tabulations describing these laws throughout the period for each state

are shown in the Appendix. Importantly note that it is not always the case that more years of

compulsory schooling were required, although on average states required more schooling towrds

the end of the period.

      The period from 1915-1939 is when compulsory education laws (hereafter I refer to both com-

pulsory attendance laws and child labor laws as “compulsory education laws”) are more likely to

have aﬀected many individuals. Secondary schooling was experiencing remarkable growth, espe-

cially in the first 40 years of this century.24 Also, in the previous period (up to 1915), these laws

were perceived as ineﬀective.25          But social scientists agree that the laws were enforced by the

1920s26 and Schmidt’s work (1995)–the only study to concentrate on this period–confirms it.
 22   For a detailed review of these studies see Lleras-Muney (2001).
 23   See Lleras-Muney (2002), Angrist and Acemoglu (1999) and Schmidt (1996).
 24  Goldin and Katz (1997) show that the percentage of young adults with high school degrees increased from 9
percent in 1910 to more than 50 percent in 1940.
 25 Many state laws did not even provide enforcement mechanisms, and if they did, there were often insuﬃcient
means to enforce them, especially in rural areas. See Katz (1976) and Ensign (1921)
 26   See Katz(1976).




                                                         8
Edwards (1978), and Angrist and Krueger (1991) suggest that the laws declined in importance

after the 1940s. So the first part of the 20th century provides the perfect window of opportunity

for using the laws as instruments. Finally, from a technical point of view, this period is interesting

because states were constantly changing their compulsory education and child labor laws.

3.2    The eﬀect of the laws on educational attainment

As preliminary evidence of the eﬀect of these laws on education, I graph the average education by

childcom for the entire sample (Figure 5) and by cohort, for every 5th cohort in the data (Figure

6). Both graphs show that average education is higher for those in states where more education

was compulsory. In order to add further controls, I turn to regression analysis. Pooling individual

data from the 1960 and 1970 census, I estimate the following model:


                         Eics = b + CLcs π + Xics β + Wcs δ + γ c + αs + εics .


The dependent variable is years of completed education for individual i of cohort c born in state s.

CL is a set of dummies for compulsory education laws in place in state s when the individual was

14, Xics are individual characteristics such as gender and region of current residence, Wcs is a set of

characteristics of individual i ’s state-of-birth at age 14 (such as manufacturing wages, expenditures

in education, per capita doctors, etc.), γ c are cohort dummies, αs are state-of-birth dummies. The

regression also includes interactions between region-of-birth and cohort, an intercept (b) and a

dummy for 1970. I also estimate the model by aggregating the data at the state-of-birth/cohort

and gender level. Both estimations will be used in Section 4 (first stage).

   Table 2 shows the results. The first column estimates the relationship including only state

eﬀects, cohort eﬀects, a female dummy, and a set of dummies for the laws. The coeﬃcients are

fairly robust to the addition of other controls (see column 2).27 The last column shows the results

from estimating the equation using the data aggregated at the state-of-birth, cohort and gender
  2 7 Inclusion of other variables, such as income, immigrant status of parents, has no impact on them. Also,

regressions by region-of-birth or by gender yield similar results. See Lleras-Muney (2001) for these results.




                                                     9
level. The estimations show that the laws increased the educational attainment of individuals. As

expected, all dummies for the laws are positive and significant and they generally increase as the

number of compulsory years increases. Overall, the implied increase in educational attainment

due to childcom is around 4.8 percent.28 This estimate is similar to those reported by Acemoglu

and Angrist (2000), Eisenberg (1988) and Angrist and Krueger (1991). Also, the continuation

school dummy is positive.29

       Before turning to the eﬀect of education on mortality, I present evidence that the laws are

good instruments. At the bottom the Table 2, I report the F-test of joint significance of the

laws; it shows that the laws are always jointly significant at the 5% level for both specifications.

Additionally the F-statistic is greater than (or very close to) 5, which suggests that the instruments

are strong. I also report the partial R-squared coeﬃcient, another measure of the instruments’

strength.30      It has a value of 0.0001 or higher, which compares favorably to those reported by

Bound, Jaeger, and Baker (1995).

       It is also worth pointing out that the changes in the laws that took place during this period

appear to have been exogenous to individuals. Although diﬀerent states might have had diﬀerent

tastes for education, the regressions here include a very large set of controls (cohort dummies, state-

of-birth dummies and region-of-birth*cohort interactions are included) which should capture this

eﬀect. Also note that the addition of controls (compare column 1 and 2 of Table 2) has little eﬀect

on the coeﬃcients of the laws, suggesting that any excluded state-of-birth/cohort level variables are

not correlated with the laws. Furthermore, Lleras-Muney (2001) presents evidence consistent with

exogenous laws: her results suggest that the laws impacted only the lower end of the distribution

of education. She rejects the hypothesis that changes in the laws during this period resulted from
  28   This was calculated by replacing the set of dummies by the continuous variable. See Lleras-Muney (2001).
  29  Continuation school is not significant in this sample, but previous work (see Lleras-Muney, 2001) showed that
this law aﬀected white males and individuals born in the north and south of the U.S. Therefore I include it.
  3 0 Bound, Jaeger, and Baker (1995) suggest that: 1-the F statistic on the excluded instruments in the first stage

should be statistically significant and large (Staiger and Stock (1997) further suggests that a value of less than 5
could signal weak instruments. This is a rule of thumb); 2-the partial r-square should be high.

(rather than caused) increases in education.31

       A final concern is that the laws must aﬀect individual health only through their eﬀect on

education. There is no evidence that the laws included any clauses or restrictions that would have

aﬀected health independently. For example, there were no lunch programs provided as part of

school attendance. Also the states that led in education during this period (the prairie states32

) were not the same states that led in health (northeastern states).33                  But again, the controls

included here are meant to rule out this possibility. Finally, exogeneity tests are performed in the

IV estimation (see next section).

       Overall the results show that the laws did have an impact on educational achievement, and

that their predictive power is large, so they can be used as instruments. Therefore I turn now to

the question of the eﬀect of education on mortality.


4        Health and Education: Econometric model
4.1       Least Squares Estimation

The econometric model for the relationship between education and health can be written as a

linear system of simultaneous equations:


                                        Hi    = X1i β 1 + Ei π1 + ε1i                                            (1)

                                         Ei   = X2i β 2 + Hi π 2 + ε2i ,                                         (2)


       where H i is individual i’s health stock, E is his education level, X 1 is a vector of individual

characteristics that aﬀect health, such as smoking, and genetic factors. X 2 is a vector of individual

characteristics that determine education, such as ability. X 1 and X 2 may contain common factors.
  3 1 The test, inspired by Landes and Solomon (1972), consists of matching individuals to the laws in place in their

state-of-birth when they were 17, 18 and up to 26 years of age, when these laws should no longer have aﬀected
them.
  32   See Goldin and Katz (1997).
  33 Starr’s 1982 book provides anecdotal evidence that the northern states lead in a variety of health aspects.
My own data supports this conclusion. For example, the north had the highest number of doctors per capita
throughout the period. And the number of doctors per capita in the north did not decline from 1915 to 1939 but
did decline in the rest of the country. The north also had the highest declines in infant mortality rates during this
period. (Results available upon request.)


                                                         11
This general specification allows for causality to run from education to health and vice-versa.

The purpose of this paper is to determine only whether or not education aﬀects health (i.e.

π 1 = 0?). Therefore I only estimate the health equation. Although health is unobserved, mortality

is observable. Following Grossman’s model of health (reviewed in his 1999 paper), death occurs

when the stock of health falls bellow a certain threshold. In a less deterministic model, H i is

proportional to the underlying probability (index) of being alive, and death is the observed result.

This is the usual limited-dependent variable set-up.

   This mortality equation can be estimated at the individual level using the NHEFS but not the

census. If individuals could be followed from the 1960 census to the 1970 census (or from 1970 to

1980), then (based on the previous discussion) the following individual linear probability model

could be estimated:


                      Dt,ics = b + Eics π + (Xt−1 )ics β + Wcs δ + γ c + αs + εics ,                 (3)


where Dti is equal to one if the individual is deceased at time t. E ics is i ’s education (measured

by completed years of education), Xt−1 are other individual characteristics measured as of (t-1)

(including gender), Wcs is a set of characteristics of individual i ’s state-of-birth at age 14, γ c is a

set of cohort dummies, αs is a set of state-of-birth dummies, b is an intercept, and ε is the error

term.

   Using the census, individuals cannot be tracked over time, but I can track groups that are

constant over time, and calculate their death rates by aggregating the data. I aggregate by

gender, cohort, and state-of-birth. This aggregation level uses all of the available individual

characteristics that are time invariant (except for education), and therefore it maximizes the

number of observations in the aggregate data. The aggregate model is derived from the individual

model by averaging over individuals in a given gender/cohort/state-of-birth group as follows:


                      Dtgcs = b + E gcs π + (Xt−1 )gcs β + Wcs δ + γ c + αs + εgcs ,                 (4)


where Dtgcs represents the proportion of individuals that died in a given group or the death

                                                   12
rate for that group, and Xt−1 gcs represents the average characteristics of that group at (t-1 ) (for

example, the the percentage of people in that group living in urban areas).34

      Note that I use a linear probability model for the estimation. The existence of negative death

rates makes it impossible to use a non-linear model such as a Logit or Normit. However, since the

dependent variable (the death rate) is not censored below by 0, the linear probability assumption is

less problematic in this case than in general. In this linear model the error term is heteroskedastic

however. A standard estimation procedure35 in this case is to run weighted least squares, where

the weights are constructed using the observed probablities. Again, due to random sampling

and the error it generates, these observed probabilities can be negative, so this estimation is not

possible. In order to address the heteroskedasticity problem I estimate the equation by GLS

(weighted least squares) using the number of individuals in the group as weights. To correct for

further heteroskedasticity, I use White’s estimator.

4.2      Eﬃcient Wald estimates

One obvious solution to correct for the bias in the GLS coeﬃcient is to use Instrumental Variables

(IV). Given that many instruments are available, Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) would be the

preferred estimation method. At the individual level, the 2SLS model is:


                       Dti   = b + Eics π + (Xt−1 )ics β + Wcs δ + γ c + αs + εi

                      Eics   = b + CLcs π + (Xt−1 )ics β + Wcs δ + γ c + αs + εics ,


where D is equal to one if the individual is deceased at time t. E is i ’s education (measured

by completed years of education), Xt−1 are other individual characteristics measured as of (t-1)

(including gender), Wcs is a set of characteristics of individual i ’s state-of-birth at age 14, γ c is a

set of cohort dummies, αs is a set of state-of-birth dummies, b is an intercept, and ε is the error

term, which is assumed to be normal N(0,σ 21 I). CL is the set of compulsory education laws that

                                                   13
serve as instruments to identify the education equation. This model can be estimated using the

individual NHEFS data but not with the census.

   Since the census data can be used only as grouped data, the Wald estimator is an alternative

estimator for the eﬀect of education. Angrist (1991) showed that the Wald estimator for grouped

data is eﬃcient and in fact equivalent to 2SLS using individual level data. In the case of many

explanatory variables the eﬃcient Wald estimator is found by GLS estimation of the following

equation:

                                   Dcrl = E crl π + γ c + δ r + εcrl ,                         (5)

where Dcrl is the death rate for individuals born in cohort c in region r under compulsory law l,

and E csl is the average education of individuals born in cohort c in region r under compulsory

law l. The weights are given by the population in each group. In other words, Wald is estimated

by grouping the data by gender/cohort/region-of-birth and compulsory education law. This pro-

cedure is equivalent to 2SLS at the individual level, where gender, cohort dummies and region

dummies serve as their own instruments (since they are exogenous), and compulsory education

laws serve as instruments for education, the endogenous variable. The estimates are referred to

as the eﬃcient Wald estimates.

   Note that because compulsory education laws are defined at the state-of-birth and cohort level,

I cannot control for both state-of-birth and cohort when using this estimator. This is a drawback

of the Wald estimator, especially if one thinks that state-of-birth and the laws are correlated.

In order to alleviate this problem, I control instead for region-of-birth. But region-of-birth may

not be a good proxy for state-of-birth. Furthermore, other individual (Xt−1 ) and state-of-birth

characteristics (Wcs ) cannot be included in this specification.

4.3    Two-Stage Least Squares with Aggregate Data

Alternatively, I can estimate the 2SLS model at the data that has been aggregated at the state-of-

birth/cohort and gender level. Estimation at the aggregate level results in less eﬃcient estimates



                                                   14
(see Green pp. 433-434) but all the covariates (especially state-of-birth) can be included. Using

the aggregate data 2SLS is obtained by estimating the following model:


                       Dgcs     = b + E gcs π + Xt−1 gcs β + Wcs δ + γ c + αs + εgcs

                       E gcs    = b1 + CLcs π + Xt−1 gcs β + Wcs δ + γ c + αs + εgcs


where now Dtgcs is the proportion of individuals who died in a given gender/cohort and state-of-

birth, E gcs is the average education of that group and (Xt−1 )gcs are other average characteristics.

Again, the weights are given by the number of observations in each cell, and the excluded instru-

ments from the mortality equation are the compulsory education dummies, CLcs . The first stage

(estimation of E gcs ) was shown in the previous section.

4.4      Mixed Two-Stage Least Squares Estimation

The census allows me to estimate the first stage using individual data. The intuition behind

Mixed-2SLS is that it might be possible to take advantage of this fact and gain eﬃciency (relative

to the previous 2SLS) by estimating the first stage at the individual level (as done in the previous

section) and then aggregating the data by gender/cohort/state-of-birth. (See Dhrymes and Lleras-

Muney, 2001.)36 Mixed 2SLS is obtained by estimating the following equation through weighted

least squares:

                                     b gcs π + Xt−1 β + Wcs δ + γ c + αs + εgcs
                          Dgcs = b + E             gcs


      Again Dgcs represents the proportion of individuals who died in a given gender/cohort and

state-of-birth group, X gcs represents the average characteristics of the group, but now I include

b gcs , the average predicted education for that group from the first stage.37
E                                                                                         The weights are

given by the number of observations in each cell. The excluded instruments from the mortality

equation are the compulsory education dummies. The only diﬀerence between standard 2SLS with
  3 6 Dhrymes and Lleras-Muney (2001) compare 2SLS and Mixed 2SLS estimators. The question of which estimator

has lower variance turns out to be data dependent, but it is possible for Mixed 2SLS to be more eﬃcient.
 37   The expression for the first stage was given in the previous section.

      This procedure also results in consistent estimates. As usual the variance-covariance matrix

needs to be corrected.38


5       Results
5.1      Least Squares Results

Although we have good reason to believe that GLS produces biased estimates, I report them here

as the benchmark for comparison with the IV results. Using the census, I estimate the GLS model

described above. The results are in the first column of Table 3. The estimated coeﬃcient of the

eﬀect of education on the death rate is about -0.012. The coeﬃcient is highly significant and is is

robust to the inclusion of more controls.39

      The validity of the aggregation procedure rests on the assumption that the aggregate data can

be understood as coming from unobserved individual data. It is important that this intuition be

confirmed, so I compare aggregate results from the census with those obtained with the NHEFS

individual data. Using individual NHEFS data, I estimate a linear probability model and a probit

model, where the dependent variable is a dummy indicating whether or not the person died

between 1975 and 1985. Then I aggregate the NHEFS data by gender, state-of-birth, and cohort

and again estimate the same linear model estimated with the census data. Because of the small

number of observations in the NHEFS aggregating by gender, state-of-birth and cohort results in

very few observations per cell, so I also reproduce the results only aggregating by state-of-birth

and cohort. The results are shown in Table 3.

   Comparing the results from LS regressions from the census with results from the NHEFS shows

that the census data gives extremely accurate estimates of the eﬀect of education. The census

LS estimates are very similar to those obtained using the NHEFS aggregated data, which in turn

are similar to those obtained at the individual level, using either LS or probit estimations. These

results suggest that sampling (and the measurement error it generates) does not significantly

aﬀect the estimates for education, that there is no aggregation bias and that the linear model is

a good approximation of the education-death rate relationship. The comparison is also useful in

terms of interpretation: a -0.012 coeﬃcient for education means that increasing the education of a

given cell by one year lowers its death rate by 1.2 percentage points. This coeﬃcient also implies

that increasing an individual’s education by one year will lower his probability of dying between

1960 and 1970 (or between 1970 and 1980) by 1.2 percentage points. This latter interpretation is

more intuitive and useful. Note again that the OLS eﬀect is quite large: at the mean, this result

implies that a 10 percent increase in education lowers mortality by about 11 percent, therefore an

elasticity of about -1.

5.2     IV results

The first column in Table 4 presents the 2SLS results using the NHEFS. This estimation is done

at the individual level and using standard 2SLS. The estimate is positive (the eﬀect of education

is about -0.02) but not significant: because this sample is small, the first stage estimation40 is

poor. Nonetheless, although the standard errors are high, the estimates from this sample are also

larger than the GLS estimates obtained from the same data.

   The second column shows the results from the Wald estimation. The Wald estimate of the eﬀect

the 10% level, and the set of dummies was jointly insignificant.



                                                      17
of education is about -0.037 and significant at the 5 percent level. The third column presents the

results of 2SLS estimation using aggregated data at the gender/state-of-birth-and cohort level. The

eﬀect of education is about -0.045 and significant at the 10 percent level. The Mixed 2SLS results

(last column) show that the coeﬃcient on education is approximately -0.059 and is significant at

the 5 percent level. All of the previous estimates are significant at the 5% level using a one-tailed

test (that the eﬀect is negative) which is perhaps more appropriate in this set-up.41 Overall the

results suggest that increasing education by one additional year lowers the 10-year death rate by

at least 3.6 percentage points.42

       For the last two estimators I perform a test of overidentifying restrictions. The χ2 statistic

for the aggregate 2SLS model is 2.42 and 1.49 for the Mixed 2SLS model. This statistic tests

the hypothesis that the model is well specified. It is calculated as the sample size times the R2

from a regression of the residuals from the second stage on all exogenous variables, including the

instruments. In both cases the overidentifying restrictions are not rejected at a 5 percent level

(critical value 14.06). This test in conjunction with earlier results from the first stage suggests

that compulsory education laws are legitimate instruments.

       Additional checks are presented in Table 5. As a last attempt to address the potential endo-

geneity of the laws, I repeat the estimations above using a larger set of instruments that include

quarter of birth, compulsory attendance and child labor laws, and the interactions of quarter

of birth and the laws. Presumably these individual-level instruments will increase the eﬃciency

of the estimates, and they are perhaps less likely to be endogenous.43                       The results (Panel A)

are identical to those presented above. The results are also very similar if only the interactions

between the laws and quarter of birth are used as instruments, and quarter of birth as well as
  41   I thank Michael Grossman for this insight.
  42   Estimates by region are comparable in size to those presented here except that they are generally not significant.
  43 Note however that the use of these instruments might be questionable (see papers in footnote 10). Also
Lleras-Muney (2001) shows for example that the laws aﬀected whites but not blacks. However quarter of birth
does appear to aﬀect blacks’ educational attainment. This again raises the issue of whether quarter of birth has an
independent eﬀect on education unrelated to compulsory attendance laws.




                                                            18
compulsory schooling laws are included as controls in both the first and second stage.44         This

again suggests that the instruments are not endogenous.

      Panel B presents the reduced form estimates, i.e. the direct eﬀect of the laws on mortality. The

results are consistent with previous estimations: if the eﬀect of childcom on education is about 5

percent, and the eﬀect of education on mortality is about 6 percent, then the direct eﬀect of the

laws on mortality should be about 0.3 percent, which is approximately what the reduced form

result shows.

      Panel C shows the results excluding ages 40, 50 and 60 since the data showed evidence of age

heaping. This is a potential problem if age heaping is correlated with education. The IV results

are very similar to the previous results. Finally in Panel D I repeat the estimations by region

of birth. They are quantitatively identical to all the results presented before. So the previous

estimates are not purely based on diﬀerences between regions.

      Since, it is well known that there exist persistent diﬀerences in mortality rates by gender I

reproduce results by gender in Table 6. The coeﬃcient on education is somewhat smaller for

females than for males, confirming the findings in the literature that the eﬀect of education is

larger for males. These results also suggest that World Wars I and II did not results in significant

selection bias for men. Also, in these estimations the eﬀect of marriage is negative as the literature

suggest, whereas the eﬀect is positive in the joint estimations. This is a composition eﬀect: males

are both more likely die and to be married.

5.3      Discussion


This section has presented four diﬀerent estimates of the eﬀect of education on mortality. Three

diﬀerent estimators, using two diﬀerent data sets and three diﬀerent levels of aggregation, were

used. Although each estimate has weaknesses, all estimates point to the same conclusion: the

eﬀect of education is causal and in fact larger than OLS suggests. Given this variety of estimates,
 44   Results available upon request.



                                                   19
this result is very robust. The result is surprising for two reasons. The first is that the IV estimates

are larger than the LS estimates. The second is that the eﬀect of education is quite large. In this

section I discuss these two issues.

5.3.1    Larger IV estimates


In all the IV estimations presented here, the eﬀect of education is much larger than the LS

estimates suggest. The Mixed 2SLS estimates suggest the eﬀect is as large as -0.058, whereas

Wald estimates imply a coeﬃcient of about -0.036. At first, this could seem to be a surprising

result: the a priori expectation was that LS estimates would be too large. However there are two

important points to notice.

    First note that the standard errors in the IV estimates are large. Even though the IV estimates

are significantly diﬀerent from 0, it is unclear whether they are statistically diﬀerent from the OLS

estimates. To test whether the IV and OLS estimates are diﬀerent, one can perform a Durbin-

Wu-Hausman test. The F-statistic for this test is 1.51 (p-value 0.22). Therefore I cannot reject

the null hypothesis that OLS and IV are the same.

    Note that an implication of this test is that education is in fact exogenous, since it suggests

that the IV estimates are no diﬀerent from the OLS estimates in a statistical sense. From this

test, I conclude that education appears to have a large causal eﬀect on mortality. Furthermore, I

conclude that the larger IV estimates are not of particular concern.

    However, if one still thought that education was endogenous, then the most plausible expla-

nation for the diﬀerence between the IV and the OLS estimates in this case is related to the

choice of instrument.45 Under the assumption that diﬀerent individuals face diﬀerent returns to

education due to unobserved characteristics, IV estimates reflect the marginal rate of return of the
  4 5 Another explanation is that the omitted variable bias is smaller than the bias that results from measurement

error in education (Card 1995) The health literature has not been concerned with this potential problem although
there is evidence of measurement error in education . If the measurement error is random, then IV estimate will
be larger than the OLS estimate. Larger IV returns can also be explained if there exist health externalities from
education for example if average education aﬀects individual health. However note that the fact that individual
and agregate estimations using the NHEFS result in similar eﬀects for education suggests that externalities are not
the main reason for larger IV.




                                                        20
group aﬀected by the instrument (Angrist, Imbens and Rubin, 1996), in this case IV capture the

returns to those aﬀected by the compulsory schooling laws. If I estimate a regression of mortality

as a function of education and education squared, where both are instrumented with compulsory

schooling laws, I do indeed find some evidence that the relationship is convex. However I do

not place too much weight on these results given that a) under the hypothesis that education is

endogenous, the instruments can only identify a non-linear relation for those aﬀected by the laws,

rather than for the population at large, and b) education does not appear to be endogenous!

5.3.2   What is the eﬀect of education on health?


The second issue is that the eﬀect of education is quite large, and it is important to understand

why. I categorize the potential eﬀects of education into two categories: direct and indirect eﬀects.

   Among the direct eﬀect, education provides individuals with critical thinking skills that are

useful in the production of health (Grossman’s hypothesis). There is some evidence to this eﬀect.

For example, Goldman and Smith (2001) find that the more educated are more likely to comply

with treatments for diabetes and Aids. Goldman and Lakdawalla (2001) suggest that the more

educated are better able to manage chronic conditions. These two papers suggest that education

matters when treatments are complex and there is scope for learning by doing. These mechanisms

have also been documented by Rosenzweig and Schultz (1989), who compared success rates of

diﬀerent contraception methods for women with diﬀerent levels of education: they find that success

rates are identical for all women for “easy” methods such as the pill, but the rhythm method is

only eﬀective for educated women.

   If this is the case, then the interaction of education with a variety of factors might be rele-

vant. For example, although access to information alone cannot explain health diﬀerences across

education groups (Kenkel, 1991), information available to the more educated will result in greater

benefits for them if they can use the information better. For example when analyzing the eﬀects

of the 1964 Surgeon General Report, Meara (2001) concluded that “the response to knowledge



                                                21
plays a more important role than knowledge itself in creating diﬀerential health behavior”.

      Another possibility is that the more educated might be more likely to adopt and use new

medical technologies.46      Since the rate of medical innovation dramatically increased in the last

century, especially for particular diseases such as heart disease (Cutler et al. 1998), it is reasonable

to think that the more educated were able to capture very high returns during this period. Lleras-

Muney and Lichtenberg (2001) for example show that the more educated are more likely to use

newer drugs.

      There are a few indirect mechanisms through which education might aﬀect health which are

also consistent with the results in this paper. One obvious one is that being in the classroom is

less of a health risk than working, especially while growing up. I cannot with my data distinguish

the eﬀect from not working from that of being in school.

      Also note that education gives you access to a higher income and diﬀerent types of jobs, both

of which aﬀect health. For example, only high school graduates in the first half of the century

had access to white collar jobs, which provided healthier work environments than manufacturing

or agriculture. Controlling for income (or occupation) does not change the results in this paper

(results are presented in Table 7). But, since income is endogenous, it is not possible (given that

I have no instruments for income) to distinguish the direct eﬀect of education on health from

its indirect eﬀect through income. The same is true for occupation. However, Grossman (1975)

showed that the eﬀects of income on health disappear once a certain level of income has been

reached, while the same is not true for education. Furthermore, standard results suggest that the

returns to education are about 10% and that the elasticity of mortality with respect to income is

about -0.3.47 If the sole eﬀect of education is through income, one more year of education should

decrease mortality by 0.003 (for average mortality of 0.11),48 which is a much smaller eﬀect than

what was estimated here. With respect to occupation, I simply note here that since the eﬀect of

education is similar for men and women, it would appear that occupation is not the only channel

through which education aﬀects health.

      Finally note that the cognitive psychology literature has documented that lack of education is

correlated with stress, depression and hostility, all of which have been shown to adversely aﬀect

health (Adler et al, 1994).

      A final comment is that the results in this paper do not imply that time preferences do not

aﬀect health and education choices nor that there is no reverse causality from health to education.

They simply show that there is a causal eﬀect of education on health, and that this eﬀect is not

due to time preferences. However, as Becker and Mulligan (1997) argue, education could lower

the discount rate, making people more patient. This is yet another indirect mechanism that could

explain my results.


6       Conclusion

This paper has shown that there is a large causal eﬀect of education on mortality. While GLS

estimates suggest that an additional year of education lowers the probability of dying in the next

10 years by approximately 1.3 percentage points, my results from the IV estimation show that

the eﬀect is perhaps much larger: at least 3.6 percentage points. However it is worth noting

that the OLS and the IV estimates are not statistically diﬀerent. Nonetheless the eﬀects are
 48   The calculation is done as follows: Deaton and Paxson (1999) estimate that
                                                   d
                                           log(       ) = −0.3 log(inc)
                                                  1−d
    Studies in labor have found that
                                                  log(inc) = 0.1ed
    so by replacing I find that:
                                                      d
                                              log(       ) = −0.03ed
                                                     1−d
    the marginal eﬀect is given by
                                               ∂d
                                                   = −0.03d(1 − d)
                                              ∂ed
Evaluated at the mean (i.e for d=0.11) this eﬀect is about -0.003

large. To better understand the impact of education, I calculate how this eﬀect translates into life

expectancy gains. I find that in 1960, one more year of education increased life expectancy at age

35 by as much as 1.7 years (using the OLS estimate). This is a very large increase.

   A few notes of caution on how to interpret these results for public policy purposes are neces-

sary. First, in order to make policy recommendations, we need to know more about the specific

mechanisms by which education aﬀects health. This paper analyzes the eﬀects of increasing ed-

ucation from relatively low initial levels. It is unclear what the eﬀects would be at higher initial

levels of education. The average education level for white Americans born in 1901 was at most

8.87 years.49    Today many developing countries, including most Latin American countries, have

average levels of education that are similar. This paper implies that more aggressive education

policies could dramatically increase adult longevity in such countries. But cost benefit analysis of

such policies are extremely complex, since for example we do not know what the cost of increasing

education would be, or its eﬀectiveness. Questions such as these are beyond the scope of this

paper. But the results presented here suggests that the benefits of education are large enough

that we need to consider education policies more seriously as a means to increase health, especially

in light of the fact that other factors, such as expenditures on health, have not been proven to be

very eﬀective.

   This evidence that education increases life expectancy implies that the returns to education,

measured only in terms of earnings increases, substantially underestimate the true returns to

education. In view of the large magnitude of the eﬀect of education on health, it is clear that more

attention needs to be devoted to the pathways of influence. Existing models of the relationship

between education and health are very imprecise about the mechanisms through which education

operates on health.
  4 9 This is the average education level of that cohort in 1960. Data for the entire population in 1901 does not

exist for the US, but the average was probably much lower.

Note: Figures 1 and 2 follow the same cohorts from the 1960 census up to the 1980 census.
In Figure 1 we can observe that that 10-year mortality increases with age: for older cohorts the number
of individuals observed in 1980 is much smaller than in 1960 or 1970.
In figure 2 we can see that the average level of education is higher in 1980 than in 1960 for all cohorts,
suggesting that those who died in each cohort had bellow average levels of education.
Figure 3: Calculating Death Rates with the Census




                                               The 1960 and 1970 census are 1/100 random
                                               samples of the population, therefore the number
                                               of individuals in any given group is always
                                               observed with error. Because of this sampling
                                               error the death rates for any given group are over-
                                               estimated 50% of the time and underestimated
                                               50% of the time. However, since the sampling is
                                               truly random, the observed death rates are
                                               consistent estimates of the true death rates.




Figure 3B: An example for a young cohort: 0 death rate



                                               If the true death rate is 0 then I observe 50%
                                               negative death rates. As cohorts age, the death
                                               rate increases (see example above) the number
                                               of negative death rates falls.
