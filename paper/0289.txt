    Probably no event in monetary history has been more studied than the
German hyperinflation of the early 1920's. Economists have been attracted
to study this episode since it provides an environment that is close to a
controlled experiment which is so rare in the study of social sciences.
    This paper provides further evidence on the role of expectations in
effecting the demand for money during the German hyperinflation. One of the
difficulties in studying empirically the role of expectations is the lack of an
observable variable measuring expectations. This paper examines three measures
of expectations that are derived from observed data from the market for foreign
exchange. The first measure is based on the hypothesis that the forward
exchange rate measures the expected future spot exchange rate and thereby
provides an observable measure of the market's expectations concerning the
depreciation of the currency. The other two measures distinguish between the
forward exchange rate   and the expected exchange rate and are based on the
supplementary   hypothesis that rational behavior requires expectations to be
unbiased. Accordingly, the measures of expectations are constructed by using
the forward exchange rate along with the information on the systematic
relationship between forward and spot exchange rates. The various measures
are then used in estimating the demand for money.
    The emphasis on measures of expectations that are based on data from
the foreign exchange markets reflects the belief that in an inflationary
economy with flexible exchange rates one of the relevant substitutes for holding
domestic money is foreign exchange.

Introduction

          One   of   the difficulties in studying empirically the role of expec-

tations is the lack of an observable variable measuring expectations. In

two earlier papers dealing with the German hyperinflation of 1921—1923, I

suggested the use of data from the foreign exchange market to measure

expectations [Frenkel (1976, 1977)]. Specifically, in estimating the

demand for money,           I   used the forward exchange rate as a measure of

the expected future value of the currency. An examination of the relation-

ship between the forward and the spot exchange rates revealed that during

that period the forward exchange rate seems to have underpredicted the

future spot exchange rate. In Frenkel (1977) I indicated that this

phenomenon need not be inconsistent with the rational expectations hypothesis

which requires that individuals use efficiently all available information.

Thus, one could expect that due to the lack of previous experience with hyper—

infaltion, while individuals learn the new structure, mistakes would be

made and expectations would therefore initially underpredict the actual

course of events [see Taylor (1975)]. Indeed, other evidence for the 1920's

on the   Franc/Pound, the Dollar/Pound and the Franc/Dollar exchange rates
suggest that during a "normal" period, the forward exchange rate seems to
have been an     unbiased forecast of the future spot exchange rate [see Frenkel

(1978),   Frenkel and Clements (1978), and Krugman (1977)].
          In this paper I examine the implications of      an alternative hypothesis

concerning      the measure of expectations. According to the alternative hypothesis,
since' expectations      are unobservable, the expected exchange rate is assumed


                                           1
                                    2

to be an unbiased forecast of the future value of the spot exchange rate.

The analysis draws on the conceptual distinction between the forward

exchange rate and the expected future exchange rate. The relationship

between these two rates is examined in Section I, which also contains

estimates of the expected exchange rate. These estimates are then used

to compute a time series of the expected rate of depreciation of the

currency. Section II contains estimates of the demand for money, using

the forward premium on foreign exchange and the expected rate of depreciation

of the currency as alternative measures of expectations. Section III contains

estimates based on an alternative estimation procedure with concluding remarks
in Section IV.
I. The Forward Exchange Rate and
   the Expected Exchange Rate

        In computing the expected exchange rate we first examine the relation-

ship between the spot and the forward exchange rates by regressing the

logarithm of the current spot exchange rate, in S, on the logarithm of

the one—month forward exchange rate prevailing at the previous month, in Fri.


(1)     in S = a + b in Ft_i +


If the forward exchange rate is an unbiased forecast of the future spot

exchange rate, the constant term in equation (1) should not differ signif i—

cantly from zero and the slope coefficient should not differ significantly

from unity.1 Efficiency of the foreign exchange market requires that the

residuals from the estimated regression be serially uncorrelated. Equation

        11n principle, one could use in equation (1) the levels of the
exchange rates rather than their logarithms.   During the German hyper—
inflation, however, a regression using the levels of the exchange rates is
completely dominated by the last few observations due to the rapid accelera-
tion of the depreciation of the Mark. Data on the spot and forward rates
are from Einzig (1937). For an analysis of the efficiency of the foreign exchange
market and for extensive references to studies on the German hyperinflation see
Frenkel (1977).

 (1) was estimated over the period February 1921—August 1923, using monthly

data on the Mark—Pound Sterling exchange rate. The length of the period

was determined by the availability of data on the forward exchange rate.

The resulting ordinary—least—squares estimates are given in equation (2)

with standard errors in parentheses below the coefficients.

                (.253) (.029)

        R2 = .98; s.e. = .456; D.W. = 1.89

As may be seen, the Durbin—Watson statistic indicates that the residuals

are not serially correlated but that the slope coefficient is somewhat

above unity (at the 95 percent confidence level). Furthermore, the joint

hypothesis that the constant term is zero and that the slope coefficient

is unity is rejected at the 95 percent confidence level and thus, the

forward rate seems to underpredict the future spot exchange rate.'

        If the relationship between forward and spot exchange rates is

stable (as in equation (2)), it may be reasonable to assume that individuals,

in forming expectations, will use the forward rate along with the knowledge

of the relationship between forward and spot exchange rates that is described

in equation (2). Thus, using the OLS estimates of equation (2), the expected

future exchange rate for period t (as of period t—l), may be computed as:


(3)     E1 Ln S (OLS) = —.454 + 1.095 P.n Fe,.


The series of expectations computed in equation (3) combines the use of

the forward exchange rate wLth the assumption that the relationship between

        1Strictly speaking, if the forward rate is an unbiased forecast of the
future spot rate, the constant term should equal —.     rather than zero. To
see this, rewrite equation (1) as: S = exp{a + u }Fb . Equating the mathe-
matical expectation of both sides yields E(S )= exp{a +—a }E(Fb      ); unbiasedness

requires that E(S)= E(F1) and thus implying that a =          and b = 1. The
hypothesis concerning the constant term cannot be r1ected by the estimates of
equation (2) but the joint hypothesis that a = —.5a'. and that b = 1 is rejected.

forward and spot exchange rates is part of the available information set that

is used by individuals. These expectations are (by construction) unbiased

forecasts of the future spot exchange rate.'

        The computation of the series of expectations is subject to a

conceptual difficulty since the estimates in equation (2) are based on

data pertaining to the entire period (February 1921—August 1923). Thus,

it contains information that was not available prior to the end of the

period. The assumption underlying this procedure, however, is that the

estimates in equation (2) are stable and do not depend on the choice of the

period. To examine the validity of this assumption I divided the sample into

two parts: "moderatet' hyperinflation and "severe" hyperinflation where the

latter period pertains to the last nine months of the inflationary process.

A Chow test was performed on the estimates of equation (2) to test for

equality of the coefficients between the two sub—periods' regressions.

This test implies that (at the 95 percent confidence level) one cannot

reject the hypothesis that the regression coefficients do not differ between

the two sub—periods.2 Thus, the data indicate that during that period, the

        'For recent applications of the rational expectations hypothesis to
the analysis of the German hyperinflation see Sargent and Wallace (1973) and
Sargent (1977). The distinction between the forward exchange rate and the
expected future spot exchange rate has been analyzed recently theoretically
and empirically using the framework of portfolio theory. See for example,
Bilson and Levich (1977), Fama and Farber (1977), Kouri (1976) and Stockman
(1978). Generally speaking, this distinction does not seem to be of great
quantitative importance; however, it might have been somewhat more important
during the hyperinflation.
        2The F—statistic for the Chow test corresponding to the null hypothesis
that the regression coefficients are the same for both sub—periods is 2.17 while
the critical values for F(2, 26) are 5.5.3 and 3.37 at the 99 and 95 percent
confidence levels, respectively. In addition to the Chow test the dummy vari-
ables method was employed according to which the constant and the slope coeffi-
cients were allowed to differ between the two sub—periods by including dummy
variables for the "severe" hyperinflation period. None of the dummy variables
was significantly different from zero at the 95 percent confidence level, indi-
cating that one cannot reject the hypothesis that the structure has remained
stable. To explore further the relationship between the two sub—periods I have
used the parameter estimates from the first sub—period to predict the exchange

relationship between spot and forward exchange rates has remained stable

throughout the inflationary process and therefore, the conceptual difficulty

mentioned above does not seem to be too serious.

        It might be noted, however, that the residuals from the estimated

regression in equation (2) show some degree of heteroskedasticity. Therefore,

to obtain more efficient parameter estimates, equation (1) was reestimated

by weighting the data from the two sub—periods by the inverse of the

estimated standard errors of the regressions corresponding to the two sub—

periods. The resulting weighted least squares (WLS) estimates are reported
                 1
in equation (4):

                   (.805) (.035)
        R2 =    .97;   D.W. =   1.84

Using these WLS estimates, the expected future exchange rate for period t

(as of period t—1), may be computed as


(5)     E1 Lu S KWLS) = —.659 + 1.066 Ln Ft_i.

       Equations (3) and (5) yield two time series of expectations concerning

the future exchange rate. Using these series one may compute two series of

rate during the second sub—period. The correlation coefficient between the
series of predictions and actual outcomes is .95. In addition, Theil's L961)
inequality coefficient is extremely low (.027) of which the fraction due to
the bias is only 8 percent.
        1When the residuals are heteroskedastic, the Chow test for equality
of sets of coefficients in two regressions needs to be modified. Following
the procedure suggested by Toyoda (1974) it was verified that, at the 95
percent confidence level, one cannot reject the hypothesis that the relation-
ship between the spot and the forward exchange rates has remained stable
throughout the two sub—periods. For a recent discussion of Toyoda's approx-
imations see Schmidt and Sickles (1977).

These three measures are based on information that is available as of period t—1.

In the following section these variables are used as proxies for expectations in

estimating the demand for money.

II. Estimates of the Demand for Money

        All    standard   theories of the demand for money predict that the demand

depends on the expected cost of holding money. To the extent that money is

held as a substitute for securities, the relevant cost is the rate of interest;

to the extent that money is held as a substitute for ownership of goods, the

relevant cost is the expected rate of inflation, while if domestic money is

held as a substitute for foreign money, the relevant cost is the expected

change in the exchange rate. As         a   practical matter, however, incorporating

the three margins in an empirical estimation of the demand may be quite

difficult since the three measures of cost would be highly colinear in

situations in which the purchasing power parity theory and the interest parity

theory hold.

        'Some aspects of the interrelationship between w* and            are examined
in the Appendix.
                                                    7

        In Frenkel (1977)                   I estimated the demand for money using the

forward premium on foreign exchange (r*) as a measure of the expected cost.

In a recent, interesting paper, Abel, Dornbusch, Huizinga and Marcus (1979)

estimated the demand as a function of both margins of substitution——the

expected change in the exchange rate (proxied by the forward premium on

foreign exchange) and the expected rate of inflation (proxied by the actual

rate of inflation). They have shown that both measures of cost are signifi-

cant and that the coefficient of the expected change in the exchange rate

is about three times the size of the coefficient of the expected inflation.

In this section I compare the estimates obtained by using ir* with those

obtained by using        and r2 as measures of the expected cost. Real balances

are defined in terms of the cost of living index and the estimation is

performed for two functional forms: the double—logarithmic and the semi—

logarithmic as in equations (6)—(7):

                                      v
with analogous equations for                and            The resulting estimates for the

        1For an analysis of the functional form see Frenkel (1977) where it
is also shown that the appropriate price deflator is the cost of living index
rather than the wholesale price index. Since during the earlier part of the
hyperinflation the forward premium on foreign exchange was negative (reaching
—.8 percent per month in early 1921),      I transformed the data on the
forward premium and on the expected depreciation by adding one percent per
month so as to permit an analysis of the double—logarithmic fuxctional form.
This transformation was not sufficient to make it2 positive, and therefore, it2
is only used in the semi—logarithmic functional form. Data on money and
prices are from Graham (1930) and Tinbergen (1934). It may be noted that,
for the semi—logarithmic regressions, the transformation only affects the
constant term. In Table 1, the OLS results for rr* reproduce the corresponding
estimates from Frenkel (1977). Those estimates are not identical to the
estimates in Abel et al (1979) due to a somewhat different method of inter-
polations, and due to a somewhat different choice of timing. In equations
(6)—(7) the demand for money at period t                  is
                                            assumed to depend on the forward
premium as of period t,    i.e.,
                              on rr =
                                                        2n(F/S);
                                    8

ordinary least squares and for the two stage least squares procedures are

reported in Table 1. These results indicate that for the double—logarithmic

functional form, the elasticity of the demand with respect to the expected

cost of holding money is higher when expectations are measured by r1 rather

than irk. In both cases the two stage least squares estimation yields very

similar estimates to those obtained by the OLS procedure, and in both cases,

the estimated elasticities are close to the predictions of the various

models of transactions and precautionary demand for money. For the semi—

logarithmic functional form, the OLS estimates of the semi—elasticity are

somewhat higher than the corresponding 2SLS estimates. For both estimation

procedures, however, the estimate of the semi—elasticity is somewhat higher

when expectations are measured by the forward premium rr* rather than by the

two alternative measures.

        When we allow for a distinction between short run and long run demand

for money, the various measures of expectations yield somewhat different

estimates of the speed of adjustment. Consider for example a partial adjust-

ment model, according to which the percentage rate of attaining the long

run level of real balances is proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of

the desired level to the actual quantity. The proportionality factor (denoted

by y) measures the speed of adjustment. The various parameters and the

speed of adjustment may be estimated by including a lagged value of real

balances in the estimated regression of the demand for money. Table 2 reports

the results of estimating the demand function with the lagged dependent variable
the corresponding specification in Abel et al (1979) is that (after December,
1921) the demand at period t depends on        £n(F1/S1). Since data
on money balances are monthly averages, both specifications are reasonable
approximations. However, the choice of timing does affect the results. As
indicated by Abel et al (1979) when one uses    rather than       only the
coefficient of the forward premium is significant while that of the expected
inflation is not.

for the two functional forms using the three measures of expectations.

Also reported in Table 2 are the estimates of the long run elasticities and

the mean lag of adjustment. As can be seen, the relationships between the

various elasticities are similar to those reported in Table 1. The lagged

dependent variable,, however, is much less significant when expectations are

measured by ira.   or   2 rather than by the forward premium r*. Again, the estimates

obtained by the OLS procedure are very similar to those obtained by the

2SLS procedure. The OLS estimates imply that wh.ei expectations

are measured by ir*, the implied speeds of adjustment are .58 for the double—

logarithmic functional form and .57 for the semi—logarithmic form. When

expectations are measured by ir1 the corresponding estimates are .75 and 87

respectively where the latter does not differ significantly from unity.

Likewise, when expectations are measured by 2 the implied speed of adjustment

is .82 which does not differ significantly from unity. These estimates imply

that when expectations are measured in terms of i*,      the   time it takes to

complete 90 percent of the stock adjustment is about 2.6 months for the

double—logarithmic functional form and about 2.7 months for the semi—logarithmic

form. In contrast, when expectations are measured in terms of
                                                                     ii,

ponding estimates are about 1.6 and 1.2 months respectively. Simiarly, when

they are measured by         the corresponding estimate is about 1.4 months. It

can be concluded that while the various measures of expectations yield

somewhat different estimates of the adjustment coefficients, all indicate

a relatively high speed of adjustment.


III. A Simultaneous Estimation of Expectations
     and the Demand for Money

          The   analysis in the previous sections followed a two—step procedure by
which expectations were estimated in the first step and were then incorporated
                                        12

in the second step. into the estimation of the demand for money. The efficiency

of the estimates can be increased by a joint estimation procedure. Further—

more,tl-ie hypotheses that expectations are unbiased and that the relevant measure of

the cost of holding money can be derived from the relationship between forward and

spot exchange rates, impose some testable restrictions on the estimated parameters.

In what follows I estimate the model simultaneously and test whether the data are

compatible with the restrictions that are implied by the model. The analysis will

concentrate on the semi—logarithmic functional form.

            The demand for money is specified by equation (8) and the expected depre-

ciation of the currency for the period between t and t+l (as of t) is specified

by equation (9):


(8)         in() =   e   +    + v

(9)         it
             t
               =E
                t
                  inS
                    t+l
                        —inS.
                            t


From equation (1) the relationship between spot and forward ratesis


(10)        in S1 = a    + bin Ft + u


and thus:


            Et inS t+l =a+b2,nF.
                               t


Substituting into (9) yields


(11)
               = a + bin Ft —   in S,

and substituting into (8) yields equation (12) as the demand for money.


(12)

                                    13

The complete model is suunnarized by equations (10) and (12) which comprise the

system of two equations incorporating the restrictions that are implied by the

analytical framework; that is, the coefficients a and b appear in both equations

in a specific way. Thus, estimating equations (10) and (12) simultaneously (by

a nonlinear method) provide efficient estimates of the parameters and also permits

testing whether the cross—equations restrictions are consistent with the data.

         The resulting full information maximum likelihood estimates of the relevant

parameters are: a = —.901 (.232), b = 1.151 (.027), and a    —.933 (.177) where

asymptotic standard errors are in parentheses following the estimates.1   As may

be seen, the estimated values of the various parameters are very similar to those

obtained by the two—step procedure. In order to test whether the data are compatible

with the restrictions, the model was also estimated in an unrestricted fashion and

the likelihood ratio test was performed. The difference between the logarithm of

the maximum likelihood function of the restricted and the unrestricted model is

—2.041 and thus, minus twice the difference is 4.082. According to the. null

hypothesis, minus twice the difference of the logarithmic likelihood between the

null and the alternative hypothesis is distributed x2 with one degree of freedom

corresponding to the number of restrictions. The null hypothesis that the data

are compatible with the restrictions cannot be rejected at the .975 percent confidence

level for which the critical value of x2(1) is 5.024; it is however rejected at the

.95 percent confidence level for which the corresponding critical value is 3.84l.2


         1The estimation exployed i C. R. Wymer's RESIMUL computer program which
provides full information maximum likelihood parameter estimates of a system subject
to nonlinear constraints. The last t used in the estimation was August, 1923.
         21n addition to imposing the cross—equation restrictions on the relationship
between the parameters a and b across equations (10) and (12), the model was also
estimated with the added restriction that a = 0 and b = 1. Likewise, the model was
also estimated with the restriction that the error term in equation (12) follows
a first—order autoregressive process. The various parameter estimates were not
affected materially but the joint restrictions, based on the likelihood ratio test,
were rejected.

              Probably no event in monetary history has been more studied than the

  German hyperinflation. Economists have been attracted to study this episode

  since it provides an environment that is close to a controlled experiment

  which is so rare in the study of social sciences. The rise in the velocity
 of circulation when inflation accelerates     was    recorded by Lehfeldt (1922)
 and    was     rationalized in terms of expectations.1 The role of expectations

 in affecting the demand for money during the German hyperinflatIon has been

analyzed in numerous studies following Cagan's (1956) classic contribution.

The major difficulty, however, has been the lack of an observable variable

measuring expectations.

         In this paper I have examined three measures of expectations that

were derived from observed data from the market for foreign exchange. The

first, which I         used in Frenkel (1977), is based on the hypothesis that

the forward exchange rate measures the expected future spot exchange rate.

Accordingly, the relationship between forward and future spot exchange rates

indicates whether or not expectations are biased. The other two measures

distinguish between the forward exchange rate and the expected future rate,

and are based on the supplementary hypothesis that rational behavior requires

expectations to be unbiased. Accordingly, the measures of expectations are

constructed by using the forward exchange rate along with the information

on the systematic relationship between forward and future spot exchange rates.




          11t is interesting to note that in explaining the rapid rise in
  prices Lehfeldt used the rational expectations argument according to which
  current prices depend on current and on expected future money supply.

       "Instead of the value of P [the price level] depending only on the values
       of Q [the money supply] at the moment, they are affected by anticipation
       of what Q is likely to become; affected, of course, thrQugh the mechanism
       of speculative purchases and sales." (Lehfeldt, 1922, p. 559).
                                   15


These three measures were then used in estimating the demand for money during

the German hyperinflation. It    was    shown that the resulting estimates,

while differing in details from each other, do not lead to fundamentally

different inferences concerning the properties of the demand for money.

        The emphasis on the various measures of expectations that are based

on data from the foreign exchange market reflects the belief that in an

inflationary economy with flexible exchange rates one of the important

substitutes for holdings of domestic currency is foreign exchange. To the

extent that domestic money is held as a substitute for foreign exchange, the

specification of the demand for money should include the anticipated change

in the exchange rate.

                                APPENDIX

           THE FORWARD PREMIUM, THE EXPECTED DEPRECIATION AND

               THE RATE OF INFLATION: TEST OF "CAUSALITY"

        In this Appendix, I examine the interdependence between the rate of

inflation and two of the meausres of expectations that were used in the paper.

It is shown that the two measures 71* and   differ significantly in

terms of their relationships with the rate of inflation. To examire     the
direction of "causality" (in the sense of Granger) between the measures of

expectations and the rate of inflation, I have employed Sims' "causality"

test and have calculated two—sided distributed lag regressions. To test the

hypothesis that there is no feedback from current inflation to future

expectations, the current rate of inflation is regressed on past and on

current and future expectations. Sizable and significant coefficients on

future expectations lead to a rejection of the null hypothesis and permit

the inference that inflation "causes" expectations in the Granger sense.

To test the reverse hypothesis, that there is no feedback from current

expectations to future rates of inflation, a similar procedure is followed

with the reverse distributed lag.

        The results of these tests are reported in Tables A—i and A—2 which

contain for each measure of expectations two regressions: one which includes

future values of the independent variable and one which does not. Also reported

are the F—statistics relevant for testing the hypothesis that the coefficients

of the future values of the independent variables are zero. The results in

Table A—i suggest that when expectations are measured in terms of the forward

premium 71*,   the null hypothesis that inflation does not "cause" expectations

must be rejected since the F—statistic is 5.17, well above the critical

value of 3.24 (at the 95 percent confidence level). When expectations are

measured in terms of it1,   the   null hypothesis cannot be rejected since the

F—statistic is 2.76, which falls below the critical value of 3.24. On the

other hand, the results in Table A—2 indicate that when expectations are

measured in terms of ,r*, one cannot reject the hypothesis (at the 95 percent

confidence level) of no feedback from current expectations to future rates

of inflation since the F—statistic is 3.00. When, however, expectations are

measured in terms of itt,   the   resulting F—statistic is 3.78 which leads to

a rejection of the null hypothesis (at the 95 percent confidence level).

        The foregoing analysis illustrates the significant difference between

the two alternative measures of expectations by highlighting the inter-

relationships between these measures and the rate of inflation. As was

indicated in the text, however, when these measures are used as proxieB for

the expected cost of holding money, they do not yield fundamentally different

inferences concerning the characteristics of the demand for money during the

hyperinflat ion.
