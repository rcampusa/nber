                                       ABSTRACT

A well-being approach requires looking beyond COVID-19 deaths to compare the performance
of elimination versus mitigation strategies as measured by other important supports for well-
being. What do the data show? Our comparison based on 2020 data shows a virus elimination
strategy to be more successful than other options, whether measured in terms of COVID-19
deaths, overall excess deaths, income, unemployment, trust, or mental and physical health.
Countries that chose and followed a strategy of reducing community transmission to zero and
keeping it there saved lives and better protected income and employment, all without obvious
costs to either the social fabric or the mental health of their populations.

Introduction
How well have different societies managed to preserve the quality of life under COVID-19? Can
well-being research help to explain which local and national strategies have been most
successful? It is too soon for a definitive judgment, but important to scan the emerging evidence
to help guide nations around the world managing the virus and its successors for years to come.
For this assembly of evidence, we focus our analysis on a comparison between two quite
different national strategies for facing the pandemic, based primarily on data covering the whole
of 2020. One group of nations, which we call Eliminators, includes about 10% of countries,
representing more than 25% of the world's population. They adopted a strategy early in 2020 to
suppress community transmission to zero, and to keep it there. The second group, whom we call
Mitigators, contains most national governments. Countries in this group adopted a variety of
strategies, ranging from initial denial to early attempts to `flatten the curve', in order to preserve
the capacity of health care systems to deal with the sick while attempting also to limit the effects
of lockdown and other non-pharmaceutical interventions on a whole range of supports for
happier lives, including social connections, family life, education and the economy. We shall use
`mitigation' to describe the general strategy of dealing with COVID-19 by some route other than
elimination of community transmission, since the generally expressed aim of countries which
chose mitigation over elimination was to find some middle ground that avoided over-loading
health care systems, limited the direct health toll of the pandemic, and kept the economy and
society as open as feasible within those constraints. Although our analysis will mainly compare
the results of the elimination strategy to all others, we shall also consider alternative approaches
within the larger suppression+mitigation group of countries.


Our analyses show that Eliminators experienced lower death rates from COVID-19. But to what
extent were these reductions in COVID-19 deaths obtained at the expense of other aspects of
economic and social life, and of the mental and physical health of the general population? To
answer this question, we shall compare various aspects of life in the two groups of countries.
How should the two groups of countries be defined? In our later analysis based on 154 countries,
we find that proximity to SARS deaths and membership in the WHO Western Pacific Region
(WHOWPR) were both instrumental in the choice of a virus suppression strategy. Our main
analysis will split countries using WHOWPR membership as the way to divide countries


                                                   1
between the elimination and mitigation groups. We have two reasons for using WHOWPR
membership as a proxy variable to capture countries committed to virus elimination. The first is
that WHOWPR countries had, via their SARS exposure and subsequent policy discussions
designed to develop pandemic responses, 1 privileged access to the most helpful scientific
information. The second reason, adopted to increase the credibility of our results, is that we
want to use some selection criterion that is not determined by actual cases and deaths due to
COVID-19. We do not wish to tilt the scales in favour of elimination by simply selecting
countries with low death rates. We shall also test the robustness of our conclusions to the use of
alternative definitions of membership in the virus elimination group, and test our findings
separately for the industrial countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). We shall also consider differences in COVID-19 success, as measured by
direct and total excess deaths, among countries and groups of countries within the large number
of countries in the mitigation group. Within the OECD country group, we pay special attention to
the Nordic countries, which, with the exception of Sweden, achieved much lower death rates
than elsewhere in Western Europe.


The well-being approach we adopt in this paper requires us to look beyond COVID-19 deaths to
compare the performance of elimination versus mitigation strategies as measured by other
important supports for well-being. The World Happiness Reports emphasize the happiness-
supporting roles of healthy life expectancy, friends and family, freedom, trust, income, and
generosity. COVID-19 and the efforts required to deal with it threatened health, income, and
possibly freedom and social connections, while drawing on generosity, support from family and
friends, and especially social and institutional trust, to improve and share quality of life.


What do the data show? First there has been a surprisingly wide-spread resilience of life
evaluations in the face of deep and uncertain threats to lives and livelihoods. Second, a
comparison based on 2020 data shows the virus-suppression strategy to be more successful,
whether measured in terms of COVID-19 deaths, overall excess deaths, income, unemployment,
trust, or mental and physical health. 2 Eliminators saved lives, better protected the economy and
jobs, all without obvious costs to mental health and well-being.

Background


Evidence was forthcoming early in the pandemic that COVID-19 was marked by high
transmissibility in its pre-symptomatic phase, 3 transmission by asymptomatic carriers, 4 and
transmission channels in which aerosols play a key role. 5 These features, which together
counselled widespread testing as the only feasible means to find and eliminate community
transmission, were not taken into account in early policy advice, both from the WHO and in most
western countries. Policy advice within the WHO and in most western countries instead focussed
on strategies that assumed primary transmission was via droplets (hence the two metre physical
separation rule, and early recommendations against mask-wearing 6) and on surfaces (hence the
emphasis on hand-washing and cleaning) 7 and, most importantly, implicitly assumed that
transmission was entirely via symptomatic carriers (hence the advice to provide testing only for
those with symptoms, or with infected close contacts). Assuming that asymptomatic and pre-
symptomatic transmission could be ignored led to under-emphasis on the role of testing, while
assuming the insignificance of aerosol transmission led to ignoring the importance of masks and
exaggerating the value of physical distancing and clean surfaces.


The combination of aerosol transmission and the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers made
COVID-19 a particularly stealthy virus. However, the early genetic sequencing of the virus led to
the possibility of testing for the virus in its various forms with reasonable speed and high
accuracy, thus rendering feasible a strategy to identify and target outbreaks, to isolate those
infected, and hence to eliminate community transmission.


Both the stealth of the virus and the scope for testing and targeting to remove it from community
transmission were recognized first in countries in the Asia-Pacific region, leading them to be
predominant among the countries adopting a virus elimination strategy. Thus, our first
comparison of international differences in direct and indirect COVID-19 deaths is on a regional
basis. We shall then turn later to a country-based analysis to help understand why some countries
adopted differing strategies and achieved better or worse results in terms of several variables
important for well-being.




                                                  3
We start by comparing direct and indirect COVID-19 death rates in 2020, based on the 72
countries for which all-cause death rates for 2020 are currently available. For our subsequent
comparisons of economic and social outcomes, and for our analysis of death rate differences, we
are able to use samples up to 150 or more countries.


Comparing direct COVID-19 deaths with overall excess death rates for 2020
Since COVID-19 has affected all aspects of life, there has been a natural interest in using total
excess mortality rather than directly attributed COVID-19 deaths as an overall indicator of the
mortality consequences of COVID-19. 8 Total excess deaths could exceed direct deaths for
several reasons. Direct deaths could be under-counted, lock-downs or shortages or overstretched
hospitals 9 could lead to other conditions being under-treated, or the disruptions to society 10 could
increase suicides 11 or other so-called deaths of despair. Total excess deaths could be less than
direct COVID deaths if policies used to limit transmission of COVID-19 reduced the death toll
from seasonal flu, pneumonia, 12 and other communicable diseases, or if the slower pace of
economic activity reduced deaths from traffic fatalities or air pollution. 13 Those who argued for
less attention to stopping deaths from COVID-19 in order to save deaths from other causes
presumed that excess deaths might be larger than direct deaths in the countries that did most to
reduce direct deaths.


Hence it is necessary to look at both direct COVID-19 fatalities and total excess deaths if there is
a convincing overall case to be made that virus elimination was the better way to protect public
health and well-being. Figures 1 to 3 compare the experience of countries in the Asia Pacific and
in Western Europe. This is a useful comparison because most countries with a virus elimination
strategy are in the Asia Pacific region, a reflection of policy choices that are likely have been
influenced by the region's SARS experience and memberships in the Western Pacific Region of
the World Health Organization (WHOWPR). Countries in Western Europe, on the other hand,
tended to adopt mitigation or suppression strategies. The countries of Western Europe are
themselves divided into three groups. The Nordic countries are singled out for special attention
within Europe for several reasons. First, they are all in the top echelon of global life evaluation
rankings, supported by levels of social and institutional trust that are also among the highest in
the world. It has been shown that countries with high institutional trust are more likely to accept


                                                  4
public health guidelines, and are more likely to look out for each other where social trust is
higher. Sweden is singled out among the Nordic countries because it shares the same high levels
of social and institutional trust, but public health officials in Sweden chose, 14 with the support of
government, to adopt a mitigation strategy, while their Nordic neighbours chose instead to target
a much greater degree of virus suppression.


The data shown in Figures 1 to 3 are drawn from the 72 countries for which comparable data are
available for direct COVID-19 deaths and all-cause excess mortality covering the whole of 2020.
The recorded COVID-19 death rates in 2020 per 100,000 population were retrieved from
https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data on January 18, 2021, while the all-cause mortality
data are from Karlinsky & Kobak (2021).The biggest difference between this sample, whose size
is restricted by the availability of excess death statistics, and our later global analysis is that
excess death statistics are almost absent for Africa. 15 There is much fuller coverage of the
industrial countries, and of two main regions ­ North Atlantic and Asia-Pacific ­ that have had
very different COVID-19 strategies. Figure 1 shows the consequences for the Asia Pacific region
and Western Europe of their very different strategies, with elimination being the norm in the
Asia Pacific region and some combination of periodic suppression and mitigation being the norm
in Western Europe. Recorded COVID-19 deaths and total excess deaths are both far higher in
Western Europe than in the Asia Pacific region. For the nine Asia Pacific countries 16 with
available excess death data, the average direct COVID-19 death rate is almost exactly 1 per
100,000 people, while the overall excess death rate was 11.5 per 100,000. For the 20 countries of
Western Europe as a whole, the recorded COVID-19 deaths in 2020 average 65.5 per 100,000,
and the overall excess death rate for 2020 was 92.7 per 100,000. Within Western Europe,
Sweden can be seen to have a COVID-19 direct death rate slightly higher than in non-Nordic
Europe (86 compared to 78), and overall excess deaths significantly lower (89 compared to 111).
Within the Nordic countries, despite their shared high levels of social and institutional trust, the
different strategies have very large consequences for COVID-19 and total excess deaths.
COVID-19 deaths in 2020 averaged 86 in Sweden compared to 12 per 100,000 in the other four
Nordic countries, while total excess deaths were 89 in Sweden compared to 23 per 100,000 in the
other four Nordic countries.

Figure 2 presents the same data for Latin America, the United States, the United Kingdom, and
Italy. The data for the Nordic countries excluding Sweden are repeated to show the change in
scale required to include these countries and regions. Once again, the data show that countries
that were not able or willing to limit COVID-19 direct fatalities had non-COVID excess deaths
that were sometimes as large again as recorded deaths from COVID-19. For the ten Latin
American countries 17 for which excess deaths are available, the average rate of COVID-19 direct
deaths was 80 per 100,000, while for total excess deaths it was 160 per 100,000.

Figure 3 shows the difference in both COVID-19 and all-cause fatalities between Sweden and
the other Nordic countries to illustrate that the choice of strategies makes a large difference to
health outcomes, even among countries that shared the same disease exposure, high quality
health care systems, and high levels of citizen trust of each other and of their institutions.

                                                  7
One of the reasons for using excess deaths to supplement recorded COVID-19 deaths is that
countries differ in how to allocate deaths where there are comorbidities and other conditions that
might have been expected to lead to death. Low estimates of COVID-19 deaths are also likely
where many deaths occur outside the hospital system, and where the health care system is
overloaded already. Low testing rates will also limit the number of those known to be infected,
and whose deaths would therefore be naturally attributed to COVID-19. At one end of this
spectrum of possibilities probably lies Sweden, where COVID-19 is taken to be the cause of
death anytime that COVID-19 was present, even if the death was likely due to other causes. At
the other end of the spectrum would lie countries with poor record-keeping, inadequate hospital
systems, and perhaps not anxious to know or reveal the full extent of the disease and its
consequences. We attempt in Table 1 to test the nature of the relationship between directly
estimated COVID-19 deaths and total excess deaths, of which they naturally form a part, since
there were no COVID-19 deaths recorded in the base years 2017-2019. We find a coefficient of
1.48 for the direct deaths, showing that directly attributed COVID-19 deaths are, for the average
country, almost one-third less than the total number of excess all-cause deaths in 2020. This


                                                8
implies that, for most countries, the total number of deaths due to COVID-19 is almost 50%
higher than the recorded number for direct COVID-19 deaths. The ratio of excess deaths to
directly recorded deaths varies a lot between countries, being below 1.0 for those countries 18
where the measures taken to slow the pandemic also reduced deaths from some other causes, and
where health systems were not over-stretched to give timely treatment to other conditions. To
estimate possible under-recording of COVID-19 deaths, we include a measure of government
accountability, one of the six components 19 of the World Bank's quality of government
indicators. This variable attracts a highly significant and sizeable coefficient, such that increasing
accountability by one-quarter of its range across the 72 countries is associated with a reduction
of excess deaths, of more than 25 per 100,000.

Having used the smaller sample of 72 countries to establish that the life-saving benefits of a
COVID-19 elimination strategy are about 50% higher when the analysis is couched in terms of
excess deaths, our further analysis makes uses of the largest global samples available to assess
the effects of alternative COVID-19 strategies on other key variables supporting well-being.


Other determinants of well-being

Here we shall consider income and employment, trust, inequality, physical and mental health,
social support, freedom, and prosocial activity. In almost all cases we find that countries which
have been most successful at avoiding direct COVID-19 deaths have done as well or better on
these other key supports for well-being.




                                                   9
Income and employment

Most countries pursuing a mitigation strategy feared that lockdowns would lead to losses in
income and employment. Meanwhile, countries who adopted an elimination strategy believed
that that the temporary closures were necessary for removing community transmission of
COVID-19, and thereby improve both income and employment in the longer run. The available
evidence supports the latter view.


Table 2 shows that countries which kept COVID-19 deaths in 2020 low were also able to achieve
higher levels of economic activity in 2020. The sample of 148 countries is the largest for which
direct COVID-19 deaths and estimates of 2020 GDP are available. Recent updates to the GDP
estimates for 2020 have made the relationship even stronger 20 than it was shown to be in World
Happiness Report 2021. As shown in Table 2, each drop of 10 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000
population is associated with 2020 GDP 0.5% higher.


Some previous well-being evaluations 21 of alternative COVID-19 policies focused on the choice
of a best date for ending lock-downs, and making use of the key assumption that an earlier end to
the lock-down would cost lives but increase GDP. This is analogous to macroeconomic analysis
assessing how alternative fiscal policies might face a Phillips curve trade-off between inflation
and unemployment. In Table 2 we are in essence estimating whether alternative COVID-19
strategies faced a similar trade-off between fatalities and GDP growth.

The correlation suggests that eliminator countries faced no such trade-off, since they were



                                                      10
able to achieve their much lower death rates while also doing better in terms of income and
employment. If we look at the average estimated 2020 and forecast 2021 GDP growth rates
for the two groups of countries, average declines in GDP from 2019 to 2020 were 1.45% in
the WHOWPR countries, compared to 3.4% in the mitigation countries. A similar growth
advantage for the elimination strategy continues into 2021, where GDP growth is
forecasted by the World Bank to average 4.7% in the virus elimination group and 2.9% in
the mitigation countries.


Virus elimination had similar benefits for employment. The unemployment rate equation in
Table 3 shows that countries adopting a COVID-19 elimination strategy in 2020 had
unemployment rates that were lower than elsewhere by an average of 5%. The equation
also shows that the higher growth rates documented in Table 2 had further impacts on the
unemployment rate, as did differences in COVID-19 death rates. Our aim here is to see
whether countries choosing mitigation instead of elimination were able to achieve higher
income and employment that might in well-being terms have helped to offset the extra loss
of life implied by a mitigation strategy. The evidence in Table 3 confirms that there was no
such trade-off for either income or unemployment. Eliminators had employment outcomes
even better than implied by their higher GDP.

Trust
Interpersonal and institutional trust have long been shown to support subjective well-being and
facilitate effective community response 22 to crises of many sorts, including earthquakes, 23



                                                   11
storms, tsunamis, 24 financial collapse, and COVID-19. 25 Thus, it is to be expected that high trust
levels should have facilitated effective responses to COVID-19, as we shall show subsequently
to be the case. In this section we ask whether confidence in national governments increased or
decreased differentially for countries which adopted elimination or mitigation strategies 26.


Figure 4 shows that confidence in the national government (Gallup WP139) rose on average
from 2019 to 2020 in both elimination and mitigation groups. However, the increase in
confidence was much larger in in the elimination countries (from 49.1% to 53.9%) than in the
mitigation countries, as represented here by WHOWPR membership (from 47.4% to 49.0%).

Inequality




                                                 12
It has been shown elsewhere 27 that people are happier living in countries where well-being
inequality is less. To what extent has well-being inequality been increased under COVID-19?
It has been argued that those already in better circumstances have been favoured even more
under COVID-19, while those is less favoured groups have borne the brunt of the well-being
losses. This would lead us to expect greater inequality of well-being outcomes. The Gallup
World Poll samples are not able to capture the well-being losses of those in elder care, hospitals,
living on the streets or in prisons. Subject to that important qualification, the data in Figure 5,
which are based on Gallup World Poll data for 112 countries with surveys held in both years
show that the distribution of life evaluations over the 11-point response has not only the same
mean but also the same distribution in 2019 and 2020. We have also confirmed that this was
equally the case for various country groups we consider in this and later sections.


                                              Figure 5
               Distribution of life evaluations did not change from 2019 to 2020




                                                  13
As between men and women, the distributions are also very similar, with women having a 2020
average life evaluation 0.13 above men, and having 2.1 percentage points more responses in the
8 to 10 range, and 1.6 percentage points fewer in the 0 to 3 range. If we compare life evaluations
in 2017-2019 with those in 2020 for the 114 countries with surveys in 2020 and in one of the
years 2017-19, the average was unchanged, at 5.75. There was a slight but significant increase in
the elimination countries, (+.066, p==.04) and an insignificant reduction in the other countries (-
.009, p=0.52).


Figure 6 sets the stage for the rest of this section by comparing the average values for the
changes from 2019 to 2020 for the variables to be considered below. The vertical lines passing
through the eliminator values are the 95% confidence intervals for each estimate. The confidence
regions for the elimination countries are on average twice as great as for the mitigation countries,
reflecting the much smaller sample size. Both groups of countries show increases in confidence
in government, more so in the case of eliminators as we have seen earlier. The two groups also
saw reductions in reports of health problems and physical pain, increases in worry stress and
sadness, and smaller changes otherwise, except for the helping of strangers, where the increase
was large. We will have more detailed comparison between eliminators and mitigators in the
remainder of the section. But it is worthwhile to summarize here that the directions of
movements are almost always the same for the two groups. There is no obvious evidence that
eliminator countries fared much worse than mitigators, despite the sometimes stricter policies
used to achieve the elimination objective.

Physical and mental health


For general physical health there is in the Gallup World Poll a question asking whether or not a
respondent has health problems, with yes or no being the available answers. For the global
sample as a whole, the percentage of the population reporting a health problem fell from 24.6%
to 21.6%, with the drop being smaller in the elimination countries (from 21.9% to 19.9%) than in
the mitigation countries (from 24.9% to 21.8%). 28 The results for reported prevalence of physical
pain the previous day show a similar pattern, falling by slightly less in the elimination countries
(down from 22.6% to 21.1%) than in the mitigation countries (down from 33.4% to 31.5%). All
of these changes are likely to be related to the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community, with


                                                 15
other possible health problems seeming less worth mentioning where COVID-19 cases and
deaths are greater. The prevalence of physical taxing jobs may have been reduced in all
countries, presumably moreso in the mitigation countries, given their larger reductions in
employment. There are also likely to be changes from 2019 to 2020 in the incidence of non-
COVID illnesses (such as the seasonal flu) and in the extent to which other health problems,
including cancers and mental illness, were diagnosed and treated. The consequences of delayed
diagnosis and treatment are likely to be more evident in 2021 and beyond.


What about emotions? Here the results differ by emotion. 29 In general, as was true for the
slightly smaller global samples used in World Happiness Report 2021, negative emotions
increased under COVID-19. The prevalence of worry increased in both groups of countries, up
from 31.9% to 36.0% in the virus elimination countries, and from 39.9% to 43.0% in the
mitigation countries. Stress went up more in the virus elimination countries (from 33.2% to
37.1%) than in the other countries (36.9% to 38.9%), while sadness went up by about the same
amount in the elimination countries (18.7% to 21.8%) as in the mitigation countries (24.8% to
27.7%). The prevalence of feelings of anger on the previous day remained the same in the
elimination countries (18.5 %) while rising in the mitigation countries (20.1% to 20.8%). This
result for anger may be related to what was found earlier for confidence in government, which
rose significantly in the elimination countries and less so elsewhere.


Positive emotions, which are generally two to three times as prevalent as negative ones, fared
slightly better in the mitigation countries. Laughter, usually more prevalent in the elimination
countries, fell by the same amount (from 79.8% to 78.0%) as in the mitigation countries (73.6%
to 72.8%). Enjoyment fell in the elimination countries (from 76.3% to 74.8%) while being
maintained in the mitigation countries (rising insignificantly, from 69.4% to 69.6%).


Social Support
The primary social support variable used in the World Happiness Reports to gauge personal
social support is whether the respondent has someone to count on in times of trouble. This fell in
both groups of countries, by more in the elimination countries (from 85.3% to 82.8%) than in the
mitigation countries (from 83.5% to 82.5%).



                                                16
Freedom to choose what one does with one's life
This also is measured on a yes/no basis, and fell in the elimination countries (from 85.9% to
85.3%). In the mitigation countries, it remained substantially unchanged (rising from 79.6% to
79.8%).


Prosocial Activity
There are three Gallup World Poll questions, asking, yes or no, if the individual engaged in pro-
social acts during the previous month. The question is asked separately for making a donation,
volunteering, and helping a stranger. The frequency of donations rose slightly more in the
elimination countries (from 32.9% to 34.8%) than in the mitigation countries (from 29.5% to
31.0%). Volunteering was unchanged in the elimination countries (at 19.4%) and nearly
unchanged (from 18.6% to 18.8%) in the mitigation countries.


The biggest change was in the frequency of helping strangers, up by about 6% in both groups of
countries, starting from a higher base in the mitigation countries. For the elimination countries,
the increase was from 39.8% to 45.5%, while for the mitigation countries the frequency of
positive responses rose from 50.4% to 56.0%. There is also evidence of increased helping of
neighbours during COVID-19 (Zetterberg et al. 2021). Willingness to help others in a time of
emergency has been documented earlier in cases of fires and accidents, and no doubt increases
the subjective well-being of helpers and helped alike, as illustrated by previous research showing
that people are far happier if they believe that their lost wallet would be returned if found by
neighbours, strangers, or police (Helliwell et al. 2018).


Testing alternative country groupings


One test of the robustness of our findings is to see if they apply when the comparison group of
countries is restricted to include countries with somewhat comparable capacities to deal with a
health crisis. Because of their criteria for admitting new members, the OECD countries all have
democratic political structures, relatively high levels of income and education, and are
committed to providing open and trustworthy governance. To match earlier work 30 that



                                                 17
compared the performance of eliminators and mitigators within the OECD, we treat Iceland as an
eliminator country. Within the OECD group shown in Figure 7, the eliminator group thus
includes Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Iceland. The four eliminator countries
had average COVID-19 death rates in 2020 of 3.5 per 100,000 people, compared to 70.1 for the
rest of the 34 OECD countries. Total excess deaths were 16.1 per 100,000 in the four OECD
eliminator countries, compared to 115.2 in the 28 other OECD countries with available data on
excess deaths. Confidence in the national government grew from 2019 to 2020 in both groups of
OECD countries, most of which were surveyed in the first half of 2020. The increase was greater
in the non-elimination countries. The reported frequency of health problems fell most in the non-
elimination countries. For worry, sadness, anger, laughter and enjoyment the eliminator countries
fared better than the rest, while donations were higher and volunteering and helping strangers
less frequent in the eliminators.

Sources as in Figure 6.
Within the non-OECD countries shown in Figure 7B, we would have added Bhutan and Rwanda
as committed eliminators, but they do not have the required Gallup World Poll data for 2019 and
2020. Within the 129 non-OECD countries, the COVID-9 death rate in 2020 was 0.9 in the 13
elimination countries, compared to 24.8 for the other countries. For the more limited number of
non-OECD countries where excess deaths data are available, they averaged 11.0 for the 6
eliminators compared to 139.4 for the 34 other countries. Confidence in government fared better
in the elimination countries, while emotions fared worse. Many of the non-OECD countries,
especially the 41 in sub-Saharan Africa, had favourable age distributions and low exposure, and
an average 2020 death rate of only 4.4 per 100,000. The global result of more help to strangers is
mostly evident in the non-OECD countries, almost equally evident in both the elimination and
other countries.

Summary of well-being outcomes beyond direct and indirect deaths from COVID-19
In this section we have looked for evidence that the lower COVID-19 death rates in the
elimination group of countries were not offset by worse performance in other aspects of life. For
income and employment, which were often used in mitigation countries as reasons to open their
economies before community transmission of the virus had been fully eliminated, the evidence
seems clear that there was no trade-off between virus elimination and economic activity. Indeed,
actual 2020 and expected 2021 economic growth were higher in the elimination than in the
mitigation countries. Furthermore, unemployment rates in 2020 were lower where COVID-19
death rates were lower and real GDP higher.


Confidence in government rose on average from 2019 to 2020 in both groups of countries, by
twice as much in the elimination countries as in the mitigation countries. For most other supports
for well-being, the changes were of roughly the same size and direction in both groups of
counties. Non-COVID-19 physical health was reported to be better by respondents in both
groups of countries. Negative emotions were more prevalent in 2020 in both groups of countries,
and positive emotions slightly less prevalent. Among prosocial activities, the biggest change was
in the frequency of helping strangers, which increased by about 6% in both groups of countries.


The lack of significant well-being harms from the COVID-19 elimination strategy, combined
with its greater effectiveness at preventing deaths, strongly suggests an overall well-being
advantage for the elimination strategy. Most mitigation strategy countries chose to re-open
before community transmission was eliminated, thereby inviting second and third waves of
infection that were in many if not most countries worse than the first wave. Furthermore, the
resulting widespread community prevalence of the virus provided an effective petri dish for the
creation of new variants that were more transmissible, thereby substantially increasing the global
costs of failing to eliminate the virus.


Given our findings, and the availability early in 2020, if not before, of evidence showing the
advantages of virus suppression, it remains a puzzle why so many countries were slow to



                                                20
recognize the necessity of fast and widespread testing to find and suppress a virus that was being
spread silently by aerosol transmission from pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers. As a
first step in answering this puzzle, we turn in the next section to see what can be done to explain
differences among countries in their choice and application of COVID-19 strategies.


What helped countries find and choose an effective COVID-19 strategy?



Here we shift our focus from a binary comparison of country groupings to a more general
analysis using 2020 data from 154 countries to help explain the choice of alternative COVID-19
strategies, where success is measured by COVID-19 death rates in 2020 per 100,000 population.
Our modelling accounts for about two-thirds of the international differences in 2020 COVID-19
death rates using eight variables, three relating primarily to differences in risk factors, and five to
the likelihood of a country choosing and successfully applying policies to reduce COVID-19
death rates.



The three risk factors relate to geography, demography, and early virus exposure. The purely
geographic variable is an indicator variable taking the value 1.0 for each of the 14 island nations,
and zero elsewhere. 31 COVID-19 deaths per capita in 2020 were on average half as great in the
island nations as in other countries. In the multivariate equation, the partial effect of being an
island nation is 15.4 deaths per 100,000 population in 2020.


The demographic variable is an age adjustment index based on the interaction of each country's
population age profile with age-specific COVID-19 mortality rates drawn from US experience in
2020. The authors refer to this adjustment as `indirect' because it uses the age-specific mortality
experience of the United States as a proxy variable in other countries without available age-
specific COVID-19 mortality data. They produce age-adjusted mortality rates for each country,
which we convert to a pure mortality risk index by removing each country's own COVID-19
mortality experience. The resulting age adjustment shows the extent to which each country's
differential age distribution affects its risk of COVID-19 mortality. We use the age adjustment
index in the form where higher values denote younger populations, and hence lower expected


                                                  21
mortality. The ratio takes the value of 1.0 in the United States, since its population structure is
the one used as the basis for comparison. Countries whose age structures imply greater risk from
COVID-19--older populations such as in Europe and East Asia--have factors less than 1.0.
Countries with younger populations have age adjustment ratios greater than 1, with the extreme
being six African countries with factors above 6.0. COVID-19 death rates in 2020 averaged 55
per 100,000 population for the 70 countries where the age-adjustment is less than 2.0 compared
to 12.5 for the 93 countries with higher ratios. In the Table 4 equation, an increase of 1.0 in the
age adjustment index is associated with a reduction of 10 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000. 32


The exposure variable is more complicated. It uses a gravity approach to measure each country's
exposure to cumulative cases in each other country on March 31, 2020. The exposure variable
divides the number of cases in each other country by the distance 33 between the capitals of the
two countries, and then sums across other countries to get a weighted exposure index for each
country, entering the equation in log form, as usual in previous applications of the gravity model
in epidemics, 34 trade, 35 migration, 36 and knowledge transfer. 37 The exposure index in log form
covers a range from 0.4 to 5.3, being over 4.0 in 8 countries, all of which are in Europe. By
continent, it is lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, where it averages 0.85. COVID-19 death rates in
2020 averaged 18.6 per 100,000 in countries with exposure values below 2.0 compared to 66.5
per 100,000 in the 43 countries with exposure values above 2.0. In the multivariate equation
shown in Table 4, an increase of 1.0 in the log of the exposure index is estimated to increase
COVID-19 deaths by about 16 per 100,000.


Of the three risk variables, the geographic and demographic variables reflect conditions over
which government strategies had no control, while the exposure variable reflects primarily the
fact that governments in Europe did not adopt an elimination strategy. For individual European
countries to adopt such a strategy was for most rendered more difficult by the Schengen
agreement providing formality-free population movements among the member countries.


Turning to the variables that help to explain the choice of a death-reducing policy strategy, the
first is an indicator variable taking the value of 1.0 for each of the 23 countries with female
leaders. 38 Of these 23 leaders, 3 were in the elimination group of countries. COVID-19 death



                                                 22
rates averaged 20 per 100,000 in the countries with female leaders, compared to 32 in other
countries. When added to the equation in Table 4, having a female leader is associated with a
COVID-19 death rate that is lower by 20 per 100,000.


The next variable captures membership in the WHOWPR group of countries that we have used
already to define the group of governments committed to an elimination strategy. COVID-19
deaths per 100,000 in 2020 averaged 1.5 in the WHOWPR compared to 33.4 per 100,00 in the
149 other countries with matching death data. A related variable is the average log distance
between each country and the six countries with the highest death tolls in the SARS epidemic of
2003. Five of those countries are also among the members of the WHOWPR group. SARS
experience was an important source of learning about the need for rapid response, and the perils
of underestimating its transmissibility. The WHOWPR provided an important forum for
collecting the lessons learned, and preparing procedures to facilitate virus elimination. 39 Because
these two variables are quite highly correlated (r=+.55) their separate coefficients in the equation
are not highly significant. Together, they provide a highly significant measure of the possible
spread of scientific knowledge that would aid the choice of an elimination strategy. A variable
that simply subtracts the WHOWPR indicator from the SARS distance variable, as suggested by
the equality of their separately estimated coefficients, attracts a highly significant coefficient of
11.5 (p=.009).


The next variable is a measure of institutional trust based on Gallup World Poll questions
relating to confidence in the national government, the judicial system, local police, elections, and
the absence of corruption in business. 40 Based on surveys from 2017 through 2019, the index has
an average value of 0.422 in the elimination countries, and 0.307 elsewhere. The difference
between these two averages is estimated in the equation to correspond to a difference in COVID-
19 death rates of 5 per 100,000 people.


Income inequality has previously been found to be associated with worse health status, 41 and is
negatively correlated with social trust, 42 which itself has been shown to improve disaster
responses. 43 Since we do not have a direct measure of social trust for this large sample of
countries, we use the gini index of income inequality to reflect the difficulties of achieving co-



                                                  23
operative outcomes during the pandemic, plus any direct health impacts of income inequality.
The gini index has the same average value in the elimination and mitigation countries, so its
impact shows up in explaining death rate differences within the mitigation group, which covers a
large range of death rates. The gini index of income inequality averages 26 in the Nordic
countries and 47.5 in the United States, a difference associated (using the coefficient of 0. 964 in
Table 4) with Nordic per capita death rates from COVID-19 to be lower than those in the United
States by 20.7 per 100,000 people.

*** p<.01, ** p<.05, * p<.1. Death rate refers to the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths reported per
100,000 people as of December 31, 2020. One country's early exposure to infections in other countries (on
Mar 31, 2020) is the sum of all other countries' cumulative infections on March 31, 2020, weighted by the
inverse of the bilateral distance of their capital cities. The bilateral distances are taken from the GeoDist
Database provided by CEPII (http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/presentation.asp?id=6). WHOWPR
refers to the membership in the WHO Western Pacific Region.



Taken together, the eight variables used in Table 4 explain about two-thirds of the differences in
COVID-19 death rates among 154 countries. We have gone partway to understanding what
factors have helped or hindered national policy strategies to deal with COVID-19. Ours is not the
only analysis to suggest that virus elimination produced better health and economic outcomes. 44
We broaden the range of countries, use a fuller set of well-being criteria, and show the early
availability of evidence that we think was sufficient to give a scientific basis for preferring the
elimination strategy even before the consequences of the mitigation were starting to unfold.

Conclusions and Qualifications
Given the breadth and consistency of the evidence favouring an elimination strategy, it remains
something of a puzzle as to why the elimination strategy was not more widely adopted before the
first wave, or even in time to prevent large-scale second and third waves, and the widespread
community transmission that has fed the development of more dangerous variants of the virus.
One possible reason might be widespread tendency, even for chess masters 45, to stick with
established solutions even when the available evidence suggests a fresh and broader look. There
was also some evidence of localism at work, with countries comparing their policies and
outcomes to those of their nearby neighbours rather than paying more attention to better
examples located farther away. Some dismissed the favourable experiences of New Zealand and
Iceland to being islands easy to defend from imported infections. Our analysis suggests that it
does help to be on an island, but the favourable performance of the Nordic countries (excluding
Sweden) within continental Europe shows that high levels of virus suppression and control were
feasible even with close proximity to major pools of infection. The Bhutan 46 and Rwandan 47
examples also show that determined policies can deliver near-elimination, while many of the
elimination countries have shown the efficacy of using mass testing, tracking, and isolation to
stop subsequent imported infections from spreading more widely. Overall, our well-being
analysis strongly supports the elimination over the mitigation strategy.


What are the main qualifications to our analysis? First, we limit ourselves to COVID-19
experience in 2020, since it permits ready matching with other data, even if for many countries
there were second and third waves in progress that were larger and more damaging than the first.
Early evidence from 2021 seems to confirm and even increase the relative advantages of
elimination. For example, cumulative death rates to the end of 2020 average 1.5 per 100,000 in
the eliminator countries compared to 33.4 in the mitigation countries. By the end of May 2021,
the gap had widened further, as by then cumulative COVID-19 deaths were 4.3 per 100,000 in
the eliminator countries compared to 69.3 in all other countries.


Second, the survey sample coverage does not include some of the groups likely to have been
most harmed by COVID-19, including those living in hospitals, elder care, prisons and other
institutional settings, and younger school-age children. If we were able to consider these groups



                                                25
more explicitly, the well-being preference for the elimination strategy would likely be even
larger.


Finally, although we presented evidence that most of the supports for subjective well-being in
2020 were maintained at higher levels in the elimination countries, there is only a modest echo of
this in the changes in the life evaluations reported in 2020. The 2021 round of the Gallup World
Poll should provide more definitive evidence on this and other elements of the comparison, as
more of the delayed consequences for mental health, physical health, social connections and the
economy will have become evident.


These qualifications all tend to confirm rather than cast doubt on the conclusions we were able to
draw from the evidence currently available. Our basic conclusion is that the absence of
significant well-being harms from the COVID-19 elimination strategy, combined with its greater
effectiveness at preventing deaths while supporting income and employment, strongly suggests
an overall well-being advantage for the elimination strategy. Thus, although there is always more
to learn, we believe that our tentative conclusions are likely to continue to hold as history
unfolds.

   Tanaka et al. (2021) find suicides in Japan significantly down in the early months of the 2020, and then higher in
the period July through September, especially among women (Nomura et al. 2020), although still at rates
significantly below those of men. More generally, Pirkis et al, (2021) use data from 21 countries to show most
countries to have had lower suicide rates during the pandemic, with 12 being significantly lower and none
significantly higher.

   All 20 of the countries in Western Europe have data for both series, while in sub-Saharan Africa excess death data
are available for only 1 country of the 49 included in our fuller analysis of COVID-19 death rates.

   The measure used is `voice and accountability' or vae for short. Its components include a number of indicators of
the quality of government accounts. The data and definitions are available from the World Bank at

   The principal change is to Guyana, which was earlier projected to have a 53% growth rate in 2020, a number that
has since been adjusted down to 23%. Such extreme changes in growth rates of GDP are not unknown for Guyana,
which has a population of less than 1 million, and bauxite production and exports that vary considerably in volume
and price. In such cases, GDP is not a suitable measure of either national of especially household income.

   With sample sizes of 118,000 in 2019 and 105,000 in 2020, these differences are highly significant, as the 95%
range for these estimates is of the order of 0.005 on the zero to 1 scale.

   As is shown in the online appendix 2 to chapter 2 of World Happiness Report 2021, the equation shown in Table 4
alters very little if median age is used as a simpler alternative to adjustment combining age-specific mortality risks
with our combination of age and gender specific mortality estimate rates with each country's actual population
profile. If we use the inverse of our age adjustment variable as an alternative, it worsens the overall fit of the
equation without materially changing the other coefficients of interest.

   Oliu-Barton et al. (2021) compare the elimination and mitigation approaches using two groups of OECD
countries. Their elimination group adds Iceland to those OECD countries already in our elimination group (New
Zealand, Australia, Japan, South Korea), and also see advantages for elimination over mitigations for both health
and economic outcomes. Iceland is part of our group of high-performing Nordic countries.
