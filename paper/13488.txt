                                              ABSTRACT

We consider two compelling research questions raised by the increased prevalence of overweight among
adolescents. First, what factors explain variation in adolescent bodyweight and the likelihood of being
overweight? Next, do overweight adolescents incur greater health care expenditures compared to those
of normal weight? We address the former question by examining the contribution of individual characteristics,
economic factors, parental and family attributes, and neighborhood characteristics to variation in these
bodyweight outcomes. For the second question, we estimate a two-part, generalized linear model of
health spending. Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, our econometric analyses
indicate that adolescent bodyweight and the likelihood of being overweight are strongly associated
with parental bodyweight, parental education, parental smoking behavior, and neighborhood attributes
such as the availability of fresh food markets and convenience/snack food outlets, and neighborhood
safety and material deprivation. Our expenditure model indicates that overweight females have annual
expenditures that exceed those of normal weight by nearly $800 with part of the disparity explained
by differences in mental health expenditures. We use both sets of empirical results to draw implications
for policies to address adolescent overweight.

I. Introduction

       The prevalence of overweight among the US population over the past several decades has

been characterized as reaching epidemic proportions (Institute of Medicine, 2004). According to

data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), nearly two-thirds of adults were

estimated to be overweight during 1999-2002, an increase of 46 percent over rates for the period

1960-62 (National Center for Health Statistics 2004). These data also reveal that 15.8 percent of

children aged 6 to 11 and 16.1 percent of adolescents aged 12 to 19 were overweight during

1999-2002, representing nearly a four-fold increase over rates for the 1960-62 period.

       Coincident with these trends, overweight among adults and children has emerged as a

serious public health concern. Among adults, overweight is a serious risk factor for heart

disease, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, poor female reproductive health, and a

variety of other physical maladies (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005). Among

children and adolescents, overweight can contribute to a number of physical health problems,

including Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors, glucose intolerance, sleep apnea,

menstrual abnormalities, and orthopedic problems. Perhaps equally important, obesity in

children and adolescents can lead to psychosocial problems such as low self-esteem, negative

body image, depression, stigma, discrimination, and teasing and bullying (Institute of Medicine

2004; Ogden et al., 2002).

       Health problems associated with overweight also translate into substantial health care

spending. For example, Finkelstein, Fiebelkorn, and Wang (2003) estimated that overweight and

obesity accounted for 9.1 percent of US health expenditures in 1998. Sturm (2002) observed that

the association between obesity and chronic health conditions is equivalent to twenty years of
                                                                                               3


aging, and that obesity is associated with significant increases in inpatient and outpatient

utilization and prescription drug spending. Wang and Dietz (2002) estimated that for the period

1979 to 1999, obesity-related annual hospital costs for children ages 6-17 increased more than

three-fold. Finally, Thorpe et al. (2004) estimated that between 1987 and 2001, the increase in

the prevalence of obesity and in spending by the obese relative to persons of normal weight

accounted for 27 percent of the rise in real per capita spending over this period.

       As described in Koplan, Liverman, and Kraak (2004), overweight is a particular concern

for children and adolescents. Apart from the increased likelihood of contracting the adverse

health conditions noted above, nearly 50 percent of overweight children and adolescents will

become obese adults. Such children are thus at risk for the adverse health conditions and

attendant health care costs associated with adult obesity. The social and emotional health

problems of overweight children and adolescents can also pose a significant risk to their

academic progress, lead to behavioral problems, and impede social adjustment during these

critical developmental periods.1 Finally, should overweight children become overweight adults,

they may also obtain lower economic rewards associated with adult overweight and obesity

(Gormaker et al. 1993, Averett and Korenman 1996, Cawley 2000, Conley and Glauber 2005).

       As Rashad and Grossman (2004) have noted, public policy interventions in response to

obesity may be most compelling for children and adolescents who are likely to lack the

knowledge necessary for informed nutritional decisions. These informational deficits represent a

kind of “market failure” that justifies educational interventions to enhance awareness about


1
 The Institute of Medicine (2004) also reports that among children and adolescents, rates of
overweight are more prevalent in high-risk populations such as children of lower socioeconomic
status and racial and ethnic minorities. To the extent that children in these groups face barriers to
economic success associated with low incomes, single-parent families, low-quality schooling,
and residence in inhospitable urban environments, being overweight may exacerbate the
difficulties of overcoming such impediments.
                                                                                          4


nutrition. Excessive myopia may also cause adolescents to undervalue the longer-term

consequences of food choices and public policy interventions may again be justified.

Additionally, self-control problems may prevent adolescents from taking prudent action in the

short-term to address overeating (see O’Donogue and Rabin 2001 for a discussion of risky

behavior by adolescents). As with smoking behavior, this lack of self control may warrant

government intervention to discourage the consumption of food with poor nutritional content.2

       Our focus on adolescents also recognizes that this age group is likely to exhibit greater

independence in their dietary and nutritional choices than younger children. They may also be

subject to less parental supervision regarding sound health habits that can affect bodyweight.

Hence interventions designed to alter behavior may have more of an impact on adolescents than

on younger children.

       In this paper, we first examine the extent to which economic factors, parental

characteristics, family structure and composition, and characteristics of neighborhoods and

geographic areas contribute to variation in adolescent bodyweight and to the likelihood of being

overweight. Next, we consider the relationship between adolescent bodyweight and health care

expenditures. This part of the analysis explores whether the relatively high health care costs

associated with adult obesity begin to emerge during adolescence. We also examine whether the

relationship between adolescent overweight and health expenditures reflects the contribution of

weight-related health conditions and whether the prevalence of such conditions differs between

overweight adolescents and those of normal weight. Finally, results from our models of

adolescent bodyweight are used to point to interventions that can potentially reduce overweight

 Gruber (2002/03) provides a non-technical discussion of the use of excise taxes to address
problems of self control in the context of cigarette smoking. Papers by Jacobson and Bronwell
(2000), Leicester and Windmeijer (2004), and Kim and Kawachi (2006) consider the use of
excise taxes to reduce obesity.

in adolescents. As our expenditure models indicate, such reductions could also reduce

adolescents’ health care spending.



II. Conceptual Framework

       As noted above, one of our objectives is to assess the contribution of a variety of factors

to adolescent bodyweight and overweight. To frame our cross-sectional analysis, we apply an

approach developed by Chou, Grossman, and Saffer (2004, 2002) and note that individual i’s

bodyweight in period t will depend on his/her energy balance (the difference between energy

consumed, Ci, and expended, Si), the cumulative effect of his/her energy balance in prior periods

(k=1 to t-1), and time-invariant factors, represented by the vector Vi, which determine an

individual’s predisposition to increased bodyweight. We define this relationship as:

                                                           t −1
                            (1) Wit = f [( C i t − S i t ), ∑ (C i k − S i k ),Vi ]
                                                           k =1


Rewriting (1) by noting that the terms in the summation and Vi contribute to bodyweight in the

prior period (e.g., period t-1), we obtain:

                           (2) Wit = f [(Cit − Sit ),Wi ,t −1 ,Vi ]

Thus, bodyweight observed for individual i during the current period will depend on levels of Ci

and Si, bodyweight in the prior period Wt-1, and time-invariant, weight-susceptibility factors

represented by Vi.

       Note that equations (1) and (2) describe the technical or ‘production’ relationship

governing the determination of bodyweight. Since we cannot directly observe this process, our

empirical estimates of variation in adolescent bodyweight will be based on reduced-form

empirical models. As in Chou, Grossman, and Saffer (2004), we posit that individual

characteristics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, gender, and genetics) will affect the technical process by
                                                                                             6

which (C-S) is converted into bodyweight. We also note that current energy balance along with

weight in past periods will also depend on economic, family, and neighborhood characteristics.

       Apart from technical production considerations, economic theory suggests that

individuals ‘choose’ their bodyweight through utility maximizing behavior. As noted by Cawley

(2004) and by Chou, Grossman, and Saffer (2004, 2002), bodyweight can enter an individual’s

utility function either directly as an object of choice or indirectly as an input in the production of

health. Thus, an individual chooses optimal levels of bodyweight and health, along with other

commodities, subject to constraints encompassing income, prices of food and other commodities,

time, and the bodyweight production function noted above. Since adolescents exercise some

discretion in their food choices, we incorporate these considerations in our empirical analysis.

Next, we discuss the role of various factors in our model.

Economic factors: Family income and food prices figure prominently as two basic economic

factors that can affect adolescent food consumption and bodyweight. First, adolescents in

families with higher incomes may be better able to afford foods of superior nutritional quality

and lower energy density than lower-income families. Next, adolescents in families with higher

incomes may be better able to take part in a greater range of recreational activities than those in

low-income families.

       Lower prices of fast and convenience foods have been found to be associated with

overweight and obesity in adults (Chou, Grossman, and Saffer 2004). In research on children and

adolescents, Chou, Rashad, and Grossman (2005) consider the impact of several types of food

prices on adolescent bodyweight by gender. While they obtain mixed results, their findings

indicate that increases in fast-food restaurant prices reduce adolescent BMI (the body-mass index

described below) for females. Finally, Chou, Grossman, and Safer (2004) note that smokers have
                                                                                              7

higher metabolic rates than non-smokers and consume fewer calories. They include the real price

of cigarettes in their study to account for the possibility that higher prices may discourage

smoking, resulting in increased caloric consumption and higher bodyweight. Chou, Rashad and

Grossman’s (2005) study of overweight in children and adolescents also accounts for geographic

variation in the real price of cigarettes but they find no effect on children’s bodyweight.

Parental and family characteristics: Parental obesity may be related to adolescent overweight

through a genetic predisposition and/or unobserved parental attitudes toward proper health

practices. Early work by Coate (1983) examined the influence of parent’s “fatness” (based on

skinfold measures) and diet to child and adolescent weight. He found that parent’s fatness is a

statistically significant predictor of child and adolescent skinfold growth and obesity, but that

diet is unrelated to these outcomes. These results support an interpretation in which parental

bodyweight affects child overweight through genetics rather than behavior. In more recent work,

Anderson, Butcher, and Levine (2003), Sastry and Plebley (2003) and Chou, Rashad, and

Grossman (2005) used data on mother’s BMI and found it to be strongly related to child

overweight. However, if fathers’ bodyweight provides a genetic contribution to children’s

predisposition for overweight, these analyses omit a critical explanatory variable.3

       Parental and family characteristics may affect adolescent bodyweight through their

impact on calories consumed and expended. For example, given the traditional role of mothers

in meal preparation, some time-constrained working mothers may substitute less nutritious fast

and convenience foods for meals prepared at home. Time-constrained mothers also may exercise

less supervision over the food choices of their adolescent children, and higher-income, time-

constrained parents have the means to substitute convenience foods for meals prepared at home.

3
 This is an unavoidable problem in analyses of single-mother families since information on the
non-residing father will be missing.
                                                                                           8

Using longitudinal data, Anderson, Butcher, and Levine (2003) found a statistically significant

positive relationship between maternal employment intensity and child overweight for children

ages three to eleven in high income families. We also include parents’ education in our model

since it has played a critical role in a variety of other health outcomes for children (Grossman,

2005), and add a variable indicating whether each parent is a smoker, viewing this as a correlate

of unobserved parental attitudes toward prudent health behaviors. Finally, family composition

and size may affect the ability of parents to adequately supervise the food consumption of their

children and to “stretch” budgets to provide high quality meals.4

Neighborhood and environmental effects: Differences in the design and environmental

characteristics of a neighborhood and the socioeconomic status of its residents may also

contribute to the likelihood that an adolescent will be overweight. Such factors include

opportunities for walking and recreation, neighborhood safety and quality, and the availability of

nutritious food outlets and fast/convenience food stores. Booth, Pinkston, and Poston (2005) cite

a variety of studies focusing on the relationship between such characteristics and adult

bodyweight. These studies suggest that residents of materially deprived neighborhoods have

been found to have higher BMI levels and a greater prevalence of overweight. Other research

using individual and state-level data has found that sprawling geographic areas have residents

with higher bodyweight and obesity than less sprawling areas (Ewing et al. 2003; Vandgrift and

Yoked 2004).

       The few studies that have examined the impact of neighborhood characteristics on the

bodyweight of children and adolescents have produced mixed results. For example, Kinra et al.

(2000) found that children ages 5 to 14 living in materially deprived households in the city of


4
  Parents’ marital status may also affect adolescent bodyweight should emotional and behavioral
problems associated with divorce or separation lead to eating disorders.
                                                                                            9

Plymouth, United Kingdom, had obesity rates 2.5 times the national average. Sastry and Plebley

(2003) found that immigrant concentration and neighborhood stability were positively related to

the likelihood that an adolescent was overweight. By contrast, Burdette and Whitaker (2004)

found no relationship between neighborhood characteristics such as safety, the availability of

playgrounds, and fast food restaurants on overweight among low-income, pre-school children.

Kandris and Liu (2003) found that when median income was included in multivariate models,

social barriers such as crime and single parenting were not statistically significant predictors of

obesity for children (ages 4 to 18 years of age) living in areas of low income in Indianapolis.

They also found that opportunities for exercise were not statistically predictive of obesity nor

was census tract educational attainment.

       Finally, in evaluating the impact of such community-level characteristics on outcomes for

children, Ginter, Haveman, and Wolfe (2000) have cautioned that the reliability of estimates of

neighborhood effects depend on the degree to which family background is included in model

specifications. Sastry and Plebley (2003) also found that inclusion of family characteristics

reduced the contribution of the small number of neighborhood characteristics in their analysis of

children’s bodyweight and obesity.

The relationship between adolescent bodyweight and health care expenditures:

       As noted earlier, we examine whether overweight adolescents incur higher health care

expenditures than adolescents of normal weight in order to gain insight into whether the high

health expenditures of overweight adults have their origin during adolescence. While there is a

relatively large literature on variation in child and adolescent bodyweight, and a descriptive

literature regarding the contribution of adult obesity to aggregate health expenditures, we are not

aware of behavioral analyses on adolescent overweight and health care spending. Our analysis
                                                                                           10

seeks to address this gap in research by estimating an empirical model of health expenditures. As

discussed below, this model specification confronts several issues of endogeneity as well as the

critical question of whether any expenditure differentials by bodyweight can be attributed to

health conditions that are associated with overweight in adolescence.



III. Data and Empirical Specification

       The data used in this study are from the household component of the Medical

Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS-HC), a nationally representative two-year household panel

survey sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The MEPS

provides national estimates of the civilian, non-institutionalized population’s access to, use of,

and expenditures for health care, their health and health insurance status, demographic

characteristics, economic status, and employment characteristics. It also includes data on

reported (rather than measured) height and weight of adults and children. For children, these data

are reported by parents (or other responsible individuals) while for adults, self-reported data on

height and weight were collected beginning in 2001. For public release, these data are converted

into units of BMI for each adult and child, defined as weight in kilograms divided by height in

meters squared.

       For purposes of our analysis, we pool MEPS household survey data for the years 2001

through 2003, the latter year representing the most currently available data at the initiation of our

study.5 We excluded female adolescents who were pregnant, restricted our analysis to



5
  Specifically, we begin with data from the second year of panel 5 (corresponding to 2001),
representing the first year in which data on adult height and weight were collected in the MEPS.
We also include data from the first year of panel 6 (corresponding to 2001), the first year of
panel 7 (2002), and the first year of panel 8 (2003). We considered exploiting the panel nature of
MEPS to examine changes in adolescent bodyweight between year one and year two of the
                                                                                           11

adolescents residing with single-mother and two-parent families, and excluded those with

missing or implausible values of BMI. Our resulting data set consists of 6738 adolescents (3463

males and 3275 females) defined as ages 12 to 19 to be consistent with classification of

adolescents in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from NCHS. We

apply survey weights to our analyses so that our estimates represent annual average estimates for

the three years of pooled data in our sample. We also adjust the standard errors of our descriptive

and multivariate estimates for the complex survey design of MEPS using the relevant survey

commands in STATA.

Data on adolescent and adult BMI and overweight: Data on BMI used to classify children as

overweight are based upon U.S. age-and gender-specific growth charts (BMI-for-age percentiles)

tabulated by NCHS. We use these BMI threshold levels to classify adolescents into four weight

categories: underweight (< 5th percentile); normal weight (5th percentile to < 85th percentile); at

risk of overweight or obesity (85th percentile to < 95th percentile) and overweight (95th percentile

or above).6 For parents, we use the NCHS classification of underweight as BMI < 18.5; normal

weight (BMI > or equal to 18.5 but < or equal to 24.9); at risk for obesity (BMI > or equal to 25

but < or equal to 29.9); and obese (BMI > or equal to 30). 7




MEPS panels. However, we found that changes in the BMI index for adolescent children were
quite small over this two year period.
6
  We follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and use ‘overweight’ to refer to
children who are in the top 5 percent of their gender and age-specific BMI distribution.
7
  Missing data on BMI, due to non-response to questions on weight and/or height, ranged from
just over 15 percent for children 12 years of age to less than ten percent for those 15 to 19. We
found that children 17 – 19 years of age sometimes had a value for the variable measuring adult
BMI. For consistency in measuring adolescent BMI and for purposes of minimizing the degree
of missing data, we adopted the following decision rule for these observations: if values existed
for both the child BMI and adult BMI measures, we used the child BMI; if the child BMI was
present and the adult BMI missing, we used the child BMI; if the adult BMI was available and
the child BMI missing, we used the adult BMI.
                                                                                         12

       As noted, MEPS BMI data for children and adolescents are based upon parental reports

of height and weight rather than measured values. Consequently, there may be measurement

error due to possible over-reporting of height and under-reporting of weight that could bias

estimates of BMI downward. To assess this possibility, we compared our BMI estimates to

tabulations based on measured BMI from the NHANES for the period 1999 to 2002 (Table 1).

Overall, we find a somewhat lower proportion of overweight adolescents in our sample, 14.2

percent, compared to 16.1 percent from the NHANES (p < 0.05). We find no statistically

significant differences between overweight rates for male adolescents (15.8 percent in the MEPS

and 16.7 percent in the NHANES), but do find a lower percentage for female adolescents in the

MEPS (12.5 percent to 15.4 percent in the NHANES (p < 0.05).

       We also examine adolescent overweight rates by race/ethnicity and gender to try to

identify the source of under-reporting. Although there is a 2.8 percentage point difference in

overweight rates between white females in the MEPS and NHANES, this difference is not

statistically significant. While we find no statistically significant differences between MEPS and

NHANES with regard to black males, black females, white males, and black females, published

NHANES tabulations do not provide estimates for adolescents of Hispanic ethnicity (estimates

are only provided for Mexicans). Thus, the difference between the overall MEPS and NHANES

estimates could potentially reflect differences in the prevalence of overweight for Hispanic

females.8




8
 Cawley and Burkhauser (2006) use the NHANES to regress data on measured weight (height)
on reported weight (height) and use the resulting equations to predict height and weight (and thus
BMI) corrected for reporting error. Unfortunately, the NHANES does not contain both reported
and measured data on weight and height for children less than age 18 so we are unable to apply
such an adjustment procedure. Goodman, Hinden and Khandelwal (2000) find that self reports of
height and weight by adolescents provide accurate estimates of BMI for classifying adolescents
                                                                                          13

Data on economic factors: Income data reported in the MEPS, expressed as a percent of the

federal poverty line, serves as our measure of household economic status. We use data from the

2002 Economic Census: Accommodation and Food Services, Geographic Area Series to obtain

information on the average state price for limited-service restaurants and full-service restaurants

in the adolescent’s state of residence. 9 These data are produced every five years so that the 2002

data are most appropriate for our study. Since the price data are reported as specific intervals, we

apply weights to price interval mid-points where the weights are the percent of each type of

restaurant in each interval (as in Chou, Grossman, and Saffer 2004). We attempted to use the

ACCRA Grocery Items Price Index for selected metropolitan statistical areas to measure the

price of food prepared at home (ACCRA 2005). However, since data for this index was missing

for half our sample, we decided not add it to our analysis. Finally, we also include measures of

the average price per pack of cigarettes in a state (2003 dollars) as reported in The Tax Burden on

Tobacco (Orzechowski and Walker 2006).

Parental characteristics and family circumstances: We classify each parent as employed or not

employed, and for mothers we classify them, if employed, as working full or part time (where

full-time work is defined as 35 or more hours per week). Other family and parental

characteristics, such as family size, parents’ bodyweight, education, health and smoking status

are also obtained from the MEPS.

Data on geographic locale and neighborhoods: We incorporate several measures of an

adolescent’s geographic location that may have relevance for bodyweight and the likelihood of



as overweight. However, we are not aware of studies that compare parental reports of children’s
height and weight to measured data for purposes of identifying overweight adolescents.

being overweight. We include data on census tract population density derived from the 2000

Census and expect that individuals residing in more densely populated tracts may have less

incentive to use motorized transportation for daily activities. We also use census tract data on

the percent of households on public assistance, the percent of vacant households, and the median

value of housing to characterize neighborhood material deprivation. We expect such

neighborhoods to lack adequate recreational facilities, have poorer environmental quality, and

lack access to higher quality and more nutritious food products than more affluent

neighborhoods.10

          Our analysis also includes variables characterizing county crime rates as an indicator of

neighborhood safety and hence, the ability to engage in outdoor and recreational activities

without feeling threatened. We obtained county-specific crime data from the US Department of

Justice Uniform Crime Reporting Program Data for the year 2002. In our analysis, we focus on

crimes against individuals (murders and aggravated assaults) rather than crimes against property.

          Finally, we also include county-based measures of types of food outlets per capita. These

include convenience and snack food stores (the latter include confectionary and nut shops, ice

cream, soft serve, and frozen yogurt stores, and doughnut, bagel, and cookie shops), fish and

seafood markets, fresh vegetable markets, supermarkets, and full-service restaurants and limited-

service restaurants. Since convenience stores, snack food outlets, and restaurants are generally

considered to serve high caloric and energy-dense foods compared to food prepared at home, we

expect that a greater presence of such food outlets will be associated with increased adolescent

BMI and the likelihood of being overweight. In contrast, we expect the greater availability of

fish and vegetable markets to be associated with the reduced likelihood of overweight and a

     Our exploratory analyses included additional neighborhood characteristics. Since these
variables did not attain statistical significance, our final model includes the above subset.
                                                                                           15

lower BMI. These data are also obtained from the 2002 Economic Census: Accommodation and

Food Services, Geographic Area Series compiled by the Bureau of the Census.

Data for health care expenditure modeling: We estimate models of adolescent medical

expenditures (in 2003 dollars) and include indicators of an adolescent’s health insurance status,

specifically whether an individual is insured by either private or public insurance for all or part

of the year (adolescents uninsured all year represent the reference group). Our expenditure

models, estimated separately by gender, also include information on the characteristics of

adolescents (e.g., their age, race/ethnicity, region of residence), family characteristics (including

family size, family income as a percent of the federal poverty line, and whether the adolescent

resides in a single or two-parent family).

       We also include parental characteristics that may affect an adolescent’s use of medical

care and health status. These include parents’ educational attainment, whether parents smoke,

and the employment status of each parent. Parents with higher educational attainment are more

likely to have children in better health than those with lower education (Grossman 2005).

However, while better educated parents may be more efficient and knowledgeable producers of

child health, the implications for health expenditures are not clear and depend upon their relative

use of parental time and medical care resources in producing child health compared to parents

with lower educational attainment. Adolescents residing with parents who smoke may be subject

to illnesses associated with second-hand smoking and thus require more medical care than those

residing with non-smoking parents. Additionally, parental smoking may also reflect attitudes

regarding health and preventive behaviors that can also affect the demand for medical care.

Parental employment (especially full-time employment) may impose greater time costs on
                                                                                            16

parents and thus constrain the number of medical care visits during the year compared to parents

working part-time or who are not employed.

       Finally, we also include the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ hospital wage

index to control for cross-sectional variation in medical care costs. The wage index expresses the

hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the national average

hospital wage level for hospital labor market areas.11

Empirical specification: We estimate an OLS model for adolescents’ BMI and probit models for

the likelihood of being overweight and also for the combined category of the likelihood of being

at risk for overweight or overweight. 12 To model medical expenditures, we estimate a probit

model for the probability of any expenditure and a GLM model for persons with positive

expenditures. The GLM model is characterized by a logarithmic link function and by a variance

function that is proportional to the mean squared (represented as a gamma distribution).

Expected expenditures are predicted for all adolescents in our sample (spenders and non-

spenders) by combining predictions from the probit and GLM models.

       In selecting the two-part GLM model, we examined alternative functional forms

including a standard two-part model (probit in the first stage and log-linear conditional

expenditure function) and a one-part GLM model. We focused on comparisons of the two part

models since we view the decision to obtain any medical care and the decision regarding the

level of care obtained (as summarized by expenditures) as qualitatively different processes

warranting separate estimation. We selected the two-part GLM model for the following reasons.

   We also considered modeling adolescent bodyweight as an ordered logit model with categories
based the weight classes defined above. However, only the cutoff point for overweight was was
consistently statistically significant in preliminary analyses so that we focused on the
dichotomous outcome “overweight or not overweight.”
                                                                                          17

First, our estimates of the conditional log-linear model in the standard two-part model displayed

evidence of heteroskedasticity. As Manning and Mullahy (2001) have noted, such

heteroskedasticity can yield biased estimates unless separate smearing estimators are applied, a

process that can be quite cumbersome when residuals are correlated with several explanatory

variables. By contrast, estimates of the conditional GLM model were consistent with evidence

of normally distributed residuals (kurtosis estimates of 2.98) and with a gamma variance function

(Park’s test statistic was approximately 2). Next, when we examined predicted expenditures by

adolescent bodyweight class, mean estimates from the standard two-part model were far below

actual mean values. The two-part GLM model yielded mean expenditure estimates that

compared favorably to observed mean expenditures in each adolescent bodyweight class.

Finally, we applied a variant of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test to examine the goodness-of-fit of our

GLM model across our bodyweight classes. We ran a regression of the residuals from the GLM

model on our four bodyweight classes (run without a constant). The results indicated that the

coefficients on the bodyweight class variables were not statistically significant, suggesting that

our functional form fit the data well.

Omitted health conditions and endogeneity issues: As specified, our model of adolescent health

expenditures excludes specific health conditions that are associated with adolescent overweight.

The presence of such conditions may lead to higher expenditures for overweight adolescents

compared to adolescents of normal weight. As a result, one could argue that our model ignores

an important source of endogeneity: the correlation between our bodyweight variables and these

omitted health condition variables. However, we have purposely excluded such conditions since

we are interested in the overall association between adolescent overweight and health care

expenditures. Put differently, we want the coefficients on our overweight variables to capture the
                                                                                         18

correlation between being overweight and having these related health conditions. In this way, we

can fully attribute the expenditures associated with such conditions to being an overweight

adolescent. In our empirical work, we examine whether the prevalence of health conditions

attributable to being overweight is in fact greater for our sample of overweight adolescents

compared to those of normal weight. We also examine whether the inclusion of such conditions

directly in our model can explain any differential in predicted expenditures between overweight

adolescents and those of normal weight, and thus, whether expenditure differentials do indeed

reflect the contribution of weight-related health conditions.

       Next, there may be other sources of endogeneity that confound our expenditure

estimation. As noted above, MEPS data on adolescent BMI are obtained from parental reports of

height and weight rather than from direct measurement so that the computed BMI may be

reported with error. As noted above, should such unobserved measurement error be correlated

with the observed measure of BMI, we will obtain inconsistent estimates of coefficients on our

explanatory variables. Additionally, there may also be reverse causality or structural endogeneity

between health expenditures and being overweight. For example, high health expenditures

resulting from unobserved health conditions that limit physical activity or from unobserved

medical treatments (e.g., drug therapy) may result in increased bodyweight for some adolescents.

While these sources of endogeneity in measured BMI could be addressed through an

instrumental variables (IV) approach, we are constrained in applying such an approach. Use of

IV will also purge our overweight measure of the unobserved health conditions that are

correlated with being overweight and whose expenditures we wish to attribute to being

overweight.
                                                                                         19


IV. Findings

       Results from the empirical models of adolescent bodyweight are reported in Tables 2 and

3 for males and females, respectively. Each table presents results for our three models: our OLS

model of continuous BMI (column 1); our probit model for adolescents who are at risk of

becoming overweight or who are overweight compared to those who are of normal weight or are

underweight (column 2); and our probit model for adolescents who are overweight versus being

in the other weight classes (column 3). We focus on these alternative outcome measures to

provide a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of family, economic, and neighborhood

factors on adolescent bodyweight.

Male adolescents:

       The most striking finding in our models of adolescent bodyweight is the strong

relationship between parent’s bodyweight class and adolescent weight outcomes. In particular,

male adolescents whose parents are obese or at risk for obesity (compared to those whose parents

are of normal weight) have increased BMI scores and are more likely to be overweight or at risk

for overweight. For example, having a mother (father) who is obese increases the likelihood that

a male will be overweight by 13.7 (7.4) percentage points.13 As noted, this relationship is likely

to reflect an adolescent’s genetic predisposition to increased bodyweight and/or parental attitudes

toward nutrition, exercise, and healthy lifestyles.




13
  Marginal effects were obtained for discrete variables by first assuming each observation to
have the characteristic of interest, predicting the probability of the adolescent being overweight
or at risk for overweight and then averaging. The same procedure was used assuming each
observation did not have the characteristic of interest. The difference between predicted mean
probabilities with and without the characteristic of interest represents the marginal effect
associated with that characteristic. For continuous variables, the marginal effect was calculated
for a change of one standard deviation in the variable. Standard errors were obtained for the
marginal effects using the balanced repeated replication method.
                                                                                            20

       Somewhat surprisingly for male adolescents, we find that father’s education rather than

mother’s education has a more consistent impact on our outcome measures. Males whose fathers

have at least a high school education have lower BMI scores and lower probabilities of becoming

overweight or at risk of overweight. We find that males whose mothers attended but did not

graduate from college have lower BMI levels and lower likelihoods of being overweight (p <

0.10 in both models). While the difference in statistical significance for each parent’s education

may reflect the correlation between the mother’s and father’s education levels, it may also reflect

a greater influence of fathers on male adolescent behavior.14 Finally, we find that parental

smoking status is positively associated with adolescent bodyweight. Males whose mothers

smoke have higher BMI scores and are 3.6 percentage points (p < 0.10) more likely to be

overweight and 5.5 percentage points more likely to be at risk for overweight or overweight.

       Mother’s employment status attains statistical significance in the male BMI and

overweight/at risk regressions although in ways contrary to our expectations. While we expected

work activity, especially full-time employment, to result in increased adolescent bodyweight, we

find just the opposite effect: male adolescents with part-time working mothers exhibit lower BMI

scores than those without employed mothers, and males having a full- or part-time working

mother are less likely to be at risk/overweight (column 2) than those with stay-at-home mothers

(the former result is significant at p < 0.10). This finding contrasts with results in Anderson et al.

2003 who found a positive relationship between maternal employment and children’s weight.

Our results may differ from their study due to our use of cross-sectional rather than longitudinal

data. Below, we examine some sensitivity tests regarding the relationship between mothers’



14
  Excluding the father’s education increased the statistical significance on some of the mother’s
education coefficients but they were not as consistently statistically significant as those for the
father.
                                                                                            21

employment and male bodyweight. Finally, given the large proportion of fathers who are

employed in our data (91 percent among two parent families), we find no impact of fathers’

employment status on any of our bodyweight outcome measures.

       We do find evidence that male adolescents in households with incomes in excess of four

times the poverty level are more likely to be overweight/ at risk for overweight than other

adolescents. Since there is no income effect in the overweight equation, this likely reflects the

impact on the risk of being overweight. We find that increased family size is associated with

reductions in bodyweight for each of the outcome measures. This finding may reflect the

inability of some income-constrained households to provide adequate meals for their family

members or to limit discretionary spending on snack foods. Finally, we find some differences in

adolescent bodyweight according to race and ethnicity. Male adolescents who are Hispanic have

higher bodyweight outcomes for all measures than white males and are 6.5 percentage points

more likely to be overweight (10.8 percentage points more likely to be either at risk for or

overweight).

       We find very little evidence that neighborhood and geographic factors have an impact on

male adolescent bodyweight with two noteworthy exceptions. First, we find that higher state

cigarette prices result in increased male BMI (column 1, p < 0.10), consistent with the notion that

higher cigarette prices may induce a substitution of food consumption for smoking. However,

since we find the opposite effect for females (discussed below), these results need to be

interpreted with caution. We also find that male adolescents in counties with greater

snack/convenience food stores per capita are more likely to be overweight, while those in

counties with more fresh food stores per capita are less likely to be overweight. A change of one

standard deviation in these variables from their means yields small changes in the likelihood of
                                                                                          22

being overweight: a 2.1 percentage point increase and a 1.7 percentage point decrease in the

likelihood of being overweight, respectively. Finally, we also find that male adolescents in

neighborhoods with higher percentage of persons on public assistance are more likely to be

overweight (p < 0.10). Such a finding may reflect a correlation between neighborhood economic

status and unobserved indicators of neighborhood amenities (e.g., recreational facilities) that are

conducive to physical activity and reduced bodyweight.

Female adolescents: Female bodyweight outcomes also display the very strong relationship

with parents’ bodyweight that was observed in the male equations, with nearly identical effects

(Table 3). For example, female adolescents whose mothers (fathers) are obese experience a 13.1

(7.2) percentage point increase in the likelihood that they will be overweight. While we find no

impact of parents’ educational attainment, employment, or family income on weight outcomes

for females, we do find that parents’ smoking behavior has some impact. In particular, female

adolescents whose fathers smoke have higher BMI scores, are 4.0 percentage points more likely

to be overweight, and are 7.1 percentage points more likely to be at risk for overweight or

overweight than those whose fathers are non-smokers. Finally, we find that females with mothers

in fair or poor health are more likely to be overweight than those whose mothers are in good or

excellent health (p < 0.10). Mothers in poor health may be less able to take an active role in meal

planning and preparation resulting in greater use of high caloric prepared foods.

       We find a different pattern of racial/ethnic disparities in bodyweight for females than for

males. Female adolescents who are Hispanic or black exhibit higher BMI scores compared to

white females. In addition, black adolescent females are 4.7 percentage points more likely to be

overweight and 5.5 percentage points more likely to be at risk for overweight or overweight (p <

0.10 for both) than those who are white.
                                                                                            23

       Female adolescent bodyweight displays some association with neighborhood and

geographic characteristics. We find evidence that increases in population density are associated

with lower BMI scores (p < 0.10), a finding that may reflect the ability to do without motorized

transportation in more densely populated areas. Contrary to expectations, we find a non-linear,

positive relationship between a state’s average limited-service restaurant price and the likelihood

of being overweight. Since this variable is not standardized for serving size, the positive

relationship may reflect the impact of larger serving portions on bodyweight. We also find that

an increase in the number of full-service restaurants is associated with a decline in all

bodyweight outcome measures but we do not have an obvious explanation for this finding.

Finally, we find that an increase in the number of county snack and convenience food outlets per

capita is associated with an increased likelihood that an adolescent female will be at risk for

overweight or overweight (a 2.7 percentage point change for a change of one standard deviation

in this variable); we find no evidence of this effect when considering the likelihood of being

overweight.

       In contrast to findings for male adolescents, increases in the real price of cigarettes are

negatively related to the likelihood of being an overweight female, a result that is at variance

with expectations. We also find some evidence that neighborhood safety and quality may be

related to overweight in adolescent females. Adolescent females residing in counties in the top

two quartiles of the distribution of murders per capita are more likely to be overweight than those

residing in neighborhoods in the bottom quartile (a 3.6 and 4.9 percentage point increase,

respectively; the former at p < 0.10). Additionally, females residing in neighborhoods in the

second and fourth quartiles of murders were more likely than those in the bottom quartile to be in

the combined category of at risk for overweight or overweight (5.3 and 7.4 percentage points,
                                                                                         24

respectively). We also find that females in neighborhoods with an increased proportion of vacant

housing units are somewhat more likely to be overweight (a change of 1.3 percentage points for

a one standard deviation change in this variable, p < 0.10). Consequently, concern over personal

safety and possible lack of neighborhood amenities (as reflected in increased vacancy rates) may

discourage physical activity and contribute to overweight in adolescent females.

Sensitivity Tests:

Parent’s employment: Since our results with respect to maternal employment differ from those

in prior work, we re-examined this relationship by restricting our sample to adolescents with

working mothers as in the longitudinal analysis of Anderson et al. (2003). By doing so, we

observe a positive relationship between mother’s hours of work and the likelihood of being

overweight but only for males (p < 0.10 for a two-tailed test). Since Anderson et al. found the

impact of mother’s hours to be greatest in high-income families, we examined regressions for

our restricted sample further broken down by family income in relationship to the poverty line.

We found no evidence of a positive relationship between mothers’ hours of work and weight

outcomes for either gender.

Adolescent age group: Since our sample of adolescents between ages 12 and 19 may differ in

their degree of independence regarding food choices and physical activity, we examined

bodyweight regressions for the following age groups: 12 to 14, 15 to 17, and 18 and 19. These

regressions yielded little in the way of new information regarding differences in the correlates of

bodyweight. One interesting finding to emerge for females is that for the oldest and presumably

most independent age group, mother’s hours of work were positively correlated with an

increased likelihood of being at risk for overweight or overweight. However, no effect was found

on the likelihood of being overweight by itself.
                                                                                         25


Adolescent bodyweight and health expenditures:

Male adolescents: In Table 4, we report results of our expenditure models for male and female

adolescents. We find no evidence that males who are overweight, at risk of being overweight, or

underweight have a greater likelihood of incurring an expenditure (probit model in column 1) or

higher conditional expenditures (GLM model in column 2) compared to males of normal

bodyweight. Consistent with these findings, predicted expenditures for each bodyweight class

based on the two-part GLM model reveal no statistically significant differences across

bodyweight classes.

       The regression models for males yield a number of plausible results. For example, males

with full-year or part-year insurance coverage have a greater likelihood of incurring expenditures

and have higher conditional expenditures than those uninsured all year. We also find that older

males, blacks and Hispanics (compared to whites), and those in larger families are less likely to

incur an expense. For both the probit and GLM models, we find that mother’s rather than father’s

education is associated with a greater likelihood and level of health care spending. Other findings

from the GLM model indicate that males in high-income households incur greater expenditures

than those who are poor or near poor, and males with time-constrained mothers (those working

full time) have lower expenditures than those whose mothers are not working (both at p < 0.10).

Female adolescents: In contrast to males, we obtain striking expenditure differences for female

adolescents across bodyweight classes (Table 4). We find that overweight females have both a

higher likelihood of incurring expenditures and higher conditional expenditures than those of

normal weight. While females at risk of being overweight are no more likely to incur

expenditures than females of normal weight, they do incur higher conditional expenditures.
                                                                                           26

Finally, underweight females are less likely than those of normal weight to incur health

expenditures but their conditional expenditures are no different than females of normal weight.

       As with males, adolescent females insured all or part year are more likely to incur

expenditures and but their conditional expenditures are no different than those uninsured all year.

Hispanic, black, and Asian females are less likely to incur expenditures than whites, with Asians

(p < 0.10) and those of other racial or ethnic groups having lower conditional expenditures than

whites. We find that females incur higher conditional health expenditures if their mothers had

more than a high school education and if their fathers graduated from high school compared to

those not graduating from high school. Finally, females in middle and high income families (with

incomes three or more times the poverty line) have higher conditional health expenditures than

those who are poor or near poor (less than 125 percent of poverty), and those with full-time

working mothers incur lower conditional expenditures than females with stay-at-home mothers.

Predicted health expenditures by female bodyweight:

       Our empirical work reveals that overweight females are more likely than those of normal

weight to incur health expenditures and when they do, to have higher expenditures. The findings

also indicate that when female adolescents at risk of being overweight incur health expenditures,

their spending also exceeds that for females of normal weight. Combining results from each part

of the model, we obtain predicted expenditures according to female bodyweight. In doing so, we

derive estimates for each bodyweight class that are based on our full sample of adolescent

females. Using this standard population allows us to obtain expenditure estimates for each

bodyweight class that are not confounded by differences in characteristics by bodyweight.

       We find that overweight female adolescents have average annual health expenditures of

$2101 compared to $1311 for those of normal weight, a statistically significant difference of
                                                                                          27

$790 in annual expenditures (p < 0.05). Additionally, female adolescents at risk of becoming

overweight have predicted expenditures of $1778, $467 above expenditures for those of normal

weight (p < 0.10). We find no difference between expected expenditures for underweight and

normal weight females ($1565 and $1311, respectively), nor do we find differences between

overweight and at risk females. Thus for adolescent females, being overweight yields a

substantial increase in annual health spending compared to spending by females of normal

bodyweight.

Adolescent female health expenditures, bodyweight, and health conditions:

       In order to determine whether the expenditure differences by bodyweight class are

attributable to weight-related health conditions we applied several empirical tests. First, we

considered whether there were differences in the prevalence of such conditions between females

who were overweight or at risk of overweight and those of normal bodyweight. These conditions

included diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, other circulatory

diseases, mental disorders, and a composite variable consisting of other health conditions

associated with childhood overweight.15 We found that the prevalence of mental disorders for

overweight females exceeds that for females of normal weight (16.5 percent of the former

compared to 10.9 percent of the latter), as did the prevalence of diabetes (1.9 percent compared

to 0.3 percent), and hypertension (2.3 percent compared to 0.06 percent), all differences

statistically significant at p < 0.05. Additionally, overweight females had a higher mean value of

the Columbia Impairment Scale (CIS) than females of normal weight (18.2 to 8.8), where the

CIS measures global impairment derived from 13 questionnaire items defined to assess

interpersonal relationships, psychopathologies, job or school work, and use of leisure time. When

we compared female adolescents at risk for overweight to those of normal weight, the only

difference found was in mean CIS (14.3 to 8.8 respectively, p < 0.05).

        Next, we included these conditions in our conditional expenditure model for females to

examine their effect on the coefficients of our weight class variables and whether they exhibited

an independent effect on expenditures.16 While the coefficients on such conditions (except other

circulatory conditions) were positive, only the coefficients on mental disorders and heart disease

were statistically significant.17 The coefficients on the overweight and at risk for overweight

variables remained statistically significant (p < 0.10 for the latter). However, while their

magnitudes were reduced they were not significantly different from their coefficients in our

initial specification.

        As reported in Table 5, the addition of these weight-related conditions and the

consequential change in coefficients reduced predicted expenditure differentials. The differential

between overweight females and those of normal weight declined from $790 to $660, and the

differential between females at risk of overweight and those of normal weight declined from

$467 to $252. However, estimates of these differentials are not precisely measured and must be

treated as suggestive: when compared to the expenditure differential without conditions, the

comparisons fail to attain statistical significance.

        Since nearly a fifth of overweight female adolescents and 12 percent of those at risk for

overweight have mental health conditions, we partitioned total expenditures into two components



16
   Since the condition variables are primarily collected when medical care encounters are
reported, they are closely correlated with the likelihood of incurring expenditures. Thus, we
restricted the use of the condition data to our conditional expenditure model.
17
   The imprecise results for other conditions may reflect their relatively low prevalence in our
sample of adolescents.
                                                                                          29

– (1) expenditures net of mental health spending (excluding inpatient and outpatient services and

prescription drugs) and (2) mental health expenditures – and estimated our model on these two

outcome variables. In the former model, the expenditure differential between overweight and

normal-weight females was $622, and the differential between females at risk for overweight and

those of normal weight was only $68 (Table 5). However, the reduced expenditure differentials

are not significantly different from their initial values. In our mental health expenditure model,

we found that compared to females of normal weight, overweight females incurred an additional

$208 in annual mental health expenditures while those at risk for overweight incurred an

additional $286. Thus, this more direct test is consistent with the hypothesis that differences in

the use of mental health services by bodyweight class may partly explain the disparity in health

expenditures between adolescent females of normal weight and those who are either overweight

or at risk of being overweight.

       In sum, these analyses suggest that at least some of the disparities in annual health

expenditures between female adolescents of normal weight and those who are either overweight

or at risk for overweight are related to health conditions associated with excess bodyweight.

While our findings do not explain all of the expenditure differences, this may reflect the fact that

for many weight-related conditions, we lack adequate sample size and hence statistical power to

obtain precise estimates of the reduction in expenditure differentials. Additionally, we lack data

on the intensity of care received for each of the weight-related health conditions that will also

contribute to differences in health expenditures. Nevertheless, the analysis suggests that mental

health problems may contribute to these expenditure differentials and points to the need for more

research on the relationship between adolescent overweight and mental health problems.

V. Conclusions and Implications

       The increase in the prevalence of adolescents who are overweight during the past four

decades has raised two compelling research questions. First, do an adolescent’s individual

characteristics, family circumstances, and economic and geographic environment help to explain

differences in the likelihood of being overweight? Second, is overweight in adolescents

associated with health care problems that yield higher health expenditures than incurred by

adolescents of normal weight? The latter question is particularly important since nearly half of

all overweight adolescents and children will become obese adults and potentially susceptible to

the health conditions and high health expenditures associated with adult overweight. Our

research explores whether these high health expenditures have their origins among teenagers

who are overweight. Focusing on both questions also recognizes that public policy interventions

to address overweight may be especially compelling for adolescents. They are more likely than

younger children to make independent food choices, may (along with their parents) lack

information on the nutritional implications of such choices, and may fail to recognize the long-

term health consequences of poor nutrition.

       In addressing the first question, we employed a rich set of data on individual and family-

level characteristics from the 2001-2003 MEPS along with secondary data describing the

availability and price of food purchased outside the home, and the economic status, quality, and

safety of neighborhoods. Our findings in this regard point to the strong relationship between

parental and adolescent bodyweight, a finding that may reflect both an adolescent’s genetic

predisposition to overweight as well as parental behavior and attitudes regarding nutrition and

the value of physical exercise and recreation. We found evidence that greater parental

educational attainment was associated with a reduced likelihood of male adolescent overweight,
                                                                                        31

and that parental smoking behavior (for both male and female adolescents) was associated with

an increased likelihood of adolescent overweight. By contrast, we found little evidence that

parental employment status measured at a point in time contributed to this outcome.

       Our results for geographic and neighborhood characteristics varied considerably and were

not always in the expected direction for both genders. We found that unsafe neighborhoods were

related to an increased likelihood that a female adolescent would be overweight and that

neighborhoods of poor quality increased the likelihood of both male and female overweight. The

greater availability of fresh food stores reduced the likelihood of male overweight, while more

snack food outlets increased the likelihood of male overweight and the likelihood that a female

would be at risk for overweight or overweight. Finally, for males, we find some evidence that

higher full-service restaurant prices reduced bodyweight and that higher cigarette prices

increased BMI levels.

       These findings suggest that targeting educational efforts at parents who are obese or at

risk for obesity as well as those who engage in poor health habits such as smoking may have

implications for the bodyweight of their children. Additionally, making nutritious food outlets

more widely available might also have an ameliorative effect. Our expenditure results suggest

that such interventions could yield cost savings from reduced medical expenditures, not just in

the future when some of these children become obese adults with costly medical conditions, but

in the short term during their adolescence.

       Finally, our finding that female adolescents who are overweight or at risk for overweight

incur higher mental health expenditures than those of normal weight points to the need for a

better understanding of the nature of causality between adolescent mental health problems and

overweight and its implications for health expenditures. Such an understanding is essential to
                                                                                         32

identify the specific channels through which overweight in female adolescents contributes to an

increase in health care spending. Other research that focuses on the type and intensity of health

care use by overweight adolescents can also contribute to understanding expenditure differentials

by bodyweight class.
