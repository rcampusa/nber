Valuing Incremental Highway Capacity in a Network

                                            ABSTRACT

The importance of increments to an existing highway system depends upon their contributions to the
accessibility provided by the existing network. Nearly 40 years ago, Mohring [1965] suggested this
logic for planning optimal highway investment programs. He argued it could be implemented by measuring
the quasi-rents generated by specific additions to an existing roadway system. This paper uses a unique
set of additions to a loop roadway in metropolitan Phoenix, together with detailed records of housing
sales over the past decade, to meet this need. We find that estimated increases in capitalized housing
values due to four segments added during this period range from 73 to over 273 million dollars per
mile of the roadway addition.

                     Valuing Incremental Highway Capacity in a Network

I. Introduction

        A highway is a network whose economic value depends on its inter-linked

connections. Some links have greater value than others. While this judgment seems like

common sense, to our knowledge no one has measured how specific roadway segments

contribute to a highway network. This task is especially relevant for recent policy debates

about failing infrastructure and how to prioritize spending. One third of the eighty one

billion in spending on infrastructure in the stimulus package under the American

Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is for highway and bridge projects. Yet, there

has been little guidance offered on how to select among competing projects, aside from

the criterion of being ready to start quickly.1

        In October of 1985 Maricopa County voters approved a one half cent sales tax for

twenty years for construction of controlled access highways. Eligibility for the funds

requires that the facilities be part of the county’s Regional Transportation Plan and a

component of the State Highway System. Proposition 400 approved by county voters in

2004 extends the sales tax for another twenty years to 2025. These tax resources are for

projects that involve new freeways, widening of existing freeways, and for bus and high

speed rail. A current example of one of these projects is a proposed new segment of the

loop roadway around metropolitan Phoenix -- the South Mountain Freeway. The Arizona

1 A recent article in the New York Times suggests policies favoring new highways over repair as well

as a willingness on the part of state officials to divert transportation funds for other projects have
contributed to the poor conditions for roadways in New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey. The
assessment indicates setting priorities among the maintenance and upgrade needs for the 84,000
miles of roads in this area has been difficult. See Kocieniewski [2009].

                                                   1
Department of Transportation recently recommended scaling back the project with the

planned right of way reduced from ten to eight lanes and a change in route based on

budget shortfalls. Three alternatives are listed for the North-South segment completing

the loop. The original objective of the funding initiative was to improve the roadway

network in the metropolitan area, enhancing overall accessibility. Yet in discussing these

alternatives the costs and community impacts were the primary reasons identified in

describing the changes. All alternatives are implicitly considered equivalent in their

contribution to the network. Figure 1 displays the proposed route alternatives. As the map

displays there are differences in the potential effects of these alternatives on the areas that

are readily linked to the loop network. Our analysis for completed segments suggests that

these types of differences can be important to the value of connector roadways.

       Few lay observers would have difficulty with this conclusion. Nonetheless when

there are public or professional comments on these types of changes it has not been

possible to offer more than an informal question –how does this affect overall

performance of the system? Recently Greenstone [2009] has argued that our current

system for evaluating regulations is “broken”. He suggests that:



       “It is largely based on faith, rather than evidence. The efficacy of many

       regulations is never assessed. Many others are only evaluated before they are

       implemented—the point when we know the least about them.” (pp. 111-112)



He calls for a culture of persistent experimentation and evaluation. In the context of

public investment policies his suggestion was first made and illustrated by Haveman



                                              2
[1972]. Indeed his ex post assessment of water resource investments confirmed

Greenstone’s intuition, concluding that:



       “…this study has demonstrated a need to seriously reappraise the procedures of

       benefit cost analysis as practiced by agencies. Unless procedures are constantly

       revised on the basis of performance feedback from existing undertakings, the

       credibility of ex ante analysis will, and should, be challenged.” (p. 111)



This research was developed to respond to these calls current (and early) for ex post

assessment. While we don’t know that there was formal benefit-cost analysis of the

roadway segments we evaluate, it is nonetheless possible to develop an ex post evaluation

of their effects and to suggest how it can be used to enhance future ex ante assessments of

projects similar to our example of the South Mountain Freeway.

       One of the early leaders in transportation economics, Herbert Mohring [1965],

provides a conceptual basis for using ex ante analysis in setting priorities. He suggested

that segment specific measures of the quasi rents associated with additions to capacity

were needed as part of the design and evaluation of policies to maximize the benefits

from a highway network. He argued that pricing and investment decisions should take

into account the differential economic importance of the links in highways as a part of

networks. Much of the literature since that time has grappled with the congestion pricing

component of his two decision criteria (see Parry [2009] or an overview). However, his

recommendation to add capacity based on the incremental value of such investments has

not. The only research that is close to meeting this challenge is an early effort by Keeler



                                             3
and Small [1977] that used engineering estimates of the relationship between speed and

highway capacity in reducing congestion. It was primarily intended to estimate ex ante

tolls assuming optimal capacity. Their analysis did not consider the quasi rents for

specific highway segments, evaluating instead the effect of measures of capacity and tolls

on congestion for different roadways in the San Francisco Bay Area.

          A hedonic property value model might seem a natural possibility for

implementing Mohring’s proposal, especially in situations where one can observe

housing prices before and after a new road segment is introduced. However, the dual

challenges of selecting a proxy measure for how a highway segment influences land

values and uncovering an instrument that convincingly identifies the change in property

value due to each new segment have proved difficult. Even if these tasks are addressed

successfully, there remains a concern about the economic interpretations of what is

measured.2 Thus, it should not be surprising to find that this literature is so incomplete.

          Fortunately circumstances in Phoenix, Arizona offer an opportunity to exploit the

pattern of residential development in relation to new highway segments to address all

three concerns. We use four new highway segments developed between 2000 and 2007 to

estimate the effect of freeway additions as separate treatments influencing residential

housing values. We estimate subdivision fixed effects to control for unobservable

attributes of neighborhoods and of the households that select them. Within a Tiebout

framework, we expect households with similar preferences for neighborhood features to

sort into similar subdivisions. Under the assumption that the distribution of these

unobservables in a subdivision does not change over the relatively short time periods

spanned by each of the intervals associated with the highway additions in our analysis, a

2   See Kuminoff and Pope [2010] and Klaiber and Smith [2009] for further discussion.

                                                   4
two step regression model can be used to estimate the treatment effect of highway

additions. Our application matches the conditions discussed in Starrett’s [1981] classic

analysis of land markets for full internal capitalization of projects yielding local public

goods. By using a set of hedonic models, each estimating fixed effects for highway

segments in each time period, we are able to: estimate the relative value of each new

highway link; control for unobserved land uses affecting private homes at the subdivision

level; and use a feasible GLS estimator to take account of the covariance structures for

the estimated fixed effects in each time period.

       Section two develops the context for interpreting estimates of the residential land

capitalization of new highway segments as measures of the incremental benefits

generated by additions to a local highway network. Section three summarizes the key

elements of our estimating model. It also describes the data used in measuring the

segment specific capitalization effects. Section four presents the findings and discusses

their role in contributing to metropolitan Phoenix’s loop road system. In the last section

we consider two issues. The first concerns whether our method is unique to Phoenix due

to the specialized nature of these roadway projects in relation to the residential

development in the area. Second, we discuss the next steps in using roadway and

residential data similar to Phoenix to develop measures of the ex ante benefits of

alternative roadway projects such as would be associated with the South Mountain

project.



II. Land Capitalization and Highway Quasi-Rents

A. Background



                                              5
          The use of housing prices to estimate the marginal willingness to pay for changes

in spatial amenities has a long history.3 Four strategies are currently used to address these

issues. Each has a mix of data requirements and maintained assumptions. The first

approach is the traditional one using a single cross section of housing sales to estimate a

hedonic price function. In the absence of additional information, this strategy is often

criticized because the information available is regarded as incomplete. An equilibrium

reflects households sorting among locations for some of the reasons that analysts can

measure and due to factors that may not be readily observable. These two sets of

influences (i.e. the observed and unobserved factors impacting the equilibrium) may well

be interrelated. The result is a reasonable prospect for biased estimates of the effects that

we seek to measure. This result follows because the factors that cannot be measured and

are omitted are also often correlated with those that can be observed.

          A second, reduced form, approach also uses housing prices but relies on external

events and spatial fixed effects to resolve the dual challenges of unobservables and

identification. The external change must be related to the amenity of interest and serves

to identify its effect.4 It relies on convincing arguments and extensive documentation that

the external event plays the hypothesized role (see Angrist and Pischke [2010] for

arguments for this approach and its impact). The third approach proposed by Bajari and

Benkard [2005] substitutes structural information for the external event. In their scheme a

structural representation of the choice process allows point estimates to be derived for the

marginal rate of substitution for the attribute of interest relative to the numeraire good. As

Bishop and Timmins [2008] note, this approach yields point estimates of the relevant


3   See Palmquist [2005] for a review.
4   See Davis [2003], Chay and Greenstone [2005] and Pope [2009] as examples.

                                                  6
marginal rate of substitution (MRS) conditional on the assumed preference function and

the way each application introduces preference heterogeneity. In the simplest cases each

tradeoff rate is assumed to be fixed for each household. It can vary across households but

does not vary with the amount of the attribute. As a result, the Bajari and Benkard logic

must impose restrictions on the hedonic price function to avoid inconsistencies in the

households’ implied choices and the conditions for constrained utility maximization.5

        The fourth set of methods involves full structural models using either a vertical or

horizontal specification for preferences (see Klaiber and Smith [2009] for a review). This

approach does not escape the need for instruments.6 Nonetheless, there is a set of

maintained assumptions required by these structural models as well.

        Thus, the four methods yield different types of information and impose different

assumptions that are unlikely to be testable within a single application. We would like to

be able to interpret these differences in prices in relationship to the tradeoffs people

would make to acquire the spatial (or temporal) difference hypothesized to lead to the

price change.

        Kuminoff and Pope [2010] demonstrate that developing an economic

interpretation for estimates of capitalization is not straight forward. Extending models by

Tinbergen [1956] and Epple [1987], they find that the size of the change in the spatial

attribute and the heterogeneity in both the supply of alternatives as well as in the

household preferences, are all important to the interpretation of capitalized price changes

measured in response to exogenous events. Moreover, their empirical examples reinforce

5 Kuminoff [2009] has demonstrated how the selection of a preference function and a specific
distribution for the parameters associated with unobserved heterogeneity are used to augment the
information we can recover from households’ locational choices in identifying the parameters
estimated in sorting models.

  Often the features of the equilibrium and assumptions about sorting suggest possible candidates.

                                                 7
the importance of these general conclusions. In related work Klaiber and Smith [2009]

used the assignment framework exploited by Cropper, Deck, and McConnell [1988] in

evaluating specification issues with hedonic models. Their focus was on assessing the

relationship between measures for housing price capitalization and the “true” general

equilibrium (GE) willingness to pay. They found the spatial extent of the market for those

affected by changes in spatial amenities was important to the discrepancy between

hedonic estimates of the capitalization of exogenous changes in land use and GE

willingness to pay.

       In the current analysis the empirical model exploits a combination of spatial

controls, using subdivision level fixed effects, and temporal controls based on the

exogenous events associated with the completion dates for each specific highway

segment. Both sources of information allow us to identify the effects of each new

highway segment on land values as measured thru shifts in subdivision fixed effects.

Given we can accept the assumptions of Starrett’s internal capitalization model these

price differentials can be interpreted as estimates of the average household’s willingness

to pay for each new highways segment.



B. What Does Capitalization Measure for Roadway Segments?

       Starrett [1981] identified two types of capitalization as conceptual extremes.

External capitalization derives from forces between communities. Internal capitalization

is associated with forces inside communities. Internal is the most relevant concept for

local public goods where proximity to the public good matters. Starrett used highways as

one of his examples of local public goods relevant to internal capitalization. We can



                                             8
adapt his basic conceptual framework to explain how residential housing capitalization

captures the economic value of increments to highway capacity. Our model begins at the

household level. Each household is assumed to have a preference function, Ui(.), that

includes a measure of the public good associated with the highway system, q, and a

measure of that household’s use of the system, g, along with the amount of land, l, and a

numeraire good, x. The location of links to the network will affect the cost of a trip and

the value of q.

         The household decision process envisions a conditional choice of g and l (land)

given a selection of each location from a discrete set of alternatives. We label these

potential locational choices as neighborhoods. In our empirical application we implement

the model by defining a neighborhood to be a subdivision. Maximizing equation (1) for

each location (where the budget constraint is substituted into the function for the

numeraire, x) defines a conditional indirect utility function, s(.) for each neighborhood

(s).



            , , ,                ,                                                    (1)

where:

mi = household income                         ,

Ti = a head tax on each household

f(.) = cost of highway use (assumed the same for all households and a function of

location)

rs = rental price of land in location s




                                             9
         There will be no internal capitalization if the conditional indirect utility function

derived from this choice problem, vsi, is independent of the neighborhood. There must be

a spatial distinction before and after each project that adds to the highway system for a

welfare interpretation of price capitalization using this model. Following Starrett and

assuming preferences are quasi linear in the numeraire and additively separable with q

and g entering one component, land another, the envelop condition can be used to define

cases that preclude internal capitalization. These situations arise when the expression

defined in equation (2) is independent of s. We start by identifying this case as an

extreme. It helps to explain situations where the equilibrium admits capitalization. When

the indirect utility function is independent of the neighborhood, then there is no scope for

the rent to adjust to q. There is no spatial differentiation across neighborhoods and the

effects of a change in the public good are independent of the neighborhood selected.

When rents do differ by neighborhood, they change with q, equation (2) describes the

tradeoffs households in each neighborhood would make in equilibrium (s and m are

neighborhoods in equation (2)).7



                  ,                                    ,                  ,                  (2)




As Starrett explains



         “There are two principal assumptions which taken together guarantee project

         benefits will be translated to land rents through the intensive margin. The first is

 ls s based on the preceding text.
    dq

                                                 10
        that all the benefits of the project must be ‘intramarginal’ in that boundary

        residents are marginally unaffected. …The second necessary assumption is that

        residents do not tend to sort themselves out within the town according to their

        relative preference for the public good.” (pp 313-314), emphasis added.



The first assumption amounts to saying we can identify a control community where the

public good has no effect on the residents. He refers to these as boundary communities.

The second refers to an absence of within community preference heterogeneity in tastes

for public goods.8

        In this setting Starrett first proposes considering the change in land rents for the

boundary community in response to a change in q to measure a project’s benefits. With

the assumption that land in the community is owned by local residents (as opposed to

rented), the analysis must consider the effects of increases in demand for land across all

neighborhoods and adjust for the effects of that change in recovering the differential

change due to q for the neighborhoods assumed to be impacted. These are the treated

subdivisions in our empirical model.

        We can adapt equation (2) using the definition of the boundary community

(labeled with the subscript       ), together with the household sorting that leads to

equalization of the net contribution to utility and defines equilibrium adjustments due to a

change in q.




8 In contrast, structural sorting models permit diversity in preferences within a community because

it is recovered as a maintained distributional assumption. The specific form of the joint distribution
of income and tastes is used, along with the properties of the equilibrium to identify the parameters
describing the heterogeneity.

                                                  11
        ,                        ,                                                     (3)




The first term on the right side of equation (3) is zero because      is a boundary

community. The second term (          ) will depend on whether the project affects the

overall demand for land. If it does, then we have the general form of a difference in

difference model in equation (4).



                            ,                                                          (4)




The left side of this expression describes the difference in the change in land prices due to

project for the affected community (s) compared to the change in land prices due to the

overall demand changes (and other factors potentially) induced indirectly by the project

for the boundary (or control) community (  ), where we assume households experience

no gain due to the change in q. This formulation clearly displays that two differences are

needed. The project’s impact (and the change in q due to it) for the communities that

experience the gain and the indirect effects on controls that do not experience gains (due

to area wide changes in the demand for land).

       If we further expand the model and allow for preference heterogeneity within

communities (a situation that was assumed away in the basic development), Starrett

argues that land rents will tend to undercapitalize the benefits of a change in q. This result

follows, in part, from a stability condition for the town structure. For our purposes, we

must assume that households are homogeneous within each neighborhood. To do


                                             12
otherwise, as we discuss at the close of the paper, requires a structural model with

maintained assumptions characterizing household heterogeneity. Our estimates for the

effect of the additions to the highway network assume that the roadway effects can take

two forms. In our basic model the effect is constant for each neighborhood. In the second

specification the effect varies based on the inverse distance to the highway segment. For

the remaining terms in the model, Starrett’s separability assumptions assure that there is

no adjustment in response to changes in q.

        The effects of roadways in our application are not continuous. They are assumed

to be capitalized at the subdivision level. The ability to distinguish these subdivisions

from assessor records is important to our strategy for identifying the incremental

willingness to pay for enhanced accessibility. In Phoenix the homes in each of the

subdivisions have lot sizes that are approximately equal. This feature implies that once

households select a neighborhood, sorting assures they will have comparable demands for

lot size as well as all the other attributes conveyed by that subdivision. We assumed in

our model that households’ costs of using the roadway, as represented by f(.), were the

same.

        As we noted the measure in (4) requires two things: (1) home sales and the

identification of their locations in subdivisions and (2) a change in accessibility due to

changes in highway segments (i.e. the dq). Without this change in roadway segments we

don’t have a difference in accessibility that can be distinguished from the subdivision

fixed effect. We have instead the equivalent of what Starrett intends to be measured with

(lsrs-lσrσ) given the lot size features of subdivisions in Phoenix. In his framework the

other features of houses (and lots) are held constant. The only reason for land rents to



                                             13
differ across neighborhoods (or in our case subdivisions) is due to differences in the

amount of q available to households who live in each. To measure the effects of changes

in q we need some basis for measuring how rs and rσ change with q. Thus, adding the

ability to observe these subdivision effects over time with the completion of new

roadway segments provides this opportunity. (i.e. measuring                     ).

        We can measure these changes by having access to information on housing sales

before and after each highway segment’s completion and opening. Thus, a difference in

these fixed effects with each opening or, equivalently, a difference in differences

approximates the left side of equation (4). Sorting assures all other contributions that

would distinguish partial and general equilibrium effects are at the ex post equilibrium

values. If we assume an algebraic relationship between the proximity of a subdivision to

completed roadways, then our strategy of using subdivision fixed effects over time

together with this measure can be interpreted as a variant of the Athey and Imbens[2006]

change in changes approach to measuring the effects of the treatment.

        Overall, then, our empirical model tests the internal capitalization condition

directly. The subdivision fixed effects measure the contribution to the housing prices in a

neighborhood as a result of each house’s location in that area. These effects account for

the unobserved factors that distinguish home prices in a particular neighborhood from all

others, after controlling for house attributes, the lot size, and other observables. If

measures of highway segments fail to be significantly related to the subdivision effects’

changes over time, then we conclude that there was no new internal capitalization.

        Of course, one might argue that roadways are planned long in advance and, once

the path is known, the value of accessibility should already be capitalized into the


                                              14
subdivision fixed effects. Certainly it is true that roadways require significant lead time.

However, the anticipated effects measure ex ante beliefs that cannot be recovered using

subdivision fixed effects without additional information. We seek to estimate what people

believe they would be obtaining. 9 Diversity in beliefs would not necessarily be

reconciled thru sorting, though it is reasonable to expect those with the strongest

preferences for access would move first. These expectations should make it more difficult

for us to estimate the ex post general equilibrium effect. If households perfectly

anticipated the gains (there were no unanticipated general equilibrium effects due to

access), then there should not be a significant change in subdivision fixed effects for the

treatment group (those with increased accessibility due to the new roadway) compared to

the change in those for the control neighborhoods between the time spans involved.

        As we noted earlier, internal capitalization also requires that the benefits are

“intra-marginal.” Starrett explains that in cases like ours this condition means that some

neighborhoods realize no gains from increments to the local public good. In our case it

translates into an assumption that not all subdivisions within the overall area benefit from

each new highway segment. This assumption means that we need to define a set of

subdivisions that serve as controls in both spatial and temporal terms. In practice this

requirement implies we assume that at some distance from a new segment the roadway’s

role in creating increased access to the network has no value. This condition is consistent

with the features of a loop roadway that provides a highway network within a

metropolitan area but is not enhancing connections to outside metropolitan areas. The

highway segments we selected were (from the planning descriptions) intended to serve

that estimates the ex ante negative effect of a highway.

metropolitan Phoenix, but do not change the area’s accessibility to other more distant

population centers. We assume the added segments have primarily a local value and will

be important to subdivisions near it. To meet this condition we impose a three mile

threshold for effects as a maintained hypothesis for our second step estimates.10

         When these conditions are satisfied the incremental benefits of additions to a

public good are measured by residential land capitalization. These increments could be

used to estimate the net quasi-rents due to the project. Starrett’s proof of this result makes

strong assumptions about preferences and assumes the lump sum taxes imposed on

households cover the incremental costs of the increases to public goods and that

household income includes profit shares, rental income on land, and labor earnings, with

the latter unaffected by increments to q.11

         While these are important maintained assumptions in his general capitalization

result, our strategy uses them as a starting point for interpreting the empirical results. We

do not argue that our findings offer measures of the aggregate quasi-rents for highway

segments. Instead we suggest they offer a basis for ranking the segments and discuss in

the closing section some strategies for extending the analysis for ex ante assessment of

these aggregate quasi rents.



III. Empirical Model and Data

A. Empirical Model

10
   We investigated the sensitivity of our results to alternative specifications of this threshold and the basic
conclusions are maintained. In particular, we examined a 5 mile cutoff and found that magnitudes of
parameters decreased, but signs and significance were maintained.
11
   There are differences in property tax rates across some of the municipalities and school districts within
our study area, Maricopa County, but these will also be controlled with our subdivision fixed effects.
Moreover, the roadways are paid thru county wide sales taxes not property taxes directly associated with
the roadways

                                                      16
         Our analysis uses on a two step hedonic property value model. Separate first-stage

models are estimated for housing sales in each of five periods – a control time span

before the new roadways are completed and four other periods with time spans defined

by the sequential dates for the opening of each of the four highway segments. Our sample

includes all subdivisions with at least 13 sales per time period. Each model includes a full

set of variables describing the homes’ characteristics and the attributes conveyed by

location as well as fixed effects identifying the subdivisions in each time span. Equation

(5) specifies the general form for the first-stage hedonic model specification, a semi-log

equation. It maintains that the housing sales price, (Pi) is a function of housing and lot

characteristics, a monthly time index, and subdivision fixed effects.



ln            ∑           ∑                                                           (5)

where:

t = identifies the time periods for each sample

cji = designates housing and lot characteristics

ski = corresponds to subdivision fixed effects

Mt = monthly time trend

i = unobserved error



The second step “stacks” the five sets of estimates for the subdivision fixed effects in a

single sample to allow these effects to be used to estimate the effects of two different

characterizations of roadway effects on the homes in each subdivision. The model is an

unbalanced panel with different subdivisions affected by the highway segments in each


                                             17
time interval.12 When subdivisions appear in repeated sub-samples over time the

qualitative terms for highway segments are coded so that they influence land values (thru

the subdivision fixed effects) from the point of completion of the roadway until the end

of the sample period. Equation (6) specifies the estimated subdivision fixed effects to be

a function of an indicator variable that identifies subdivisions that satisfy two conditions.

They are within three miles of each new roadway segment and the sales were after that

highway segment opened. The model also includes a fixed effect to capture noise and dis-

amenity attributed to subdivisions within 1,500 feet of a highway segment. This effect is

interacted with the timing fixed effect. Finally a measure of distance to the central

business district is included.

         We consider the proximity to each highway segment in two different formats: (a)

the primary model is a fixed effect for the subdivisions within three miles of the roadway

segment (this corresponds to what we labeled earlier as the difference in differences

effect); and (b) the second uses the inverse distance to the roadway truncated to zero at 3

miles (this approach is a variation on the Athey and Imbens change in changes model).

This formulation gauges the sensitivity of our findings to treating the highway effect as

fixed.13 After each roadway opens these variables (and the fixed effects identifying

subdivisions adjacent to each segment) are assumed to continue to exert an influence on

the subdivisions’ contribution to housing sales prices.




12
   In addition to different segments, it is possible that we might not observe a minimum of 13 sales within a
subdivision for some time periods. Either outcome would remove a subdivision from the housing sales
included in the first step model and thus the corresponding subdivision fixed effect for the time period in
which this occurs.
13 As noted in footnote #10 we also tested using a greater distance threshold and found comparable

effects to those reported here.

                                                     18
            ∑                    ∑                                                             (6)

     = corresponds to either the dummy variable for the distance interval (or the inverse

distance of road segment l from subdivision k for the robustness check)

     = 1 if the road segment was opened in the time period defining interval t or in a

        previous time period

      = 0 otherwise

      = 1 if the subdivision was adjacent to a completed highway segment during the

        period

      = 0 otherwise

        = distance of subdivision k to the central business district.



        Our two step strategy requires that we have estimates of both the fixed effects and

their covariance structure. By applying a Cholesky decomposition to each estimated

covariance structure for the fixed effects from each first stage model, the variables in

equation (6) may be transformed so that the feasible generalized least squares estimator

required for the second stage model can be derived using ordinary least squares with the

transformed “stacked” data.14 This decomposition is especially convenient because there

are over 15,000 subdivisions included in the full sample over all five sub-periods.

        Equation (6) hypothesizes two types of effects for the treated subdivisions. The

first assumes that once a highway opens all homes experience a constant percentage

increment due to increased access to the roadway network. This effect persists thru time


14The estimated parameters are based on each sub period and transformed using the relevant
Cholesky matrix for the estimated covariance structure for each sub period and then stacked. This
result follows because the covariance matrix for the feasible GLS applied to the pooled set of fixed
effects is assumed to be block diagonal.

                                                  19
as subsequent segments open due to the definition of the time fixed effect (Dlrt). For

subdivisions adjacent to a segment there may well be dis-amenity effects due to noise or

pollution. Changes in land uses near segments such as strip malls or commercial

structures could also be expected to influence these subdivision terms. The fixed effects

identifying adjacent subdivisions will capture the net impact of all of these influences.

       In a second specification, we consider the possibility of spillover effects between

highway segments. To describe how this was implemented it is important to outline the

spatial structure of the changes in the highway system and then describe how interactions

between segments were hypothesized to alter the contribution of each new segment to the

accessibility of each subdivision to other areas within the metropolitan area.

       During this time span several major loop freeways in the Phoenix area were

completed. This overall process for expanding the loop roadway involved four major

segments. Figure 2 displays the segments with color coding for the Price segment

(green), the Pima (blue), Santan (black) and connector (red). The southern segment of

Loop 101 (Price) connecting the cities of Tempe and Chandler was completed in

December 2000. The northern segment (Pima) connecting Scottsdale to Tempe was

completed in April 2002. Another project linking the Loop 101 with Interstate 10, a

major interstate, opened in November 2003 (connector). The second loop roadway, Loop

202, opened in June 2006 with the completion of a 12 mile segment of the Loop 202

joining the southern section of the Loop 202 Freeway linking Loop 101 and US 60

through the cities of Chandler and Gilbert (Santan).

       A closer look at the segment labeled Price indicates that it is along the eastern

boundary of Phoenix. It is a north-south segment linking the southern (and middle)



                                             20
residential areas to the major east-west connectors (i.e. Route 10 and 60). The Pima

component completes this north-south link providing access to and from Scottsdale and

provides an east-west thoroughfare connecting at the northern edge of the metro area. Our

spillover hypothesis suggests that completing the Pima segment may change the value of

the Price segment. A similar argument could be applied to the Price connector and Santan

segments along the southern boundary providing another east-west link to Interstate

Route 10. These effects are tested by introducing different sets of interactions of the

separate fixed effects for each roadway segment.



B. Data and First Stage Results

       Our application involves over 600,000 sales of private homes in Maricopa County

from January 1, 1999 to June 30, 2007. Table 1 identifies the time period corresponding

to each completed segment, the number of subdivisions that had sales affected by each

highway segment, as well as the control time period. Table 2 provides two sets of

summary statistics. The top panel describes the characteristics of the properties involved

in housing sales. This includes the mean, standard deviation, the minimum, and the

maximum values for price and variables describing the characteristics of each house. In

addition it includes the distance between the centroid for each house and the roadway

segments. The bottom panel describes the features of the subdivisions included in our

sample. It reports the average number as well as the size of the smallest and largest

subdivision and the years they were built.

       Table 3 provides estimates of the hedonic price equations for each time period.

The values in bold designate the estimated parameters that were significantly different



                                             21
from zero with p-values of 0.10 or less. Following many previous hedonic studies, our

specification includes quadratic effects for age, lot size, and house size. Overall, the

effects of housing attributes were quite stable over the eight years comprising our sample

period and generally agree with our expectations for the effects of each of these structural

variables. The relative stability of the estimated parameters over time suggests that these

coefficients reflect the construction costs during the period. Locational effects of where

houses are placed are captured by the subdivision fixed effects. We do not report specific

estimates for the fixed effects for the subdivisions estimated separately for each time

period.

          We selected two roadway segments-Price and Pima and developed kernel density

estimates for the fixed effects (using the three mile threshold) to identify treated and

control subdivisions in each time period. Figure 3 displays the results for the first

roadway segment to be completed, the Price, and Figure 4 is the Pima segment. In each

figure we display the density estimated for the treated (blue) and control (red) subdivision

fixed effects by sub-period and for the overall sample. The effects of each roadway on the

values of the affected subdivisions are clearest using the sub-period plots. For the Price in

sub-periods 3, 4, and 5 there is a clear displacement of the treated subdivisions to yield

larger estimated changes in the fixed effects than the control compared to the base time

period. This is the distinction that our second stage model isolates for each roadway

segment. The second stage model acknowledges that the fixed effects are not

independently estimated and takes account of these correlations with the feasible

generalized least squares estimator. These sample kernel density estimates assume




                                             22
independence. Nonetheless these simple graphs are useful in providing a general idea of

what the second stage models are capturing.

       The Pima kernel estimates display the shift in fixed effects for this roadway

segment as well. There is no period two in this case because the first time period after this

roadway was completed is our period three. All three periods for the Pima display a shift

and the full time period (in the last panel) more clearly displays the treatment effect. As

we discuss in the next section, the connector and the Santan segments do not have as

large an influence as the Pima and Price. As a result, we do not report kernel density

estimates for them.

       Figures 5a thru 5d display the clustering of the subdivisions that are serving as the

treated cases for each highway segment (in red) and the controls (in black). As the figures

confirm there is a clear delineation of the treatments used for each segment.



IV. Estimates of the Incremental Values for New Highway Segments

       Table 4 presents five different specifications of the second stage model. The first

panel is the simplest model with the fixed effect terms for each roadway, including

whether the subdivision is within three miles of roadway segment and the time period for

the hedonic model was after the completion of the segment. This simplest specification

also identifies whether a subdivision was adjacent to the segment and includes the

distance to the Central Business District (CBD). The second panel includes these

variables along with interaction effects to consider spillover effects that are associated

with directional spillovers. The third panel focuses on spillovers that focus on connection

effects between new and existing roadway segments. The fourth includes all fixed effects



                                             23
and interaction variables. The last is a robustness check replacing the fixed effects with

the inverse distance between subdivisions and relevant roadway segments.

       Our primary focus is on the estimates treating the highway as a fixed effect with

an implied constant mean effect (in percentage terms) for the subdivisions impacted by

each new highway segment. Regardless of whether the fixed effect (the first panel) or the

inverse distance (fifth panel) is used, there is a clear ranking of the contributions of

different highway segments to housing prices, with the north / south Pima segment the

most important, increasing housing prices by about twenty four percent. The Price/10

connector has the second largest impact that is significant and stable, indicating a thirteen

percent increase in housing prices for homes in a subdivision near this segment after it

was completed. The remaining segments also have significant effects on the subdivision’s

contributions to prices with a mean effect of seven percent for the Santan segment and

about four percent for the Price segment.

       The models considering spillover effects are defined using interaction terms under

a “directional” or “connection” based rationale. These interactions are only significant

when they involve the Price segments. They do not appear to alter the overall effect for

composites of the completed roadway segment, suggesting that the simpler formulation

offers the best description of the highway segments’ effects. That is, assuming separate

fixed effects offers the best guide to the relative importance of each highway component.

The fixed effects for adjacent impacts are only statistically significant for the north /

south Pima segment using the full fixed effects specification. This effect reflects a large

set of land use changes that took place in the areas around this segment because of its

enhanced accessibility. Figure 5a illustrates the location of the subdivisions along this



                                              24
segment. There has also been significant commercial development in this area that

closely aligns with the roadway. The composite of these two impacts on the adjacent

subdivisions is reflected in these fixed effects.

       The last component of our analysis is in the fifth panel of Table 4. We estimate no

spillover (i.e. interactions between segments) model replacing a fixed effect for

subdivisions within each roadway segment with the inverse distance for the centroid of

the subdivision in relation to the closest point of the roadway. This term is interacted with

the fixed effect identifying when each segment opened (i.e. the       in equation (6)).

       Two conclusions emerge from this gauge of the sensitivity of our findings. First,

as we noted at the outset of this discussion of findings, our conclusions about the ranking

and statistical significance of these new roadway effects remain stable for the segments

with the largest effects. Second, when we evaluate the estimates at the mean of the

inverse distance for the treated subdivision in our sample, the estimated average effect is

consistent but smaller compared to what we found with the models that assumed the

effects were constant. Only the Santan and Price display results that switch order of

importance and these would not be significant differences. More specifically, the

estimates at the mean values for the inverse distance are: 12 percent for Pima, 5 percent

for the connector to the Price, 2.3 percent for the Santan and 2.5 percent for the Price

segment.

       Our adaptation of Starrett’s model suggests the difference in differences logic

recovers increments that reflect the sorting response of households to each neighborhood

after each change. These estimates provide the ex post increments to the willingness to

pay attributable to each roadway’s contribution to accessibility. At an aggregate level



                                              25
they are approximate because we are using the average proportionate change together

with the average house price to estimate average increments.15 At best then, the results

should be interpreted as ranking the segments. In Table 5 we report a simple

approximation using the percentage increment for each roadway segment and the average

of the sales prices in the affected subdivisions to provide an order of magnitude measure

of these effects in comparison to the costs for each roadway segment.

           As cautioned earlier these are not estimates of aggregate quasi rents. We are

gauging the size of the overall effects to judge whether small percentage effects on the

average subdivision for some roadway segments considered together with the number of

houses in these neighborhoods would change the ranking due to the number of affected

properties. In our case they would. The top ranked roadway segment remains unchanged

but the ordering of the others would be affected. This finding reinforced the need to

consider measuring both the average treatment effect and assessing the size of the

impacted area in the design of ex post evaluations. While there are many assumptions to

interpret these as benefit measures, for many purposes even the aggregate capitalized

value of specific segments offers sufficient information to gauge the importance of the

roadway segments.

           Table 5 provides the elements that contribute to our estimate of aggregate changes

to evaluate our segment ranking. The first two columns report the number of houses near

each segment and those defined as adjacent to the roadway. Recall our estimates

15   i.e. if ∆q; is the change in accessibility due to segment j, then the WTPi for household i would be:
                              ∆ ,      , ,                                ,
                           , , ,                   ,
Where * and ~ identify the differences in the utilization and land with and without the increased
accessibility implied by q j .



                                                        26
suggested that subdivisions near the roadway gained relative to controls but the gain was

reduced somewhat if these areas had homes that were adjacent to the roadway. Hence

both factors need to be considered in computing the increment to an aggregate for each

highway segment. The next four columns report the number of sales and average prices

for home affected by each highway segment. These are taken from the treated

subdivisions. We distinguish whether they are near or adjacent to the highway. The

seventh column reports our estimate for aggregate increment to evaluate our ranking

based on fixed effects alone.

        If we use them as an order of magnitude gauge of the importance of the roadway

segments and compare them to the costs of each segment, we would conclude that all

have had impacts on land values that clearly exceed their costs.16

        Ideally, a full benefit cost analysis would includea more complete accounting of

who gains and loses. As Mohring [1961] suggested, there are both gainers and losers

across each metro area. Starrett’s model assumes any income effects of capitalization will

be reflected in the bids for residential properties. We suspect, due to the rapid population

growth during the period of our sample’s transactions, that these roadways influenced the

placement of new subdivisions and thus channeled growth of residential housing. Our use

of controls to capture the boundary effects takes account of some of these influences.

Real housing prices in other areas probably did not decline over this period. The influx of

new households may have been responsible for avoiding a relative decline in real prices

for the areas that might have failed to gain access to the overall area during the period we


16
  Cost estimates are obtained from yearly certification reports prepared by the Arizona Department of
Transportation. These reports show the progression of the freeway system as well as the costs for each
segment. When possible, we use the cost associated with segments under construction rather than the
estimated pre-construction costs.

                                                   27
study. This is why Starrett’s argument to consider the effects of overall land demands on

the boundary community’s land values is important to detecting the net effect of each

highway segment. A structural model would be needed to judge how these aggregate

approximations relate to the quasi-rents for these segments during this period. 17



V. Implications

        Mohring’s [1965] call for greater attention to marginal cost pricing and economic

principles in managing existing roadways and in evaluating increments to their capacity

seems especially relevant to today’s policy climate where increased infrastructure

investment is viewed as especially important as a stimulus for aggregate economic

activity and as a long term need for economic growth. Research considering the

implementation of Mohring’s proposal for evaluating highway investments has been

virtually non-existent.

        We argued that Starrett’s capitalization results can provide an effective rational

for measuring the gains (at the subdivision level) due to highway segments that generate

primarily local benefits within a metropolitan network. Our example is based on key

segments added to the loop roadways around metro Phoenix between 2000 and 2007. An

important question is whether it is possible to exploit the results from this type of analysis

to evaluate the ex ante incremental benefits from potential additions to other roadway

systems.

        We answer this question in two ways. First, for Metropolitan Phoenix, which

recently extended the ½ cent sales tax 20 years to fund expansion of the freeway system,


17All of these areas experienced significant price declines after the end of our sample period. There is
no reason to believe that these effects eliminated the relative value of segments near each roadway.

                                                  28
our results help provide guidance for the best types of roadways to target for additional

infrastructure spending. In fact, the first roadway targeted for the expansion of HOV

lanes was the Pima Freeway, consistent with our findings that this roadway is associated

with the largest capitalized benefit.

       In terms of using our results to inform policymakers in other areas, our results are

not likely to translate directly. However, there is a link between the way Starrett posed

the question of internal capitalization and the current generation of vertical sorting

models (see Sieg et al [2004]) that may be worth pursuing in developing a calibrated land

valuation model for this task. Starrett’s neighborhood effects are similar to the effects of

local public goods in the Epple-Sieg [1999] vertical sorting model. That is, in these

models, the equilibrium conditions under the assumption preferences satisfy the single

crossing condition imply housing prices and public goods are linked. The nature of the

link depends on the preference specification. For the case of the CES function used in

Sieg et.al [2004] there is a simple updating rule linking neighborhood price indexes and

the neighborhood specific public goods. The relation exploits the ascending bundle

property of the equilibrium. This condition assures neighborhoods will be ranked the

same way if compared by housing (or land) prices or an index of public goods. Thus, the

prices and public goods indexes of adjoining neighborhoods (in the sense of being ranked

together) can be used to structure an updating rule for prices if the public goods change or

to compute the index of local public goods if the prices are different. It is this relationship

that could be used to calibrate preferences.

       A sketch of the logic would proceed as follows. We would need to observe

housing prices before and after a highway project to estimate price indexes for a set of



                                               29
neighborhoods comprising the choice set relevant for the market equilibrium in the area

where we would like to project the benefit of the improvement. The new location’s

application need not have the level of experimental detail distinguishing treatment and

control neighborhoods, as in the case of our Phoenix example. It would require the before

and after price indexes, and measures of the neighborhoods used to get the relationship to

the new roadway. Under these conditions, the estimated effects of new roadway

proximity from Phoenix could be used as relative values in the new location—a

calibration would attempt to use them in a public goods index to estimate the post project

prices.

          Klaiber and Smith [forthcoming] have found support for a vertical sorting model

for Maricopa County based on local school quality using school districts as the basic

choice alternatives. Augmenting it to reflect our findings here would require significant

additional information and qualifying “ifs” and assumptions. Nonetheless, the basic point

is that using the structural foundation of the internal capitalization model is one way to

extend the results where the conditions associated with highway developments did not

offer the controls offered by our example.

          Even if this scheme is judged too arbitrary for most highway projects, there is

scope for exploiting Starrett’s internal capitalization within a DD framework. Over the

past decade—rapidly growing areas like Las Vegas, Nevada, the Research Triangle area

of North Carolina and suburban Atlanta, Georgia as well as other areas may well offer

examples where this logic could be replicated to judge the overall viability of Mohring’s

proposal to rank highway projects.
