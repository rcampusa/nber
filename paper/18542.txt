                                              ABSTRACT
A review of the literature suggests that when pension values are measured by the wealth equivalent
of promised DB pension benefits and DC balances for those approaching retirement, pensions account
for more support in retirement than is suggested when their contribution is measured by incomes received
directly from pension plans by those who have already retired. Estimates from the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS) for respondents in their early fifties suggest that pension wealth is about 86 percent as
valuable as Social Security wealth. In data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), for members
of the same cohort, measured when they are 65 to 69, pension incomes are about 56 percent as valuable
as incomes from Social Security. Our empirical analysis uses data from the Health and Retirement
Study to examine the reasons for these differences in the contributions of pensions as measured in
income and wealth data.
A number of factors cause the contribution of pensions to be understated in retirement income data,
especially data from the CPS. One factor is a difference in methodology between surveys affecting
what is included in pension income, especially in the CPS, which ignores irregular payments from
pensions. In CPS data on incomes of those ages 64 to 69 in 2006, pension values are 59 percent of
the value of Social Security. For the same cohort, in HRS data, the pension value is 67 percent of the
value of Social Security benefits.
Some pension wealth “disappears” at retirement because respondents change their pension into other
forms that are not counted as pension income in surveys of income. Altogether, 16 percent of pension
wealth is transformed into some other form at the time of disposition. For those who had a defined
benefit pension just before termination, the dominant plan type for current retirees, at termination 12
percent of the benefit was transformed into a state that would not count as pension income after retirement.
For those who receive benefits soon after termination, there is a 3.5 percent reduction in DB pension
value at termination compared to the year before termination. One reason may be the form of annuitization
that is chosen.
A series of caveats notwithstanding, the bottom line is that CPS data on pension incomes received
in retirement understates the full contribution pensions make to supporting retirees.

         I. Introduction

         The aim of this paper is to increase understanding of the importance of pensions and Social

Security as sources of income and wealth in retirement. We also hope to increase understanding of

pension dynamics as covered individuals proceed from employment through retirement, either collecting

or transforming their pensions.

         We begin by focusing on the apparent discrepancies between published data documenting pension

coverage and plan value between surveys of current workers and surveys of retirees. Consider, for

example, the following simple comparisons: The widely read Social Security publication “Income of the

Population Over 55, 2008,” p. 37, suggests that 39.2 percent of units (couple or single member

households) with at least one member aged 65 to 69 received pension or other retirement benefits beyond

their Social Security. In contrast, data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) suggest that about

three fourths of households from that same cohort had a pension from a current, last or previous job when

they were ages 51 to 56 (Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai, 2010a, Table 5.12), and 52.7 percent of

respondents (not households) had a live pension from a current or previous job (Table 5.11).

         There are analogous differences in plan values. For example, pensions appear to be much more

important relative to Social Security when measured for those approaching retirement in the HRS than

when they are measured among retirees by the Social Security Administration using CPS data. For those

ages 65 to 69, the CPS suggests income from pensions is about 59 percent as large as income from Social

Security.1 In contrast, for a similar population HRS data suggest the current value of expected pensions is

67 percent of the present value of their future Social Security payments. Adding the values of pensions

 Pensions account for 15.1 percent of total income while Social Security represents 25.4 percent of total income. (Social
Security Administration, 2010, p. 316.)

and IRAs, as CPS income data does, in HRS wealth data, the value of pensions and IRAs together is 90

percent of the value of Social Security (Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai, 2010a, Table 12.1A).2

        These differences may result from differences in the importance of pensions vs. Social Security in

income data vs. their importance in wealth data, from differences when measures are taken for households

in their early fifties vs. households in their late sixties or early seventies resulting from disposition of

pensions in intervening years, from differences when expected flows are compared to realized incomes,

from differences in requirements for inclusion of a benefit in CPS vs. HRS data, or for other reasons. Our

goal is to determine the importance of each of these explanations.

        We examine various measures of pensions and Social Security to suggest the importance of

potential reasons for these differences. To determine whether the measured differences in the importance

of pensions vs. Social Security are due to differences between surveys, or are the result of comparing

measures based on incomes with measures based on the wealth equivalents of expected benefits, we do

two things. First, using measures of income received by those ages 65 to 69, we compare the importance

of pension and Social Security income in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) with corresponding data

from the Census. Second, we compare the relative importance of pensions and Social Security when based

on income or expected wealth within one survey, the Health and Retirement Study.

        To isolate the effect of the time in the lifecycle the data are collected, we examine differences in

the relative importance of pensions vs. Social Security using wealth values collected at different stages of

the employment cycle, when workers are on the job and have not yet neared retirement age, just before

retirement, and just after retirement. We also consider differences in wealth when measured based on

expectations as recorded just before retirement vs. payment received, as recorded in the income section of

 A number of studies use data from the Health and Retirement Study to examine the relative importance of pensions and Social
Security wealth as sources of support in retirement. For early studies along these lines, see Gustman, Mitchell, Samwick and
Steinmeier (1999) and Gustman and Steinmeier (1999).


                                                            2
the HRS for individuals who have retired. These latter comparisons are for the same individuals at

different stages of their life cycle.

        It is not a mystery why differences in plan balances might arise when comparing account values

before vs. after retirement, especially among those with a defined contribution (DC) plan. Consider DC

plans from previous employment held by respondents ages 51 to 56 when first observed in 2004.

According to HRS data, more than half these balances are rolled over into an IRA after exit or cashed out

(Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai, 2010b, Table 11.3D). Moreover, the pattern of withdrawals from DC

plans may be very uneven and difficult to detect. Poterba, Venti and Wise (2011) suggest that many

households may put off withdrawals from DC pensions until well after retirement age.

        But DC plans represent a minority of the pension wealth held by those who are currently of

retirement age, even among those who have recently reached retirement age. Among the Early Boomer

cohort in the HRS, those ages 51 to 56 in 2004, defined benefit (DB) plans still account for two thirds of

their pension wealth. In HRS data on pensions held in last or previous jobs, cash outs and roll overs

account for somewhat less than one fifth of the value of DB pensions at the time they are disposed of.

        An obvious question, one that we address in this paper, is whether the pension benefits of those

approaching retirement age are systematically overstated in HRS wealth data. Could it be that the

discrepancies between reported pension coverage and plan values, especially DB plan values, are the

result of reporting error, presumably by workers who have not yet focused on their pensions? After all,

there is ample evidence of reporting error in plan coverage and in plan value (Gustman and Steinmeier,

2004, 2005; Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai, 2010a). Or are there systematic forces at work?

        Section II discusses possible reasons for differences among surveys in the measured importance of

pensions. Section III compares the importance of pensions and Social Security in the retirement incomes

of those 65 to 69. The importance of pensions and Social Security in incomes after retirement is compared




                                                    3
with their importance in wealth measures in Section IV. Section V uses data from the Health and

Retirement Study to compare plan coverage and plan values as evaluated in the period before retirement

with comparable measures of coverage and plan wealth based on data collected after retirement. Section

VI compares measures of pension wealth collected for members of a panel, restricted to those with a

single pension plan who provide consistent answers to questions about plan type. Section VII concludes.

         II. Reasons for differences in pension values.

         Consider a number of reasons why pension measures may differ between surveys, when measured

in the context of surveys of income vs. wealth, and when measured at different ages, even for the same

individuals when observed before and after retirement.

         A. Differences in concept and measurement.

         Before retirement, many surveys focus on pension coverage from the current job, but do not keep

track of pensions held on previous jobs. For example, surveys based on establishment data focus only on

the value of the pension from current employment.3 Similarly, most household surveys of individuals

taken before retirement that are aimed at evaluating pensions ignore dormant but live pensions from

previous jobs, and are especially likely to ignore defined benefit pensions, whether from current or

previous jobs.4 At the same time, pension income reported after retirement often includes the value of

payments from all plans, whenever the job was held. If pension coverage is more comprehensive after




3
  According to data from the Health and Retirement Study, in 2004, 46.8 percent of respondents ages 51 to 56 had a pension
on a current job; 15.9 percent had a pension that was still alive from a job previously held but not yet in pay status; and 3.5
percent had a pension in pay status. These are not mutually exclusive categories, so 52.7 percent of respondents had a
pension that was still live. In addition, 62.4 percent of respondents ever had pension coverage, some having cashed out or
converted their pension into some other form. (Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai, 2010a, Table 5.11.)
4
  Still other studies may ignore pensions, or a portion of pensions, when considering the sources of retirement wealth. For
example, Bricker et al. (2010, 2012) use the Survey of Consumer Finances to examine the changes in retirement assets over the
course of the Great Recession. Yet DB pensions from current and previously held jobs are excluded from Bricker et al.’s
measures of total wealth. This is despite the fact that at the onset of the recession, DB wealth accounted for two thirds of total
pension wealth for those approaching retirement age (Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai, 2010a, Table 13.1).



                                                               4
than before retirement, this would increase the measured value of pensions in retirement in surveys of

retirees compared to current workers.

         In contrast, there are a number of reasons why the value of pensions after retirement may be

underestimated, especially if evaluation is based on sources of income realized in retirement. First, not all

pensions are in pay status, even after the person leaves the pension job. When a pension is not in pay

status, it is commonly ignored in questions related to pension incomes. Even when a pension is in pay

status, a survey may not include income from the pension. For example, as pointed out by Anguelov, Iams

and Purcell (2012), CPS data on pension incomes in retirement count only annuitized income, but not

irregular income from pensions, such as periodic withdrawals from 401k accounts. This is an important

problem because funds in DC pension accounts often are not claimed until the covered worker reaches age

70, when withdrawals are mandated. Indeed, a disproportionate amount of benefits may not be withdrawn

until even later (Poterba, Venti and Wise, 2011).

         Another factor is that actual benefit payments may be reduced from the pension called for by the

simple benefit formula advertised by the firm when an annuity is chosen that differs from the single life

annuity emphasized by plan.5 For example, the annuitized benefit will be reduced when, as required by

law, a spouse or survivor benefit is chosen. The reduction will depend on the ages of each spouse and on

whether the survivor benefit is half the main benefit, whether it is two thirds as in Social Security, or

whether the annual benefit will remain unchanged upon the death of the covered worker. There may be

further reductions if the retiree chooses a guaranteed minimum payout period. To be sure, these

differences in payout due to actuarial adjustments do not create actual differences in the present value of

benefits. But one must know the details of the respondent’s choice as to spouse and survivor benefits and


5
 Social Security wealth considers own, spouse and survivor benefits for couples, and uses life tables for each spouse in
determining the wealth equivalent of these benefits for the household. Pension wealth estimates take the report of expected
benefits and discount those benefits as if the respondent would be receiving a single life annuity.



                                                              5
other characteristics of the annuity, and adjust using appropriate life tables. That is, a proper analysis

would not just consider the annual pension payment, but would also consider the value of payments that

will be made in future years to the surviving spouse. Typically these details are not available on a survey

and no such adjustment is made. Indeed, in the absence of the appropriate information on the HRS as to

the details of the annuity, our pension wealth estimates do not include such adjustments either.

       In addition to these sources of difference between pension values when reported before vs. after

retirement, there is another source of complication. It is sometimes difficult to trace pensions held when

the individual participates in more than one plan. This will lead us to restrict the panel to those who report

having only one plan.

       B. Rollovers, cash-outs, and other changes in pensions at job termination

       In addition, some pensions are rolled over or cashed out at retirement. Unless the survey carefully

traces IRA balances and other assets back to the pension plan where they originated, and continues to

keep track of those funds, as a result of these modes of disposition, there will be a reduction in the

measured contribution of pensions to post retirement incomes. Of course, the role of cash-outs in

influencing subsequent wealth is even more difficult to evaluate.

       Table 1 describes the disposition of pensions as reported by respondents who were members of

the original HRS cohort and included in a pension in 1992. The reports are made in the wave just after

the respondent leaves his/her Wave 1 job.

       Adding the total values reported in the top panel of column 1, the total value of DB pensions

reported at disposition per HRS respondent (whether covered by a pension or not) is $64,379. From

column 1, we see that only 6 percent of DB plan values are lost to rollovers or are cashed out.

       The total value of DC pensions is $15,347. Of that total, 42 percent of the balances were left in the

account to accumulate and similarly 42 percent were rolled over into an IRA. The remaining 16 percent




                                                      6
was used to purchase an annuity or withdrawn. To be sure, assets that are cashed out may simply be spent.

Or they may have been deposited, used to pay off a mortgage, or saved in other ways. On the other hand,

funds left in a DC account or rolled over into an IRA are even more likely to be available to support

consumption in retirement.

        Conversion of DC plans into some other form (other than leaving the account to accumulate) will

be a much more important reason why the value of DC plans in retirement falls below the value initially

stated by currently employed respondents than is the case for DB pensions. Since DB pensions were by far

the dominant plan type for this cohort, as they are for current retirees, turnover of pension assets into other

forms at retirement is less significant in explaining why pension values are lower in surveys of retirees,

although it also contributes to the explanation.

        Adding the total values in column 1 and dividing into the sum of the values for categories

associated with a change in the form of the asset out of a pension, about 16 percent of total assets no

longer remain in the form of a pension at termination.

        We should also note here that in instances where current pensions were cashed out soon after the

individual left the job, the questions in the HRS on disposition of pensions will capture that termination of

the pension. However, if at the time the individual left the job he/she reported that the plan remained intact

but was not in pay status, and at some later time after the individual left the job that plan was cashed out,

our estimates would overstate the value of pensions for that individual.6

        C. Other sources of differences between benefits measured before and after retirement.

        There are other reasons to expect discrepancies between pension values reported before and after

retirement, especially when expected plan values are reported a number of years before retirement.

Defined contribution balances change with contributions and with returns on assets. In addition, pension


6
 We have just completed a study where we also include information on later updates to the status of HRS pensions, but these
data became available too late to include them in the current analysis.


                                                             7
plans may have changed between the time the individual is surveyed while still at work, and the time the

individual has retired. Still another complication is that some who left their pension job may not collect

for a number of years. In addition, the individual may have reported an expected retirement age before

retirement that differs from the actual retirement age. For example, when interviewed before retirement, a

58 year old individual may report an expected benefit on the assumption that he will remain at work until

age 62. But a layoff, or ill health, or other circumstance may lead to an actual retirement age before then.

The expected benefit values before retirement and the actual benefits found after retirement may then

differ because they refer to different retirement dates, and thus different amounts of tenure on the job, and

perhaps also to different final earnings.

           a. The different waves of the HRS are not consistent in whether they permit multiple
               responses. Consequently, the percent nonzero observations cannot be summed.
               There also may be a minor effect on the totals reported in the table.


       Errors in reported plan type may also affect the findings. Evidence suggests that respondents have

considerable difficulty in identifying plan type (Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai, 2010a, chapter 7). To

separate the effects of errors in reported plan type from systematic factors affecting the comparison of

values before and after retirement per se, a number of the comparisons made in this paper are restricted to

those who consistently report plan type in Wave 1 and at termination. Similar problems may arise when



                                                    9
respondents have more than one plan. In particular, there may not be sufficient information to match each

individual pension over time. To reduce errors from this source, the comparisons we make in panel data

are restricted to those who report only one pension. Ten percent of the original sample had more than one

plan. Restricting the panel to those with only one plan creates less of a problem for the original HRS

cohort than would be the case when analyzing members of cohorts that are much younger, where multiple

plans are more common. There also are other issues that may affect comparisons between expected

benefits at a time before retirement and actual benefits realized after retirement. An important problem is

that it is not always clear whether the individual is reporting expected benefits in current or future dollars.7

A related problem is differential availability of cost of living adjustments. Historically, partial, ad hoc,

cost of living adjustments were available to workers in the private sector. They are much less common

today and are no longer available for most private sector workers with a DB pension. However, cost of

living adjustments are still available for public sector workers. If cost of living benefits are added into post

retirement pension incomes, but are not considered by those reporting expected pension benefits, this

would lead to a finding of higher benefits when pensions are measured after retirement than before.

and Retirement Study.

         In Table 2, we report shares of income due to Social Security and pensions for households with at

least one person aged 65 to 69 in 2006.8 The data in column 1 are reported by the Social Security


7
  When calculating wealth values of defined benefit pensions, we treat all reports of future benefits as if they were made in
future dollars. Thus these values are discounted by 5.8 percent.
8
  Note the following differences between the data in Table 1 and 2, and between the wealth estimates taken in 1992
and 2006 in Table 2. Table 1 includes respondents with a current pension who had reported only one plan. This table
indicates how that one plan is disposed of upon respondents’ job termination during Waves 2 to 8. Table 2 includes
respondents ages 51 to 55 in Wave 1. Pension wealth in this table includes the present value of pensions from
current/last and previous three pension jobs in Wave 1 for respondents ages 51 to 55. The pension wealth in 2006
(ages 65-69) includes the present value of pension from current job in 2006 and any job that was terminated after
Wave 1 in addition to pension values from previous three pension jobs respondents reported in their initial interview
in 1992. However, by 2006, some of those respondents have retired and their pension is lost through conversion to


                                                              10
Administration using data from the Current Population Survey. Shares calculated using data from the

Health and Retirement Study are reported in column 2. In CPS data, the share of income due to Social

Security is 25.4 percent, and the share due to pensions is 15.1 percent. From HRS data, 22.3 percent of

income is due to Social Security and 14.9 percent is due to pensions.

           There are a number of reasons for the differences reported between the surveys. Some of these

differences are captured in the footnotes under Table 2. There are a few differences in the definition of

income between the two surveys, so the denominators used to calculate income and pension shares will be

different between the surveys.9 Also, as noted in our discussion of sources of measurement error, the

surveys differ in their methodology for counting Social Security and pension income. For example, the

CPS disregards irregular withdrawals from pensions, while the HRS does not. In the end, the share of

income due to pensions differs by 0.2 percent between the surveys. But there are larger differences in the

share of income due to Social Security.

           To abstract from the effects of differences in the definition of income between the surveys, it is

instructive to consider the ratio of pension income to Social Security income. In the CPS data, pension

values are 59 percent of the value of Social Security. This is despite the fact that the CPS includes regular

income from IRA and Keogh plans under pension income, while in our calculations using the HRS data,

we did not. In HRS data, the pension value is 67 percent of the value of Social Security benefits.

           Despite various differences in definition, the share of income from pensions among those 65 to

69 appears to be comparable in the HRS and CPS. The share of income due to Social Security is lower

in HRS data, so that the ratio of income from pensions to Social Security is substantially lower in the

CPS than in the HRS.


IRAs and annuities or has been cashed out. Some of the respondents who stayed on the same job and their pension
did not change reported a zero plan number when they were asked about the number of plans in 2006. As a result,
the pension wealth from their current job has disappeared.

    Income is reported for last month in the HRS, while in the CPS, income is based on a report for last year.


                                                                11
         IV. Social Security and pensions in wealth vs. income data

         The last column of Table 2 reports the share of total wealth due to Social Security and pensions for

households with HRS respondents ages 65 to 69.10 When comparing to Social Security and pensions as a

share of income as reported in the HRS in column 2, it is very important to recognize the differences in the

denominator. Earnings play an important role in the income of those ages 65 to 69 but are not included in

the wealth of those 65 to 69.

             A- Total Income from HRS
             1- Total income from HRS is the sum of earnings and income from respondent and
                spouse, including individual earnings, income from employer pension or annuity,
                income from Social Security DI or SSI benefits, income from Social Security

10
  The wealth estimates in the last two columns of Table 2 are both discounted to 2006. Note that the Social Security wealth
estimates in 2006 ignore any benefits already paid previous to 2006. Despite that, Social Security wealth is higher in the 2006
estimates than in the 1992 estimates, even though these comparisons are for members of the same cohort. Both estimates of
Social Security wealth are computed on the assumption that the individual retires immediately and claims benefits at the earliest
age possible. As a result, the Social Security wealth estimates for 2006 take account of additional benefits resulting from
additional work by those individuals who had not retired by 1992. The effect is to raise the present value of Social Security in
2006, thereby reducing the value of the ratio of pensions to Social Security in 2006 relative to 1992.

   retirement benefits, unemployment insurance, workers compensation, income
   from other government transfers, household capital income, and all other
   household income.
2- Total wealth includes the present value of Social Security benefits, pensions from
   current and any previous jobs, primary and secondary housing, real estate, IRAs,
   financial assets, businesses, and vehicles.

B- Social Security
1- Social Security Income in the HRS includes income from Social Security
   retirement, spouse or widow benefits, and SSI and DI benefits. It is calculated
   based on the amount of benefits received last month. It is reported in the Assets
   and Income section of the survey.
2- Social Security benefits in CPS data include Social Security retirement, spouse
   and widows’ benefits, as well as Disability Income and transitionally insured
   benefits.
3- Present Value is calculated based on an “if claim now” scenario. It includes the
   present value of the benefit for the respondent, his/her spouse, any top ups, and
   those benefits already claimed.

C- Pension
1- Pension Income from HRS includes income from all pensions and annuities.
   Irregular payments are included if they were paid out the month before the
   financial respondent in the household was interviewed.
2- CPS data excludes irregular payments from IRA, 401k, and Keoghs.
3- Present Value of pension includes:
   a. The present value of expected future benefits from all previous pensions. It is
       constructed based on the value reported by respondents when they were first
       interviewed, or in the wave after a job offering a pension was terminated. The
       present values are computed using a life table from the Social Security
       Administration and a 5.8 percent interest rate. Values are updated by 5.8% for
       each year between the year it was reported and 2006.
   b. The present value of pensions for plans already in pay status includes the
       present value of remaining benefits as of 2006.
   c. DC account balances from last and previous jobs that were left to accumulate
       are included in pension wealth. Their values are updated by 5.8 percent for
       each year between the year they were reported and 2006.




                                        13
       Social Security accounts for a larger share of wealth than income. The difference is about 0.7

percentage points (23.0 – 22.3). Similarly, pensions account for a 2.4 percent larger share of wealth than

of income (17.3 – 14.9). The ratio of pension wealth to wealth from Social Security benefits is .75, a

higher ratio than the ratio of pension income to Social Security income in the HRS at .67. In HRS data,

the relative value of pension wealth to Social Security wealth is about .75, while the ratio between

pension and Social Security income is .67.

       V. Estimated contributions of pensions to retirement wealth before and after retirement.

        Comparing columns 4 and 5 of Table 2, one can determine the changes in the present values of

pensions reported before and after retirement. The value of pension wealth reported just after retirement,

when respondents were 65 to 69, is about 8 percent lower than the value reported before retirement when

the respondents were 51 to 55. Specifically, when reported in 1992, the value of pensions was $236,113,

falling to $217,174 when reported in 2006. In contrast, summing the values in Table 1 for various

outcomes at disposition of pensions, we can compute what part of the assets initially held in the form of

pensions in 1992 remained in that form by 2006, and what part is transformed into some other asset.

Specifically, from Table 1 we have (14,054 + 46,620 + 6,401)/(64,379 + 14,347) remaining in the form of

pension wealth between ages 51 to 55 and 65 to 69. That is, pensions lose about 16 percent of their value

at the time of disposition because they are transformed into other forms.

       VI. Further explanation of changes in pensions between pre- and post-retirement within the

HRS panel.

       By restricting participation in HRS panel data to those who provide consistent answers, these data

can be used to provide further insight into the reasons for the decline in the value of pensions as

respondents age from their early fifties into their late sixties. We will examine expected pension wealth in

1992, expected pension wealth in the year just before leaving the firm, expected pension wealth in the year

just after leaving the firm, and pension wealth computed from actual pension income from the income

section of the HRS.

       Most of the remaining analysis will focus on respondents (not households) ages 51 to 61 in 1992.

Enough time has passed that almost all members of the original HRS cohort have retired.

       The sample used in the remaining analysis will be restricted in a number of ways to clarify the

picture as to which changes underlie the findings. In all tables, individuals are restricted to those reporting

only one pension plan. (This restriction is not too severe since only 10 percent of this cohort had more

than one pension at the outset of the survey.) But other restrictions may vary from table to table for

reasons that will become apparent. Within each table, the underlying samples are consistent, but they are

not always consistent across tables. All comparisons are made in present value terms.

       Tables 3 and 4 describe the origins of the sample. As seen in Table 3, the HRS includes 3,209

respondents in the original wave of the survey (1992) who had a current job and reported having only one

pension plan on that job. Of these, 2,515 left their wave 1 job by 2006, Wave 8 of the survey, when they

ranged in age between 65 and 75. An additional 377 left the survey before terminating their wave 1 job,

and 317 had not yet terminated their job as of 2006. An additional 242 respondents who were recorded as

having a pension at Wave 1 denied having a pension at the time their job was terminated.




                                                     17
        Most commonly, individuals retired from their pension jobs in the first few waves after the initial

survey in 1992. In the first three waves of the survey, three fifths of those who reported one pension on

their current job in the initial wave of the survey retired from their pension job.

        Compare the first and second rows of Table 4. Of the 2,515 individuals who reported having a

pension in Wave 1, and who remained with the survey, but left their job by Wave 8, 2,273 reported having

a pension just after leaving their job.

        Within the group of 2,515 with one pension on a current job in 1992, from line 3, 1,602

respondents reported having a defined benefit pension on that job. By the eighth wave, 1,450 respondents,

including some who had not reported having a DB plan in Wave 1, reported having left their Wave 1 job

and, at the time they left, having had a defined benefit pension. Thus between the first wave and the final

wave at termination, the number of covered workers who reported having a pension fell by 10 percent, and

the number of workers with a DB pension fell by 5 percent. But again, some of these respondents had

reported a DC plan in 1992 and a DB plan when the job was terminated.

        Of the 1,450 who reported having left their job and having had a defined benefit plan at

termination, 1,150 had also reported having a DB plan both in 1992 and at job termination. This will be

the sample that underlies much of our later work, concentrating on those who consistently reported a DB

plan throughout the panel.

        Appendix Table 1 reports the differences in plan value by plan type for those who stayed with the

survey and left their job before the end of the survey; left the survey before leaving their job; or never left

their job before their final interview. From row 2, average plan value for those with a DB plan who

terminated their job by Wave 8 was $114,000. Among those reporting a defined benefit pension in the first

wave of the survey, 243, or 12 percent of the sample, left the survey before terminating their job. In the

initial wave of the survey, their pensions were worth $107,000. Nine percent of those with a DB plan in




                                                     18
Wave 1 remained with their employers throughout the survey. In the initial wave of the survey, their

pensions were worth $96,000.

       Columns 3 and 4 of Appendix Table 1 present findings for those who reported a defined

contribution pension in Wave 1. Account balances reported in the first wave of the survey are similar

whether the respondent remained in the survey but left the job before the end of the survey, left the survey

before leaving their job, or remained with the survey but did not leave their job. These balances average

$39,000 across all three groups.

       Reporting error remains a problem, especially with regard to plan type. Returning to Table 4, of

the 1,602 who reported a defined benefit pension in Wave 1, and who remained throughout the period of

analysis, among those who terminated by Wave 8 (column 9), 1,150 also reported having a defined benefit

pension at termination. On the other hand, 452 (1,602 – 1,150) members of the survey declared having a

pension in Wave 1 and that their pension was a DB plan, but did not declare having a DB pension at the

time they terminated their employment on the pension job. In addition, 300 (1,450 – 1,150) reported a DB

pension at termination, but did not report a DB pension in the first wave of the survey. This difference is

probably a reflection of reporting error rather than a gain in DB coverage on the same job.

       In forming the group of panel members who consistently reported only one defined benefit plan,

28 percent of the observations that reported a DB plan in Wave 1 will have been lost as a result of

inconsistent reporting of plan type (1 - (1,150/1,602)).

       Having examined the differences in frequency of pensions from the initial wave of the survey

through termination, we now turn to Table 5A, which describes the numbers experiencing different

types of disposition of defined benefit pensions at termination. Building on the information provided in

Table 1, Table 5A reports findings for the restricted sample, and also reports how outcomes change

among those leaving their jobs just after 1992, through those leaving a decade or more later.




                                                     19
         From the last column of Table 5A, row 2, we see that 69 percent of respondents’ DB plans began

paying benefits at termination, while in 20 percent of the cases benefits were expected in the future. In

12 percent of the cases, the plan was rolled over into an IRA, the individual received a cash settlement,

or there was some other disposition that did not involve paying benefits.11 Also notice by scanning

across the columns that roughly 12 percent of plans are cashed out, rolled over or otherwise claimed no

matter what wave the individual leaves the job. Of course, as expected, the longer a person remained on

the job, the greater the probability that benefits would be received upon exit, and the lower the

probability that the individual would be expecting future benefits.

         Thus, we find that in 12 percent of the cases for those who had a defined benefit pension just

before termination, at termination the benefit was transformed into a state that would not count as

pension income after retirement. Nevertheless, the origin of the income or wealth in retirement is

from the pension.




11
  Since only one answer was permitted in the early waves of the HRS as to disposition of the pension, there are two sources
of error in trying to trace through the value of DB plans ending in different states. On the one hand, given the small size of
cash settlements permitted by DB plans, especially in the early 1990s, these figures likely overstate the share of benefit
amounts that went into cash settlements. On the other hand, since only one outcome could be selected, partial cashouts of
DB plans are ignored, leading to an undercount of the value of cashouts.

       Table 5B provides the analogous results for those who reported a defined contribution plan both

in the initial wave of the survey and upon leaving their job. Here only 35 percent of the respondents

reported leaving their assets to accumulate in a DC plan, and another 35 percent rolled the balance over

into an IRA or converted it to an annuity, forms that would be picked up as sources of retirement income

by the CPS, but not credited to pensions as the source.

       Next, in Tables 6A and 6B we compare the expected present values of defined benefit pensions

and DC account balances reported in the first wave of the survey with (1) expected values recorded just

before retirement, and with (2) expected present values just after retirement. To make this comparison,

we require of the sample that the individual report having a defined benefit or defined contribution plan

both at termination and at the earlier period of observation.

       Table 6A pertains to DB plans. For purposes of this comparison, the individual cannot have

cashed out the DB benefit. As seen in Table 5A, 12 percent of those with a DB plan cashed out or in

some other way had their DB plan transformed by termination. In addition, for this comparison the

sample includes those who received their benefits immediately upon termination. Because we are using a

sample of individuals who are covered by only a single defined benefit plan in 1992, we avoid any

ambiguity as to which plan the respondent is reporting on. This is very important in tracing plan values.

       To compare benefits in the first wave of the survey with benefits in the wave just before

retirement, we compare the values in rows 1 and 2 of Table 6A. Values are all reported in 1992 dollars.

These values may differ either because the annual benefits reported differ, or because the expected age of

retirement differs. This comparison suggests that the present value of the expected pension is reported to

be higher in the wave just before retirement than it is in the first wave respondents are in the survey and

are first asked about their pensions. Although the differences vary by wave, the DB pension value




                                                     23
observed in the wave just before retirement is about 5 percent higher than the pension value observed

when first entering the survey. The mechanics of calculating an accrued pension value would lead one to

expect such growth, even though respondents are asked about their expected pension benefits at their

expected retirement age.

       Consistent with the likely effects of accrued interest and continuing deposits, Table 6B shows that

the values of DC accounts grow sharply, doubling between the time the individual is first observed in the

survey and the year of exit.

       The 5 percent gain in DB pension value between the first wave of the survey and the year

before retirement would lead one to expect pension values measured among near retirees to be larger

than pension values measured among those on the job in their early fifties, even though whatever age

the survey is taken, respondents are asked for the annual benefit at expected age of retirement (not at

current age). Thus this difference cannot explain why pension values reported by retirees are smaller

than pension values reported by current workers. Nor can the difference between the account balances

in DC plans between the first wave and last wave in the job explain why pension values are lower when

calculated based on pension incomes after retirement, rather than pension wealth values recorded

before retirement.

This table is the follow-up to Table 5B. The sample includes respondents who reported they left their DC account balance to accumulate, rolled it over into an IRA, or

DC account balances after Wave 1 are the sum of balances if there was more than one account.

                                                                                        26
           Next, we compare pension values reported between the year before retirement and after job

termination. DB pension values for respondents who reported receiving benefits at job’s termination are

3.5 percent lower when computed after termination than they are when computed the year before

termination. One possibility is that some respondents who were ignorant of the effect of spouse and

survivor benefits and related options on the annual benefit payment only became aware that their annual

(not lifetime expected) benefits would be lower than those called for in the basic formula once they had

retired.

           Turning now to DC pension values reported in Table 6B, when evaluated just after retirement,

account values are 27 percent lower than those reported in the wave just before retirement, even for

those whose primary response was that they left the balance to accumulate. But the balances reported

after retirement still exceed the values of account balances reported in the first wave the respondent is in

the survey (48/39). One cannot rule out selection bias affecting the choice of plans remaining in the form

of continuing DC accounts.

           The 3.5 percent reduction in DB pension value at termination compared to the year before

termination is another difference contributing to the explanation of why pension values measured

among retirees are smaller than the pension values measured among those on the job.

           The differences in the two stages, from first wave until the wave before retirement, and the

wave before retirement until just after retirement, taken together, are roughly offsetting for DB plans.

This table is the follow-up to Table 5A. The sample includes only respondents who reported expecting future benefits in that Table, whose
plans were not yet in pay status in the interview just after they had left their job.




                                                                         29
       Lastly, in Table 7 we compare data for those with DB plans. There we compare actual benefit

receipt from the pension section of the HRS, the expected values of benefits reported just after

retirement, but before the plan is in pay status, and expected benefits upon participation in the first wave

of the HRS. This comparison requires that we limit the sample to those whose plans did not immediately

go into pay status upon their leaving their job. Once again, the reported current annual payout is

transformed into a present value. And again, we limit the sample to those with only one plan, which is

DB, so that mismatching of plans between waves for those with more than one plan is not an issue here.

       The three panels of Table 7 refer to those in the sample for whom updates are available. We will

concentrate on the second panel, which provides results for those whose plan ultimately went into pay

status. Benefits reported based on observed pension income after retirement are about 8 percent higher

than the benefits expected, but not yet received, reported in the first subsequent wave taken after

retirement. (119/110). For this subsample, however, there are only 127 respondents with data available

on pension income after retirement. We found for the 647 respondents in Table 6A who collected

benefits immediately after leaving the firm, that benefits declined by 3.5 percent between the amount

anticipated just before retirement and the value of pensions reported just after having left the job

(138/143).



       VII. Conclusion:

       A review of the literature suggests that when pension values are measured by the wealth equivalent

of promised DB pension benefits and DC balances for those approaching retirement, pensions account for

more support in retirement than is suggested when their contribution is measured by incomes received

directly from pension plans by those who have already retired. Our empirical analysis has attempted to

account for these differences in the contributions of pensions as measured in income and wealth data.




                                                     30
        A number of factors cause the contribution of pensions to be understated in retirement income

data.

        1. One factor is a difference in methodology between surveys. As pointed out in Anguelov, Iams

           and Purcell (2012), the CPS ignores irregular payments from pensions. In CPS data on incomes

           of those ages 64 to 69 in 2006, pension values are 59 percent of the value of Social Security.

           For the same cohort, in HRS data, the pension value is 67 percent of the value of Social

           Security benefits.

        2. Some pension wealth “disappears” at retirement because respondents change their pension

           into other forms that are not counted as pension income in surveys of income. Altogether, 16

           percent of pension wealth was transformed into some other form at the time of disposition.

           For those who had a defined benefit pension just before termination, at termination 12

           percent of the benefit was transformed into a state that would not count as pension income

           after retirement.

        3. For those who receive benefits soon after termination, there is a 3.5 percent reduction in DB

           pension value at termination compared to the year before termination. One reason may be the

           form of annuitization that is chosen. This is another difference contributing to the explanation

           of why pension values measured among retirees are smaller than the pension values

           measured among those on the job.

        One factor operates in the other direction. Pensions grow in value during the time respondents

remain at the firm. Thus there was a 5 percent gain in DB pension values between the first wave of the

HRS and the year before retirement. The mechanics of calculating an accrued pension value would lead

one to expect such growth as job tenure increases, even though respondents are asked about their

expected pension benefits. This would lead one to expect pension values measured among near retirees




                                                   31
to be larger the closer the individual is to retirement. The gain in the value of DC plans was even larger.

Consequently, this factor cannot explain why pension values reported by retirees are smaller than

pension values reported by current workers.

       Our findings suggest a number of caveats. Clearly, reporting errors or inconsistent reporting by

respondents play a role in affecting the decline in the relative value of pensions reported as individual’s

age. Thus there are differences between pension coverage reported before vs. after retirement that appear

to lead to exaggeration in the value of pensions before retirement. Altogether, 242 respondents of 2,515

who reported pension coverage as of Wave 1 of the HRS denied having pension coverage when they left

their job. Misreporting of plan type also plays a role. Of the 1,602 respondents who reported a defined

benefit pension in Wave 1, and who remained throughout the period of analysis, among those who had

terminated their job by Wave 8, 1,150 also reported having a defined benefit pension at termination.

Thus 452 (1,602 – 1,150) members of the survey declared having a pension in Wave 1 and that their

pension was a DB plan, but did not declare having a DB pension at the time they terminated their

employment on the pension job.

       These caveats notwithstanding, the bottom line is that CPS data on pension incomes received in

retirement understate the full contribution pensions make to supporting retirees. If one is to avoid

understating the role of pensions, a great deal of caution is required. Pension income and wealth measures

vary when they are measured for the same person, and for the same pension, at different times in the life

cycle. Although part of the difference is due to the well-known discrepancy between expectations and

realizations, the documented transitions in pensions over the life cycle are consistent with pensions

providing a larger share of support in retirement than is suggested by CPS pension income data.

       Understanding the reasons for these differences is important for public policy. The discrepancies

between the measures based on income vs. those based on wealth will lead to an incorrect understanding




                                                     32
of how much pensions contribute to supporting families in retirement. Because the contribution of

pensions to supporting retirees is understated in CPS income data, both the need for additional support in

retirement and the potential contribution of pensions to retirement support may be misunderstood. Errors

in measuring the value of pensions in turn lead to errors in the reported share of retirement income due to

Social Security. Because pension values are understated, such errors will suggest that retirees are more

highly dependent on Social Security for their retirement incomes than they are, and that too large a share

of the population of retirees is solely dependent on Social Security.12

     Fisher (2007) has shown there is a similar effect when income from assets is understated.
