         ARE INFLATION RATES DIFFERENT FOR THE ELDERLY?



                            ABSTRACT



     This paper presents new evidence on cost—of—living indices and

annual inflation rates for the elderly population as well as the

general population. It employs a now fairly widely accepted adjustment

for the inappropriate treatment of housing in the Consumer Price Index.

We disaggregate by five—year age cohorts for the elderly, and analyze

various features of the differences in the inflation faced by the

elderly and the general population, as well as within the elderly

group itself. We conclude that, conditional on a housing adjustment,

the inflation experience of the elderly from 1961—1981 was quite similar

to the general population, both cumulatively and year—by—year.

1.   Introduction

          A series of interrelated issues raises concern over the

measurement of inflation for the elderly population.      General interest in

their absolute and relative economic performance, especially

in the last dozen years, thorny economic and political problems concerning

alternative indexing provisions for Social Security and other retirement

programs, and concern over "budgetary control" all render the issue of

inflation facing the elderly relative to the general population an important

economic and social issue.

     In this paper we present new evidence on cost—of—living indices and

annual inflation rates for the elderly population as well as the general

population. Employing a now fairly widely accepted adjustment for the inappro-

priate treatment of housing in the Consumer Price Index, we disaggregate by

five—year age cohorts for the elderly, and analyze various features of the

differences in the inflation faced by the elderly and the general population,

as well as within the elderly group itself. We conclude that, conditional

on a housing adjustment, the inflation experience of the elderly from 1961-

1981 was quite similar to the general population.

     Toward this end we present a very cursory discussion of some related

estimates in the next section; discuss our methodology and report expenditure

shares by age in Section 3; report our results for the different age groups of

cumulative cost—of—living indices and annual inflation rates and

analyze various aspects of the results concerning the potential differences in
                                      2


inflation rates by age and other characteristics in Section 4; briefly

present a rough order of magnitude of the potential excess "indexing costs"

in Social Security recently in Section 5; and offer a brief conclusion

which suggests that more fundamental issues concerning what we hope to

accomplish with indexing appear to dominate, at least historically, the

measured differences in inflation rates for the elderly and the general

population, and therefore, current evidence offers no historical statistical

support for the notion that a separate index for the elderly with which to

index their Social Security and/or retirement pension benefits would have been

worthwhile.




2.   A Brief Literature Review

           Several previous studies have attempted to adjust cost—of--living

indices for the peculiar treatment of housing in the Consumer Price Index (CPI),

and other studies using the standard treatment of housing have sometimes

 calculated separate cost—of—living indexes for the elderly. For example,

Bridges and Packard (1981), using seven expenditure commodities and the

 traditional treatment of housing, divide the population into those 65 and above

 and 64 and below and study the period 1967—79. They conclude that the cumulative

 cost—of—living for the elderly by 1979 was about 2.3 percentage points

 higher than that for the younger population. Of course, since the consumption

 of housing is very different, as we will see below, for the elderly than

 for the general population, the standard treatment of housing can cause

 serious problems. In any event, a longer time period, a more appropriate

 treatment of housing, and a disaggregation of the elderly population are

 highly desirable.
                                      3


     Borzilleri (1980) studied the period 1970—77, using fifteen commodity

classes, but continuing the standard treatment of housing and the simple

division of the population into those 65 and above and others. Duffy (1979),

using the standard treatment of housing and seven commodity groups, concluded that

inflation rates increase slightly with age. Michael (1979) studied the period

1967—74. He excluded housing, and disaggregated into different age cohorts.

His purpose was somewhat different from ours and the others: it was not primarily

focused on age but on variations in the rate of inflation across individual

households.

     Dougherty and Van Order (1982), focusing on the inappropriate treatment

of housing in the CPI, present several different measures of an adjusted

Consumer Price Index. They conclude that "15 to 25 percent of the price

rise since 1968 as measured by the CPI could be spurious." We present

similar results below. They, however, did not focus on the implications

of this for separate price indexes for the elderly.

     Despite the lack of convincing evidence that the Inflation experience

of the elderly was markedly different from the general population, calls

for developing a separate price index for the elderly continue. Since

life expectancy has been increasing, the age structure of the elderly has

also been shifting toward higher ages. Therefore, it is important to

discover how measured annual inflation rates and cumulative costs—of—living

differed between the elderly and the general population, and among the

elderly. The main issues are treatment of housing, disaggregation by

commodity classes and disaggregation by age. Each of the existing papers

treats one or two of these; this paper considers all three.

3.   Methodology

            Our primary data source is the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES).

This survey was conducted by the Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

19,975 households were interviewed, each over a 15 month period, to determine

their expenditures in detail. The level of disaggregation was extreme:

for example, expenditures on house slippers as distinct from sandals were

determined. We use the summary tape which gives expenditures in about 60

categories; from this we aggregated still further into 17 broad categories,

which are listed in Table 1; for the period prior to 1968, some adjustments

were necessary and are discussed in the Appendix.

     A price index in the n'th period can be written as



                p   q1°       ° °
                          =                         =     e.(p. /p. )
            LP1 ci.               q
            1



        0
where p. and p. flare the price of the i .,th commodity in the base and the

n'th period; q.° is quantity purchased •in the base period and e is the

expenditure share on the i'th commodity in the base period.

     To develop a price index for a particular group in the population,

the group's expenditure shares on each commodity in the base period,1

and the price changes from period to period, are needed. We calculate
                                       5



 the expenditure shares from the CES. The price changes are taken from

 the BLS publications, CPI Detailed Report. What distinguishes the price

 index of one age group from that of another are the share weights. The

elderly population was divided into five groups: 55 through 59 years old,

60 through 6/i, 65 through 69, 70 through 74, and 75 and older.   Following
the BLS in its calculation of the official CPI, we calculated the expenditure

shares of each of the 17 classes of goods over each age group by summing

the individual shares weighted by the individual total expenditures.     Thus,

we calculated an expenditure—weighted average of the individual expenditure

shares. This is formally equivalent to taking total age—group expenditures

on all commodities. We were able successfully to match the expenditure

categories in the CES to the commodity categories in the BLS so that the

price change data would correspond to the share weights.2

     Because a house purchase has an investment component as well as a

consumption component, its treatment in the official CPI has become very

controversial. There are two separate issues: the calculation of expenditure

shares in the base period, and the changes in the costs of owner occupied

housing.

     The official CPI calculates the share of expenditures on owner—occupied

housing in a manner which has no basis in economic theory: for the fraction

of the population purchasing a home in the base period, the total purchase

price plus total undiscounted interest expected to be paid over half the

life of the mortgage are included as current spending! For example, someone

purchasing a $100,000 home on a thirty year mortgage expecting to pay

$150,000 interest for the first half of the mortgage would have $250,000 added

to property taxes, insurance and maintenance and repairs for current housing

expenditures. Thus, the CPI records anyone buying a home in the base period
                                       6




as having spent virtually all of his income on housing (an expenditure

share of about 1). Because of this              approach, the relative weight

of homeownership in the CPI had reached 23% by 1977. Since the owner—occupied
                                                                                -
price index was 317 by 1980 (the rental index was 191), the official CPI

is   dramatically overweighting a commodity whose price increases have been

much larger than average.3

      The best measure of expenditures on a consumer durable in some time

period is the user cost of capital. Net of taxes, this is the price of the

asset multiplied by the real rate of interest plus depreciation. Unfortunately,

there is no widely accepted series on the real rate of interest, and in the

case of housing, depreciation is not directly measured. However, in a

competitive setting the rental rate of a consumer durable will on average

be the same as the user cost of capital.4 Fortunately, the CES asks owners

of houses what they estimate the monthly rental of their houses would be.

Although there will surely be considerable error in the response of any particular

individual, there is no reason to suppose that there will be any systematic

bias in the answers, and that, therefore, the average will be a good estimate

of what houses on average would rent for. Our basic measure, the rental

equivalent, is the owner's estimate of what the house would rent for on the market.

This provides our estimate of the expenditure shares on housing. A rental

equivalent sftries is used to estimate housing price change.

       Table 1 presents the expenditure shares for the seventeen commodity groups, by

age. The basic pattern of expenditure shares by age is that the elderly have a

consumption bundle weighted more toward "necessities". For example, on food away

from home, alcohol, tobacco, domestic services, home furnishings and recreation,

the elderly spend 15.6% against 30.3% for those less than 60; whereas for

housing, food at home and medical care, they spend a much larger fraction of

their income than do the non—elderly. The table also shows, however, that

the expenditure shares of the elderly vary considerably by age, which implies

that considerable age disaggregation is desirable. In particular those over

age 74 have substantially different consumption patterns from the rest of

the elderly. For example, those over 75 spend a much larger fraction of

their income on food—at—home, home ownership, utilities and medical care and

a much smaller fraction of their expenditures on food—away—from—home, clothing

and transportation. The substantial differences in expenditure shares suggest

that in a period of substantial differences in rates of inflation among different

commodities, the inflation rate for different age groups may differ. To an

analysis of this question for the period 1961—1981, we now turn.




4.   Analysis of Results

         Table 2 presents our cumulative cost—of—living indices (with 1967=100)

for the period 1961 to 1981 for six age groups: 21—54, 55—59, 60—64, 65—69,

70—74, and 75 and over. For comparison, we also present the official Consumer

Price Index for this period.

     The first thing to note is that compared to our index the official Consumer

Price Index, cumulatively, by 1981, substantially overstated the cost—of—living;

this overstatement was about 22 basis points or approximately 10 percent.

The difference is almost exclusively due to the treatment of housing. As far

as age variation is concerned, as of 1981, the difference between the cumulative

cost—of—living for any of the elderly age groups and the non—elderly population

was quite small, as were the differences among the elderly age groups.   The

largest difference was that between 60—64 and the non—elderly, a difference of

2 points, less than 1% of the cumulative cost—of—living. Therefore, conditional

on correcting for the overstatement of the cost—of—living in this period due

to the peculiar treatment of housing in the Consumer Price Index, the cumulative

cost—of—living by 1981 was virtually identical for all age groups despite their

substantial differences in expenditure shares.

     Even though cumulative differences by age were small, inflation rates may

have differed substantially in certain years. Since the CPI is used in the

Social Security benefit calculation, yearly differences by age are important

even if over many years the differences are offset. In Table 3 we give

year—by—year inflation rates by age. We note that the inflation measures for

any year across age groups are similar. For example, in the high inflation

year of 1974, the non—elderly inflation rate was measured at about 10.4%,

within two—tenths of 1 percentage point of that for any of the elderly age

groups. Again, in 1980, the non—elderly 11.3% inflation rate was quite

similar to that for most of the elderly, but did overstate inflation for those

over age 75 by about two—thirds of a percentage point. Table 3 also shows

that the official CPI substantially overstated inflation rates for the entire

population from 1974 to 1980. For example the official inflation rate in 1979 was

one—third too high.

     As a way to summarize the inflation difference by age, we present in Table

4 the average difference over 1961—1981 between the inflation rate of each age

group and the inflation rate of the non—elderly population. We also give the

estimated variance of each difference and the maximum difference over these years.

     These results are quite remarkable. The average differences amount to

1/2 of 1 percentage point or less. The maximum deviation for     year for any

age group is still well below 1 percentage point. For example, between 1961 and

1981, for 65—69 year olds, the maximum deviation of our measured inflation rate

from the inflation rate of the non—elderly population

was about 1/4 of 1 percentage point. The maximum devation was still smaller

for the younger cohorts of the elderly population, and somewhat higher

for the more elderly age groups. However, the maximum deviation for any

elderly age group in any year was still only 7/10 of 1 percentage point,

which occurred for those 75 and over. Thus, despite substantial differences

in expenditure shares between the elderly and non—elderly and within the

elderly population as they age, the actual historical inflation experience

was quite similar for the elderly and the general population and for the

different cohorts of the elderly in this 20 year period.

     Let us briefly state the major results of our exploration into housing

adjusted, age differences in costs—of—living in the 1961—1981 period:

     1.   The cumulative Consumer Price Index with its peculiar treatment of

housing overstated inflation by about 10%. This led to an over adjustment

in the indexing of various contracts in the last several years.

     2.   The expenditure shares of the elderly relative to the non—elderly,

and the elderly as they age, vary enough so that differences in the relative

inflation rates by commodity could create a substantial difference in

their impact on the standard of living of different groups.

     3.   Despite these differences in expenditure shares, the historical

experience reveals quite similar costs—of—living cumulatively over the 1961—1981

period for all age groups considered. The cumulative difference in the

cost—of—living by 1981, once the housing adjustment is made, is less than
                                            -

one percent.

     4.   The annual inflation rates are quite similar for the elderly and

non—elderly, and the for the elderly as they age. In no year did the annual

inflation difference between any elderly age group and the non—elderly exceed

one percentage point. The usual differences were on the order of several

hundredths of one percentage point.

     5.   In view of this marked similarity, the historical evidence does

not suggest the need for a calculation of a separate cost—of—living index,

once we adjust for a conceptually better measure of housing costs for the

elderly. Of course, the differences in expenditure shares do indicate that

potential differences should be monitored to see if they become large at any

time in the future which may provide an impetus for a separate index.
                                      15
     Our results show that there is little variation in average inflation

by age. However, as noted in Michael (1979), different individuals may face different

inflation rates because of their different expenditure shares. To gain

some insight into this potential non—uniformity in inflation rates within

each age group, we analyze for two recent years of very high inflation,

1980 and 1981, the expenditure shares of 70—74 year olds to see how their

inflation rates differed. For the year 1980, the range in measured

individual inflation rates was from 7.5% to 19.1%. The average inflation

rate for this group, as reported in Table 3, was 11%. The standard

deviation within this age group- in measured inflation was 2.3%. The range

in 1981 when the average was 9.7% was 7.2% to 14.6% with a standard deviation

of 1.0%. This amount of variation within age groups is typical for these

years over other age groups in the population. Thus, the range of individual

inflation rates within an age group was substantial, but the average

for each of the groups was approximately the same.   It follows that a

standard inflation adjustment at the average value, even adjusted for the

overstatement due to housing, would have over—indexed some individuals

and under—indexed others. Since there is little variation in inflation

rates by age, age is not of much use in finding more accurate inflation

adjustments at the individual levels. It is, therefore, not clear what

can be done about the individual inflation variations.



5.   Application to Indexing Costs

          A large number of issues surround the appropriate treatment of

various programs and contracts in an inflationary environment. What is the

appropriate measure of inflation? Is the purpose of indexing to insure

some absolute purchasing power or some relative position? Should any
                                         16




group in the population be fully insured against real income declines even

when those are suffered by society as a whole? Each of these questions is

beyond the scope of this paper and may dominate our ultimate alternations

in indexing our contracts and government programs. It is, however,

worth placing in perspective the overadjustment of Social Security

benefit payments due to the overstatement of inflation in the CPI. We

can calculate the cost—of—living adjustments that would have been made had

our cost—of—living index been used, and compare them with what was actually

done.

        Our estimate is $5.7 billion worth of cumulative overpayment from mid—1978

through mid—1981.5 This is not a trivial amount, but it is not large

compared with the amounts involved in other kinds of policy discussions.

For example, real Social Security benefits were increased by 25% or so in

the late 1960's and early 1970's and subsequently indexed. A fundamental

question is whether the social contract apparently made at that time,

following a quarter century of extremely rapid economic growth and modest

inflation, should be continued or should it be adjusted in light of the

fact that productivity growth has fallen sharply and that those financing

Social Security benefits through their current taxes have had very little

gain in their standard of living. These are much deeper issues than can

be addressed in this paper. We can, however, point out that obsessive

concern with the cost—of—living adjustment is not justified, and certainly

should not keep policy discussions from more important issues.

6.   Conclusion

         We have presented estimates on expenditure shares of the elderly

and non—elderly population. We found there to be substantial variation

in these shares by age. Because there has been considerable movement

in relative prices over the last twenty years, it is possible that

inflation rates have varied by age. Once an appropriate adjustment is

made for housing, this does not appear to be the case. In the period

1961—1981, both the cumulative cost—of--living and the annual inflation

rates have not varied substantially by age. This suggests that attention

would better be focused on the fundamentals of what we are attempting to

do with such indexing rather than on differences across age groups.

     Prior to 1968, disaggregated price series were available for only 12

categories similar to the subsequent disaggregation to 17. We matched the

categories carefully and spliced the series. To check for any discontinuities,

we took our larger number of categories back to 1968, the twelve up through

1969 and analyzed the two estimates of inflation for 1969. The differences

were trivial and this result combined with Bureau of Labor Statistics

statements made us confident that no major problem occurs because of the greater

disaggregation available beginning in 1969.

*    This   research is part of the NBER programs on Social Insurance and Pensions.

     We are deeply indebted to Dong—Ik Lee for valuabel advice and assistance.

1.   Traditionally, the base period index is set equal to 100, so the formula

     above would be multiplied by 100.

2.   We were not able to find a good correspondence for expenditures on

     miscellaneous current consumption expenditures (these include such

     items as banking fees, checkwriting charges, accounting fees, funeral

     expenses, etc.), so we eliminated these expenditures from the price

     calculations. In total, however, these expenditures are a small

     fraction of the expenditures of the elderly; among families with heads

     who are age 65 and over, the fraction on miscellaneous expenditures was

     less than 1%.

3.   Congressional hearings have produced several "experimental" CPI measures,

     each assessing housing in a different manner. Our approach is similar to

     the rental equivalence measure which will be officially published in 1983

     and used for indexing purposes in 1985, and we have calculations based

     on alternative user cost of capital estimates as well. These follow the

     same qualitative pattern as our rental equivalent estimates.

4.   This general result is derived in Dougherty and Van Order (1982).

5.   The official adjustment for 1981 was 10.2% based on annual averages

     first quarter to first quarter. By the end of 1981, the official CPI

     was rising less rapidly than the rental equivalent due to the sharp

     turnaround in the housing market.
