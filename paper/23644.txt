This chapter focuses on women, work, and family, with a particular focus on differences by
educational attainment. First, we review long-term trends regarding family structure, participation
in the labor market, and time spent in household production, including time with children. In
looking at family, we focus on mothers with children. Next we examine key challenges faced by
mothers as they seek to combine motherhood and paid work: workforce interruptions associated
with childbearing, the impact of home and family responsibilities, and constraints posed by
workplace culture. We also consider the role that gendered norms play in shaping outcomes for
mothers. We conclude by discussing policies that have the potential to increase gender equality in
the workplace and mitigate the considerable conflicts faced by many women as they seek to
balance work and family.

     I.     Introduction

     Over the last half century sweeping changes have occurred in women’s and men’s roles in

the household and in their participation in the labor market. These changes have a strong

educational gradient. For instance, marriage has declined for all groups but especially among

those with less education, while women’s labor force participation rates have risen, but most

markedly among those with more education. In this chapter, we begin by documenting major

transformations in the family and labor market, with a particular focus on differences by

educational attainment. In looking at family, we mainly focus on mothers with children –

principally those who are married or single, though we recognize the growing number of

cohabitors. Also, given space limitations, we focus on opposite-sex couples. However, there is

an important and growing literature on the allocation of time in the household and labor market

by gay and lesbian couples with children.1

     Next, we examine key challenges faced by women as they seek to combine motherhood and

work: workforce interruptions due to childbearing, the impact of home and family

responsibilities, and constraints posed by workplace culture and “how business is done.” A

particular contribution of this discussion is that we pay close attention to the very different

experiences of women at the top and bottom of the educational distribution. We also look at

persistent gendered norms about appropriate roles in the family and how they impact labor

market and family outcomes. Finally, we consider possible changes in employer and government

policies and in how the workplace is structured that have the potential to benefit individuals,

families, and society at large.

    II.    Work and Family: Then and Now

    In this section, our focus is on major transformations in the family, in mothers’ employment

and earnings, and in their allocation of time between the household and the market. While our

focus is on major, long-term shifts we also note that many dimensions of this transformation

have stalled in more recent decades.

    A. Sweeping Changes in the American Family

    The most dramatic change in the family since the 1960s and 70s, has been the decline in

married couple families – what has been termed a “retreat” from marriage (see for instance,

Andrew Cherlin, 2009; Ellwood and Jencks, 2004, and Lundberg and Pollak, 2016). This

decline can be seen in Figure 1, which provides data on the percentage of currently married

adults for 1970 to 2014.2 Over that period, the percentage declined from 72 to 55 percent for all

race/ethnic groups. This figure also shows that while a majority of white non-Hispanic and

Hispanic women were married in 2014 (59 and 52 percent, respectively), this was true for just 38

percent of African-American women. As discussed at length in Blau and Winkler (2018), the

move away from marriage is related to a host of forces: economic (increases in women’s labor

force participation, educational attainment, career commitment, and wages combined with

declining real wages for less skilled men); technological (reproductive technology such as the

pill and household technology such as the microwave); social (attitudes about premarital sex and

 U.S. Census Bureau data on all women ages 15+ indicate that the percentage married was 66
percent in both 1950 and 1960, fell to 62 percent in 1970, and stood at 51 percent in 2015. See
U.S. Census Bureau, Table MS-1, “ Marital Status of the Population 15 Years Old and Over, by
Sex, Race and Hispanic Origin: 1950 to Present,” www.census.gov, accessed April 21, 2017.
                                                                                                    3
unmarried fertility), and legal (changing divorce laws).3 The decline in married-couple families

was accompanied by a considerable increase in single-parent families and, especially in more

recent decades, many more cohabiting families.

    Figure 2 provides data on the rise in single-mother families. By 2015, they comprised 26

percent of all families with children (and 75 percent of all single-parent families), up from just

under 12 percent in 1970. Notably most of this increase had occurred by 1990. The figure also

points to substantial and persistent differences across race/ethnicity groups; in 2015 mother-only

families comprised 54 percent of all African-American families with children as compared to 19

percent of white, non-Hispanic families and 29 percent of Hispanic families.

    Trends in family structure also diverge by educational attainment and this divergence is

growing as observed by Blau (1998) and McLanahan (2004) and more recently by Isen and

Stevenson (2010) and Lundberg and Pollak (2016). This is illustrated in Figure 3, which

provides data on the percentage of women aged 30-50 currently married by educational

attainment for 1970 and 2015. In 1970, differences across education groups were not very large,

ranging from 78 to 85 percent, with the higher figure for women with a high school education.

Between 1970 and 2015, marriage declined for all educational groups, but most dramatically for

those with less education. By 2015, the share currently married was 71 percent for college

graduates versus 54 to 56 percent for the other education groups.4

    B. Trends in Labor Force Participation, Work Experience, and Hours Worked

    Dramatic changes have similarly occurred in women’s labor force participation rates and

 Goldin and Katz (2002) first pointed to the pivotal role of the birth control pill in family
decisions. However, in recent research Caitlyn Myers (forthcoming) finds that access to abortion
played a larger role.
4
  There is also a strong educational gradient in rates of cohabitation and unmarried births; both
outcomes are substantially higher among those with less education as discussed in Fletcher and
Polos, this volume, Lundberg and Pollak (2015), and Blau and Winkler (2018).
                                                                                                     4
their broader presence in the labor market, especially since the 1960s, what Claudia Goldin

(2006) has called a “quiet revolution.” Key factors behind these changes are women’s rising

levels of educational attainment and wages, greater availability of market substitutes for

household production and improvements in household technology, the development and

dissemination of the birth control pill, and demand shifts that favored occupations like clerical

work where women were well represented, as well as changes in the family (see, for instance,

Blau and Winkler, 2018; Bailey and DiPrete, 2016; Blau and Kahn, 2007; and Blau and Kahn,

forthcoming). The labor force participation rate of women (ages 16+) rose from 37.7 percent in

1960 to 60 percent in the mid-1990s and remained at roughly that level through the first decade

of the 2000s. It subsequently declined to 57 percent as of 2015. In contrast to the experience for

women, men’s labor force participation rate has steadily declined since WWII, albeit at a more

modest rate. It stood at 83.3 percent in 1960 and subsequently declined to 69 percent in 2015.

Thus, from 1960 to 2015, the gender difference in the overall labor force participation rate fell

from 45.6 percentage points to just a 12 percentage point difference.5

      Again, there is a strong educational gradient. Figure 4 shows trends in the labor force

participation rates of women and men (ages 25-64) by educational attainment for 1970 and 2015.

Over this period, while women’s labor force participation rates increased for all groups, they rose

most sharply for college-educated women and hardly at all for women who did not complete

high school. As just one point of comparison, panel a shows that the participation rate for women

                                                                                                     5
who completed high school (only) increased from 51.3 to 62.2 percent (11 percentage points),

while it rose from 60.8 to nearly 80 percent (19 points) for women with a college degree or more.

For men, panel b shows declining labor force participation rates for all groups, with the smallest

decrease for men with a college degree or more and an especially marked decline for the least

skilled (those who completed HS or less).6

         Focusing on mothers, we see in Figure 5 that labor force participation rates for women

with children under age 18 have increased dramatically over the past half century, contributing to

the large increases for women overall. From 1960 to the mid-1990s, participation rates for

married mothers rose from just 28 to a high of 70 percent. The rate then plateaued and began to

decline slightly starting in the early 2000s. These patterns closely track and help to drive the

patterns for women overall. In 1975, (the first year for which these data were available) the

participation rate for never-married mothers was fairly similar to the rate for their married

counterparts, but changed little through the early 1990s and so increasingly lagged that of

married women. However, the participation rate for this group subsequently sharply increased,

rising from 53 percent in 1992 to 75 percent by the early 2000s, eventually surpassing that of

married mothers. These participation rate gains resulted from a combination of major federal

policy changes and the buoyant labor market of the 1990s (Blank, 2000; and Meyer and

Rosenbaum, 2000). The participation rate of this group has declined somewhat since the early

2000s as well. The net result is that by 2015 the participation gap between married and never-

married mothers stood at just 4.6 percentage points. The participation rate for ever-married

(separated, divorced or widowed) mothers exceeded that of married mothers throughout the

period and experienced a comparable 1990s increase to that of never-married mothers for similar

reasons. As of 2015, the participation rate for this group stood 10.6 percentage points higher than

that for married mothers.

    As for all women (and all men), there is a sharp educational gradient in participation rates for

mothers. Illustrating this point, Figure 6 provides figures on labor force participation rates of

mothers with infants. In 2013, the rate was 74 percent for those who had completed four years of

college or more as compared to 64 percent for those with some college and just 50 percent for

those with high school or less. Note that not only did college-graduate mothers have the highest

participation rates, they also had the largest increase in participation between 2006 and 2013.

    Also of importance, particularly for wages, women’s labor force attachment (continuity of

employment) has also been increasing. This is the case, for example over the course of a year,

with the share of employed women working year-round and full-time increasing from 41 percent

in 1970 to 61 percent in 2014.7 Women are also working more consistently over the life cycle.

While employed women still have less average labor-market experience than men, the gender

experience gap—the difference in average years of labor market experience between women and

men—began to decline beginning in the 1980s (O’Neil and Polachek, 1993; and Blau and Kahn,

1997). Blau and Kahn (forthcoming) report that the gap fell from 6.8 years in 1981 to 3.8 years

in 2007 (just before the Great Recession) and 1.4 years in 2011.8

       As with the other outcomes reviewed, there is a strong educational gradient in

accumulated work experience. Goldin and Mitchell (2017) show that women’s work experience

 Blau and Kahn (forthcoming) note that the very small experience gap in 2011 may be partly
due to the negative effect of the Great Recession on male experience levels.
                                                                                                    7
is greatest for the most highly educated. For instance, for the 1970 to 1974 birth cohort, average

work experience for college graduates was 8.7 years at ages 25-34, as compared to 7.3 years for

those with some college or less.

       The increase in women’s labor force attachment is further illustrated by changes in how

quickly women return to the labor force after a first birth. Table 1 provides comparison figures

for the 1960s and first decade of the 2000s. Of those women who worked during pregnancy, 72

percent in the recent cohort returned to work within 6 months as compared to just 21 percent in

the earlier cohort. Dey (2016) further documents a narrowing of the gender difference in

workforce interruptions, which she largely attributes to new mothers’ swifter return to the labor

force than in decades past (rather than men’s reduced participation rates). Goldin and Mitchell

(2017) point to another new development. With the rise in the mean age of first birth, declines in

labor women’s force participation associated with childbearing interruptions are occurring later

than in past years, a pattern they describe as a new “sagging middle.” This trend may also be

associated with the rise what is known as the “sandwich generation,” mothers of children who

are concurrently taking care of their elderly parents (Parker and Patten, 2013).9

       Although women’s labor force participation and attachment have increased, important

differences remain in hours worked. Most notably, a larger fraction of women work part-time

compared to men—25 percent versus just over 12 percent. The incidence of part-time work for

mothers (whether married or not) is similar to the incidence for all women. Table 2, which

provides figures on mothers’ employment status, indicates that 24 percent of all employed

mothers with children under 18 years of age were employed part time and the corresponding

figure for those with a child under age 1 was around 27 percent. Nonetheless, these figures also

point to the fact that a substantial share of employed mothers, even those with infants, combine

family with full-time paid employment.

       At the top end of the hours distribution, a greater fraction of men than women engage in

what has been termed “long hours” or “overwork,” typically defined as employment of more

than 50 hours per week. Cha and Weeden (2014) find that this gender difference in long hours

changed little over the 1979 to 2009 period. There is a notable educational (and occupational)

gradient in who is working long hours. Jacobs and Gerson (2004) and Kuhn and Lozano (2008)

find that the length of the workweek has generally decreased for workers with less than a high

school education, while it rose for those who completed four or more years of college, as well as

for those in professional, managerial, and technical occupations. Boushey and Ansel (2016)

provide detailed evidence on this divide by occupation using pooled data for 2011-2014. They

find that workers with jobs in health-care support, food preparation, and clerical occupations

(occupations more dominated by women) were employed the fewest hours and those in legal and

management positions were employed the greatest number of hours.10

       C. Earnings and Income by Family Type

       The increase in married women’s labor force participation that we have reviewed has led

in turn to an increase in dual-earner families among married couples. As may be seen in Table 3,

among couples with children under 18, the share of dual-earner families rose from 54 percent in

1976 (the first year for which data are available) to a high of nearly 70 percent in 1990. It stayed

at that level through 2000 and then declined to 64 percent in 2010, where it remained in 2014.

This pattern tracks the labor force participation trends of married women discussed earlier. As

may also be seen in Table 3, the decline in dual-earner couples since 2000 primarily reflects a

                                                                                                   9
rise in husband-only employed (stay-at-home mother) families, as well as smaller increases in

wife-only employed (stay-at-home father) families and families where neither parent works.

Kreider and Elliott (2010) and Livingston (2014) provide ancillary evidence that it is less-

educated mothers who comprised the growing share of stay-at-home mothers. (This point is

discussed further below in light of particular concern about “opting out” among college-educated

mothers.)

       Women’s economic contribution in dual-earner families has increased considerably. For

instance, in families with employed wives, wives’ contribution to family income rose from 26.6

percent in 1970 to 37.3 percent in 2013.11 Consistent with this, the percentage of wives with

higher annual earnings than their husbands increased from 16 percent in 1981 to 29 percent by

2015.12 An issue which has been relatively unexamined, with the exception of Winkler,

McBride, and Andrews (2005), is whether this earnings pattern is transitory or more permanent

(which would likely affect the strength of women’s bargaining power in the household). These

authors find that this earnings pattern is persistent, as measured over a three-year period, for a

large fraction of such couples (60 percent). The increasing share of wives who out-earn their

husbands is part of a broader pattern of a narrowing of the earnings difference between husbands

and wives. One factor contributing to this is that couples are increasingly likely to marry those

who are similar to themselves in terms of educational attainment (McKinnish and Mansour, this

volume, Schwartz and Mare, 2005).13 However, more generally, the narrowing gender earnings

gap among married couples reflects an overall rise in the gender earnings ratio. For the labor

force as a whole, the gender earnings ratio for year-round, full-time workers rose from around 60

percent in the 1970s to nearly 80 percent in 2015.14 This trend reflects many of the factors

previously discussed, including women’s rising educational attainment and labor force

attachment. In addition, the occupational upgrading of women, combined with a reduction in

labor market discrimination and shifts in the overall demand for labor favoring women relative to

men also contributed (see Blau and Kahn (forthcoming) for recent evidence and a review).15

       Single-mother families are at a substantial relative economic disadvantage compared to

married-couple families, in part because there is only one earner and in part because never-

married mothers, who tend to have less education, are a large and increasing share of all single

mothers— the share of never-married mothers among single mothers rose from 4 percent in 1960

to 44 percent in 2011 (Wang, Parker, and Taylor, 2013). The net result is that in 2015, nearly 40

percent of female-headed families were poor, compared to around 8 percent of married couples.

Poverty rates were particularly high for black and Hispanic female-headed families, with 46

percent of both groups living in poverty. Even among white, non-Hispanic female-headed

families, the poverty rate was 32 percent.16

       Among married couples with children, the gender gap in housework and childcare has

considerably narrowed, though it is far from parity. Arlie Hochschild (1989) famously described

large amount of unpaid work performed by employed women as “the second shift.” Bianchi et al.

(2000, with the trend updated in a 2012 follow-up piece) found that married women spent 1.7

times as much time in housework as married fathers in 2010, down from 7 times as much in

1965. This decline was mainly due to women’s considerable reduction in time spent in

housework; men only modestly increased their housework time in the 1980s. Another piece of

evidence on the current (unequal) situation is that, in 2014, husbands with employed wives spent

only slightly more time in unpaid work than those with nonemployed wives; far from more

equally sharing the load (Blau and Winkler, 2018). Nonetheless, a key consequence of women’s

substantial reduction in housework time, combined with their rising labor force participation

rates, is a considerable narrowing of the difference in women’s and men’s allocation of time to

home activities and paid work.

       Parents’ time with children has also changed considerably from the 1960s to present, as

documented by Bianchi, Robinson, and Milkie (2006), Hofferth and Lee (2015), and Parker and

Wang (2015). From 1965 to 1985, mothers’ primary time spent caring for children declined as

they entered the labor force in greater numbers, but it rose steadily thereafter, for both single and

married mothers and for both the employed and nonemployed.17 Fathers’ time with children

(principally those in two-parent families) has also increased since 1985. Nevertheless, in

married-couple families, a substantial gender gap in time spent with children remains.

       As might be expected, employed mothers spend somewhat less time with children than

nonemployed mothers (see for instance, Guryan, Hurst, and Kearney, 2008; and Fox, Han,

Ruhm; and Waldfogel, 2013). However, Bianchi (2000) points out that a number of factors

narrow this difference including the fact that, as we have seen, a large fraction of mothers are

employed part-time and many children (even those of nonemployed mothers) are in preschool.18

Single mothers spend somewhat less time with children, in part because they do not have a

second parent in the household with whom they can coordinate care and other household tasks

(Fox et al., 2013).

     Much attention has focused on the allocation of parental time with children by parent’s level

of education. More highly educated mothers and fathers spend more time directly engaged with

their children than their less-educated counterparts, a pattern that holds regardless of the parent’s

employment or marital status, and is observed across a large number of economically advanced

countries (Guryan, Hurst and Kearney, 2008). And, this gap has been widening over time

(Ramey and Ramey, 2010; and Lundberg and Pollak, 2014). The fact that highly-educated

parents spend more time with their children is in some respects counter to what would be

expected based on economic theory, since they have a higher opportunity cost of time. Among

alternative explanations, time spent with children may be regarded as a luxury good (Guryan et

al. 2008). Also, more-educated parents have the financial resources to enable them to make

more time for children: they are more able to outsource household tasks or purchase market

substitutes, are likely to have jobs that provide greater flexibility, and are more likely to be

married and so have a second adult with whom they can coordinate schedules. Some research

also suggests that highly educated parents tend to regard time with children as a necessary

   III.      Women, Work, and Family: Bringing It All Together

     Considerable progress has been made on many fronts since the 1960s – women’s rising

participation rates and labor force attachment, a declining gender pay gap, and a narrowing of the

difference in time spent in housework and childcare by wives and husbands—but progress is far

from complete. And, new challenges have arisen, with the rise in dual-earner families, including

those with small children, and the increase in employed single-parent families. In other words, a

growing share of the workforce is seeking to balance the dual demands of paid work and family.

In this section we examine work-family challenges for mothers with children under age 18 with a

primary focus on the effect of child care burdens, but, as previously noted, some mothers are

concurrently caring for aging parents as well. As relevant and as data and research findings

permit, we look at the different experiences and challenges for women at various points in the

educational distribution.

   A. Pregnancy, Childbearing and Workforce Interruptions

          As reviewed in Section II, childbearing continues to involve at least some amount of

workforce interruption for most employed women, even if it is just for a few months after each

birth. Leave, especially paid leave, is important in placing women and men on a more equal

footing in the workforce and ensuring continuity in general and firm-specific work experience.

However, the United States is the only economically advanced country that does not have a

federal paid leave policy (it mandates 12 weeks of unpaid leave and it has been estimated that




                                                                                                 14
only 59 percent of private sector workers are eligible).19 In addition, the United States is also less

generous in the provision of other family friendly policies, including child care and opportunities

for part-time work. In their analysis of data for 22 OECD countries over the period 1990 to

2010, Blau and Kahn (2013) show that the gap in family-friendly policies between the United

States and other countries is large and growing with consequent effects for women’s labor force

participation rates. Indeed, they find that over the study period, a substantial portion (nearly 30

percent) of the considerable decrease in U.S. women’s labor force participation rates relative to

other economically advanced nations that occurred at that time was due to the greater expansion

in these other countries of various family-friendly policies, including the length and generosity of

parental leave, mandates for part-time availability, and expenditures on child care. (Their

findings also suggest that extended leave may come at a cost for women’s careers, as discussed

in a subsequent section.) For the United States, Rossin-Slater, Ruhm, and Waldfogel (2013)

provide research evidence on California, one of the few states that mandates paid leave. Using a

difference in differences approach, they find that paid leave increased the usual weekly work

hours of employed mothers of one-to-three year olds.

       While family-friendly policies undoubtedly play an important role in women’s labor

force participation rates, the Blau and Kahn (2013) findings suggest that they are not the whole

story (again, accounting for about 30 percent of the U.S. relative participation rate decline). This

is consistent with Goldin and Mitchell’s (2017) conclusion that differences in leave policy are

not the main reason for the differences in women’s participation between the U.S. and other

countries. They note that life cycle-participation patterns (including post-birth participation dips)

are similar for the United States and the United Kingdom even though the latter has longer

protected and paid leave. Olivetti and Petrongolo’s (2017) review of the literature and analysis

of the international data gives a more important role to spending on early education and childcare

than to leave policies; these are also areas where the United States performs poorly relative to

other countries.20

        Childbearing and childrearing may also affect wages as first discussed in Mincer and

Polachek (1974). Subsequent work including Light and Ureta (1995) confirmed that interruptions

played an important role in explaining the gender gap in wages for young workers over the 1966-

1984 period. However, research by Blau and Kahn (forthcoming) which compared 2010 to

earlier years found that labor market experience has significantly diminished in importance in

explaining the overall gender wage gap, as women’s average experience levels have become

more similar to men’s, although they still play a role. Moreover, the importance of gender

differences in experience and workforce interruptions appears to vary by skill level and

occupation. Recent influential work by Goldin (2014) and others, discussed at length shortly, has

pointed to large negative effects of long hours and workforce interruptions on wages and the

gender wage gap in high-skilled occupations, particularly law and business.

     Women who are pregnant and those who have recently borne children face a number of

unique challenges. For instance, pregnant women must be careful to avoid heavy lifting and

excessive physical exertion and may require extra water or restroom breaks (Bakst, 2012; and

Schulte, 2014). To the extent that manual occupations and service positions provide less

flexibility at the worker’s discretion than professional jobs (Williams, Blair-Loy, and Berdahl,

2013), women in such positions are likely to be more negatively affected.

                                                                                                   16
   Another issue unique to new mothers is breastfeeding. For mothers who return to work and

continue to breastfeed, employers tend to vary in their willingness to make needed

accommodations such as permitting breaks and providing a private area. In their statistical

analysis, Rippeyoung and Noonan (2012) find that, controlling for “work orientation” prior to

childbirth (among other factors), mothers who breastfed their children for a longer duration (six

months or more), experienced a much greater loss in income (due to reduced hours and exit from

the labor force) for the first five years post-birth than those who did so for a shorter duration or

used formula.

   B. Impact of Home Responsibilities, Including Child Care, on Employment and Earnings

   As we saw in Section II, the allocation of time in the home remains extremely unequal

between married parents and single mothers have no adult with whom to share household

responsibilities. Due to these unequal burdens, home responsibilities tend to disproportionately

impact mothers’ paid labor market activity on a range of dimensions, whether it be the

occupations they choose, the jobs they take, or the hours that they work, with consequent effects

on their earnings and career trajectories. Becker (1985) put forth a theory of diminished work

effort as one explanation for a gender wage difference. He argued that the time devoted by

married women to home and child-care activities might reduce the effort that they put into their

market jobs, controlling for hours, and thus decrease their hourly wages compared to men with

similar qualifications. Hersch and Stratton (1997) provide evidence of a negative impact of

housework on married women’s wages in models estimated using fixed effects and instrumental

variables to address concerns that an unobservable factor might be driving the results or that

women with higher wages “buy” themselves out of housework. In a follow-up 2002 paper they

examine this relationship for all women regardless of marital status and again identify a negative



                                                                                                       17
relationship, suggesting that it is the effort involved with housework, not marriage per se that

drove the original finding. We note however, that neither study was restricted to mothers, which

is the focus here.

       There is a voluminous research literature on motherhood and employment (for early

influential papers see Fuchs, 1988; Korenman and Neumark, 1992, and Waldfogel, 1998).

Mothers earn less than non-mothers, what has come to be known as a “motherhood penalty.” As

we saw in the prior section, a large fraction of women, especially mothers, work part-time. Part-

time work, by and large, comes at a cost in terms of lower wages and benefits, and fewer

opportunities for promotion (see for instance, Budig, Misra, and Boeckmann, 2016). And

motherhood tends to be associated with work force interruptions and lower accumulation of

work experience—although less so than in the past. However, what has received considerable

attention (see, for instance, Budig and England, 2001; Binder, Anderson, and Krause, 2003; and

Budig, 2014) is that a motherhood penalty exists even for mothers with the same labor-market

experience and education as non-mothers. An important methodological issue in this literature is

identifying causal relationships. For instance, a selection argument is plausible in that women

with lower wage offers will have lower costs of children. To address this specific concern, the

common approach taken in this research is to estimate fixed-effect regressions.

       Of particular interest here, the aforementioned authors – Binder et al. (2003), Budig and

England (2001), and Budig (2014) – investigated not just the overall motherhood penalty, but

also looked at it by mother’s educational attainment. Taken together, these studies find that the

largest wage penalties are borne by women in medium-skill jobs or those at the lower end of the

wage distribution—rather than by high-skilled women or those at the top of the wage

distribution. One possible explanation for this overall set of findings is that more high-skilled



                                                                                                    18
mothers may have greater workplace flexibility which serves to attenuate negative wage impacts

associated with motherhood.

       Apart from flexibility issues, another explanation for the motherhood penalty is that some

mothers may be unable to return to their previous employer after childbirth, and instead must

change firms, especially if their employer does not provide adequate maternity leave or if they

are not eligible for or cannot take advantage of unpaid leave through the 1993 federal Family and

Medical Leave Act. (Waldfogel, 1998).21 Women in this situation lose out on the benefits of

firm-specific training and potential rewards from an especially good job match.

       Laboratory and field experiments by Correll, Benard, and Paik (2007) provide

compelling evidence for an additional factor, suggesting that at least part of the explanation for

the motherhood penalty is labor market discrimination against mothers – differential treatment of

otherwise equally qualified mothers by employers. In a lab study, they modified resumes to

include an indicator of parental status.22 They found that mothers were perceived more

negatively than non-mothers as measured by indicators of perceived competence and

commitment. In a field experiment, they again used fictitious resumes (which varied by

indicators of parental status) but in this case sent them to employers. They found that mothers

received fewer callbacks than non-mothers. Fathers did not face a disadvantage in either setting.

       Seminal papers by Mincer (1978) and Sandell (1977) point to another way that family

ties can negatively affect married women’s job and career opportunities: most often, couples

place greater priority on husbands’ careers rather than wives’ careers. This means that wives may

find themselves more likely to be “tied movers,” relocating when it is not advantageous for them

to leave a job where they have accumulated considerable seniority and firm-specific training or

“tied stayers,” unable to relocate despite better opportunities elsewhere. A more recent analysis

by Cooke, Boyle, Couch, and Feijten (2009), which employs fixed-effects regression to account

for unobserved heterogeneity, provides evidence that family relocation decisions lead to an

increase in total family earnings (and so are economically rational for the family, as a whole), but

at the expense of married women’s own earnings. Compton and Pollak (2007) find that, even

among couples in which both spouses have a college degree, it is the education (and presumably

the earning power) of the husband that principally affects the couple’s propensity to migrate to a

large metropolitan area. A methodological challenge that the authors seek to overcome is that

migration and educational investment decisions are endogeneous; to at least partly address this

concern, they include control variables to reduce the likelihood of joint determination (e.g.

whether the current state of residence is the home resident of one of the spouses). Geographic

considerations may impact women’s job choices, even prior to marriage and motherhood.

Benson (2014) shows that anticipation of a lesser ability to determine the geographic location of

the family may lead women to select occupations in which they can later secure a position in a

wide swath of geographic areas (e.g. physicians and accountants) rather than choosing

occupations that tend to have more geographically limited opportunities (e.g., research

scientists)23.

      C. Workplace Culture, Constraints, and Flexibility (or lack thereof)

Workplace culture and expectations significantly contribute to the challenge of combining work

and family, especially with the advent of the ‘24/7’ work culture, both for women in professional

jobs and those in medium-skill and low-wage jobs. These groups are discussed in turn.



23

                                                                                                  20
       According to Davies and Frink (2014), the norm of the “ideal” office worker—typically

applied to white middle-class men—began to emerge towards the start of the 20th century, with

the rise in white-collar (office) work. They describe the ideal worker of that time as “a man

completely devoted to his employer, his faithfulness rewarded by promotions” (p. 26). Even

today, especially for those in professional positions, the maintained assumption by employers is

that work should take precedence over family. This places mothers as well as those fathers who

undertake a substantial share of childcare and housework responsibilities in a bind, and the

degree of conflict has only intensified with the general increase in weekly work hours for

professional and other highly skilled workers that we discussed in Section II.24 Williams, Blair-

Loy, and Berdahl (2013) theorize that professional men and women who make family

considerations an overt priority may experience career repercussions, though for different

reasons. Men may bear a penalty because they are engaging in what the authors call “gender

non-conforming behavior,” given that the idealized male worker focuses exclusively on his

career, while women may bear a penalty since they are engaging in “gender-conforming

behavior,” since their behavior is essentially validating that the workplace is not their main

focus25.

       Recent influential work by Goldin (2014) and others has focused attention on the impact

of workplace culture and expectations (including long hours) on women’s wages, the gender

wage gap, and occupational choice. Goldin focuses on the concept of temporal flexibility (or lack

thereof) and its impact on wages. Temporal flexibility refers to work schedules as they pertain to

hours worked per day and per week, where the work is performed, and the need to work specific

days and times. She observes that some occupations/firms offer disproportionate rewards for

working long hours and particular hours. One common characteristic is that workers in these

situations are not readily substitutable – another worker cannot readily substitute person-specific

or knowledge-specific capital.26 Thus, workers willing to provide longer hours or cover certain

time periods receive a wage premium, while those not willing to do so incur a wage penalty.

Given that women continue to hold a greater share of household responsibilities, they are more

likely to place a higher value on flexibility and hence to bear this type of wage penalty. Goldin

points to lack of temporal flexibility in top management positions and high-powered law firms as

a key factor behind the larger gender wage gaps in these areas. She points to pharmacy as a

notable contrast (Goldin 2014, 2016). These days most pharmacists are employed by large firms

and computerization of the field has facilitated substitutability across workers and thus flexibility

in work hours and scheduling. The result is that the penalties for part-time or part-year work are

small as is the gender wage gap. The Goldin analysis highlights that findings showing returns to

longer hours and labor market experience and penalties to workforce interruptions are

susceptible to interpretations other than human capital.

       In related work, Cha and Weeden (2014) find that trends in “overwork” (working 50+

hours per week) contributed to the slower convergence of the gender wage gap over the 1979 to

2007 period. Specifically, while the gender gap in overwork remained largely unchanged, the

rising returns to overwork combined with the fact that more men engage in this type of

employment served to lower women’s wages relative to men’s, an effect equal to about 10

because he or she has developed a close working relationship with the client and has detailed
knowledge of the case.

percent of the total change in the gap over the 1979-2007 period. Furthermore, this factor was

especially important in managerial and professional occupations.

       One methodological challenge in looking at the relationship between long work hours

and the gender wage gap is identifying a causal relationship To address this, Cortés and Pan

(2016) create an instrumental variable from a supply-side shock; cities differ in the stock of low-

skilled immigrant women. Presumably a greater stock of such women (who provide substitute

labor in home production) should enable a greater proportion of women to work long hours and

reap the attendant rewards. As expected, they find that in cities with more low-skilled immigrant

female labor, the gender wage gap is reduced relatively more in occupations which have the

greatest returns to long work hours.

       The findings of Goldin (2016), Cha and Weeden (2014), and Cortes and Pan (2016) point

to long hours as being an important and growing contributor to the gender pay gap in some high

skill occupations. This may be one reason that highly skilled women appear to have fared less

well than their counterparts in narrowing the gender pay gap over the past thirty years. Blau and

Kahn (forthcoming) found that, in 2010, the gender wage gap was larger at the top of the wage

distribution (90th percentile) than at the middle (50th percentile) or the bottom (10th percentile).

Moreover, they found that the gender wage gap had declined less at the top of the wage

distribution since 1980 than it had at the middle and the bottom of the wage distribution. These

results—a larger current gender wage gap at the top of the wage distribution and slower progress

for those in this group since 1980—remained even after adjusting for gender differences in

qualifications.

       Another potential response to lack of adequate flexibility apart from part-time work or

working in occupations with shorter hours is to exit the labor force entirely. Lisa Belkin (2003)



                                                                                                       23
first famously raised this issue in a 2003 New York Times Magazine article in which she coined

the term “opt out revolution” for college-educated women. Evidence on this varies considerably,

but a key take-away is that there has not been an “opt-out revolution” for this group. Claudia

Goldin (2006) analyzed the career and family patterns of female graduates of selective colleges

from around 1980 (when they graduated) until 15 years later. She found that women with at least

one child spent, on average, just 2 of the 15 years out of the labor market, and fully half of these

women had not been out of the labor market (or an educational institution) for more than six

months.

       Antecol (2011) also examined the extent of opting out among college-educated workers.

While she did not find broad evidence of this behavior, she did find it among the narrow set of

white married college-educated women in male-dominated occupations. Similarly, Cha (2013)

found that overwork (working more than 50 hours per week) in male-dominated occupations is

associated with mothers, but not their female childless counterparts or men, leaving the

occupation. Her finding is suggestive of a “push” from the occupation. Moreover, she found that

such mothers tend to respond by exiting the labor force, rather than shifting to a less male-

dominated occupation.

       While a desire for flexibility may be an explanation for some high-powered women

opting out, Hersch (2013) suggests it may not be the full explanation. In her study, she compares

labor force participation rates for women who graduated from the most elite schools, especially

those who earned MBAs, as compared to those who graduated from less-selective institutions.

After accounting for a host of personal factors, she finds that women who graduated from elite

schools have lower participation rates. She argues that workplace flexibility or lack thereof

cannot explain the difference because women who graduated from both types of schools would



                                                                                                  24
likely find employment at the same firms (and thereby face the same workplace policies). This

may be the case, but it is also possible that the women from the elite schools are

disproportionately employed in high pressure workplaces (firms or departments within firms)

with less flexibility. Hersch suggests that women from the most elite schools may place a higher

value on investing time in children, all else equal.

     A complete picture of workplace culture and flexibility necessitates looking at non-

professional workers because such individuals comprise the majority of the U.S. workforce.

These individuals are both low- and middle-wage workers.27 Low-wage workers, a large fraction

of whom are women, tend to be subject to the most rigid schedules—schedules that are set

largely at the employers’ discretion, not the workers’ (Council of Economic Advisers, 2010;

Golden, 2015; and Boushey and Ansel, 2016b). The middle wage group faces flexibility issues

somewhere in between the other two groups (the group is too heterogeneous to be described by a

single paradigm).

     Considerable concern has been raised regarding the prevalence and consequences of

unpredictable schedules. Workers are often required to be available at a moment’s notice, what

has been referred to as “open availability” or “just in time” scheduling so that the firm can avoid

the costs associated with overstaffing. Workers may also be sent home earlier than expected

when demand is slow, a practice that also leads to irregular shifts and unpredictable earnings.

Williams, Blair-Loy, and Berdahl (2013) and Boushey and Ansel (2016b) discuss that when low-

wage workers request more flexible hours they are often instead offered fewer hours, which

negatively impacts earnings. Further, they observe that lack of adequate employment flexibility


27
  Williams, Blair-Loy and Berdahl (2013) divide families into three groups: low income,
professional (those in the top 20 percent of income and include at least one college graduate),
and the “missing middle.” This latter group is so named because although it is, by far, the
largest, it receives the least attention from researchers.
                                                                                                  25
contributes to greater tardiness and absenteeism as well as more quits. Albeda (2011) points out

that these concerns are especially acute for single mothers who, unless they live with extended

family, find it extremely difficult to juggle schedules. From a policy standpoint, these negative

impacts are of considerable importance. However, we would note that research to date has not

devoted the same level of analytical rigor as has been applied to high-skilled occupations.

   D. Gendered Norms about Appropriate Roles for Women and Men

   Research points to gendered attitudes about appropriate roles for women and men as an

explanation for trends in women’s labor force participation rates (Cotter, Hermsen and

Vanneman 2011; and Fortin 2015). These authors point out that gender roles were becoming

more egalitarian from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s when female labor force participation was

growing, but then did not change further when female participation rate growth stagnated.

However, one challenge is firmly establishing causality since broad changes in participation rates

may influence attitudes. Fortin (2015) addresses this issue by using an instrumental variable

approach. Specifically, she uses an exogenous shock to attitudes in the form of the HIV/AIDS

“scare” —individuals’ concerns about contracting AIDS well-exceeded their actual chances — to

instrument for gender role attitudes. While she acknowledges that the HIV/AIDS is likely to be

only one of the factors that produced the changes in gender role attitudes, she argues that its

effect is sufficient to provide an exogenous source of identification. Using this approach, she

finds that the stalling of progress in gender role attitudes in the mid-1990s explains at least a

third of the leveling-off in female labor force participation trends.

   In related research, Bertrand, Kamenica and Pan (2015) find that gendered norms continue to

hold considerable sway, even in couples with nontraditional earnings patterns—those in which

wives potentially outearn their husbands. While one would expect women in such couples to



                                                                                                    26
have increased bargaining power as a result of their greater earnings, these authors find that a

wife whose earnings are predicted to be greater than her husband’s (and so their economic roles

do not conform to the gender appropriate ones) is actually less likely to participate in the labor

force, all else equal. And, if she does work, she earns less than predicted, in part due to lower

work hours (perhaps to hold down her earnings). Bertrand et al. also find that the wife spends

more time in household tasks, perhaps to make the situation more acceptable to her husband.

They also find that such couples are less happy in their marriage and more likely to divorce.

   Bertrand et al.’s finding regarding time spent in housework is consistent with earlier work by

Bittman, England, Folbre, Sayer, and Matheson (2003), who find that wives who earn the

majority of family earnings spend more time in housework than those who bring home a smaller

share of the earnings. Some research has questioned Bittman et al’s findings (see England, 2011;

Gupta, 2007; and Sullivan, 2011), but what particularly distinguishes Bertrand et al.’s study is

that they found this result in models that looked at within couple variation in earnings over time.

In addition, they included controls for the level of both husband’s and wife’s income; if this is

not done, the impact of relative income might pick up some of the effect of the absolute income

levels of each spouse.

   An additional point relates to Bertrand et al.’s finding for divorce. They found that couples

with a nontraditional earnings pattern are more likely to divorce. However some evidence

suggests attitudes about gender appropriate roles are changing (Wang, Parker, and Taylor, 2013),

and so this impact may be diminishing. Consistent with this, related work by Schwartz and Han

(2014), which examines divorce patterns by spouse’s relative educational advantage (rather than

earnings advantage), finds that married couples formed since the early 1990s in which the wife

holds the educational advantage are less prone to divorce then earlier cohorts and are now no



                                                                                                     27
longer more likely to divorce than couples in which the husband has the educational advantage.28

     Recent research nonetheless indicates that gender identity as it affects the marriage market

may shape the responses of even young, college-educated single (and childless) women,

suggesting that such views continue to have a strong hold. Using survey and experimental

methods applied to MBA students, Bursztyn, Fujiwara, and Pallais (2017) collected information

on single women’s expressed job preferences and personality traits. They found that when these

women expected their responses to be public (shared with their MBA classmates) single women

gave less career-minded responses than when they expected their classmates would not see their

responses, perhaps to make themselves appear less ambitious and thus more attractive in the

marriage market.

     While much research looks at the impact of gendered norms on labor market outcomes,

Pedulla and Thébaud (2015) investigate the extent to which the family-friendly nature of the

workplace (e.g. the availability of paid family leave, subsidized child care, the option for flexible

hours) affects preferences regarding spouses’ gender roles (e.g. male/primary earner,

wife/primary earner, egalitarian). They use an experimental research design applied to young

unmarried childless women and men. In one experiment, they randomly ask respondents about

preferred gender roles (without any information about the availability of family-friendly

workplace policies) and in another they ask respondents the same question after “priming” them

with information about the broad availability of such policies. They find that when “primed”

with this information, men’s preferences regarding gender roles are not affected while women

indicate that they are more likely to prefer an egalitarian arrangement. Their findings suggest

that the availability of family-friendly workplace policies may be effective in shifting gendered

preferences, particularly of women, and, in turn, reducing inequality in the allocation of time

between husbands and wives.

       IV.     Conclusion and Suggestions for Moving Forward

       In this chapter we reviewed long-term trends and research evidence on women, work, and

family. In doing so, we looked at evidence by educational attainment to a greater extent than is

usually done. We saw that mothers, at all points in the educational distribution, face challenges

in balancing work and family, though the specifics differ. There is also an important

intergenerational dimension to differences by parents’ educational attainment. As we have seen,

time with children has especially increased among highly-educated parents. To the extent that

less educated mothers have less flexibility in the workplace, they cannot as easily adjust their

schedules to spend more time with children, contributing to this difference. To reduce the

disproportionate challenges faced by mothers in the labor market, policies and practices should

take explicit account of differences by educational attainment so that they meet the needs of all

Americans, not just those who are in one segment of jobs or the other.

       When available, leave policies and other family friendly policies, have the potential to

increase gender equality in the workplace, especially if men utilize these policies as well as

women. As discussed earlier, Blau and Kahn (2013) point to the important role that family policy

plays in supporting women’s paid work. However, they also present evidence suggesting that

extremely generous family policies may encourage women’s employment in part-time work and

lower-level occupations. Thus the participation gains may come at a cost in terms of advancing

women’s status in the labor market. Olivetti and Petrongolo (2017) similarly point to potentially

beneficial effects of moderate (up to one year) leave on women’s employment (largely driven by

effects on the employment of less-skilled women). In contrast, they find that longer leaves have



                                                                                                    29
detrimental effects on employment for all women (regardless of skill level) and negative effects

on the relative earnings of higher-skilled women, indicative of the consequences of losing out on

valuable career advancement opportunities.

        It might be argued that the negative effects of parental leave on women’s outcomes could

be considerably mitigated if men more equally shared in leave taking. For this reason, some

countries, including Norway and Sweden, have instituted “daddy leave” which provides a period

of paid leave that is available exclusively to the father after the birth of a child on a “use it or

lose it” basis. Such policies have been found to increase leave utilization by fathers (although not

to the point of equalizing the duration of leave taken across mothers and fathers). One reason for

this is that if the family wishes to fully avail itself of the entire leave allotment, fathers have an

incentive to take the “daddy leave” since they cannot transfer this benefit to the mother (Haas

and Rostgaard, 2011). However, evidence for a similar program in Quebec suggests that fathers

had a very high take up even though most families had not fully exhausted their leave allotment

under the previous program—that is the draw into the program was not simply to “stretch” the

total amount of leave time available to the family (Patnaik, 2016). Patnaik suggests that the

“daddy only” label itself may help to promote father’s leave-taking through its effect on norms

about paternal leave-taking.

        Another very important point about family-friendly policies is that child-care subsidies

potentially have different effects than leave and part-time policies. This is a policy option that

make it easier to combine work and family and unambiguously increase women’s labor force

participation, without the potentially detrimental effects associated with leave policies (Olivetti

and Petrolongo, 2017; and Blau and Winkler, 2018).

        Another “way forward” is restructuring the workplace and re-setting workplace norms.



                                                                                                         30
Goldin (2014, 2016) point to the case of pharmacy as an occupation in which hourly wages are

not much impacted by shorter or longer work hours. However, the question remains as to how

applicable the example of pharmacy is for other professions requiring college and advanced

degrees, since conditions which have permitted such a high degree of substitution among

pharmacy workers may not be present elsewhere. Regarding workplace norms, France has taken

an interesting step by pushing back on the intrusion of technology into the private lives of

workers (The Guardian, 2016). It has passed a law that requires firms with more than 50

workers to set out times when workers can be disconnected from email communication. Another

option, as discussed by Boushey and Ansel (2016) and Correll, Kelly, O'Connor and Williams

(2014), among others, is for firms to give workers greater say over where and when work is

performed. Government can also mandate this as well, such as Vermont, which, in 2014,

adopted a “right to request” part-time policy. However, it is policies like these in other OECD

countries that, as discussed above, are believed to have contributed to women’s concentration in

part-time and lower-level jobs. Thus, similar to the reasons discussed regarding leave, it is

crucial that both male and female workers utilize any flexibility that is provided so that they are

on a level playing field in the workplace.

       As we have noted, it is likely that professional workers have more flexibility than other

workers. Nonetheless, our review of the evidence on the role of temporal inflexibility in

adversely impacting some highly skilled workers, particularly in law and management, suggests

that they could benefit from additional flexibility. With regard to the workplace situation of the

vast majority of workers who are neither professionals nor employed in positions requiring a

college degree, policies that give greater employee discretion over work hours and provide

greater predictability in hours would facilitate work-family balance, without unduly jeopardizing
