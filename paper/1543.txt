              Short — Term Movements of Long — Term
             Real Intere St Rates:   Ev idence from
                the U.K. Indexed Bond Market



                             ABSTRACT




      The central government now issues both nomi nal and inflation indexed
 long—term bonds i n the United Kingdom. The diff erence in their yields
provides one measure of the long-term expected r ate of inflation. The
evidence suggests that higher long—term, cx pected, real yields are
associated with forecasts of higher income,
                                              with tighter monetary policy,
and with positive aggregate suppi y shocks. Changes in the short—term
growth rate of the monetary base, which pre sumably capture the so—called
liquidity effect on short-term in terest rat es, do not perceptibly alter
long-term real rates. Long-term real rates also appear to be unaffected
the rate of expected inflation. Comparison with nominal interest rate       by
equation estimates reveals that concl usi ons about the effect of all
variables are extremely sensitive to the choice of a proxy for
                                                                 expected
long-term inflation.

 I. Introduction:       Review and Preview

      Identifying   the determinants of 1 ong—terrn          real interest rates has been
 hampered by the difficulty of measuring the             very series whose movements we
 wish to explain. Neither financial markets              nor surveys have provided
 estimates over time of long-term real rates            directly   or, through forecasts
 of long-tern-i inflation, indirectly.' Econometric forecasts of long-term

 inflation are necessarily very sensitive to the assumed values over the

 long-term of the driving variables, like the money supply. Unconditional

 long-term forecasts obtained using time—sen es models seem equally

 unsatisfactory since those methods essential ly predict that the average

 inflation rate over the long term will be the same as that observed
                                                                     over
 the sample period.

     A new source of information about
                                       financial market expectations of
 long—term inflation now exists.          Since

United Kin gdom has issued both     n om i n a 1
                                                   and indexed long-term bonds.2 Here
we use the additional     informat-j on   provi ded by the yields on these real

bonds to obtain a measure of expected inflation and then investigate what

factors drive thes e real rates over time.             In the remainder of this section
we briefly review   the recent empirical           literature on U.K. interest rates.
The next section 1 ays   out a model of real          interest rates. Section III
presents the resul ts   of estimating the          real rate model. Sections IV and V
investigate the effects    of taxes and al
measures. Section     VI offers concluding remarks.
     Although the movements of interest rates and especi             ally t he   relation
between nominal rates and (expected) inflation 'have been the
                                                              subject of a
great deal of recent research in the United States o ver the last decade,

hardly any work has been done in the United Kingdom until
                                                                      very
recently..."(Foster (1979)). This relative lack of             attention   to U.K.
                                               —2-



interest rates is probably due to            the   fact that the Bank of England

traditionally has virtually pegged short—term interest rates. "Changes in

MLR (Minimum Lending Rate offered by the Bank of England to clearing banks)

were administrative i n nature.                      "Of greater operational significance

in enforcing its desi red level of short-term interest rates was the Bank of

England's practice of quoting the price at which it would buy or sell

Treasury and other el igible      bi lls.            (Barclays Bank, p. 1). Estimates of

the relation between nominal       s   hort interest rates and other factors based

on pre—1980 data then seem as likely to capture Bank of England policy

rules    as private sect or   behavi or.      In the 1980s the Bank of England has

completely abandoned quoting b         ill   prices, having decided to permit "market

forces a greater role      in determi fling the structure of short-term interest

rates, and permit gre ater      flexib ility."3 Nevertheless, some attenipts have

been    made to explain   the movement of nominal interest rates in the U.K.

before this regime switch.

        Ball (1965) examines the movement of the annual average yield on

consols over the 1921—61 period. Though he concludes that movnents in

money (relative to income) are negatively associated with movements in the

nominal long rate, he finds no evidence "that the rate of inflation

affected   the bond rate" (p. 91) . As he notes, deriving a measure of the
average inflation expected over the infinite future is problematic. As
proxies for the desired measure, Ball uses actual year-over-year inflation
and a geometrically-declining weighted average (with decay rate 0.5) of

past inflation. Neither proxy significantly affects nominal rates over the

whole sample or over its post-war portion. From 1921 to 1961, the price

level grew at an annual compound rate of 2 percent. Year-to-year inflation
                                      -3—


 rates, however, ranged from minus 20 percent (1921—1922) to plus 20 percent

 (1950-1951) during this sample period. Since the horizon of the expected

 inflation rate relevant for consols is very long, expected inflation

 proxies with such large weights on recent observations of inflation are

 likely to be dominated by measurement errors. Obtaining near-zero

 estimated coefficients on these measures of expected inflation then is not

 surprising. Nor is it compelling evidence that long nominal rates are

 immune to expected long-term inflation.

     The   other empirical studies of U.K. interest rates focus on short-term
 interest rates, where more reliable proxies for the inflation rate
                                                                    expected
over the relevan t term are usually thought to be obtainable. Demer
                                                                   y and
Duck (1978) and Foster (1979) use the Carison and Parkin (1975) sur
                                                                    vey-
based proxy for expected (6 month) inflation in short-term (3 month

nominal interest rate equations. Both articles obtain estimates of
                                                                   the
reaction of nomi nal interest rates to expected inflation that are

significant but considerably below one. Demery and D
                                                    uck's point estimates
of the long-run response of short—term rates average
                                                     about 0.65; Foster's
average less th an 0.50. The Carlson-Parkin data may
                                                     approximate market
expectations of inflation over the upcoming six mont hs with considerable

error (see Evans and Gulamani (1984)). Second, data
                                                    limitations prevent
matching the term to maturity of interest rates (3 months) to that of the

expected inflatio n rate proxy (6 months). Together, these factors may

produce downward bias in the expected inflation coefficient estimate that

is sizable. Even with a perfect expected inflation
                                                   measure, we would not
expect its coeffi cient to be unity in these specifications. Levi and Makin

(1978) demonstrate that the reaction of short-term interest rates to short-
                                    -4-


term expected inflation is likely to be smaller in the short—run than in

the long—run. Even if short real rates are impervious to inflation in the

long run, until that long run arrives, nominal short rates would not rise

one—for-one with expected inflation. Each of these articles also presents

evidence that demand pressure (as measured by job vacancies) raises rates

and that the liquidity effect associated with faster money growth reduces

real rates. Such reductions are due to the acceleration and not the level

of money growth. Since far—forward short—term interest rates are likely to

be much less (if at all) affected by current deviations of output from

equilibrium or by the acceleration of money growth, the effects of these

latter two forces on long—term real rates are likely to be attenuated.

     Symons (1983) foresakes the Carison—Parkin data in favor of a

forecasting equation for inflation. His ex-ante, or expected, real short

rate is constructed by subtracting forecasted inflation from the nominal

interest rate. Symons then tests only whether actual inflation affects his

expected real rates, not whether expected does. Given accelerations in

money growth, he finds that his expected real short rate is not affected by

actual inflation. To the extent that Symons' inflation forecasting

equation provides a proxy that more accurately captures movement in

expected inflation than does actual inflation (the presumption underlying

the construction of his expected real rate), however, we want to know the

response of expected real rates to expected inflation. Since he finds a

"substantial" difference between actual and his expected inflation measure,

these results tell us little about the response of expected real rates to

expected inflation.

      Here we examine the movements of long-term yields, which can be viewed

 as a weighted average of forward short rates. Since the dynamics alluded

to by Levi and Makin are likely to be more complete the longer the horizon,

the response of long—term yields to 1ong-term factors is likely to be

larger. Compared to estimates from s tatic specifications for short rates,

we expect to find larger coefficient estimates     for long-term phenomena and
smaller ones for transient phenomena   in equations that explain long-term
yields. Expected long-term inflation    is an example of the former;
accelerations of money growth and cycl ical   output movements are examples of
the latter.



II. A Model of Real Interest Rates
     The model in this section seeks to incorporate some of the major

measurable forces that drive long term interest rates. The implied reduced

forms for the other endogenous variables (real output and prices) m ay   less
adequately capture the dynamics and other important factors driving    those
variables. The aggregate demand side of the economy is composed of

expenditure (1) and portfolio balance (2) functions. The aggregate supply

side has been condensed into a price function (3). Equation (4) defines

the nominal interest rate as the real rate plus the (expected) inflation

rate. The presumed sign of the derivative of the left-hand-side variable

precedes each of the respective right-hand-side variables.

     (1) Q     = E(+X, —r, +MBP, -GMB, -RPOIL)

     (2) MBP = L(+Q, -i)

     (3) P      p(÷pe +Q, 4-RPOIL)

     (4)   i    r+p
                                           —6—




       The expenditure function specifies the demand for output (Q) as being

positively related   to exogenous demand (X) , negatively     related to the

expected real   interest rate (r), positively related to      the real monetary

base (MBP) through a      real balance effect, negatively rel at ed    to growth in

the nominal monetary      base (GMB), and negatively related to   the relative

price of petroleum       RPOIL).    This specification embodies t he liquidity

effect on interest rates of _______
                            changes in money growth rates.            Over the s ho r t

period   examined here    changes    in GMB approximate changes i n the money base
relative to its own      trend growth\rate. To the extent that    financial

markets clear faster     than the output market, it    is necessary to distinguish

between the longer-run expenditure function and its steeper short-run

counterpart. Inclusion of GMB capt ures this phenomenon by allowing the
longer run expenditure function to shift downward temporarily in response
to   an acceleration in base growth.       We have not included a government
deficit variable in the expenditure        function because of measurement

problems. Generating month—by-mont h       estimates of the expected, long—term,
weighted, natural real output, publ ic sector deficit, which may well

influence   long real rates, is probl ematic. Point estimates on such a           proxy

would almost certainly be so dominated by measurement error that little

would be gained by including one.

      The inclusion of the relative price of energy term allows for the

possibility that business expenditure falls in response to the reduced

profitability associated with higher real input costs (see Wilcox (1983)).

Crystal (1984) suggests another avenue for such real supply side forces to

affect   expendi ture on U.K. goods. A rise in the price of petroleum "caused
an appreciation of sterling and a rise in the relative price of British
                                           —7—




manufactured goods. As a result, British manufactured goods became

uncompetitive and production contracted sharply." (p. 37)
       Equation (2) posits that the demand for the monetary base in real

terms depends on real income and on the nominal interest rate (i). The

aggregate supply function (3) relates the price level to the expected price

level (pe) through nominal wages, to output, and to the relative price of

oil. Increases in real energy costs may lower real wages, increase costs

to firms, and lower equilibrium output; the net effect on real rates of

these changes is ambiguous. The quasi-reduced form for real interest rates

then   .4
       is:




       (5) r =   r(tp,   +X, tMBP, -GMB,    RPOIL)



III. Determinants of Real Rates

       The U.K. began issuing indexed bonds in 1981. Until March, 1982 only

pension funds were allowed to hold these real bonds. The first issue

carried an initial coupon of two percent and matures in 1996. Since this

maturity has the longest history, we use its yield as our measure of the

expected long-term real yield. Both coupon payiients and principal are

indexed, one-for—one, with the U.K. equivalent of the CPI, the retail price

index (RPI).5    To obtain   a measure of expected inflation embedded in the

prices of these assets, we subtract the real yield from the nominal yield

on U.K. government bonds maturing in 1997. The arithmetic spread between

nominal and real yields then consists of expected inflation and an

inflation risk premium. This measure of expected inflation may be biased

downward (or upward) by a positive (or negative) inflation risk premium.
                                              -8-


There may well be such a premium. As long as it is either constant or

uncorrelated over time wi th the other variables, however, its omissi on will

not bias our coefficient estimates. It ml ght be pres umed that, to the

extent there is an inflat ion risk premium, it is positive and rises with

maturity. For mat unties between 6 and 36 years, however, the nomin al-real

yield differential was vi rtually constant at 7 per cent in 1 ate 1984.                           If
expected inflation as of that date was the same fo r horizon s between 6 and

36 years, the term struct ure of the inflati on risk premium was also                          f 1 at.


This does not deny that the inflation risk           premi urn   may vary through time

(as opposed to across maturi ties at a given time).               A flat inflation              risk
premium term structure seems most likely to           suggest rel ati vely             small

inflation ris k premia. We t ake it to be zero in what follows.

        Figure 1 plots the norni   n al   (i), real (r), and (the den ved) expected

inflation (p) rate data over the 1 981:7 - 1984:5 sample pen od.6 Figure 1

points out the difficulty of using rnovenients in long nominal rates to glean

information abo ut     long real   rates.     The movements in the real yields are

small relative      to those of n orni nal   yields, generating an expe cted inflation

series which closely      mimics the nominal yields correlation                   =   Q99)•7 The

full-sample      correl ation between     the levels of i and    r   is not strong and is

negative    (—0.36).    On   average, a 100 basis point ri se        in I     i   S   associated
with a 6 basis poi nt decline in          r and, concomitanti y,     a 106 basis point

rise in p.8

        It is S ometimes argued that, over short pen ods, change s in nominal

rates   signal   changes in real rates, even though over 1           on ger       periods,     their
levels may be unrelated. This does not hold true for these                        long yields.
First differences in long nominal rates are associated largely and

consistently with fi rst differences in expected inflation (correlation

0.93) and move less reliably with first differences in real rates

(correlation =   0.54)   •     On average, a 100 basis point month-to—month change

in nominal yields consists of approximately an 80 basis point move in

expected inflation, while real yields move only 20 basis points.9 There is

a second barrier to using nominal rates as indicators of real rates. In

addition to the rel ation between the two series being loose, Figure 1 hints

that   it may also be    unstable. Before 1983, i fell 400 basis points while

real rates meandered.         After that, real rates rose fairly steadily while

nominal rates drifted
       The reduced form for nominal yields (5) suggests a role for exogenous

spending, X. As our proxy for this variable we use the index of leading

economic indicators      for    the U.K.      The series was detrended by dividing it

by an exponential trend with a 2 percent annual growth rate, which is

approximately the long        run real     output growth rate in the U.K. To remove

the noise in its month-to-month movements,              we used a t hree   month moving

average (based on the        current   an d   two previous months)   of   the detrended
series. This series i s referred            to as ILl. MBP is th e    seasonally adjusted

monetary base, deflate d by the 5 easonally adjusted RPI and by the 2 percent

trend growth variable. GMB                                        rate of the nominal,

seasonally—adjusted monetary base over the last three months.'°                 The supply
shock proxy, RPOIL, is the U. S. dollar price of Saudi crude oil, deflated

by the dollar/pound exchange rate and by the seasonally adjusted                RPI. The
resulting variable is        the real,     pound price of petroleum and has be en

similarly smoothed by        taking its     three   month moving average.     The   1   ast
regressor is D8230N, a        dumy   van    able which takes on the val ue    one   starting
in March 1982 and is zero otherwise.         This variable allows for the fact

that prior to that date only pension funds could hold indexed bonds.

     Our model posits six relevant exogenous variables. As a check on the

appropriateness of the assumption of their exogeneity we have conducted

bivariate Granger causality tests.         For each explanatory variable except

D8230N, we tested whether the first four lags of the dependent variable, r,

were significantly related to the current          value   of   each expl anatory
variable, given the presence of its        first   four lags and a constant term.

In no case were lagged real      yields j ointly significant. Thus each of these
variables satisfies at      least this mi nimal exogeneity criterion. We then

reversed the procedure, regressing r on its first four own lags, a

constant, and each of the fi rst four lags of the independent variables in

turn. The lags of ILl, GMB, and RPO IL each proved to be jointly

significant. MBP and p were insignificant.

     The results of estimatin g       truncated and complete versions of (5) are
presented in Table 1. Using       a maximum likelihood technique that allows        for

first-order autoregressive errors (AR1), row 1         shows the relation of real
yields to expected inflation and D8230N. Contrary to what is usually

reported in bivariate U.K. or U. S. short-term interest rate regressions,

long real rates are unaffected by expected inflation. As this market was

opened up to allow agents other than pension funds to hold indexed bonds,

we would expect    real   yields to fall and the coefficient on the associ at       ed

dumy variable     to   be negative.   The coefficient on D8230N is —0.344, but

insignificant.     As is often the case, this abbreviated specification

requires a very large estimated autocorrelation correction coefficient, P

(0.936).

      Rows 2 through 7 add various combinations of the remaining variables

                                          of which specification we look at,

 expected inflation never affects real yields by either an economically or

 statistically significant amount. Increases in the mdex of leading

 economic indicators (ILl) drive real rates up. Tighter overall monetary

 policy (lower MBP) raises rates as well but the liquidity effect (GMB)

 though perhaps important at short maturities, has no discernible impact on

these long real rates. The supply shock proxy, RPOIL, is consistently and

strongly negative. These estimates also                that     he opening up of the
market in

about 0ne- half     a percentage point (50 basis points).
     It   is     tempting to interpret the coefficients on    the constant as
estimat es of the steady-state, long-run real rate since the variables

(except p)       are entered as deviations from their respective means. Over    a

sample   per i   od this short, however, these variables may well have exceeded
or fal len b elow their steady-state values on
                                               average. If money had been
unsust ainab ly tight, for example, the coefficient on the constant would be

higher than the steady-state long-run real rate.
     As more complete versions of the model are estimated, the residual

autocorrelation coefficients and their significance levels drop noticeably.

Row 7 has been estimated with ordinary least squares (OLS) since the

complete specification (row 6) indicates an insignificant amount of

residual autocorrelation. This produces little change in the estimates.

Rows 8 and 9 omit the portion of the sample when indexed bonds could only

be held by pension funds. The estimates in these
                                      -12—


those in rows 6 and 7. This supports handling the March, 1982 change in

regulations with an intercept shift.



IV. Tax Effects

        Whether there are income tax rate effects on U.S. interest rates has

been a matter of dispute ever since the theoretical argument was put forth

by Darby (1975), Feldstein (1976), and Tanzi (1976). Table 2 presents the

results of testing for tax effects using non-nested specification tests

like those used by Peek (1982) in tests for tax effects on U.S. short-term

interest rates. We may interpret the specification of the model to this

point as being appropriate if either taxes are ignored or if the marginal

pound of investment income and expense is tax—free.

If that marginal pound faces a constant, proportional income tax rate, t,

the real after-tax interest rate, ra.t., is now determined by the model.



        (6) rat =    r(p,)

where Z is the vector of explanatory variables other than expected

inflation. The real after-tax return on indexed bonds is    r(1-t)   since only

real    capi tal gains are taxed in the U.K. Dividing through (6) by (1-t)
gives


        (7) r    =
                     r(11, y)

      The expected inflation measure used so far, however, is derived on the

assumption of no tax effects. The real after-tax yield on indexed bonds is

assumed equal to that on nominal bonds

      (8) r(1-t) =    i(1-t)   -
                                   p

This means that p can no longer be obtained by subtracting real from

nominal   yields. Equations 7 and 8 imply


      (9) p = (i-r)(1-t)
and



               =               z
      (10) r         r(i—r, i—i

where i-r is the original expected inflation measure. Note that expected

inflation is given by (9), but the after—tax specification (10) still uses

i—r, the original measure.

      The results of estimating the specifications adjusted for and

unadj uste d for taxes are listed in Table 2. The test statistics are

generated using the specification test procedure suggested by Davidson and

MacKinnon (1981).    The income tax rate series we use is taken from Buiter
                     12
and Miller (1983).        The tax—unadjusted (5) and tax-adjusted (10)

specifications are each estimated. The fitted values from each are then

added to the list of independent variables in the alternative specification

and the models are re-estimated. The test statistics presented are the

estimated coeffici ents and associated standard errors for the fitted

values. In row 1, the coefficient in the tax-unadjusted specifications of

the fitted values from the tax-adjusted model is 1.35 (t0.62). The
                                      -14-


estimated coeffi cient when the fitted value variable from the tax-

unadjusted model is added to the tax-adjusted model is -O.35(t= —0.16).

These test coeff icients sum almost precisely to unity. They need not be.

Nor need they lie between zero and one, though that might seem intuitive.

These results from row 1 weakly favor adjusting for    I n come   tax rate

effects. The tax—unadjusted models fitted values add nothing to the

alternative. The coefficients in both tests in row 1 simultaneously differ

insignificantly from zero and from one, however.

     Row 2 uses the same tax rate series but sets the pre—1982:3 rates

equal to zero, since only tax—exempt pension funds could hold index-linked

bonds then. This specification of the test favors the tax-un adj usted

model. Thus, this row provides equally weak support for this alternative

model. Row 3 drops the pre—1982:3 observations altogether. The results

again provide no strong Support for either model against the other. This

evidence is eminently inconclusive. Two reasons may be given. Over this

short span of time ordinary income tax rates varied very little and

unearned income tax rates were unchanged until mid-1984.      Second, t he

pattern of effective tax rates expected over the life of the bond, and not

the current realized tax rate, may be the relevant tax r ate. As ti me

passes, additional data may come to support one model relative to the

other.     Given the evidence summarized in table 2 and that the conclusions

differ immaterially, we use the tax-unadjusted specification I n what

follows.

V. Alternative Measures of Expected Inflation

       The measure of long term expected inflati on used in Figure 1, p. is

replotted in Figure 2 a long with two alternative proxies, the actua

inflation rat e over the last twelve months (p12) and that over the last

three months (p3). All three decline sharply from late 1 981 until           1 ate


1982 and have trendless movements thereafter. Not surpri singly act ual

shorter-term infl ation measures are more volatile than p.        Somewhat

surprisi ngly, these al ternative measures do move fairly ci osely with p; the

correlation b etween p and p12 is 0.94, the correl ation bet ween p and              is
                                                                               p3
0.72. These    correl ati ons may imply litt le about causation    however

Bivariate Granger tests (using four lags due to the brevity of the           s am ple)


do not reject the hypothesis that p is unrelated to p12 or to p              Nor can

the converse hypotheses be rejected. Nor would we necessarily expect a

tight relation between them.     Nevertheless, it will prove inter esti ng to

examine how t hese other measures perform in long-term interest rate

equations.

       Table 3 shows the effect of alternative expected inflation measures on

real   and nominal interest rate equation estimates. Row 1 uses p, the

difference between real and nominal yields, as the expected inflation

measure and therefore is identical to row 7 of Table 1.      Rows 2, 3, and 4

use as alternative expected inflation measures, p12, p3. and i, the nominal

interest rate. This last measure is included on the argument that nominal

rates predict inflation well. p12 and p3 are considered not because of a

prior belief that they predict long-term inflation well, but to examine the

sensitivity of the estimates to different expected inflation proxies.

Judgments about robustness to these differences in specification have to be

tempered by the limited period for which data are available.

     The alternative expected inflation proxies deliver real rate equation

estimates which are remarkably similar. The estimated expected inflation

coeffi cien ts are each virtually zero, ranging from -0.033 to 0.052. Only

for p3 is there a statistically signi ficant effect. Conclusions about

significan ce and even the size of the other variables effects are also all

but invari ant to the choice of proxy     This is surprising given the

rel atively large correl ation between p and r(-O.51) and between p and the

other explanatory variables (ILI(-0.62), MBP(0.46), GMB(—O.60), and

RPOIL(0.43)). Al so notable is t he fact that the model based on p3, which it

might be argued would be a poor proxy for long-term expected inflation,

fits best. Its standard error of 0.1427 is nearly 10 percent smaller than

that based on p •    Row 4 illustr ates that, though nominal interest rates may

be very highly correlated with expected inflation (correlation =    0.98),
other variables may still be si gnificantly related to real rate movements.

     Rows 5 through 7 use the n ominal interest rate as the dependent

variable. Row    5 reproduces row   l's coefficients (except 1 is added to the

p coefficient)      It appears her e to facilitate comparison with rows 6 and

7.   In rows 2 and 3 real rates appear virtually immune to p12 and p3.       At

the same time, nominal rates do not    react one—for-one to them; their
respective coefficients are 0.433 and 0.197. And no longer are the

estimated coefficients on the remaining variables robust to which proxy is

used. The entire pattern of significance (and sometimes sign) is reversed

when p12 and p3 are substituted for p. The overall fits also deteriorate
                                      —17-


dramatically, standard errors of the estimate (S.E.E.) rising by a factor

of three or four.

       Rows 1 through 4 suggest that we can assess the effects on real rates

of variables other than expected inflation by choosing any of the four

proxies used there or by omitting a proxy altogether since the coefficients

are very close to zero and generally insignificant. To do this, however,

requires a measure of r. Without a direct measure of r or p for this

maturity, we must effectively use i as the dependent variable. The

coefficients and significance of the variables other than expected

inflation are then extremely sensitive to the proxy chosen, as we see from

rows 5 through 7.    This is ironic. Given an indexed bond market, we would

not need to generate p to assess effects on real rates since they would be

directly observable. Real rate equations could be estimated directly.

Without an indexed market, however, we require the (unobtainable, implicit,

market) forecast of inflation to obtain accurate estimates of the real

interest rate equation. These last rows then indicate that assessing the

effects of any of these factors on long real rates may be extremely

problematic without an indexed market or some other way of generating a

long-term expected inflation proxy.



VI. Concluding Remarks

       Assessing the level, movement, and determinants of long-term real

interest rates has been difficult because of the lack of either direct

measures of the rates themselves or widely accepted proxies for long-term

inflation. The operation of the indexed government bond market in the U.K.

in   recent years provides a new source of information on both real rates and
                                     -18-


expected inflation. The evidence to date suggests that real rates are

unaffected by expected inflation but are affected by forecasts of demand,

by monetary policy, and by supply shocks. It also suggests that expected

long-term inflation may be quite volatile.

     The simultaneous operation of real and nominal long-term bond markets

also allows us to assess the robustness of conclusions about real rates

based on nominal interest rate equation estimates. More sophisticated

measures of expected long—term inflation than the alternatives used here

can probably be constructed. Section V, however, suggests that conclusions

about expected, long-term real rates may prove extremely sensitive to the

choice of expected inflation proxy. Though the correlation between p and

p12 is quite high (0.94), for example, the conclusions based on these

proxies are drastically different.

1.   For simplicity, unless otherwise noted, interest rates refer to long—
     term, expected real interest rates. The same shorthand applies to
     inflation. Cargill and Meyer (1980) point out the advantages and
     difficulties of matching interest rate and expected inflation
     maturities.

2.   By 1984, about one-third of the flow of new central government debt
     issued was indexed and about ten percent of the outstanding stock was
     indexed.

3.   Barclays Bank apparently took this quote from the Bank of England. It
     does not cite the source. This change in policy seems the natural
     result of focussing more on monetary aggregate growth rates and less
     on market yields.

     p in (3) refers to the price level expected a short time into the
     future. A true reduced form would have solved the actual price level
     out of MBP and RPOIL, replacing it with pe I do not think the
     results are materially affected. Since no measure of pe is available,
     the alternative is to use a constructed pe series.  I feel that the
     formulation based on actual P serves as well as any based on
     constructed pe is likely to. The movements in the other components of
     MBP and RPOIL dilute the impact of this measurement error to some
     extent.

5.   The indexing is not completely neutral, however. Coupon and principal
     are indexed to the RPI eight months earlier. There is a two month RPI
     reporting lag. Secondly, there is a perceived need to ascertain
     accrued interest between semi—annual coupon payments for day-to-day
     trading purposes. The eight-month lag is, therefore, due to the need
     to determine accrued interest." (Rutterford (1983)).

6.   We restrict the sample period to a July, 1981 starting date to allow
     the market to become established.

7.   Later we compare this expected inflation measure with actual inflation
     over this same period.

8.   Regressing r on i (and a constant) gives a coefficient estimate of -
     0.06   (t =   —2.19).
9.   Regressing first differences of r on those of i (with no constant
     term) gives a coefficient estimate of —0.18 (t = -3.23).

10. Other variants of this liquidity effect proxy, like the growth rates
     of either the real monetary base or real Ml over three or twelve
     months or the growth rate of nominal Ml over the past six months
     relative to its growth rate over the last three years, produced
     similar results. The specification in the text produced a somewhat
     better overall fit.
11. The sample mean of each of these explanatory variables (except for p)
    has been subtracted.

12. For the 1981 observations the rate is 0.310. For 1982, it is 0.324.
     For 1983, it is 0.332. We use the same value for 1984 as for 1983.
     This rate is the marginal direct tax rate of a married couple.
