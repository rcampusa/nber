                                             ABSTRACT

Pablo Picasso was by far the greatest artist of the 20th century: textbooks of art history contain more

than twice as many illustrations of his work as of that of his closest rival, Henri Matisse. A survey

of textbooks also identifies Jackson Pollock as the greatest American artist, by a narrow margin over

Andy Warhol. The 15 greatest artists of the century include nine conceptual innovators, who made

their greatest contributions early in their lives, in their 20s and 30s, and six experimental innovators,

who generally did their greatest work in their 40s and 50s - and even, in the case of Mondrian, in his

70s. Contrary to the belief of many humanists, the textbooks show that in art, as in all intellectual

activities, importance is determined by innovation.

Introduction

                Perhaps the importance that we must attach to the achievement of
                an artist or a group of artists may properly be measured by the
                answer to the following question: Have they so wrought that it will
                be impossible henceforth, for those who follow, ever again to act
                as if they had not existed?
                                                 Walter Sickert, 19101

        Important artists are innovators: they are important because they change the way their

successors work. The more widespread, and the more profound, the changes due to the work of

any artist, the greater is the importance of that artist.

        Recognizing the source of artistic importance points to a method of measuring it. Surveys

of art history are narratives of the contributions of individual artists. These narratives describe

and explain the changes that have occurred over time in artists’ practices. It follows that the

importance of an artist can be measured by the attention devoted to his work in these narratives.

The most important artists, whose contributions fundamentally change the course of their

discipline, cannot be omitted from any such narrative, and their innovations must be analyzed at

length; less important artists can either be included or excluded, depending on the length of the

specific narrative treatment and the tastes of the author, and if they are included their

contributions can be treated more summarily. The judgments of different authors can of course

differ. Surveying a large number of narratives can reduce the impact of idiosyncratic opinions,

and serves to reveal the general consensus of expert opinion as to the relative importance of the

artists considered.

        Today, well into the first decade of a new century, it is possible to survey a large

collection of narratives of the art of the past century, and to see which artists emerge most
                                                   4

prominently from these accounts. One result of this survey is a ranking of the greatest artists of

the twentieth century.

The Ranking

               Lists seem trivial, but in fact they are crucial symptomatic indices
               of underlying struggles over taste, evaluation and the construction
               of a canon... [T]here is a complex genealogy of influence and
               indebtedness which is left for critics and historians to unearth.
                                                Peter Wollen, 20022

       The artists selected for this study are those whose major contributions were made entirely

in the twentieth century and who were found to be the most important artists at particular times

and places by a series of earlier surveys of art history textbooks. Specifically, 15 different artists

were found to have an average of at least two illustrations per textbook in a series of nine

previous studies of artistic importance.3 These artists are listed in Table 1.

       For the present study a new data set was created by recording all illustrations of the work

of these 15 artists in 33 textbooks of art history.4 All of these books surveyed the history of art in

the 20th century, and all were published in 1990 or later.

       Table 2 ranks the 15 artists by using the total number of illustrations of each artist’s work

that appeared in the 33 textbooks. A number of important facts emerge from this ranking.

       Perhaps the most striking feature of Table 2 is the dominant position of Picasso.

Remarkably, the textbooks surveyed contain an average of 12 illustrations of his work, more than

twice as many as the average for his rival and friend, Matisse. Table 2 clearly demonstrates that it

would be difficult to overstate the importance of Picasso for 20th-century art.

       More generally, Table 2 also points to the privileged position given to artistic

developments in France. The top five artists are all Europeans, and all spent some if not all of
                                                   5

their careers in Paris. Pollock ranks sixth, making him the most important American artist of the

century. He is joined in the top 10 by Warhol and Johns. Thus New York is given a prominent

role, second to that of Paris.

        Table 2 provides the basis for a brief overview of the specific roles of the most important

artists of the 20th century, and this will be the subject of the following section of this paper. The

data set constructed for this study can be used to provide a more precise focus for that overview,

by pointing to when each of the artists made his major contribution. Thus Table 3 shows the five-

year period in each artist’s career that accounts for the most textbook illustrations. Arranging

these periods in chronological order provides quite a precise outline for a consideration of the

sequence in which the greatest artistic innovations of the 20th century occurred.

Revolutionary Minds

                Every consequential contribution to l’art moderne has been made
                by revolutionary minds.
                                             Robert Motherwell5

        Fauvism was the first significant art movement of the 20th century. Matisse was its leader,

and Table 3 shows that his most important period began in 1905, when he and several friends,

including André Derain and Maurice Vlaminck, first presented their new work, at the Salon

d’Automne. At that exhibition the critic Louis Vauxcelles’ facetious remark gave the group the

name of fauves, or wild beasts.6 Fauvism followed the lead of Gauguin and van Gogh in

liberating the use of color, but it was more extreme in its anti-naturalistic use of pure bright

colors: in Matisse’s words, it was based on the realization “that one could work with expressive

colors that are not necessarily descriptive colors.”7 This would later directly influence the Blue

Rider movement and many other expressionist artists.
                                                   6

       Fauvism was a conceptual innovation, based not on visual perception but on an idea.

André Gide immediately understood this, as he responded to the widespread claim that Fauvism

was irrational by observing that in fact just the opposite was true: “Everything can be deduced,

explained... Yes, this painting is reasonable, or rather it is itself reasoning.”8 Matisse was a

protean conceptual artist, who went on to make a number of other contributions in his long

career. In his famous “Notes of a Painter” in 1908, he explained that his artistic goal was not to

imitate nature, but to express his reaction to it: “I am unable to distinguish between the feeling I

have about life and my way of translating it.”9

       Fauvism was short-lived, and it was soon overshadowed by a very different movement,

that was concerned with form rather than color. Cubism was the most important innovation in the

visual arts of the 20th century, its preeminence witnessed not only by the dominant position of

Picasso in Table 2, but also by Braque’s fifth-place ranking in that table. Cubism is often

considered to have been announced by Picasso’s large painting, Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, of

1907, which would become the most important work of art of the 20th century.10 In 1909 Picasso

and Braque joined forces, and from then until the outbreak of World War I the two worked, in

Braque’s words, “rather like two mountaineers roped together.”11

       Cubism revolutionized the representation of forms. Since the Renaissance, the most

prevalent approach to form in Western painting had been one-point perspective, which provided

a systematic method for recording what the eye sees. Cubism replaced this with a principle that

allowed the artist to represent not just what he could see from a single vantage point, but what he

knew of his subject as a result of having seen it from many different positions. As John Golding

observed, “The Cubism of Picasso and Braque was to be essentially conceptual. Even in the
                                                   7

initial stages of the movement, when the painters relied to a large extent on visual models, their

paintings are not so much records of the sensory appearance of their subjects, as expressions in

pictorial terms of their idea or knowledge of them.”12

        In less than a decade the young artists Picasso and Braque, joined in progress by the even

younger Juan Gris, successfully established “for the first time in Western art the principle that a

work of art... need not be restricted to the phenomenal appearance of the object for which it

stands.”13 This became the most fundamental watershed for the art of the modern era, not only in

painting but in all the visual arts. In recognition of the impact of this principle on the art of the

20th century, Golding called Cubism “the most complete and radical artistic revolution since the

Renaissance.”14 The leader in the development of Cubism was the greatest artist of the 20th

century, the young genius David Sylvester described as “the quintessential finder.”15

        In 1910, Picasso and Braque took Cubism to the brink of abstraction, but both then

stopped short of making a completely non-representational art. By 1915, however, a number of

other artists had created non-objective forms of painting. The three greatest pioneers of

abstraction were Mondrian, Malevich, and Kandinsky, all of whom rank in the top ten in Table 2.

        Mondrian, Malevich, and Kandinsky all believed that art could have redemptive value,

and that it could contribute to the creation of better societies, but the specific forms of their art

differed greatly. And not only did the three make distinctively different versions of abstraction,

but they arrived at it in very different ways. Mondrian sought harmony and rhythm in the

relations among colors and lines, and he worked experimentally, constantly changing his

paintings as a result of visual inspection. He stressed that his paintings were “created consciously

but not calculatingly.”16 Kandinsky also proceeded by trial and error, explaining that as he works
                                                  8

“the painter always ‘hears’ a ‘voice’ that simply tells him, ‘That’s right!’ or ‘That’s wrong!’ If

the voice becomes very faint, the artist must put his brushes down and wait.”17 In contrast,

Malevich’s paintings systematically recorded forms that were meticulously planned with

mathematical calculations and measurements in order to express his ideas, for his art was

intended to communicate his ideas. Thus he declared that “The important thing in art is signs

flowing from the creative brain.”18 The difference between the cautious approach to abstraction

of the experimentalists Mondrian and Kandinsky and the precipitous arrival of the conceptual

Malevich was apparent to John Golding, who observed that “It might be fair to say that

Malevich’s abstraction sprang, Athena-like, ready formed from the brow of its creator; this

distinguishes Malevich’s approach very sharply from that of both Mondrian and Kandinsky, who

had sensed and inched their way into abstraction over a period of many years.”19

        Marcel Duchamp was a central influence on the anti-art Dada movement that began

during World War I, and in 1934 André Breton, the founder and leading spirit of Surrealism,

declared that Duchamp had been “at the very forefront of all the ‘modern’ movements which

have succeeded each other during the last twenty-five years.”20 Yet by nature Duchamp was a

maverick, who avoided formal labels and alliances, and consistently stood apart from the normal

practices of artists. He made very few works of art, and never presented his work at a commercial

gallery. But as his position in third place in Table 2 suggests, Duchamp’s influence was

enormous. This was a result not only of the works of art he made, but also for the ironic and

detached persona he created, which became a new model of the artist’s image for many

conceptual artists later in the century.

        Duchamp’s avowed goal was to change the course of modern art. Thus in 1946 he
                                                    9

explained that “until the last hundred years all painting had been... at the service of the mind.

This characteristic was lost little by little during the last century.”21 To return art to its conceptual

role, Duchamp produced works that undermined a series of central conventions of Western art.

Perhaps none did this more violently than his invention of the “readymade,” manufactured

objects he purchased and signed, which at one stroke eliminated the distinction between art and

reality, and challenged the sanctity of the touch of the artist. This innovation was so radical and

subversive that its full impact was delayed for decades after its introduction in 1912, but with the

wholesale departure of Johns, Rauschenberg and others from the traditional methods and

materials of art from the mid-1950s on, Duchamp came to be recognized by many as “the most

influential artist of the second half of the twentieth century.”22

        Brancusi was the greatest sculptor of the 20th century. His distinctive contribution was to

bring abstraction to sculpture. He did this visually, for the source of his inspiration was always

real, and his forms always originated in human or other natural shapes. Unlike most of his

contemporaries, Brancusi did not have plaster models translated to marble by technicians, but

worked directly in the stone. He furthermore did this without sketches or other plans, for his

approach became a philosophy as well as a method: “all those works are conceived directly in the

material and made by me from beginning to end, and... the work is hard and long and goes on

forever.”23

        Brancusi’s experimental approach meant that the completion of an individual sculpture

was not a resolution, but only one step in the sequential development of a theme. This process

was often gradual and protracted, as for example he made versions of The Kiss over an elapsed

span of 35 years. His forms generally became progressively simpler and more abstract over time
                                                  10

as he searched for what he called “the essence of things.”24 David Sylvester remarked that

Brancusi was “an extreme instance of the seeker, with his indefatigable exploration of a few

themes, eschewing duplication to create variations involving the subtlest of differences.”25 Henry

Moore explained Brancusi’s role in modern sculpture: “Since the Gothic, European sculpture had

become overgrown with moss, weeds - all sorts of surface excrescences which completely

concealed shape. It has been Brancusi’s special mission to get rid of this overgrowth, and to

make us more shape-conscious. To do this he has had to concentrate on very simple direct

shapes.”26

        Pollock, de Kooning, and Rothko were the most prominent members of the Abstract

Expressionists, a large group of New York painters who came to be recognized as the most

important advanced artists to emerge after World War II. The group was unified not by a style

but by an interest in drawing on the subconscious to produce images, and in doing so by working

directly on the canvas by trial and error, without plans or preconceptions. Pollock’s signature drip

method of applying paint, with its inevitable splashing and puddling that could not be completely

controlled by the artist, became the most famous emblem of this search for the unknown image,

as Pollock explained that “I have no fears about making changes, destroying the image, etc.,

because the painting has a life of its own. I try to let it come through.”27 De Kooning also worked

without a specific goal: “I find sometimes a terrific picture... but I couldn’t set out to do that.”28

Rothko stressed the absence of preconceived images more dramatically: “The picture must be for

[the artist] ... a revelation, an unexpected and unprecedented resolution.”29 The Abstract

Expressionists’ incremental approach caused their art to develop slowly, and Thomas Hess’

description of the evolution of de Kooning’s mature style, as “a continuous process - a gradual,
                                                  11

logical, steady development, marked by hundreds of insights, but no blinding revelation,” applies

equally to the other members of the group.30 The Abstract Expressionists created the most

important artistic movement based on experimental innovation since Impressionism, and in the

process shifted the center of the advanced art world for the first time from Paris to New York.

       Johns and Rauschenberg, who worked together during their key innovative periods in the

late 1950s, reacted against the attitudes and methods of the Abstract Expressionists, and initiated

an era of conceptual art that has persisted to the present. Like Duchamp before them the two

young artists wanted to depersonalize and demystify art. Thus Johns believed that “looking at a

painting should not require a special kind of focus like going to church. A picture ought to be

looked at the same way you look at a radiator.” To this end Johns selected familiar subjects, and

presented them in a way that effectively predetermined each painting’s appearance. Thus he

explained that he painted the American flag “because I didn’t have to design it. So I went on to

similar things like the targets - things the mind already knows.”31 Rauschenberg’s invention of

the “combine,” in which he attached real things to his canvases, was intended to make his

paintings independent objects rather than illusionistic representations of them: “I don’t want a

picture to look like something it isn’t. I want it to look like something it is. And I think a picture

is more like the real world when it’s made out of the real world.”32

       Johns’ deadpan portrayal of two-dimensional motifs, and Rauschenberg’s use of found

objects, powerfully revived Duchamp’s earlier efforts to eliminate the traditional barriers

between art and everyday life. And like Duchamp, their highly conceptual approach raised the

possibility of irony that had been altogether absent from the almost spiritual quests of the

Abstract Expressionists. Their work opened the door to a series of movements that have made art
                                                 12

that has differed radically in form and appearance, but that have all been characterized by the use

of common images and objects and the real or ostensible rejection of the vision of the artist as a

privileged maker of hallowed relics.

       Warhol and Oldenburg were central figures in Pop Art, which exploded on the advanced

art world in 1962. Pop was a conceptual movement based on the preconceived representation of

commercial images and objects. As John Coplans pointed out, Warhol’s celebrated paintings of

1962, including the hand-painted images of Campbell’s soup cans and the silk-screened canvases

of Marilyn Monroe, introduced two influential formal innovations: “First, the actual against the

simulated use of an anonymous and mechanical technique, and second, the use of serial forms.”33

In another conceptual practice that subsequently became standard procedure for many leading

artists including Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst, Warhol planned works which he then had

fabricated by others. He explained that “Paintings are too hard. The things I want to show are

mechanical.”34 Although Warhol took advantage of his celebrity to promote his work, he

consistently claimed not to believe in the mystique of the artist: “Why do people think artists are

special? It’s just another job.”35 In 1962 Oldenburg made his first soft sculptures, which

originated as props for Happenings. These oversized canvas representations of hamburgers, ice-

cream cones, and other common objects challenged “the traditional concept of sculpture because

they were soft rather than hard, as one expects sculpture to be.”36 In language that probably

pleased the aged Marcel Duchamp, in 1961 Oldenburg declared that he was “for an art... that

does something other than sit on its ass in a museum.”37

Young Geniuses and Old Masters

                       At the age of ten, twenty, a hundred, very young, a little
                                                   13

                older, and very old, an artist is always an artist.
                        Isn’t he better at some times, some moments, than at
                others? Never impeccable, since he is a living, human being?
                                                 Paul Gauguin, 190338

        The data set constructed for this paper can be used to examine the creative life cycles of

the artists considered by this study. Table 3 shows that the nine artists categorized as conceptual

innovators all had their best five-year periods during their 20s and 30s, whereas five of the six

experimental artists had their best five-year periods during their 40s and 50s. Even more

narrowly, Table 4 presents the ages of the 15 artists in the single year from which their work

received the most illustrations. The ages of the nine conceptual artists in their single best years

range from 25 for Johns to 37 for Malevich, all below the ages for the six experimental artists,

which range from 38 for Pollock to 71 for Mondrian. The median age of 33 for the conceptual

artists in their best years is fully 16 years below the median age of 49 for the experimental artists.

        Table 5 presents the percentage distributions of all of each artist’s illustrations over their

entire careers. The differences between the conceptual and experimental artists are again clear.

For eight of the nine conceptual artists - all except Matisse - more than half of their total

illustrations represent work they did before the age of 40; for five of them, more than 80% of

their illustrations are of work done before that age. In contrast, for five of the six experimental

artists - all except Pollock - less than one third of their total illustrations are of work they did

before 40, and for four of them this share is less than 20%.

        Conceptual innovators tend to make their greatest contributions early in their careers,

when they are least constrained by fixed habits of thought and least accustomed to following the

existing conventions of their disciplines. In contrast, experimental innovators generally improve
                                                  14

with age, with the deepening of their understanding of their craft and their increasing knowledge

of the subjects they are trying to represent. The greatest artists of the 20th century clearly follow

these contrasting life cycles. The conceptual painters Braque, Johns, and Picasso made their

greatest contributions in their 20s, while their conceptual peers Duchamp, Malevich, Matisse,

Oldenburg, Rauschenberg, and Warhol made their major contributions in their 30s. Of the

experimentalists, Pollock made his greatest contribution in his late 30s, while Brancusi,

Kandinsky, de Kooning, and Mondrian made theirs in their 40s, and Rothko did his greatest

work in his 50s. The art of the 20th century was thus developed by both young geniuses and old

masters.

Conclusion

               Today movements are just that; they have no time to stagnate
               before they are replaced.
                                                          Lucy Lippard, 196739

       The twentieth century was a time of fundamental change in advanced art, as artists

embraced radically new methods and materials. This study has used scholarly narratives of

modern art to identify the most important innovators of the past century. Picasso dominates these

narratives, but other artists also made key contributions in Europe early in the century, and in

New York later, as the center of advanced art changed continents.

       As the analysis of this study has shown, the greatest artistic innovators of the century

made their discoveries in very different ways. Some, including Picasso, Matisse, and Duchamp,

made sudden breakthroughs based on the formulation of new ideas. Others, including Mondrian,

Kandinsky, and Pollock, made more gradual progress dictated by visual criteria. As in earlier

centuries, the tension between conceptual and experimental innovation played a major role in the
                                                  15

transformation of fine art.

       The process of change continued to dominate fine art in the final decades of the 20th

century, and in fact accelerated over time. The enormous demand for innovation was a key

element in making conceptual approaches to art the dominant feature of the art world in the late

20th century. The extremely rapid pace of change created by a succession of conceptual

movements in fact may account for the absence from this study of any artist who came to

prominence after the early 1960s. There is no doubt that Robert Smithson, Bruce Nauman, Jeff

Koons, Damien Hirst and other artists who worked in the late 20th century have made important

contributions that have changed the practices of their peers. Yet the rapidity of change in this era

has limited the extent of their influence relative to that of their predecessors. A central reason for

this is the nature of the conceptual changes that have occurred in art over the course of the 20th

century, for many of them have served to create new genres that have become independent

specialties for many artists. The resulting fragmentation of art in the new era of pluralism

restricts the proportion of the art world’s territory that any single innovation can reach. Until

some future innovator reverses this process by creating an art form that restores greater unity to

the visual arts, Picasso and the other great artists of the early and mid-20th century may be the

last in a line of giants each of whom, since the Renaissance, has for a time dominated the entire

world of advanced art.
