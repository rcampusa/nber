            Modeling Deviations from Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)



                                   ABSTRACT




     The volatility of the exchange rate under floating rates can be

interpreted in terms of approaches that allow for short term price rigidity as

well as in terms of models that consider the magnification effect of new

information. This paper combines the two approaches into a unified framework,

where the degree to which prices are rigid is determined endogenously. It is

shown that the variance of percentage deviations from ppp has an upper bound,

and that the relationship between the variance of deviations from ppp and the

aggregate variability is not inonotonic. Allowing for a short—run Phillips

curve with optimal indexation, it is also demonstrated that a higher price

flexibility will reduce deviations from ppp and output volatility.

I. Introduction

     Recent experience with floating exchange rates has renewed interest in

the doctrine of purchasing power parity (referred to as ppp henceforth). This

doctrine hypothesizes that adjustment of the exchange rate should follow

national inflation differentials closely if the law of one price is to

hold.' To the degree that ppp holds, it provides a link between goods prices

in different countries which, together with interest rate parity, enables us

to understand the behavior of floating exchange rates by means of elegant

modeling. Recently, however, a growing number of studies have provided ample

evidence of deviations from ppp..2 These findings cast doubt on the ability of

models that rely on the doctrine of ppp to provide a satisfactory explanation

for the behavior of exchange rates. As a partial solution, recent studies

have added extra shock, which describes deviations from ppp generated by a

random process. The purpose of this paper is to model deviations from ppp in

a way that is more satisfactory and is consistent with the asset approach to

exchange rate determination , as well as with sluggish adjustment in the goods

market.

     There are two different interpretations for deviations from ppp: first,

as deviations from the law of one price; next, as an index number problem. In

other words, even if the law of one price holds for each good, the difference

in consumption basket across countries implies that changes in relative prices

will result in deviations from ppp. Clearly, the first interpretation causes

more headaches in explaining the international transmission. This paper will

concentrate on this interpretation and, in order to simplify, will assume a

one—good world. Hence ppp and the law of one price are synonyms.

     In a recent paper Flood (1981) demonstrated that the volatility of the

exchange rate can be interpreted in terms of models that allow for short term



                                     —1-—
price rigidity (Dornbusch (1976)) as well as in terms of models that consider

the magnification effect of new information (Frenkel (1976) and Mussa

(1976)). This paper combines the two approaches into a unified framework,

where the degree to which prices are rigid is determined endogenously. The

benefit of such an approach is in deriving the dependence of the variance of

deviations from ppp on the underlying structure of the economy. It is shown

that the variance of percentage deviations from ppp has an upper bound, and

that the relationship between the variance of deviation from ppp and the

aggregate variability is not necessarily monotonic. These results seem to be

applicable for deviations from parity conditions between any two related

markets and not only for the problem of ppp. The analysis also demonstrates

that deviations from ppp and volatility of exchange rates are closely related

phenomena. They are explained by combining the two alternative approaches

analyzed by Flood; thus, both approaches should be viewed as complementary and

as reinforcing each other. Allowing for a short—run Phillips curve, it is

also demonstrated that with optimal indexation a higher price flexibilty will

reduce output volatility.

    A study by Mussa (1981) suggests that the frequency of price adjustment

should be related negatively to the cost of price changes. Comparing the

price behavior of assets traded in a well organized market to the price

behavior of goods, it is safe to claim that the cost of price adjustment for

the former is lower than for the latter. The exchange rate functions

simultaneously as the price of an asset (foreign currency) and as a component

of the price of traded goods. The two prices are different because the

behavior of the spot exchange rate resembles that of assets prices, whereas

the behavior of the price.of traded goods resembles that of goods prices. To

capture this situation, let us model it in a discrete time framework where



                                     —2—
first we compare two polar cases. One is the situation where goods' prices

are fully flexible; the other is where goods' prices are pre—set due to overly

high transaction costs of last—minute goods price revisions.

     The next step is to modify the framework, recognizing that there is

limited price flexibility, which depends on the cost benefit of potential

goods arbitrage.3 This enables us to derive the more general case, where the

nature of the deviations from ppp is closely related to the cost structure.

Solving this case provides us with a measure of the variance of deviations

from ppp, which in turn enables us to find boundary estimates for deviations

from ppp, and to derive comparative statics results that seem to be in

agreement with observed empirical regularities.

     Section II describes the solution for the two polar cases of full price

flexibility and pre—set prices. Section LII generalizes the framework for the

case of limited price flexibility due to transaction costs. Section IV adds

the possibility of a short—run Phillips curve as a means of analyzing the

effects of deviations from ppp on output fluctuations. Section V summarizes

the findings. The appendix describes the solution for a specialized

stochastic system.



II. Flexible versus Pre—Set Prices

     The suggested treatment of deviations from ppp that is described in

Section III can be applied to a variety of different models that use some

version of ppp. To demonstrate, let us consider one possible approach to

modeling exchange rates, by analyzing how the suggested methodology for

treating deviations from ppp modifies the results. It should be kept in mind,

however, that the suggested treatment is not specificto the approach

considered subsequently.



                                     —3—
     Consider the case of a small, open economy under perfect capital

mobility, in a world of one traded good. Suppose that the money market

equilibrium is given in a log—linear form:



        —
            Pt
                  —
                      a(i +   E e+i — et)                        (1)




where m is the money supply at time t; t the price of the traded good; Yt

real output; e the spot exchange rate at time t (the domestic price of

foreign currency); and i the foreign interest rate. All variables, except

      are expressed in logarithms, and Et is the conditional expectation

operator, based on time t's information. Equation 1 embodies the interest

rate parity condition, assuming the absence of a risk premium.

     This paper focuses on the nature of the dependence of current prices

on the exchange rate (et). One polar case occurs when the price of the traded

good is pre—set before period t. This occurs when last—minute price revision

are extremely costly. In such a case ppp does not hold —— an outcome which

corresponds to the situation where transaction costs   of goods arbitrage and

price adjustment are high enough to prevent potential goods inflow (or outflow)

that will equalize goods' prices within period t. To describe this

possibility, suppose that the price Pt is set at the end of period t — 1 at

its expected p.p.p. level, i.e.




     Pt Ei(e + p)                                                (2)




For this case, eq. 1 can be simplified:




                                      —4—
        B =         Ei     —
                               ctE
                                     e+1 + cte                                   (3)




where B =                      —         —
                     m +

        Let      us assume that the current information set includes knowledge of the

value of all current shocks, as well as of the structure of the model.

Because the exchange rate is flexible, It adjusts so as to ensure money market

equilibrium. Forward iteration provides us with the rational expectations

solution for e



    =
            1-I-a   ko Et Bt+k( +cz + —               [--- kOt Bt+k — Es_i    Bt+k)( I-u


        If ppp holds within each period, goods prices are flexible within each

                                             This
period, and Pt =
                           e+      p .              happens when transaction costs in the goods

market are negligible, which is the other polar case. Let us denote the

exchange rate and the good's price corresponding to this case by e and Pt.

Consequently, (see Mussa 1976):

                                                                *      *
        —
             =        1                       ___    k         _________
        e           1+c    kO. E Bt+k( 1a —                         1÷a


        Under flexible prices, et is a weighted average of expected Bt+k, minus a

term corresponding to the unexpected change in foreign prices at time t. In

the case of pre—set prices, e is equal to a weighted average of expected

Bt+k, adjusted by              times the innovation in this weighted average. Notice

that for both cases the expected value of the future exchange rate is the

same:




                                                         —5—
                                                                          (6)
                 Ee+i

   With the help of eq. 4 and 5 we get




     e =        +
                     _![    + p —   E_i(e +                               (5')




    The expression in the bracket corresponds to the good's price adjustment

to unexpected shocks in a flexible prices regime. When prices are pre—set,

they cannot adjust to unexpected shocks. As a result, the interest rate (and

the spot exchange rate) absorb the needed adjustment by depreciation of

       —
           Eti   Pt] above          .     Thus, good's price adjustment is substituted
for interest rate adjustment at a rate of —i-

     Equation       5 can also be presented as:



        —
            E_1e
                       =     — E_1e ÷            — EtiPt]                  (7)




    The effect of pre—set prices is to magnify the unexpected depreciation by

a factor of   —i--   the   unexpected price adjustment under a flexible prices

regime. Let us define by O the percentage deviation from ppp under a pre—set

prices regime. From eq. 7 we get:



        =
            e    + p — Pt = (1      +—--)     [ — Etit]                    (8)




    The effect of pre—set prices is to substitute price adjustment under a

flexible prices regime with a deviation from ppp due to exchange rate

adjustment, at a rate of 1 +            —--




                                                —6--
III. The case of limited price flexibility

       The two polar cases analyzed in Section II correspond to the limiting

case. In general, good arbitrage and price adjustment will occur if their

benefits exceed the costs. To model this case, suppose that the real

transaction costs associated with price adjustment (per unit of output) are

given by C. C is a measure of the degree of goodst prices flexibility. The

lower C is, the greater the degree of price flexibility, and C = o corresponds

to the fully flexible prices case. We presume that the cost of making a price

change (which is taken to be of the lump sum variety) must be balanced against

the benefit of potential          goods arbitrage      (which is taken to depend on

the extent of deviations from ppp).

Prices are then given by


                 E —
                  tit t
                             *
                       (e + p )     if     16 t   <C
                                                                       (9)

                                           let1
                                                  )C
                        Pt


       The good's price is pre—set at the end of period t—1 at its expected

level. If In period t the deviation from ppp that results from this pricing

rule is below the threshold limit C, the price stays at its pre—set level.

If, however, it exceeds the threshold C, the price differential is enough to

compensate for the transaction cost, and arbitrage of the good will occur. To

simplify, it is assumed that in this situation the arbitrage is forceful

enough to equate the good's price with the international price, such that ppp

holds. In the first case the price at time t corresponds to the pre—set

condition; in the second to the flexible condition. In the first case the

exchange rate at period t is e ; in the second it is

If At denotes deviation from ppp for the case analyzed in this section, we

get:

        Suppose that 6 follows normal distribution, O N(0, a82) .                                 (See

Appendix A for an analysis of possible determinants of 0's distribution).

Thus,            follows a truncated normal distribution. To study its nature, let

                                                                          —p---

standard normal cumulative distribution and density function. Let us denote

by V the variance of x. Solving for V we get that7



    V = V6.            11(Z), where 11(Z)                 1 —   2(—Z) —   2•Z'(Z)              (11)




        The variance of deviations from ppp corresponds to portion 11(Z) of V0

11(Z) has a simple interpretation as the shaded area in Figure I. The variance

of deviations from ppp under pre—set prices, V0 , can be interpreted as a

measure of relative price pressure, or as a possible measure of the

variability of the various shocks affecting the economy (See Appendix A for a

description of possible components of V0 ).

        An alternative formulation for V0 is

             =   c2.   H(Z)/Z2                                                                 (12)

from which we derive that




        sign           =       sign   (11(z) — Z2(—                                            (1.3)

        Higher variability of relative pressure has two opposing effects: First,

it increases the probability of potential profitable arbitrage (101>0) ,                                 which
tends to reduce deviations from ppp. Second, it increases the variability of



                                                                —8—
 0, including its variability when arbitrage does not occur. In terms of

eq. 11, the first effect reduces ti(Z), the second increases V0 .                     To gain

further insight, let us analyze eq. 13. z2.(— —--) has a simple interpreta—

tion as the area of triangle ABC                 in   Figure 1. Thus, the sign of          depends
                                                                                      0
on the difference between the shaded area and the triangle area in Figure 1.

It is negative for small Z (like Z1                   in   Figure 2) and positive for large enough

Z       (like   Z2 in Figure 2). By means of a numerical solution, we find that for

    Z      1.36                0 , and that
                       0

                                                                                    (14)
                   < 0                 > C/L36


           Starting from low relative variability (a0                0) , an increase in        will

increase deviations from ppp. Further increase in a will further increase

deviations from ppp until a reaches its upper limit. This occurs

when a0 =         CI1.36   .    Above this point any further increase in a will reduce

deviations from ppp. This is because an increase in a0 shifts the probability

weight to the tails of the distribution. Thus, when deviations from ppp are

large enough, they will induce forceful arbitrage, which tends to reduce the

actual deviations. As can be seen from eq. 12, the upper boundary for the

standard deviation from ppp is a :



                = c•                  = C•O.46                 (where 0.46 =           ) (15)
                       Max J)

and it is attained for a = C•0.735

           The effect of lower C is to reduce deviations from ppp (for a given a0 ,

because it will increase the region where potential deviations from ppp induce

arbitrage. In terms of Figure 1, it shifts                         towards the origin reducing

H(Z). This is in agreement with the economic insight that deviations from the

law of one price should be smaller in a well organized market, because in.

those   markets C is lower. Polar examples for this might be the market for

foreign exchange, where C is small, versus the market for non—traded goods,

where C is large enough to nullify the law of one price.



IV.     ppp and Output Fluctuations
      The analysis has so far neglected the possibility of a short—run Phillips

curve. In this section the previous analysis of deviations from ppp is

integrated with a discussion of a frictional labor market, where unanticipated

shocks result in an output response based on contracting elements. The

analysis considers how deviations from ppp affect output variability. This is

done by adding to the money market equilibrium condition (eq. 1) an aggregate

supply function, which is a modified version of models used by Flood and

Marion (1982) and Marston (1982). These authors consider the case of an

economy where nominal wage contracts are negotiated in period t—1, before

current prices are known, so as to equate expected labor demand to expected

labor supply. But actual employment in period t is demand—determined, and

depends on the realized real wage. These models also allow for partial

indexation, which may be set according to some optimizing criteria, and assume

built in asymmetry, where wages might be pre—set but goods' prices are

flexible. The new aspect of the subsequent analysis is in allowing for a

symmetric framework, where prices can exhibit short—run rigidity. The degree

of this rigidity is endogenously determined, and is manifested in the

deviations from ppp.

        The model can be summarized by:

       Eq. 16       is the familiar money market equilibrium (eq.1). Eq. 17 describes

the short—run Phillips curve where v is a white noise supply shock. It can

be justified in the following way.8 Suppose that the labor supply is given by




       l = S(w          —                                                (18)

where           is a supply shock, and l the labor employed. The money wage in

period t       is   given by



       w = Et_l w + b(p —                Eti                             (20)




                        is the contract wage, which is equal to the expected money wage

in a fully flexible regime (it is also equal to the wage that clears the labor

market in the absence of uncertainty). Actual wage (we) is allowed to adjust

in proportion b to the cost of living increase (b is the degree of wage

indexation).

     Despite the fact that deviations from ppp do not affect the value of

optimal wage indexation, they enter the loss function, affecting output

volatility (relative to its desired level).                                En terms of eq. 30, deviations

from ppp enter the loss function via their effect on price volatility

(V1 ).       A more inflexible goods price structure (dC > 0) will reduce price

volatility ( because                   )   0   ).          The effect of lower price volatility on

output volatility is, however, tricky to assess. For an arbitrary choice of

wage indexation, it is indeterminate. Assuming, however, optimal wage

indexation (in terms of our loss function) lower price volatility turns out to

be undesirable. This is because the optimal wage indexation (b) takes

advantage of the negative correlation between supply shocks and goods prices,

by means of incomplete indexation. The extent of the beneficial effect of



                                                               —15—
 optimal indexation depends, however, on the internal flexibility of prices.

 Lower goods price flexibility reduces the importance of the above beneficial

 effect, implying a larger loss function (          > 0) and larger deviations

 from ppp. Notice that the causality runs in this case from a more inflexible

 price structure to higher deviations from ppp and a higher output variabili].ty

 (relative to desired output); and this argument is conditional on the optimal

setting of the degree of wage indexation. Thus, this analysis suggests that the

desirability of less volatile domestic prices (d C > 0) depends on the

efficiency of the wage indexation scheme.



V. Concluding Remarks and Implications:

     The model analyzed in this paper integrates deviations from ppp with an

analysis of the determinants of the exchange rate, providing the links between

the two. It suggests a number of testable implications that seem to be in.

agreement with recent empirical studies.

     Deviations from ppp are closely related to the total variability in the

economy by the structure of transaction costs in the goods market. •For a

given economy there is an upper boundary for deviations from ppp (as measured

by the variance of percentage deviation from ppp). This implies that the link

between variability in the economy and deviations from ppp differs between two

types of economy. For rather stable economies, increases in the
                                                                  variability
of the shocks that affect them tend to increase deviations from ppp. For

highly unstable economies, increases in the variability tend to reduce devia-

tions from ppp. For example, starting from a stable period (in relative

terms) like the fifties and sixties, increases in variability due to oil

shocks and changes in regimes to floating rates will increase deviations from

ppp.12 To the degree that higher inflation rates al come with more variable



                                     —16—
rates,13 an increase in the inflation rate results in higher deviations from

ppp. At some stage, however, higher inflation comes with lower deviations

from ppp. This suggests that in periods of hyperinflation, the ppp doctrine

might hold better than in periods of moderate inflation.'4 The doctrine of

ppp should also hold better between neighboring countries, and between

countries with larger potential trade, because of the lower transaction cost

of trade in goods between such countries.

     The above discussion was conducted for a simplified model, but its

results have broader implications. Most of the discussion in the open macro

economy literature is conducted for models where some version of the law of

one price holds. This is correct even in models where domestic and foreign

goods are imperfect substitutes, as long as the price of each class of goods

in different locations is tied by the law of one price. The general question

is to what degree the results obtained by those models for the optimal values

of various endogenous behavioral parameters are robust to modification of the

law of one price. The above discussion demonstrates that deviations from ppp

and limited price flexibility can be added to the models in a way that leaves

the value of optimal parameters intact, affecting only the volatility of

various variables. It is also shown that the desirability of price

flexibility depends on the efficiency of the wage indexation scheme. With

optimal indexation a higher price flexibility will reduce output volatility.

     A natural exterttion of the above analysis is to consider a multi—goods

world with multi—periods overlapping contracts. The addition of these aspects

should add continuity to the process of generating deviations from ppp, making

the bound    conditions for the variance of deviations from. ppp dependent on

the contracting technology and some average of the transaction costs of

different goods.

       Notice that unstable growth of the money supply (high V ) might be a

major component in explaining deviations from ppp, which is the essence of the

magnification effect.

                                           Appendix B

       The purpose of this appendix is to add transportation costs to the

analysis of deviations from ppp under limited price flexibility. In such a

case, there are two costs to be considered in the price adjustment rule (eq.

9—10): the lump—sum type of cost of price adjustment (C) and transportation

costs, taken to be C per unit. The existence of transportation costs

differentiates domestic and foreign markets. Consider, for example, the case

where Pt < p + e ( Pt are prices in the pre—set regime). Because of the
existence of transportation costs (C) , the potential gains from goods

arbitrage (export in this case) are measured by (       p÷e—   ) — Pt
Prices will adjust only if this expression exceeds the lump—sum cost of price

changes (C). Thus, if Pt < e + p we get

                          *

(Bi)       =
               0

               C    if (p + e —       )—   p>C
(where0.p+e_p)
       Notice that price adjustment will not generate ppp because of the

existence of transportation costs. Using the same argument we find that if



                               *

that whenever the lump—sum cost element is significant relative to

transortation costs, the dependence of V on V8 will not be inonotonic.

3.    By good arbitrage we refer to those forces that tend to equate the
      goods' prices with international prices, like potential trade
      pressure. Those forces can be manifested in price adjustment and (or)
      In actual trade.

4.    Those costs might include information costs and costs of price changes.

5.    For convergence we assume that the relevant transversality condition
      holds. A related version of the two cases analyzed in this section can
      be found in Mussa. (1976, 1982).

6.    McCallum (1977)    uses a similar pricing rule in the context of a
      closed economy. In general, we expect to observe more continuity in the
      arbitrage process, resulting from having a spectrum of goods with
      different transaction costs (C), and from the fact that the volume of
      potential arbitrage in each good might correspond in a more continuous
      manner to price differential (upper sloping arbitrage schedule). The
      benefit of the simplifying assumption used in this paper is in providing
      a tractable solution for deviations from ppp. Appendix B considers how
      the analysis is affected if we add the possibility of transportation
      costs. We find that whenever the lump—sum cost element is significant
      the results of Section III are unchanged.
 7.   To derive eq. 11 we use the fact that
                             2              __1 z               2               2

      (1976) and Fischer (1977).

9.    This is also the loss function used by Flood and Marion (1982).

10.   We are using the fact that if x2 is a normal variable, and x1 is a

      trancated normal variable E(x1 x2)
                                                             E(x1 E(x21x1)) = pE(x1)2

11.   Optimal indexation in a related framework is derived by Flood and Marion
      (1982).

12.   This phenomenon is analyzed in Frenkel (1982).

13.   For an analysis of this tendency see Logue and Wiilett.

14.   For evidence of a tendency for ppp to hold in hyperinflation see Frenkel
      (1976, 1982).

15.   Notice that within this framework fixed exchange rate is a consistent


      solution only if 6 =   0.   In such a case V0 =
                                                        V
      Under fixed rate we get lower V0 because instability in the money market
      is adjusted via the balance of payment mechanism instead of price
      adjustment. Thus, we expect to observe lower deviations from ppp under
      fixed rate (assuming o < CI1.36 ).
