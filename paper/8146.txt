1      Introduction
There are many industries where a potentially competitive segment requires the services provided
by natural‚Äìmonopoly bottlenecks, the so-called essential facilities.1 Regulating these facilities is
difficult in general, even more so for the weak regulatory institutions common in developing coun-
tries. Hence, some countries have turned to Demsetz auctions, where the facility is awarded to
the firm that bids the lowest user fee.2 Demsetz (1968) showed that this simultaneously achieves
ex post rent extraction and second-best efficient pricing.3 This paper shows, however, that if the
monopoly is allowed to integrate vertically, a Demsetz auction may be even worse than no regula-
tion at all on the bottleneck monopoly. In those circumstances, having a floor on the fee that can
be bid and prohibiting (open) vertical integration can raise welfare.
     The central tradeoff in this paper is that a minimum bid above average costs can foster compe-
tition and productive efficiency under asymmetric information, even though it distorts the down-
stream market. We can use this tradeoff to motivate the model and provide the main intuition
behind the results. Consider first the case of an unregulated bottleneck monopoly, which can
charge monopoly fees to downstream firms. As is well known (see Spengler (1950)), if the down-
stream market is competitive and in the absence of economies of scope, there are no incentives for
vertical integration, since the monopoly fee for the use of the essential facility extracts all rents
from the downstream market. At the other extreme, suppose that the essential facility is regulated
perfectly (in prices) so that it makes no rents ex post but is allowed to integrate downstream. If
quality of service is supervised imperfectly, the integrated firm has an incentive to exclude rivals
by worsening the service quality, thus effectively extending its monopoly power to the unregulated
downstream market.4 Assume there is uncertainty about the costs of operating in the downstream
market. Hence welfare is lower under vertical integration than under an unregulated essential facil-
ity, because the expected downstream costs of the integrated bottleneck monopoly are higher than
those of the downstream firms that survive in a competitive market.
     The standard policy recommendation against service quality discrimination is to ban the bottle-
neck monopoly from operating in the downstream market. The effectiveness of such prohibitions is
    1 Forexample, electric transmission and distribution are essential facilities for competitive power generators and
suppliers; so is the last mile in telecomms for competitive internet service providers or long distance carriers; and
seaports and airports for transportation companies.
   2 This is sometimes known as ‚Äúcompetition for the field‚Äù (instead of in the field) and goes back at least to Chadwick

(1859).
   3 See, however, Williamson (1985) for a critique.
   4 Lower quality may increase the costs of competitors (as, for example, in Economides (1998, 1999)) or reduce the

willingness to pay of users for their services.

suspect because they can be circumvented by an (illegal) underhand agreement with a downstream
firm. Observe, however, that such agreements introduce an additional source of inefficiency: since
there is asymmetric information on the cost parameters of the downstream partner, there is a posi-
tive probability of distorted production. Thus underhand agreements further reduce welfare.
     On the other hand, the standard incentive-compatibility constraints force the bottleneck monopoly
to share rents with its downstream affiliate with positive probability, thus reducing the attractive-
ness of underhand vertical integration. This implies that there is a wedge between expected profits
under underhand and open integration. This wedge can be exploited by setting a floor on user
fee bids, inducing the essential facility to operate with a competitive downstream market. The
distortions introduced by these fees are relatively small.
     Consider first a case where the regulator sets no floor. Since underhand agreements lead to rents
for the bottleneck monopoly, competition for the franchise drives fees to zero. If two firms tie their
bids at zero, the facility is awarded to the firm that offers to pay the highest sum to the government.
Since vertical separation yields ex post losses, monopolization through an underground agreement
is inevitable. By contrast, suppose that the floor lies above the average cost of the bottleneck. Then
a vertically separated essential facility will have rents. Moreover, usage of the facility could be
larger than with an underhand agreement because only low-cost companies survive in a competitive
market. If the rents received under vertical separation are high enough, the bottleneck monopoly
will prefer this option to an underhand agreement. Thus, while a floor above average costs distorts
the downstream market, it can foster competition and productive efficiency. This is the central
tradeoff we exploit in the paper.
     For expositional convenience, henceforth we will talk about ‚Äúseaports‚Äù when we mean essential
facilities and ‚Äúshipping companies‚Äù when we have in mind the downstream market.5 Nevertheless,
the results have obvious generalizations to other industries with similar structure. We assume that
vertical restrictions are in place so only underhand vertical integration is possible. We also assume
that the regulator sets a minimum cargo-handling fee for bids. The port franchise is auctioned to
the firm that offers the lowest bid.6
     We model the underhand vertical integration agreement using a standard hidden‚Äìinformation
model. The port is the uninformed principal, randomly matched with a shipping company, which
observes whether its constant average cost is high or low after closing the underhand agreement.
Another option for the port is to remain vertically separated, allowing shipping companies to com-

       Trujillo and Nombela (2000) for a description of port operations.
   6 If
     two or more firms offer the floor, the franchise is awarded to the one among them offering the largest up front
payment.

pete, so that only low cost shipping companies survive. Clearly, the volume of operations is higher
in this case, since first, there is competition rather than monopoly downstream and, second, only
low-cost shipping companies operate.
    Our main result is that with floors welfare is higher than under both unregulated and vertically
integrated monopolies. Moreover, the prohibition of vertical integration plays an important role
in ensuring this result, even when underhand integration is feasible. Under such an agreement,
the port is forced (by the incentive compatibility constraints) to share rents and distort production
decisions, making integration relatively less attractive. For this reason, under restrictions on inte-
gration the regulator can set a lower floor than when integration is allowed and still induce the port
to choose separation, which provides higher social welfare.
    We also show that the regulator must be careful when choosing the floor. If the floor to bids is
set too low, then monopolization through an underhand agreement becomes inevitable and welfare
is even lower than with an unregulated port monopoly. Because of this, there are compelling
reasons to argue that the regulator should be cautious and set the floor ‚Äútoo high‚Äù (i.e. higher than
the lowest cargo-handling fee that makes the port choose separation) rather than ‚Äútoo low.‚Äù
    Our paper is related to the literature of monopoly regulation via franchising which was pio-
neered by Chadwick (1859) and Demsetz (1968) (see also Stigler (1968), Posner (1972), Williamson
(1976), Riordan and Sappington (1987), Spulber (1989, chap. 9), Laffont and Tirole (1993, chap.
7 and 8), Harstad and Crew (1999) and Engel, Fischer, and Galetovic (1998). We contribute to
this literature by studying the interaction between the Demsetz auction and the downstream ex-
post market structure, allowing for the possibility of underhand vertical integration. We show that
departing from second-best pricing and leaving ex post rents in the pockets of the monopolist can
be welfare increasing when competition in the auction affects ex post market structure. Moreover,
ex post rents need not conflict with full ex ante rent extraction.
    Our paper is also related to Vickers (1995) who studied vertical integration by a monopoly
optimally regulated aÃÄ la Baron and Myerson (1982) into an industry with symmetric firms under
Cournot competition (see also Lee and Hamilton (1999)). We differ from Vickers in that in our
model the monopoly is regulated by a Demsetz auction. Moreover, firms are asymmetric in the
downstream market, which enables us to consider the selection role of competition. Finally, the
downstream market is competitive but can be monopolized by lowering quality to rival firms. We
thus study the effects of vertical integration on downstream market structure when quality degra-
dation is a problem, a problem studied by Economides (1998, 1999) in the case of an unregulated
monopoly that is vertically integrated with one of many downstream firms competing Cournot (see
also Salop and Scheffman (1987)). Finally, note also that Laffont and Tirole (2000, chap. 4) pro-


                                                 3
vide a complete analysis of regulation under the standard models of one-way access to an essential
facility.
    The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we describe the recent seaport auctions
in Chile. This case study motivates some of our assumptions and provides an application of the
model; we return to it on various occasions in later sections. In Section 3 we show that vertical sep-
aration and asymmetric information on costs force the port to share rents. In Section 4 we study the
relation between auction outcomes, downstream market structure and welfare. Section 5 discusses
several extensions of the basic model. Section 6 briefly summarizes the results of the Chilean port
auction. Finally, several appendices include the main proofs and formalizes extensions.


2      The Chilean seaport auctions7
Chile is a country isolated by deserts and mountain ranges from its neighbors. Hence the impor-
tance of sea-borne trade, which represents a large fraction of its GDP. The Chilean coastline, while
long, offers few sites at which important ports can be built without incurring in large sunk invest-
ments in breakwaters. Consequently, there are only three large ports for general cargo (as opposed
to bulk cargo).
    Traditionally, these ports had been state owned, but in 1981, in response to the inefficien-
cies of state management, the government allowed private firms to unload, store and customs
process cargo. Productivity improved substantially under the new regime. Nevertheless, by the
mid-nineties, the main Chilean ports had become congested and the government began to look for
alternatives to public funding of additional infrastructure. After consulting with experts, it con-
cluded that further productivity improvements could be achieved only if each individual port was
operated by a single firm, which would internalize the benefits of investing in large-scale special-
ized cranes, of improving the coordination of activities within each port and of investing in other
activities with important externalities.8 The expectation was that efficiency gains could at least
double the capacity of the ports without any further investments in basic infrastructure.
    To ensure that productivity improvements benefit users, the government designed a competitive
auction to award the ports to the firm bidding the lowest cargo handling fee. Nevertheless, regula-
tors feared that if shipping companies won the auction, they would monopolize the port by favoring
their own operations and lowering the service quality received by competitors. The advantages of
    7 SeeFoxley and Mardones (2000) for a description of the Chilean seaport auctions.
    8 Forexample, Mardones (1999, personal communication) argued that firms did not invest in their worker‚Äôs human
capital because they might be hired away by competitors within the port.



                                                        4
Demsetz auctions would be lost in the process. Even though the regulator sets minimum quality
standards, these are difficult to monitor and enforce under the Chilean regulatory and legal system.
Thus it is unlikely that quality standards would help avoid monopolization.
    This analysis led to restrictions on horizontal and vertical integration that were supposed to
prevent monopolization. First, the Antitrust Commission, at the request of the government, estab-
lished that no single firm could operate all three ports. Second, shipping companies could own
not more than 40% of a port operators‚Äô equity.9 In addition, the government fixed a floor for the
cargo handling fee. If two or more firms were to bid the floor fee in the auction, the port would be
awarded to the firm that offered the highest lump sum payment. 10
    The main Chilean shipping and stevedore companies challenged the restrictions to vertical and
horizontal integration in court. They argued that the restrictions would favor foreign operators; and,
moreover, that restrictions would be ineffective or unnecessary because a vertically-separated port
could easily replicate the integrated outcome by granting a monopoly to one shipping company in
exchange for underhand payments. In addition, they argued that two of the main ports (Valparaƒ±ÃÅso
and San Antonio) are less than 60 miles away, and they compete with each other, so there was no
danger from monopolization of a port. We will examine these arguments below.


3      Vertical separation and rent sharing
In this section we show that when there is hidden information about the costs of shipping compa-
nies, an underhand agreement forces the port to share rents with the shipping company even when
there are many potential shipping companies. Thus, prohibiting vertical integration imposes a cost
on the port. We start by describing the basic model and then solve the port‚Äôs optimization problem.
In the next section we study the auction of the port franchise.

    9 This restrictions applied to relevant shipping companies, that is, those that carry more than 25% of the cargo
transferred in the region during the previous year (regions are an administrative division of Chile). It is also worth
noting that this is a prospective rule, in the sense that it must hold during the life of the franchise. See Foxley and
Mardones (2000) for more details.
   10 The floor was fixed so as to cover the rental value of capital invested in the preexisting infrastructure of the port

(breakwaters, esplanades, etc). The argument of the regulator was that a lower fee would have prevented the entry
of new ports, since they would be unable to compete with franchised ports that need not cover returns on preexisting
infrastructure.

3.1 The model
The inverse demand for shipping and handling cargo is p = D(q), with D0 < 0, where q is the
total quantity of cargo handled and p is the price paid by users to shipping companies. We assume
that the price p covers all necessary arrangements with the port (see Table 1 for the notation used
throughout the paper)
    There is a continuum of shipping firms, each with constant average cost of transporting cargo
equal to s. A fraction Œª ‚àà (0, 1) of shipping companies has a low average cost of s` per unit of cargo
while the remaining shipping companies have a high average cost sh > s` . The port‚Äôs average cost
of handling a unit of cargo is constant and equal to c. Moreover, we assume that the port is able to
lower quality enough to price any shipping company out of the market.
    For future reference it is useful to distinguish four possible vertical structures:

Unregulated monopoly with vertical separation: The port is free to choose its fee but is not
     integrated into the shipping market. There is perfect competition among shipping companies
     and only low cost firms survive.

Regulated monopoly with vertical separation: In this case, the port charges the fee with which
     it won the auction. The downstream market works as in the previous case.

Vertical integration: The port is matched at random with a shipper, thus the probability of inte-
      grating with a low cost shipper is Œª. The port gets to know the shipper‚Äôs costs after starting
      operations and excluding other firms. The fee bid in the auction is irrelevant.

Underhand integration: The port establishes an underhand agreement with a randomly chosen
    shipping company and then discriminates against other shipping companies to exclude them
    from the market. The shipper learns its costs after starting operations and excluding other
    firms, while the port does not. Again, the fee bid in the auction is irrelevant.

   The key assumption above is that shippers are unaware of their own costs when they operate
as monopolies until after they begin operations. This is justified by noting that their previous
experience is on a much smaller scale.
   We now study the optimal underhand contract.


3.2 Underhand agreements
Suppose that vertical integration is prohibited but the port decides to establish an underhand agree-

variable that can be used in the underhand contract is the amount of cargo q that is handled through
the port. Since the shipping company belongs to one of two types, the port can offer a menu of
contracts
                                             Ai + ri qi ,

 i = `, h where Ai is a fixed amount and ri is a per-unit fee (refer to Table 1 for the notation used in
the paper). The revelation principle implies that the port will maximize its rent by using a direct,
incentive‚Äìcompatible mechanism such that (Ai , ri )i=`,h that maximize

(1)                          Œª[A` + (r` ‚àí c)q` ] + (1 ‚àí Œª)[Ah + (rh ‚àí c)qh ]

where D0i ‚â° D0 (qi ). The first pair of inequalities (2) represents the two standard participation
constraints. Since the agreement is illegal, there are no legally binding contracts and the port
must ensure the shipping company at least zero profits regardless of the shipping company‚Äôs cost.
The next pair of inequalities, (3) and (4), are standard incentive‚Äìcompatibility constraints. The
last equality (5) appears because the shipping company is free to choose a price that maximizes
monopoly profits given it faces costs si + ri .
    Solving this problem leads to the following result:

Proposition 1 Let (A‚àói , ri‚àó )i=`,h be the contract that solves (1)‚Äì(5); let (pi‚àó , q‚àói )i=`,h be the corre-
sponding quantities and prices chosen by the shipping company and Œ†(q‚àói ) the combined profits.
Moreover, let (AiŒπ , riŒπ )i=`,h be the contract that the port would impose if it knew the shipping com-
pany‚Äôs costs, (pŒπi , qŒπi )i=`,h the corresponding prices and quantities and Œ†(qŒπi ) the corresponding
combined profits. Then

   (b) p`‚àó = pŒπ` and p‚àóh > pŒπh ;
   (c) A‚àó` < Œ†(q‚àó` ) = Œ†(qŒπ` ) = AŒπ` and Ah‚àó + (rh‚àó ‚àí c)q‚àóh = Œ†(q‚àóh ) < Œ†(qŒπh ) = AŒπh .

Proof: See Appendix A.

                                                     8
    Note that the full-information contract (AŒπi , riŒπ )i=`,h replicates the outcome of a vertically inte-
grated port. Hence, Proposition 1 shows that the restriction on vertical integration reduces port
profits for two reasons. First, the port sets a per-unit charge of rh‚àó > c, which distorts (optimally)
the decisions of the high-cost shipper. Second, the port must transfer an informational rent to the
low-cost shipper. Since sh > s` and (p‚àóh ‚àí sh ‚àí rh‚àó )q‚àóh ‚àí A‚àóh = 0, the low-cost shipper makes a profit

                                          (ph‚àó ‚àí s` ‚àí rh‚àó )q‚àóh ‚àí A‚àóh = (sh ‚àí s` )q‚àóh > 0

by claiming that its cost is high. This sets a lower bound on the rent that the low-cost shipper
receives. We have that the port‚Äôs expected utility under vertical separation is

                                            Ei œÄ(A‚àói , ri‚àó ) = ŒªA‚àó` + (1 ‚àí Œª)Œ†(q‚àóh ),

where œÄ(A, r)are the port‚Äôs profits when establishing an underhand agreement which charges a
fixed fee A and a per-unit fee r. These profits are lower than the profits of a vertically integrated
port
                        Ei œÄ(AŒπi , riŒπ ) = Ei Œ†(qŒπi ) = ŒªŒ†(qŒπ` ) + (1 ‚àí Œª)Œ†(qhŒπ ),

since A`‚àó < Œ†(q`Œπ ) as shown in Proposition 1.
    For future reference it is useful to compute aggregate welfare with underhand and vertical
integration. Let W(q) be aggregate welfare when q units of cargo are handled, then

                                                                  ¬ï               ¬îZ     qh‚àó

                                0                                                    0

and                        ¬îZ                                   ¬ï               ¬îZ                                   ¬ï
                                 qŒπ`                                                   qŒπh
          Ei W(qiŒπ ) ‚â° Œª               D(q)dq ‚àí (c + s` )qŒπ`        + (1 ‚àí Œª)                D(q)dq ‚àí (c + sh )qŒπh       .
                             0                                                     0

Clearly Ei W(q‚àói ) < Ei W(qŒπi ) since q‚àóh < qŒπh . Moreover, if the cost of the shipping company is low,
aggregate welfare under vertical integration equals welfare under separation.


4     Auction design
In the previous section we showed that vertical separation reduces the attractiveness of monop-
olizing the shipping market. In this section we study the interaction between the restrictions on
vertical integration and the rules of the auction.


                                                                9
4.1 Timeline
The timing of the game is as follows:

   1. The regulator sets a floor w for the fee per unit of cargo.

   2. Each bidder i = 1, ..., n submits a bid (wi , Gi ) ‚àà IR2+ , where w is the per unit cargo handling
      fee and G is an up-front payment to the government.

   3. If min j w j > w, the port is awarded to the firm bidding min j w j . If min j w j ‚â§ w the port is
      awarded, among the firms that bid w or less, to the one that offers the largest G j .

   4. After the franchise is awarded the port chooses one of two strategies. Under the U (under-
      hand) strategy, it establishes a monopolization agreement with a shipping company chosen
      at random. Under the V (volume) strategy, it operates the port so as to maximize the volume
      of cargo, charging at most min j w j per unit.

   5. If the port decides to use the U strategy then:

         ‚Ä¢ The port offers the shipping company a take-it-or-leave-it underhand contract.
         ‚Ä¢ The port lowers service quality to rivals and the market is monopolized.
         ‚Ä¢ The shipping company learns its cost and the contract is implemented.

   6. If the port chooses the V strategy, there is free competition in the shipping market.

    Observe that competition for the franchise leads to rent dissipation. Nevertheless, different
cargo handling fees will affect demand and the structure of the shipping market.


4.2 Ex post market structure and welfare
As usual, it is convenient to solve the game by backwards induction. Assume that the outcome
of the auction is a cargo handling fee w. The port can choose one of two strategies: operate
for volume, V , or underhand integration, U . We begin by analyzing the port‚Äôs decision and the
ensuing market structure. Next we study aggregate welfare in each case.

                                Figure 1: Port profits and market structure

Market structure Consider first the profits of the port using the V strategy. Call pv the price
paid by users when the port follows strategy V . Since the shipping market is competitive and low-
cost shipping companies will drive high-cost shipping companies out of business, the price paid
by users will equal the cost of low-cost shipping companies plus the fee for using the port. Thus,
in equilibrium
(6)                                       p = s` + w ‚â° p v .

The total quantity of cargo handled will be qv ‚â° q(pv ) (where q(p) denotes the demand function,
i.e., D‚àí1 (p) in the notation of Section 3) and the port will make profits equal to

(7)                                      œÄv (w) ‚â° (w ‚àí c)q(s` + w).

     Figure 1 plots the profit function (7), which is continuous and strictly increasing in the relevant
range if the standard conditions that ensure strict quasiconcavity hold. œÄv (w) peaks at wm ‚â° pm ‚àí
s` , where pm = arg max (p ‚àí s` ‚àí c)q(p), the fee that would be set by an unregulated, vertically
separated port. As is well known, the port can exploit all its monopoly power by choosing w such
that w + s` = pm .


                                                      11
   Now, since œÄv (c) = 0, œÄv is increasing in the interval [c, pm ‚àís` ] and there exists w‚àó ‚àà (c, pm ‚àís` )
such that
                                        œÄv (w‚àó ) = Ei œÄ(A‚àói , ri‚àó ),

that is, w‚àó is such that profits from the volume and the underhand strategies are the same. There
also exists wŒπ ‚àà (c, pm
                      ` ‚àí s` ) such that


(8)                                        œÄv (wŒπ ) = Ei Œ†(qŒπi )

with w‚àó < wŒπ , since Ei œÄ(A‚àói , ri‚àó ) < Ei Œ†(qŒπi ) as shown in the previous section. Note also that
Ei Œ†(qiŒπ ) < Œ†Œ∑ (wm ) because the expected value considers the possibility of integration with a high
cost firm. The following results are now apparent from Figure 1:

Result 4.1 When w is close enough to pm ‚àí s` the port prefers volume operations.

Result 4.2 If w is sufficiently low, the port will monopolize the shipping market through an under-
hand agreement.

Result 4.3 Vertical separation makes volume operation relatively more attractive.

    Result 4.1 shows that a competitive shipping market (V ) is more attractive when the fee w
is high. To see the intuition, assume that w = pm ‚àí s` . In this case competition weeds out all
inefficient shipping companies and the port makes the same profits as an unregulated monopoly.
By contrast, if the port chooses to establish an underhand agreement, it must not only share rents
and distort production, but it may also pair up with an inefficient shipping company. This makes
an underhand agreement less attractive than operating for volume..
    If the cargo handling fee w falls, competition in the shipping market transfers more of the
efficiency gains to users via lower prices p, but this lowers profits for the port. There is a value of
the fee w‚àó such that monopolizing the shipping market becomes more attractive, despite the costs
of underhand agreements. Interestingly, underhand profits do not depend on w and remain constant
at Ei œÄ(A‚àói , ri‚àó ).
    Result 4.3 shows that restrictions on vertical integration enlarge the range of auction outcomes
w such that the port chooses the V strategy and a competitive shipping market results. The reason
is quite clear: an underhand integration, even when it cannot be penalized, is not a perfect substitute
for legal vertical integration.



                                                    12
Welfare Consider welfare as a function of w. If the port chooses the volume strategy, aggregate
welfare is                            Z v         q
                                  W (qv ) ‚â°           D(q)dq ‚àí (c + s` )qv ,
                                              0

i.e., total user surplus minus port and efficient firm shipping costs. Now dW(qv )/dw = [D(qv ) ‚àí
c ‚àí s` ]dqv /dw < 0 for w > c, since D(qv ) ‚â° w + s` > c + s` and dqv /dw < 0. On the other hand,
with underhand integration, welfare equals Ei W(qi‚àó ). The following proposition compares welfare
with competitive and monopolized shipping markets:

Proposition 2 W(qv ) > Ei W(qiŒπ ) > Ei W(q‚àói ) and W(qv ) ‚â• W(qŒπi ) ‚â• W(qi‚àó ) for i = `, h. Thus,
welfare is always higher when the port chooses a competitive shipping market.

Proof: Since dW(qv )/dw < 0 for w ‚àà [c, pm ‚àí s` ] and qv = qŒπ` when w = pm ‚àí s` , it follows that
                                                                                R qŒπ`
welfare with a competitive shipping market is at least equal to W(q`Œπ ) =        0      D(q)dq ‚àí (c + s` )q`Œπ
and generically higher. Now recall that

            Ei W(qiŒπ ) = ŒªW(qŒπ` ) + (1 ‚àí Œª)W(qhŒπ ) > Ei W(qi‚àó ) = ŒªW(qŒπ` ) + (1 ‚àí Œª)W(qh‚àó )

because qŒπ` > q‚àóh , from which the result follows.
    Proposition 2 implies that vertical and underhand integration reduce welfare. There are three
sources of inefficiency when the port chooses underhand integration. First, the standard allocative
inefficiency of monopoly, which is also present in an unregulated market (i.e., when the port freely
chooses w). Second, underhand integration leads to productive inefficiency, because a high-cost
shipping company may be chosen to monopolize the market. And third, the high cost firm faces
distorted fees in order to lower the cost of the incentive constraint on the low cost firms.
    Figure 2 depicts welfare as a function of the cargo handling fee given the (privately) optimal
decision of the port. As long as w ‚àà [w‚àó , pm ‚àí s` ] the port chooses a competitive shipping market
when vertical integration is illegal. Welfare increases as we move leftward and w falls; it reaches a
maximum when w = w‚àó . The intuition is simple. In that range a lower w leads to a lower shipping
fee p and users receive an increasing fraction of the benefits from an efficient shipping market.
When the cargo handling fee falls below w‚àó , the shipping market becomes a monopoly. Welfare
jumps down to Ei W(qi‚àó ) and becomes independent of w.
    Restrictions on vertical integration have two consequences which differ depending on w. First,
they enlarge the range of w‚Äôs for which the port chooses a competitive shipping market. Obviously,
in the interval [w‚àó , wŒπ ) they increase welfare. On the other hand, when the fee is too low, restrictions
do not prevent monopolization, so welfare is lower.

4.3 Auction rules, market structure and welfare
The previous sections have shown how the structure of the shipping market and the welfare impact
of the restrictions on vertical integration depend on the fee that wins the auction. In this section we
examine the auction for the port franchise.
    We begin by considering the case where there is no floor (i.e., w = 0). In this case, min j w j >
0 cannot be an equilibrium, for then it pays to set w slightly below min j w j and receive profits
which are at least Ei œÄ(A‚àói , ri‚àó ) > 0 if vertical integration is not allowed and Ei Œ†(qŒπi ) > 0 if it is.
Since neither Ei œÄ(Ai‚àó , ri‚àó ) nor Ei Œ†(qŒπi ) depend on the fee when w is low enough, competition drives
min j w j to zero. Moreover, since monopoly profits do not depend on w, max j G j < Ei œÄ(A‚àói , ri‚àó )
cannot be an equilibrium either. Hence, we have established the following result:

Result 4.4 (i) If w = 0 and vertical integration is prohibited then in equilibrium min j w j = 0
and max j G j = Ei œÄ(A‚àói , ri‚àó ); (ii) if w = 0 and vertical integration is allowed then in equilibrium
min j w j = 0 and max j G j = Ei Œ†(qŒπi ).

    Result 4.4 shows that in a precise sense competition for the franchise can be too intense. If
there is no floor (w = 0), competition brings w down to the range where monopolization becomes
attractive. When w ‚àà [0, w‚àó ), the auction leads to a fee of w and underhand agreements ensue.

                                                    14
Thus, the auction inevitably leads to a monopolized shipping market. While ex ante competition
for the franchise extracts all expected rents from bidders, Proposition 2 and Result 4.4 imply the
following somewhat surprising corollary, which is apparent from Figure 2:

Corollary 1 If w < w‚àó , then (i) welfare is lower than with an unregulated port and (ii) restrictions
on vertical integration reduce welfare.

    Simple inspection of Figures 1 and 2 shows that the regulator can do much better by setting a
floor w ‚â• w‚àó . Competition for the franchise will drive the cargo handling fee to w and the port will
choose a competitive shipping market. Any rents that the port may make will be competed away
through the lump sum payment G. These facts can be summarized in the following result:

Result 4.5 (i) If w ‚â• w‚àó and vertical integration is prohibited then in equilibrium min j w j = w and
max j G j = œÄv (w); (ii) if w ‚â• wŒπ and vertical integration is allowed then in equilibrium min j w j = w
and max j G j = Ei Œ†(qŒπi ).

    Thus, restrictions on vertical integration can be welfare enhancing when combined with a floor
w ‚â• w‚àó , since they allow the regulator to set a lower w than without the restrictions. Alternatively,
for a given w, restrictions on vertical integration make it less likely that the shipping market will
be monopolized. In any case, Result 4.4 suggests that if there is doubt about the true value of w‚àó ,
the regulator should err by setting a value of the floor w above w‚àó .
    A second implication of the preceding results, which is apparent from Figure 1, is that the
government obtains a higher lump sum payment if it sets a floor above w‚àó than when shipping
is monopolized through an underhand agreement. For higher floors to the bid there is a tradeoff
between revenue and welfare: a higher floor w yields more revenue in the auction but decreases
welfare. It follows that the revenue generated in the auction is not necessarily a good indicator of
welfare.


5    Extensions
In this section we discuss three extensions which generalize the rent-sharing-cum-inefficiency re-
sult on which our results are based. The underlying models are provided in the appendix.

Repetition In the real world, a port that establishes an underhand agreement with an inefficient
shipping company will eventually find out the shipping costs and will look for another partner.


                                                  15
However, there is no guarantee that the new shipping company will be efficient, so it is possible
that the port establishes consecutive agreements with several shipping companies before eventually
finding the right partner. We show in Appendix B that the solution to this multi-period problem is
to offer the same menu of underhand agreements as in the one-period game until the port finds a
low cost shipping company, at which point it establishes a long term agreement and extracts all the
surplus in each following period. Interestingly, there is no ratcheting in this case.
    If periods are short, i.e., it is easy to switch to another shipping company, underhand integration
becomes more attractive, since the port will find an efficient partner fairly quickly, so it will share
only a small fraction of total rents. Restrictions on vertical integration are less effective in this
case. By contrast, if replacing shipping companies takes a long time, the one period model is
a good approximation and restrictions to vertical integration are an effective means of having a
competitive shipping market.

Specific investments and shipping company‚Äôs opportunism While many port assets are sunk
and specific, ships are mobile. Since an underhand agreement is by definition an incomplete con-
tract, the shipping company may hold up the port. In Appendix C, where we abstract from asym-
metric information considerations, we consider a model in which the port undertakes sunk invest-
ments in equipment that can be used by any shipping company. It is shown that vertical separation
reduces rents obtained by the port because it leads to underinvestment, even when the port can
extract all ex ante rents by making the shipping companies compete to be selected. By contrast,
when the shipping market is competitive, a shipping company cannot hold up the port. Hence,
vertical separation reduces the relative attractiveness of monopolizing the shipping market.11

Oligopoly and collusion As mentioned in Section 2, Chilean shipping companies argued that
restrictions on vertical integration were irrelevant because ports would compete with each other.
This is doubtful, since ports are few in Chile and therefore collusive agreements are likely. It is
shown in Appendix D that vertical separation reduces the rents that ports can make from collusion.
That is, any combination of collusive prices that can be sustained with vertical separation can
also be sustained under vertical integration, and ports make higher profits in the second case. By
making monopolization relatively less attractive, restrictions on vertical integration increase the
likelihood that the port chooses the strategy of maximizing volume. The reason is that, as in our
previous model, vertical separation forces ports to give shipping companies some informational
rents.
  11 Of   course, the difference is larger when it is harder to replace the shipping company.


                                                            16
6       Epilogue
In several decisions, the Chilean appellate and supreme courts decided, partly on the basis of the
preceding reasoning, that the arguments of the port authority for restrictions on vertical integration
were reasonable, i.e., that the limits to vertical integration would make it less likely that the main
ports would be operated by monopoly shipping companies. After the delays caused by the injunc-
tions, the port authority was finally able to proceed with the auction of the main ports. There was
a satisfactory number of participants in the bidding process (14 for all ports), including domestic
and international firms. The domestic shipping lines participated in joint ventures with foreign
specialists in port management.
    In all three franchises the fees were attained.12 These were approximately 10% lower than
the rates under the private, multi-operator scheme. The three winning bids were offered by a
company which was 40% owned by the shipping company who had been the strongest opponent of
restrictions on vertical integration. However, by the rules of the bidding process, the port authority
awarded one of the ports (Valparaƒ±ÃÅso) to the runner up. In the end, the government received US$294
million for the three franchises, twice as much as expected (all participants offered an upfront
payment).
    Whether the government succeeded in preventing the monopolization of the shipping business
in Chile‚Äôs main ports remains an open question that will be answered by a future evaluation of
the franchises‚Äô performance. However, the analysis has shown that the restrictions on vertical
integration plus a minimum per-unit charge for port operations make it less likely that the winners
will operate as port monopolies.




    12 A fourth franchise for a less important bulk cargo port was also successful.However, in a second round of auctions
for smaller local ports, there was less interest: one was deserted (Arica), while the other had only one bidder (Iquique).

A      Proof of Proposition 1
Let L be the Lagrangian associated to problem (1), and Œ∑i , ¬µi and œài , i = `, h be the positive
multipliers associated with constraints (2), (3‚Äì4), (5), respectively.
   From the incentive-compatibility constraint (3) and the participation constraint (2) for the high
cost shipper it follows that

                              (p` ‚àí s` ‚àí r` )q` ‚àí A` ‚â• (ph ‚àí s` ‚àí rh )qh ‚àí Ah
                                                         > (ph ‚àí sh ‚àí rh )qh ‚àí Ah
                                                         ‚â• 0.

Hence, the participation constraint of the low-cost shipping company holds with slack and Œ∑` = 0.13
   Now, from the first order conditions for the Ai , it follows that

                                    ‚àÇL
(9)                                     = Œª ‚àí ¬µ` + ¬µh = 0,
                                    ‚àÇA`
                                    ‚àÇL
(10)                                    = (1 ‚àí Œª) ‚àí Œ∑h ‚àí ¬µh + ¬µ` = 0.
                                    ‚àÇAh

Solving for Œª in (9), then substituting into (10) and rearranging yields Œ∑h = 1. Hence the participa-
tion constraint of the high-cost shipping company binds‚Äîall rents are extracted from the high-cost
shipping company. Moreover, if ¬µ` = 0 we have ¬µh = ‚àíŒª < 0, a contradiction. Hence ¬µ` > 0 and
the incentive compatibility constraint for the low-cost firm is binding and the firm is indifferent
between behaving as a high- or low-cost firm.
    Since Œ∑h and ¬µ` are strictly positive, we have

(11)                                Ah = (ph ‚àí sh ‚àí rh )qh ,
(12)                                A` = (p` ‚àí s` ‚àí r` )q` ‚àí (sh ‚àí s` )qh ,

where (sh ‚àí s` )qh is the information rent appropriated by the low-cost shipping company.
  13 The  strict inequality in the derivation above assumes that qh > 0. As will become clear by the end of the proof,
                                                        Œª
this requires that the shipper‚Äôs optimal q for r = c + 1‚àíŒª (sh ‚àí s` ) be positive.




                                                         20
   From (11) it follows that (4) is equivalent to

                                           A` ‚â• (p` ‚àí sh ‚àí r` )q` ,

which by (12) is equivalent to
                                           (sh ‚àí s` )(qh ‚àí q` ) ‚â• 0

and therefore to q` ‚â• qh . In what follows we ignore this constraint, solve the port‚Äôs optimization
problem and then show that the resulting values of q` and qh satisfy the constraint (with strict
inequality).
   Using (11) and (12) to substitute for Ah and A` , we can rewrite problem 1 as

                  max {Œª[(p` ‚àí s` ‚àí c)q` ‚àí (sh ‚àí s` )qh ] + (1 ‚àí Œª)(ph ‚àí sh ‚àí c)qh }
                  (r` ,rh )


subject to
                                       (pi ‚àí si ‚àí ri ) + qi D0i = 0,

i = `, h. The first order conditions are

              ‚àÇL                               dq`      ‚àÇ
(13)              = Œª[(p` ‚àí s` ‚àí c) + q` D0` ]     + œà` [(p` ‚àí s` ‚àí r` ) + q` D`0 ] = 0
              ‚àÇr`                              dr`     ‚àÇr`
              ‚àÇL    ¬à                                                ¬â dqh
                  = (1 ‚àí Œª)[(ph ‚àí sh ‚àí c) + qh D0h ] ‚àí Œª(sh ‚àí s` )
              ‚àÇrh                                                      drh
                                     ‚àÇ
(14)                           +œàh      [(ph ‚àí sh ‚àí rh ) + qh D0h ] = 0.
                                    ‚àÇrh

    Given si , the shipping company‚Äôs first order condition defines qi as a function of ri which, by
the second order conditions, is strictly decreasing. It follows that we may differentiate with respect
to ri the first order condition to obtain:

                                      ‚àÇ ¬à                      ¬â
                                          pi ‚àí si ‚àí ri + D0i qi ‚â° 0.
                                     ‚àÇri

Now p` ‚àí s` ‚àí c = p` ‚àí s` ‚àí r` + (r` ‚àí c). Hence, one can rewrite (13) as

                                                         dq`
                                             Œª(r` ‚àí c)       =0
                                                         dr`

where, as mentioned above, dq` /dr` < 0. Therefore we have r`‚àó = c. Doing a similar substitution


                                                     21
for (14) we obtain that
                                                                             dqh
                                           [(1 ‚àí Œª)(rh ‚àí c) ‚àí Œª(sh ‚àí s` )]       =0
                                                                             drh
with dqh /drh < 0 Hence we have that

                                                             Œª
                                                rh‚àó = c +       (sh ‚àí s` ) > c.
                                                            1‚àíŒª

    It now is straightforward to see that q` > qh . Also, trivially, the full information contract that
the port would impose is such that the AŒπi ‚Äôs extract all rents and the riŒπ ‚Äôs equal marginal cost c. This
concludes the proof of part (a). Part (b) follows from part (a) and the fact that the qi ‚Äôs are decreasing
in the ri ‚Äôs and D0 < 0. Last, part (c) follows from the fact that the high-cost shipping company
pays a distorted fee per unit of cargo handled and the low-cost shipping company appropriates the
information rent.


B     Repetition
Consider the case in which the game is repeated each period, with a large number of periods. In
this case the port franchise can offer a contract to the shipping company with the explicit threat of
terminating the contract if it turns out to be a high cost firm. Note that if the firm is a high cost
firm, it behaves exactly as before, lasts one period and the port franchise chooses another firm from
the large number of potential firms. If it is a low cost firm, the port can pay the shipping company
enough to make it profitable to reveal its type and then extract all the rent, thus getting the integrated
port profits with a low cost shipping company, Œ†(q`Œπ ), each period (Besanko, 1985). Letting V be
the expected value of discounted profits, with discount factor Œ¥, we obtain the following Bellman
equation:
                                  (                                    )
                                                             ‚àû
     V=          max             Œª [A` + (r` ‚àí c)q` ] + Œ¥ ‚àë Œ¥t Œ†(qŒπ` ) + (1 ‚àí Œª) {[Ah + (rh ‚àí c)qh ] + Œ¥V }
             {A` ,Ah ,r` ,rh }                              t=0

subject to

                                      (p` ‚àí s` ‚àí r` )q` ‚àí A` ‚â• 0,
                                      (ph ‚àí sh ‚àí rh )qh ‚àí Ah ‚â• 0,
                                      (p` ‚àí s` ‚àí r` )q` ‚àí A` ‚â• (ph ‚àí s` ‚àí rh )qh ‚àí Ah ,
                                      (ph ‚àí sh ‚àí rh )qh ‚àí Ah ‚â• (p` ‚àí sh ‚àí r` )q` ‚àí A` ,

                                                                  22
                           (p` ‚àí s` ‚àí r` ) + q` D0` = 0,
                          (ph ‚àí sh ‚àí rh ) + ph D0h = 0.

    Note that the problem facing a shipping company is the same as before, since a low-cost ship-
ping company receives no rent after the first period and a high-cost shipping company is discarded.
There is no ratchet effect here because the high-cost shipping company is discarded in the sec-
ond period, which implies that the low-cost shipping company‚Äôs payoff after the second period
is zero regardless of what it declares in the first period. Hence, the shipping company faces the
same incentives and behaves exactly like in the one-period game. It follows that we can replace
the values obtained in the one-period game to obtain the modified Bellman equation. Recall that
A‚àó` = [D(q`‚àó ) ‚àí s` ‚àí c]q`‚àó ‚àí (sh ‚àí s` )q‚àó` ‚â° Œ†(q‚àó` ) ‚àí (sh ‚àí s` )q‚àó` are the profits made by the port when
contracting a low cost firm in the static game and Œ†(qh‚àó ) = [D(qh‚àó ) ‚àí s` ‚àí c]qh‚àó are the profits when
contracting with a high cost firm. Replacing in the value function we obtain that
                               ¬í                    ¬ì
                             Œ†(q‚àó` )
                        V =Œª         ‚àí (sh ‚àí s` )qh + (1 ‚àí Œª)[Œ†(q‚àóh ) + Œ¥V ]
                                                  ‚àó
                             1‚àíŒ¥

which leads to the expression for the value function:
                                  ¬ö ¬î                       ¬ï               ¬õ
                           1          Œ†(q`‚àó )
                  V=               Œª          ‚àí (sh ‚àí s` )qh + (1 ‚àí Œª)Œ†(qh ) .
                                                                         ‚àó
                     1 ‚àí (1 ‚àí Œª)Œ¥     1‚àíŒ¥

Note that as Œ¥ ‚Üí 1, there is no discount of the future, and the value function is dominated by the
profits of a low-cost shipping company. After a number of periods, the probability that the shipping
company is not an efficient firm is vanishingly small, and as waiting is not costly, the results are
dominated by the profits obtained from low cost firms. It is also interesting to note that even as
Œª ‚Üí 1, the port franchise cannot extract all profits from the low cost firm, which can always claim
being a high-cost firm.


C     Specific investments and shipping company‚Äôs opportunism
In this appendix we examine a different source of rent sharing and inefficiency, which arises from
specific investments and opportunism. Assume that, as before, the marginal cost of handling a unit
of cargo is constant, but it is a function of the amount invested by the port in site-specific assets.
Thus, marginal cost is a function c(I), with c0 > 0, c00 > 0, where I is the amount invested. To
simplify the analysis, we assume that there is symmetric information.

                                                    23
   Assume that the port invests I. Then ex-post total profits are

                                              Œ† = [p ‚àí s ‚àí c(I)]q.

Clearly, regardless of how Œ† is shared, it is optimal to set q equal to the monopoly quantity.
Moreover, since the contract is incomplete any ex ante sharing agreement is irrelevant. Thus we
assume that after bargaining ex post the port captures a fraction Œ± ‚àà (0, 1) of Œ†. Then it will invest
ex ante to
(15)                               max Œ±[D(q) ‚àí s ‚àí c(I)]q ‚àí I,
                                          I

Solving this problem leads to the following result:

Proposition 3 Let I ‚àó be the level of investment that maximizes (15) and œÄ(I ‚àó ) the corresponding
combined profits. Moreover, let I Œπ be the level of investment that would had been chosen by a
vertically integrated port and œÄ(I Œπ ) the corresponding combined profits. Then
    (a) I ‚àó < I Œπ ;
    (b) Œ†(I ‚àó ) < Œ†(I Œπ ).

Proof: Since q is chosen optimally for each I, the envelope theorem implies that the first order
condition of problem (15) is
                                                           1
                                      ‚àíc0 (I ‚àó )q(I ‚àó ) = .
                                                           Œ±
Now q and ‚àíc0 are decreasing in I (the optimal monopoly quantity increases when costs fall and
c00 > 0). Moreover
                                       ‚àíc0 (I Œπ )q(I Œπ ) = 1.

Hence, I ‚àó < I Œπ . Part (b) follows trivially by noting that I = I Œπ maximizes [D(q) ‚àí s ‚àí c(I)]q ‚àí I.
    Note that since the port has bargaining power ex ante, it will demand a payment from the
shipping company. This payment can be at most A‚àó = (1 ‚àíŒ±)[D(q‚àó )‚àís ‚àíc(I ‚àó )]q‚àó with q‚àó = q(I ‚àó ).
Thus, its expected utility is at most

              Œª {[D(q‚àó` ) ‚àí s` ‚àí c(I`‚àó )]q‚àó` ‚àí I`‚àó } + (1 ‚àí Œª) {[D(qh‚àó ) ‚àí sh ‚àí c(Ih‚àó )]qh‚àó ‚àí Ih‚àó }

This expected payoff is less than what the port would obtain if vertically integrated, viz.

              Œª {[D(qŒπ` ) ‚àí s` ‚àí c(I`Œπ )]qŒπ` ‚àí I`Œπ } + (1 ‚àí Œª) {[D(qhŒπ ) ‚àí sh ‚àí c(IhŒπ )]qŒπh ‚àí IhŒπ } .

    Thus underhand vertical integration is less attractive, which implies that competition becomes
relatively more attractive.


D      Oligopoly and collusion
In this appendix we show that collusion between two ports is made more difficult when shipping
companies are vertically separated. For simplicity we assume that there is no asymmetric infor-
mation between ports, that is, whatever is known by port 1 is also known by port 2 and viceversa.
Nevertheless, as in the text, ports do not know shipping company‚Äôs costs.14
    We first analyze the case when two vertically integrated ports collude and then study collusion
when ports are vertically separated, each closes an underhand agreement with a different shipping
company and shipping companies collude. In both cases we assume that colluded firms play a
trigger strategy where any deviation destroys collusion forever. Our strategy is to show that for
whatever combination of collusive prices that is sustainable, ports make higher profits when verti-
cally integrated. Thus, mandatory vertical separation makes operation for volume relatively more
attractive.


D.1 Vertically integrated ports
We assume that (symmetric) collusive prices are such that pŒπ` ‚â§ p` ‚â§ p`h ‚â§ ph ‚â§ pŒπh , where p` is
the collusive price when both shipping companies are low cost, p`h is the collusive price when
only one is low cost, and ph is the collusive price when both are high cost. Clearly, there is no
point in colluding at prices lower than pŒπ` or higher than pŒπ` , since both ports can increase profits
by increasing p when lower than pŒπ` or higher than pŒπh . Moreover, suppose that ph > p` . Then both
ports increase their profits by switching prices. Last, assume that p`h is less than p` or greater than
ph . Then both can increase their profits by increasing p when lower than p`Œπ or higher than pŒπ` .
     Under a trigger strategy ports will collude in each of the three cases if

                              1
                                 Œ∑(pk ‚àí si ‚àí c)D(pk ) ‚â• (pk ‚àí si ‚àí c)D(pk )

with k = `, `h, h and i = `, h; where Œ¥ ‚àà (0, 1) is the common discount factor and Œ∑ is the smallest
market share. Hence, collusion is sustainable if Œ∑ ‚â• 1‚àíŒ¥. A port‚Äôs expected profits under collusion
  14 Though we have not showed it, we believe the results would be reinforced if there were asymmetric information
between ports, as collusive agreements should become more difficult to supervise.

We are ready to compare these profits with those that can be made when ports are vertically sepa-
rated but establish underhand agreements with shipping companies.


D.2 Vertically separated ports
Suppose, again, that contingent on shipping companies‚Äô cost declaration collusive prices are given
by p` , ph and p`h , with pŒπ` ‚â§ p` ‚â§ p`h ‚â§ ph ‚â§ pŒπ` . Since we are comparing port profits with and
without vertical integration for each possible set of prices p` , ph and p`h , it suffices to show that
vertical separation forces ports to share part of the profits with shipping companies.
    Ports jointly choose (Ai , ri )i=`,h to maximize

where Œ∑ is the shipping company‚Äôs market share. The first six are standard participation and
incentive-compatibility constraints. The next four are the standard collusion conditions which
assume that cheating once destroys cooperation forever. Note that the contract must be chosen to
give enough incentives to each shipping company not to cheat; these are constraints (22) to (25).
    Now note that the argument in Proposition 1 carries through to show that the low cost-shipping
company can always make positive profits by claiming to be a high-cost shipping company. Hence,
just as in the monopoly port case, separation forces ports to share part of the rents with shipping
companies. Thus, vertical separation makes underhand agreements less attractive.
