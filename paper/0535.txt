     In this study, the authors examine three aspects of the Canadian experience

with flexible exchange rates in the 1970s: the movements in the Canadian dollar—

U.S. dollar exchange rate, the sharp growth of external borrowings by Canadians

in the 1974—76 period, and the real effects of relative price movements.

     Several theoretical and empirical exchange rate models are found to have

done poorly in explaining the movements of the value of the Canadian dollar

over the decade.

     In the examination of external borrowings in the mid—1970s, it is concluded

that there was some response in borrower and lender behaviour to movements in

nominal long—term interest rate differentials. Four sources of explanation for

such behaviour are examined.

     A three—sector model comprising non—tradable goods, resource—based tradable

goods and non resource—based tradable goods, is used to study the effects of

changes in raw material prices, domestic unit labour costs, and the exchange rate

on various real variables in the Canadian economy.

INTRODUCTION

      The Canadian economy during the 1970s provides a fascinating
study of how an economy responds to both real and nominal

shocksi under flexible exchange rates. Under the heading of
real shocks, one can categorize the sharp increase and almost as
sharpdecrease in the Canadian terms of trade and the divergence
of Canada's cyclical position vis—â--vis the United States. The
nominal shocks to the economy include the accelerating growth of
the money supply in the early 1970s which was followed by the
implementation in the latter half of 1975 of a policy of gradual

deceleration of monetary growth.
        As a result of both real and monetary movements, the exchange

rate became progressively more overvalued (in purchasing—power—

parity terms) over the mid—l970s, reaching a peak in the fourth

quarter of 1976. This was followed by a depreciation of about 20
percent over the next two years, bringing the real exchange rate
at the end of 1978 back to its 1971 level. The shifts in the
terms of trade and the real exchange rate resulted in movements in
real variables such as the relative outputs of different kinds of

goods,  income distribution and the real balance of trade. The
response of interest rates to inflation and to the resulting
anti—inflationary monetary policy was one of the factors leading
to the sharp increase in Canadian external borrowing in 1975 and

1.   Here, and throughout, the term "shock" is used in its
     conventional economic sense as a shift in an exogenous
     variable in the model under consideration.

1976, one of the most interesting episodes in the entire period.
     In this paper we examine in detail certain aspects of the
response of the Canadian economy to real and financial shocks over
the 1970s. In each case we compare what theory tells us to

expect with the actual outcome, using relatively simple regression
equations to help us evaluate whether the data are consistent with

the theory. Perhaps it should he noted that we are not attempting
to account for everything that occurred in the Canadian economy in

the 1970s2 but rather, we are trying to see whether we can

explain some of the more significant movements of the economy at
that time with the intention of shedding some light on the

operation of the flexible exchange rate system.
     One of the continuing themes in our investigation is that the
real world is very complex; a variety of shocks can occur at one

time, thereby making analysis of what is happening at any given
time difficult for the contemporary observer. Second, and
following from this point, the problem of interpreting the effects

of such shocks on the long—run value of the exchange rate has made
it very difficult to forecast the exchange rate. Both the
difficulty of interpreting shocks and the problem of forecasting

exchange rates increase the over—all range of uncertainty.
This can therefore result in behaviour that causes the adjustment

to both real and nominal shocks to be much slower than one might

have expected, with consequent real effects over the adjustment

period.


2.   To do this would require substantially larger and more
     complicated empirical models than those we have used.
                                3



     The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 1 we
sketch out very briefly the salient characteristics of the

Canadian economy in the 1970s on which we wish to focus. Section
2 discusses the variety of exchange rate equations that have been
developed to explain the movements of the Canadian dollar over the
decade, and evaluates their ability to capture these movements.
In this section we also examine the efficiency of the foreign
exchange market during this period. In Section 3 we analyze the
very sharp growth of external borrowing by Canadians in the
1974—76 period. Our attempt to explain this growth relies in part
upon the existence of irrationality in the formation of long—run
expectations in the bond market or exchange market or both.
Finally, in Section 4 we turn to an analysis of the real effects
resulting from the shocks to the system. In particular, we show
that fluctuations in relative outputs, income distribution and
trade balances can all be at least partly explained by relative
price changes arising from terms of trade and exchange rate
movements.

1    A SHORT HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

      In this section of the paper we outline a brief overview of
some of the principal forces at play in the Canadian economy in

the 1970s.3 Further details will be presented as required in
the course of the discussion.

     Canada had been on a fixed exchange rate since June 1962 (at
a value of 92.5 cents U.S.), with official reserves roughly
constant over the period at a level of between $2.5 and $3.1

billion.4 The combination of an unusually strong current
account and a normal—sized capital inflow resulted in a sharp

increase in official reserves in the first half of 1970.
Following the decision to float, (June 1, 1970), the Canadian

dollar rose rapidly from 92.5 cents to nearly $1.00 U.S.      In the

early 1970s, monetary policy was influenced by the desire to
prevent the Canadian dollar from rising much above parity with its

U.S. counterpart as long as unemployment remained well above the

levels that had   prevailed   in the latter half of the 1960s.5



3. General discussions of the Canadian economy can be found in
    Courchene (1976), Freeman (1978), the Bank of Canada Annual
    Report, the Department of Finance Economic Review, and the
    OECD annual report on Canada. For a survey of the Canadian
    balance of payments over the 1970s see MacKay and Hannah
     (1979)
4.  For part of the period, the maximum level of Canadian
    reserves was determined by an agreement with the United
    States.
5. One complicating factor for policy—makers throughout this
    period was the upward movement in the natural rate of unem-
    ployment as a result of demographic changes and government
    policy initiatives in the field of unemployment insurance.

     A very important factor affecting the Canadian economy in the
1970s was the sharp movement in the relative world prices of raw
materials and manufactured goods. Since Canada is a major
exporter of raw materials, the relative price change was reflected
in a very sharp increase in the Canadian terms of trade (Figure
1). Beginning with a slow increase in 1972 04, the terms of trade
rose throughout 1973 and peaked at 1.187 in 1974 Q2. After
declining to 1.092 by 1975 01, they hovered around 1.11 until the
end of 1976 when they began a long downward slide that ended only
in 1978 04. The improvements in the terms of trade in the 1972 to
1976 period increased real incomes in Canada quite substantially

since Canadian output could be traded at very favourable rates for
the product of the rest of the world. One measure of this gain

(see Freedman (1977)) shows an increase in Canadian incomes and

potential real expenditures arising from the terms of trade
effect, of almost 0.6 percent per annum over the 1973—76 period.

For example, in the peak year, 1974, real incomes rose by over 1.5
percent because of a 7.9 percent increase in the terms of trade in
that year. A further indirect effect of the terms of trade
improvement in the early part of the decade was the upward
pressure that it exerted on the value of the Canadian dollar.
     The 1970s was an unusual decade for the Canadian economy

insofar as the behaviour of unemployment and inflation rates

differed markedly from that in the United States. Whereas the
U.S. economy entered into a sharp recession in 1974, the downturn

in Canada was much less pronounced. Indeed, it was only late in

1974 that the unemployment rate began to increase in Canada,
rising gradually over the period from 1975 to mid—1978. In Figure
2, we present the unemployment rates in Canada and the United

States over the period 1964—78. The sharp rise in the prices of

internationally—traded goods and the high rates of growth of the
money supply in Canada (Figure 3) contributed to a marked increase
in the rate of price inflation both in absolute terms and relative

to the United States (Figure 4). Since the exchange rate had no
pronounced trend in the 1971—76 period, this increase in
relative prices in Canada vis—à—vis the United States resulted in
a sharp deterioration of the competitiveness of Canadian industry
according to all the conventional measures.
      In late 1975, the Governor of the Bank of Canada announced a

target range of rates of growth for the narrow monetary aggregate
(Ml). The intent was to reduce the monetary growth rate gradually
in order to bring down the rate of inflation over time. Not

surprisingly, the attempt to slow the growth of the money supply
resulted in increases in short—term interest rates. With U.S.

long—term interest rates relatively low, an unusually large
long—term interest rate differential vis—à—vis the United States

developed and long—term borrowing abroad6 increased to
unprecedented levels in 1975 and 1976 (especially in the latter
year) .   These capital flows put substantial upward pressure on the
Canadian dollar.

     In the fourth quarter of 1976 the Canadian dollar began its
long downward slide. By the end of 1978, the 21 percent

depreciation of the dollar was sufficient to bring the
competitiveness of Canadian goods back to the 1971 level.

However, although there was a not insignificant response in the
output and net export of tradable goods in 1977 and 1978,

improvements in the merchandise trade balance were slower than
anticipated. The slowness of the response can be
attributed, at least in part, to the fact that many tradable goods
industries were operating at near to full capacity as a result of

the sharp increase in output. The focus of attention therefore
shifted to the actual and planned investment in these industries,

in response to the capacity tightness situation resulting from the

depreciation.

2      DETERMINATION OF THE CANADIAN DOLLAR-U.S. DOLLAR
       EXCHANGE RATE AND EXCHANGE MARKET EFFICIENCY

       Several recent papers (Dornbusch (1978b), Isard (1978) and
Schadier (L977)) have     surveyed   various theoretical models of

exchanc;e ratc detenuination. In this section we examine how well

the empirical counterparts of  these models have done in explaining
the   movements of th Canadian dollar — U.S. dollar exchange
rate7 during the 1970s. Particular attention is paid to the
concept of market effic iency, under which the exchange rate is
assumed to reflect fully all available information. In the
concluding part of Section 2 we       examine   the   reasons why the

empirical   models have performed so poorly and why the exchange
market opears to have been inefficient.

2.1    Models of exchange rate determination

       Perhaps   the simplest exchange rate theory is based on the
concept of purchasing—power parity (PPP). In Figure 5, four
measures of what the exchange rate (Canadian dollars per U.S.
doLlar) would have     been had it followed purchasing—power parity
are compared to an     index of the actual exchange rate

(1971l00).8 The broad measures (based on consumer prices,


7.    Since about 70 percent of Canada's foreign trade is with the
      United States, this is by far the most significant bilateral
      exchange rate for Canada.
8.    We take 1971 as a representative base year rather than 1970
      because Canada returned to floating rates only in mid—1970
      and there was, in the remaining months of that year, a
      large appreciation which may be interpreted as a sign that
      the Canadian dollar had been undervalued.

unit labour costs arid GNP deflators) do very poorly, especially

for the 1974—77 period. The export price measure moves very
little, even after 1976, which is quite surprising.9
     As can easily be seen in Figure 5, real exchange rate
movements during the period were very large. Figure 6 shows two
measures of the real exchange rate — one based on relative unit
labour costs and the other on relative GNP deflators. The 24
percent appreciation of the real exchange rate on a unit labour
cost definition (18 percent on a GNP deflator definition) from

1971 to the fourth quarter of 1976, means that even exchange rate
models that enforce purchasing—power parity with a medium—term lag

cannot   explain the movements of the nominal exchange rate for that
period. The fact that the real exchange rate on either measure
had returned to approximately its 1971 level by the end of 1978
suggests that if there were real factors that caused the

appreciation of the real exchange rate, they were only of a
temporary nature (or were balanced by shocks with an opposite
effect).    On the other hand, if the movements in the real exchange

rate were due to a lagged adjustment to purchasing—power parity,

the adjustment lags were much longer than expected.




9.   if the lw of one price had held, then relative export prices
     would have tracked the exchange rate exactly. Figure 5 shows
     that there is little difference prior to 1977. Subsequently,
     however, relative export prices do not follow the deprecia-
     ting exchange rate.
                              13



     Are there more complex empirical exchange rate models that
will track the exchange rate accurately for both the 1970—76

period and for the more recent period without the use of ad hoc

adjustments?lO The answer appears to be no. Monetarist
models, such as those of Girton and Roper (1977) and Sargen

(1977), perform poorly because of their incorporation of the

purchasing—power—parity assumption. The demand for short—term
assets model of Haas and Alexander (1979) and the eclectic model

of Freedman (1979a) track the period to the third quarter of 1976

fairly well, but require dummy variables for the subsequent
period. The Freedman model contains some insights as to what

moved the exchange rate in the earlier period, illustrating that
the Canadian—U.S. interest rate differential, the Canadian terms

of trade, relative prices, foreign borrowings and the unexpected
change in the trade balance all had significant impacts. In this
model, as in that of Haas and Alexander (and many other exchange
rate models — see Freedman (1978)), a 1 percentage point change in

the interest rate differential results, ceteris paribus, in a more
than 1 percentage point change in the exchange rate, an effect

that is larger than most theoretical models would suggest.

     With portfolio balance models, difficulties appear to arise
when a country is a net debtor in bonds denominated in foreign




10. An Appendix contains a number of estimated models of the

currencies, a situation that is true for Canada. For in that case
(see Branson (1978)), an exchange rate (Canadian dollars per U.S.
dollar) that moves above equilibrium results in an excess demand

for foreign exchange which puts further upward pressure on the

exchange rate, moving the system away from equilibrium.11 We
can illustrate this point in a simple three asset case. With the
home country demand for real balances (M), bonds (B) and foreign

bonds (F) (EF in domestic currency) as functions of the domestic
interest rate (r) ,          the foreign interest rate (r*) and the expected
rate of depreciation () , one has:


      M = rn(r,r*,Ee)(M÷B÷EF)
      B = b(r,r*,Ee)(M+B1.EF)
      EF =

Then EF =            (M+B)     since m+b+f=l

Now   r is a   functJon of r*, E, and M/B alone (Dornbusch

(l978b)).      Therefore with M and          B unchanged, fi is also unchanged

and SO:



11. Similarly, an exogenous increase in the current account
      surplus will cause a decrease in net foreign liabilities
      and depreciation of the currency, which in turn will
      generate a larger current account surplus, again moving
      the system away from equilibrium.

     dE —    —E

If F <    0, then dE/dF > 0, i.e., a decrease in net foreign
liabilities (a rise in F) leads to a depreciation of the domestic
currency.

     There is a potentially large class of models (of the rational
expectations type) that start from the balance of payments

identity to determine the expected exchange rate. For example,
assume that market participants form their expectations of the

exchange rate such that, n periods into the future, the basic

balance will be zero. Then, given the future values of the
functional determinants of the current account and long—term

capital flows, a unique exchange rate is determined. Current and
past values of the variables could be used to 'forecast the future

values. Also, the latest data on current and capital accounts

could be compared to the forecast value based on the knowledge of
the current values of the determinants to establish whether there

has been an exogenous shift in demand or supply functions. An
example of a particular functional form that may be useful in the
approach is gven in Longworth (l979a)

     With this approach, a greater role is given to the current

account, capital account, and their determinants, than in other
exchange rate models and thus it is more in the spirit of the

models of Mundell (1968) and Fleming (1962). It is much easier to
                                 16



examine demand and relative price shocks in this type of model
than in the monetarist model.

        Consider, for example, a shock to the world price of raw
materials relative to manufactured goods.        If the exchange rate

and domestic wages initially remain unchanged this will cause an
improvement in the Canadian terms of trade and the current

account. If this situation is expected to persist there must be
an appreciation of the real exchange rate to restore the basic
balance to its equilibrium level.

              attempted to measure the effect of the Canadian
        Freedman

terms of trade on the exchange rate. Although he did find a
significant impact, the terms of trade improvement in Canada
during the mid—1970s could only be one small part of the
explanation for the appreciation of the real exchange rate. For
example, although the terms of trade peaked in the second quarter
of 1974, the real exchange rate appreciated until the fourth
quarter of 1976 (at which time the terms of trade were 8 percent
less than    their peak value)

2.2     Exchange market efficiency
        Both the Freedman and Haas—Alexander models employ lagged

exchange rates as determinants of     the   current exchange rate.

Thus,    the world that they describe is not one of efficient markets
in   which the exchange rate properly incorporates all information
as it becomes known, and in which lagged information should not

play a significant role. If the exchange market is efficient,
                                   17



then in the absence of a risk premium, the forward exchange rate
should be an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate (see for

example, Levich (1979)). Since the current spot rate is known at
the same time as the forward rate, it is also true that the

current forward premium should be an unbiased predictor of the

change in the spot rate (Porter (1971), Levich (1979)). Longworth
(1979a) has shown that the 30—day forward premium was a biased

predictor   of the change in the spot rate for the period January
1971 through October 1976; in fact, the two variables were
strongly negative correlated. This apparent inefficiency could
not have resulted from intervention in the exchange market by the
authorities, since they appear to have been following a smoothing
rule whereby the amount of intervention was proportional to the
change in the exchange rate (Longworth (l979b)).
     For    the   1977—78 period, the forward premium again failed to
be an unbiased predictor of the change in the spot rate; the

constant term, which indicates a trend in the rate of depreciation
unaccounted for by the forward premium, was significant in the

regression of the change in the spot rate on the forward premium.
Thus, at least at first glance, the exchange market appears to
have been inefficient for this period as well.
     The question arises as to what new information caused the

exchange rate to move. In a study of changes in the exchange rate
from month—end to month—end, Loiigworth (1979a) found that changes
(which are assumed to be unexpected) in the interest rate

differential and unexpected                in foreign borrowing were
                                move7n-t
                                  18



important in both sub—periods,'2 with the unexpected movement
in the merchandise trade balance significant for the 1977—78

period. Although changes in relative prices, relative costs,
rela1ive money supplies and the terms of trade often had the

correct sign, they were never significant.

2.3 Possible reasons why the market appears to have
     been inefficient

     Since     the Longworth efficient markets model has little
exp].anatory power, one must assume eiLber that some important
economic md icators have been overlooked or that the significance
of certain information is only appreciaed with time — thus the
lagged exchange rate in the Freedman model is indicative of a
partial-adjustment mechanism. Why might one expect these lags?
     riarket    participants must be able to distinguish between

changes  in nominal variables and changes in real variables, as
well as between changes of a permanent and a temporary nature. It
is perhaps possible that the market was concentrating on the
nominal, rather than the real exchange rate. Since, as Mussa
(L976) has pointed out, for many years the exchange rate remained
very close to unity, this could have served as a strong anchor for
expectations. For a time immediately after the dollar was allowed
to float in 1970, the Bank of Canada was acting to reinforce

12. Given the important role ascribed to interest rate
    differentials and foreign borrowings in both the Freedman
    and Lonqworth models, they are discussed in Section 3 with
    special emphasis on the large borrowings observed during
    1976.
                               19



expectations that the nominal exchange rate would not deviate much
from the usual range. Thus the Bank of Canada Annual Report for
1970 (page 9) notes that "It is therefore still necessary to seek
a mix of fiscal and monetary policy which encourages levels of
interest rates in Canada that are consistent with the exchange

rate staying within a suitable range.t'

     Courchene (1976, page 161) has written, "after a full year of
combatting inflation [1969—70] despite the fact that Canada was on

a fixed exchange rate, when the rate floated and Canada was
finally allowed the independence to pursue its own policies with
respect to the behaviour of prices, the concern over inflation was

immediately jettisoned in favour of ensuring that the exchange
rate was set at an 'appropriate level' ...,   the net result of
attempting to obtain an 'appropriate' exchange rate was a very

large increase in the rate of monetary expansion, the legacy of
which is our current [1976] inflation rate." The rate of monetary
expansion, after adjustment for the growth in demand for real
money balances as a function of real income, was much faster than
that in the United States for the first half of the decade. This
contributed to more rapid growth of unit labour costs and prices
in Canada than in the United States.
     The exchange market appears to have largely ignored the
significant appreciation of the real exchange rate. Also, because

of lags in adjustment to the real exchange rate and because of the

terms of trade improvement associated with the world—wide

commodity boom, there was no immediate significant deterioration
                                20


in   the nominal merchandise trade balance to alert the market.

      Nor was there a strong signal from the basic balance in the

1970—76 period. The basic balance was    positive   from 1970 to 1973

and only slightly negative in 1974 and 1975. As the current
account balance went negative in 1974 (—$1.46 billion) and 1975

(—$4.76 billion) , long—term capital inflows increased from $1.04

billion in 1974 to $3.94 billion in 1975.    Then, as long—term
capital inflows more than doubled to $7.91 billion in 1976 and the

                 balance strengthened (partly because of an
merchand ise trade
improvement in the terms of trade) , the basic balance reached an
historical high of $4.11 billion.
        a rational framework for exchange rate determination, the
       In

terms of trade improvement and the high level of capital inflows
would have to have been considered largely permanent for the value
of the Canadian dollar to have remained at the high level that it
did. Yet previous experience had shown that terms of trade
improvements, which in Canada are primarily associated with an
increase in the world price of raw materials relative to the world
price of manufactured goods (Longworth (l979a)), tended to reverse
themselves — the Korean War boom being a case in point. As well,
large increases in long—term capital inflows, such as the 40
percent increase in 1969 over 1968, also tended to he temporary
                                                                    —




e.g., in 1970 capital inflows fell below the 1968 figure.
     When most of the variation in a series is typically due to
temporary disturbances, then it is rational to assume that any
particular change in that series is due to a temporary shock that
                               21



will reverse itself. If exchange rate determination is based upon
an examination of underlying fundamentals, the Canadian case

appears to be very puzzling. On the other hand, if market
participants were in fact concentrating on the nominal exchange
rate and viewed deviations from unity as being temporary, the

behaviour of the exchange rate from 1971 to 1976 is more easily
understood.

     Such behaviour would require the absence of a large number of

speculators basing their decisions on underlying economic

determinants. As McKinnon (1976) has observed, there may not be a
large pool of capital available for speculation over long periods

of time. Although there is a good deal of speculation over
periods of hours or days or weeks, there seems to be insufficient

capital to smooth the real exchange rate so that it reflects
economic fundamentals.

3       CANADIAN EXTERNAL BORROWING IN THE MID—1970s

        One of the very interesting aspects of economic behaviour
over the 1970s was the movement of long—term capital flows and,
more specifically, the movement of gross new issues abroad by
Canad ianprovinces, municipal it ies arid corporat. ions. As the
aggregate data show (Table 1, column 1), after remaining at levels
of between $1 and $2 .)1li1Ofl between 1964 and 1973, gross new
issues abroad virtually doubled in i.')74, doubled again in 1975,
and   almost    doubled again   in   1976 before falling off in 1977 and
1978.        In this section, after examining the   data   more closely, we
look at the determinants of long—term capital inflows in terms of
the expected cost over time of borrowing in different
markets.13
      In the course of the analysis some simple models of interest
rate and exchange rate determination are used to focus on the
relationship between tie expectation of future inflation
incorporated in the long—term interest rate, and that incorporated
in the expected exchange rate. One of the puzzles underlying the
entire discussion is why Canadian boowers issued enormous

             terms of a portfolio choice framework, we would expect
       the   amount of borrowing in a qiven market to he a function
      of the cost of borrowing in that market relative to the
      cost of borrowing in other markets, and the relative risks
      of borrowing in the two markeLs. That is, we assume that
      long—term borrowers are risk-averse and require a reduction
      in the relative cost of borrowing in external markets to
      offset the extra risk involved in issuing more securities
      denominated in foreign currenci.es.

amounts of foreign—pay securities in 1976 at a time when high
Canadian interest rates were believed to reflect (at least in

part) inflationary expectations, and when the Canadian dollar was
widely believed to be overvalued.




3.1 A closer look at the data
       In column 2 of Table 1, we present the total gross new issues

to foreigners by provinces, municipalities and corporations over
the 1964—78 period, scaled by nominal GNP. As can be seen from

the data in columns 1 and 2, the reduction of foreign borrowing in

the early 1970s was more than reversed in the mid—1970s, and
inflows reached historically unprecedented levels in 1976.
       Another way to look at the data is to examine external

borrowing by provinces, municipalities and corporations as a share
of their total borrowing (see columns 3 to 6, Table 1). Once
again the pattern of sharp increases in the mid—seventies stands
out.    These were years of very substantial deficits for the

provinces and municipalities and large total issues by all three
i:ypes of borrowers, a very considerable share of which was
financed abroad.

       An important element in modelling long—term capital flows
rests on the question of who bears the exchange risk ——   the
foreign lender or the domestic borrower. In contrast to most
theoretical models in which the foreign lender purchases domestic

currency bonds issued by a domestic borrower and hence takes on
                               25



the exchange risk, in Canada it is traditionally the domestic
borrower who takes on the exchange risk by issuing foreign—pay

bonds. Until the mid—1970s the only important exception to this
pattern was the federal Government, some of whose outstanding
Canadian dollar obligations have been purchased by

foreigners.14 Thus, almost all the foreign holdings of
provincial, municipal and corporate bonds were in the form of

foreign—pay bonds specifically issued to tap foreign markets. In
the mid—1970s, however, with the growth of the Euro—Canadian
dollar market, there were some issues of Canadian dollar

obligations abroad in which the lender took on the exchange risk.

In Table 2, we present the data for 1970—78, dividing issues
abroad by Canadian provinces, municipalities and corporations into
Canadian dollar issues, U.S. dollar issues, Euro—U.S. dollar
issues, Euro—Canadian dollar issues, and other foreign currency
issues. In the last five columns of the Table, we present the
share of total domestic and foreign issues represented by each

category of bonds.-'-5 The growth of issues abroad in 1975 and
1976 was substantially larger than the rise in foreign—pay issues

over this period because of the large issues of Euro—Canadian

dollar bonds in 1975 by provincial governments, and in 1976, by



14. This ignores purchases of corporate equity by foreigners
    which at times have been substantial. We restrict the
    discussion that follows to bond issues.
15. We assume throughout that the proportion of these foreign—pay
    bonds held by Canadians can safely be ignored.

corporations.'6 Nonetheless, the share of issues denominated
in foreign currencies still showed a substantial increase in the
mid—1970s.

     The traditional explanation of these borrowings focussed on
interest rate differentials between the domestic market and

foreign   markets (see Figure 7) . Thus,    for example, Caves and

Reuber   (1971) regressed net inflows of    long—term capital on
Canadian and U.S. long rates, the Canadian long—short differential
and some measure of financial requirements. Similar equations
were used by Helleiner (1962), Officer (1968), Lee (1969) and

Freedman (1970) 17 These studies differed in their use of
stock or flow data and in their incorporation of exchange rate

expectations.
     In Table 3 we present the results of a very simple regression
for the period 1964 Q4 to 1978 Q4 in which the proportion of bonds

issued abroad (EXTSHARE) (including Euro—Canadian dollar bonds) to
total bonds issued (TOTISSUE) ,    is   first regressed on the

differential between Canadian and U.S. long—term interest

rates (INTDIFF'),l8 and then   alternatively, on    the ratio



16. In the main it was financial corporations that issued Euro—
    Canadian dollar bonds over the period. The amount issued by
    non—financial corporations was relatively small.

    Spitaller (1971)

    issued in the United States with the rate on bonds issued
    in Canada by the same Canadian borrower. Because of data
    constraints we have used the differential between the

      Although the results of the former equation are much better
than those of the latter, they explain only about 20 percent of
the variations. Furthermore, the movement of interest rates in
1975—76 is not sufficiently large to xplain the increase in
borrowing during this period. However, the main objection to this
type of simple regression is that it ignores the possibility that
the exchange rate expected to prevail t the time of interest
payments and principal repayment may not be the same as the
current exchange rate. That is, the use of the nominal interest
rate differential uncorrected for expected changes in exchange
rates is very questionable during a period of differing inflation

rates and floating exchange rates.

      In order to examine the magnitide of exchange rate risk, we
turn next to an analysis of the mathematics of bond prices.
Although couched in terms of borrower behaviour, the following
analysis can also be used to examine the behaviour of a foreign
lender taking on the risk of excharije rate change, as in the case
of Euro—Canadian dollar issues.

3.2 Some simple mathematics of bond prices
     In this section, the following notation is used:


RLC — interest rate on long—term Canadian dollar bonds;
RLU — interest rate on long—term U.S. dollar bonds;
n    —   term to maturity;
S(t) — exchange rate at time t, defined as Canadian dollar price

         of one U.S. dollar;
i    —   yield   to maturity;
rlc — real loncy-terrn interest rate in Canada;
rlu — real long—term interest rate in the United States;
T'c — rate of inflation in Canada; and
nu   —   rate    of inflation in the United States.


     When a Canadian borrower issues a $1 U.S. bond abroad, he

receives $S(Q) in Canadian funds at the time of issue. In return

he pays $(RLU) S(L) interest at time t, and $1S(n) principal
repayment in Canadian funds at time n (where RLU, the U.S. long
rate is equal to the coupon on U.S. dollar bonds). The yield to
maturity on such a bond can he calculated by solving the following

equation:



     S(O) =     f (RLU)S(t)e'tdt   +    S(n)e                  (1)




     Traditionally, Canadian borrowers have determined the

protection against a depreciation afforded by lower U.S. interest
                                    32



rates by calculating the amount of the depreciation that would
result in the bond yield being equal to the cost of borrowing in

Canada, or RLC. There is a variety of possible exchange rate
movements that one could postulate in carrying out this
calculation; the most common one used is one in which a

once—and—for—all depreciation of the Canadian currency occurs

immediately after the issue of the bond. That is, 5(1) = S(2)
     =   S(n)   S(O). The equation then becomes



     S(O) =f(RLU)S(l)e1tdt+S(i)em                              (1')




To determine the S(1) that would raise the cost of borrowing in
the United States to the cost of borrowing in Canada, we may

rewrite equation (1') as:



     S(O)                                                      (2)




     S(O) = RLU
                  [1 — e
                         —RLCn
                               ]   + e -RLCn                   (2
     S(l)



     In the case of a perpetuity, n approaches infinity and

S(O)/S(l) = RLJU/RLC.    For example, if RLU were 8 percent and RLC

were 9 percent and S(O) were 1.00, then the immediate depreciation
that would wipe out the gains from borrowing in the United States

would be an increase in S to 1.125 in period 1, i.e., a fall in
                                 33



the value of the Canadian dollar to 88.9 cents U.S. Note that it
is the ratio between the two interest rates, and not the

differential, that is relevant to the calculation in the case of a

perpetuity. In the more general case of the term bond, one can
analyze the effect on S(l) of changes in RLU, RLC, and n by

differentiating the expression with respect to these parameters.
Since the results do not yield a great deal of intuitive

understanding, it is perhaps more useful to illustrate the
magnitude of the effect by the examples in Table 4•20

       By comparing lines 1 and 3, one can see that for equal
proportional differences in interest rates, the rise in the

exchange rate that wipes Out the gain to the borrower is the same

in the case of a perpetuity but quite different for a term bond.

Also, by comparing lines 1 and 2, one can see that for the equal

absolute differences in interest rates, the depreciation
protection is virtually the same for bonds of short maturity, but
differs substantially for bonds of long maturity. The reason for
these results is that the longer the maturity, the larger the role

that interest payments play compared to the principal repayment.
With short maturities the cost of the depreciation operates mainly

through the increase in the cost of the principal repayment. With
long maturities, it operates in substantial part via its effect on
      the Canadian dollar value of the interest payments.
raising
   The results shown in Table 4 indicate that for a bond of
20—year maturity, the protection factor can neither be expressed
only   in terms of the interest rate differential nor only in terms

of the ratio of interest rates. It is, therefore, perhaps
somewhat surprising that the regressions discussed above and
presentedin Table 3 all indicate that the differential performs
substantially better than the ratio of interest rates.
    The exercise we have carried out thus far has been a fairly
mechanical   one illustrating the relationship between rates in

Canada    and the United States and the depreciation that would wipe
out the   gain to the Canadian borrower. However, there are also
economic relationships between interest rate differentials and

expected exchange rate changes.       For instance, take a simple pair
of assumptions that are characteristic of a strong monetarist
                                                35



position: (a) long—term interest rates are equal to a real rate
plus the expected rate of inflation over the term to maturity,
i.e., the Fisher effect always holds; and (b) movements in
exchange rates are the result of a difference in inflation rates
in the two countries. This gives


     RLC =    nc +    'rrc                                         (3)
     RLU =    rlu+    'Tu                                          (4)


     S(t) =S(O)e(t                                                 (5)


     Substituting these expressions into equation (1) to calculate
the cost of foreign borrowing, we have



     S(O) =     (RLU)S(O)e (Trc_Tru)t_itdt+S(O)e(lTc_Tru)ne_in
                                   e                               (6)

Hence

            = na      +     'ITO




         the cost at borrowing in Canada is RLC or nc + nc.
        Now

Thus, the difference in the cost of borrowing in the United States
and in Canada is simply rio — na. Whatever the long—run
differential in real interest rates is, it is by assumption
unaffected by changes in rates of inflation and nominal interest
rates and, hence, the decision as to whether to borrow in the
United States or Canada should not he a function of nominal
differentials.                   To put it slightly differently, the nominal

interest rate in each country incorporates an inflationary

premium.         If   the only reason for a change in nominal interest

rates were the change in this inflationary premium (i.e., real

rates were always constant) ,                 then any change in interest rate
Ufferantials would be solely the result of a change in
inflationary expectations for Canada vis—à—vis the United States.
Hut   this      change should he reflected in the expected exchange rate
over the life of the bond and, therefore, should not result in any

change in the borrowing decision.21



21. In this discussion we have ignored the once—and—for—all
    change in the level of the exchange rate brought about by
    the change In the rate of growth of the money supply that is

3.3 Possible explanations of observed patterns of borrowing
       Since observed movements in external borrowing over the
mid—1970s clearly imply some response in borrower or lender
behaviour to movements in nominal rates, one or more of the

assumptions made above must be invalid.22 We will examine
the possible sources of the observed behaviour under the following
four headings:

       i)      Expectations of future inflation are formed

              differently in the bond market and the foreign

               exchange market.

       ii)     The Fisher effect does not always hold in the
              bond market.

       iii) Purchasing—power parity does not always hold in

               the foreign exchange market.


      the ause of the chaige in the interest rate and inflation
      rate. In a model with perfect foresight this level change
      would take place at the instant the change in money growth
      was announced and hence would not affect any transactions
      that occurred thereafter, such as borrowing that takes place
      at the new interest rates. Since this level change cannot
      be anticipated there is no way in which any transactor can
      take advantage of its occurrence. In Figure 8A we present
      the    effects on the exchange rate, interest rate, and prices,
      of a decUne in the rate of growth of the Canadian money
      supply below that of the U.S. money supply, under the
      assumption  of rational expectations. The value S(O) in the
      text is the level of the exchange rate in the instant after
      the change in money supply growth is announced. For a
      general discussion of the level change in the case of a
      closed economy see Bailey (1971)
22.   For a similar analysis of short—term money markets, see
      Aliber (1976).
                                38


     iv)    Other factors are also important in determining
            the location of borrowing.


3.3(1) Inconsistent expectations in bond markets and
        foreign exchange markets
    There is relatively little of an analytic nature that can be
said about this possibility. Given the long history of the
Canadian dollar being relatively close in value to one U.S.
dollar, it may have been difficult for borrowers to envisage a
situation in which the two currencies diverge continuously over

time.23 Indeed, borrowers may have been influenced by parity
psychology whereby the Canadian dollar is perceived to be roughly

equal to the U.S. dollar over the long run. Nonetheless, if the
best estimates of relative long—run inflationary movements are

reflected in the differential between bond rates in the two
countries, one would expect these same estimates to he used in the
calculation of the expected exchange rate. Thus, one would have
to assume a substantial amount of irrationality if one argued that

there were inconsistent expectations in the two markets.


3.3(u) The Fisher effect does not always hold in the
           bond market
     There are two sub—cases in this instance. First, the long
rate is determined by the expectations theory of the term



23. For example, the implication of a one percentage point dif-
    ferential between Canadian and U.S. rates of inflation over
    twenty years is a 22 percent depreciation of the Canadian
    dollar over that period. Even if     the   former seemed possible,
    the    latter may not have seemed plausible to Canadians.
                              39



structure, but the short rate does not always move one—to—one in
response to the rate of inflation. Thus, for example, Friedman
(1968) has argued that in response to a decrease in the rate of

growth of the money supply, there are liquidity, income, and
inflationary effects on the interest rate. Short—term interest
rates thus rise initially and then fall back to their original

level before falling to a level consistent with the new, lower
rate of inflation brought about by the decline in money supply

growth. Most empirical work now suggests that the time required
before the short rate reaches its new equilibrium level can be

rather long.

     The effect of such a divergence from equilibrium of short
rates can give rise to substantial divergences in the movements of

the long rate from the full Fisher effect, at least in the short
run. For example, suppose that in response to a slowing in the
rate of growth of the money supply of one percentage point, one

had the following annual short—term interest rates starting from

an initial level of 6 percent ——   6.30, 6.00, 5.50 and 5.00
thereafter. If the long—term interest rate had originally also
been 6 percent, and if the expectations theory of the term

structure held exactly, the 20—year long rate would take the
following values —— 5.21 percent in the first period, 5.11 percent

in the second period, 5.04 percent in the third period, and 5.00

percent thereafter.24 Note that when the market foresees


24. In making these calculations we used the Shiller
    approximation, as developed in Modigliani and Shiller
    (1973) and Shiller (1979).
                                  40


correctly the eventual decline of the short-term interest rate,
one has   divergent movements in the short run, with the short rate

increasing   and the long rate falling substantially. Despite the
fact. that the lonq rate rema ins above its new equil ibrium level
for a period of time, there will be no gain to borrowing abroad
after the announcement of the decline in the money supply growth,
if one assumes that the exchange market responds rationally to the
expected movements in interest rates.25
      If U.S. interest rates remained at 6 percent, then as shown
in Figure 8B, there would be an immediate appreciation of the
Canadian dollar, followed by a gradual movement back to the
long—run equilibrium as determined by purchasing—power—parity
considerations. Thus, if in the very long run, Canadian rates are

I percentage point below U.S. rates and the Canadian dollar

appreciates by 1 percent per year in an offsetting fashion, in the
period after the announcement, Canadian long rates would be only

79 basis points below U.S. rates, but the expected appreciation of
the   Canadian   dollar over the 20—year period in which the bond is

outstanding, would be less than 1 percent per year, thereby again
equalizing returns. In effect, there would be a sharp

25. Here we define rationality in the sense of Dornbusch (1976,
    l978a) , where the current spot rate is equal to the expected
    spot rate discounted by the interest rate differential
    plus one. We treat the expected spot rate in the distant
    future as determined by PPP considerations, and use the
    product of one plus the short rates in the discount
    factor. In a case in which the expectations theory of
    the term structure holds, this is the same as discounting
    using one plus the long rate.

appreciation of the Canadian dollar in response to the
unanticipated announcement of a decline in the rate of growth of
the money supply and thereafter there would be equalization of
borrowing   costs internationally. Thus, even when the Fisher
effect does not hold in the short run, there will be no response

in external borrowing to a nominal interest rate change, provided
that the expectations theory of the term structure holds, the spot
exchange rate adjusts to interest rates and, in the long run, PPP

holds.
     The second sub—case to be considered is one in which the

expectations theory of the term structure does not provide an

explanation of movements in long—term interest rates. Recent
studies for the United States (see Shiller (1979)) and Canada
(Freedman (1979b)) suggest that the long—term bond rate is more

volatile than it would be under the pure expectations theory.
Thus, when short rates rise, long rates tend to rise as well and

by more than anticipated on the basis of pure expectations.
However, the long rate tends to rise less than would be expected

If the short—term rate were a martingale. For example, the rise
in short rates from 6 percent to 6.30 percent might be expected to

lead to a rise in long rates from 6 percent to, say, 6.05 percent.
Since long—term interest rates rise rather than fall in response

to a decline in the rate of growth of the money supply, real
long—term interest rates would be substantially higher in this
instance than in the first sub—case for the period of adjustment.
Not surprisingly, this would lead to substantial borrowing in
                              43



foreign markets. In this sub—case, the element of rationality in
long—term borrowing decisions stems from the "irrationality" in

the setting of long—term interest rates whereby long—term real
rates can move quite markedly in response to a change in money
supply growth.

    On average, experience in Canada tends to accord with the
notion that long rates move in the same direction as short rates
but with a response coefficient of about 0.2. However, the
movements of interest rates in 1976 seem to be more consistent
with the first model than with the second; short rates tended to
rise somewhat in 1976 while long rates fell substantially (Figure

9). To the extent that Canadian long rates fell in response to
the fall in expected inflation rates in Canada, one would have

expected a corresponding rise in the expected long—run value of

the Canadian dollar. However, since U.S. long rates fell by about
the same amount as Canadian long rates over 1976, interest rate
differentials remained unchanged —   although by historical
standards they were at a high level. If the fall in the U.S. rate
had been a response to a decline in inflationary expectations in
the United States, then the relative positions of the two

currencies and the relative expected inflation rates would have

remained unchanged in 1976, thereby leaving open the question as
to why external borrowing grew so rapidly in 1976.26


26. There is a view that Canadian long rates move in sympathy
    with U.S. long rates (Lynch (1979)). Although this model
    breaks the link between long rates and expected rates of
    domestic inflation, it leaves unexplained changes in the
    differential  between Canadian and U.S. long rates.

3.3(iij) Purchasing—power parity does not always hold
        As noted above, the period leading into 1976 was
characterized by an increasing divergence of the exchange rate

from purchasing—power parity. However, this should have acted in
the direction of reducing borrowing even at large real interest
rate differentials, since over the long term one might have

expected PPP to be re—established. Hence, the protection factor
was substantially less than might have appeared to be the case,
given the overhang of "overvaluation" (in PPP terms) . On the
other hand, if the market believed that the Canadian dollar was
high because of some real change that was permanent, then relative
PPP would hold from that point in time.     In this case, we would be
back in the situation described earlier in which borrowers
incorporate notions of expected future rates of inflation into
both exchange rate expectations and long—term interest rates.
       The purchase of five—year Euro—Canadian dollar instruments by
foreigners   is even more difficult to understand from this

perspective. As was demonstrated earlier, a five—year instrument

provides relatively little protection against a depreciation, even
at fairly substantial interest rate differentials.    And, given the
overvaluation of the Canadian dollar in PPP terms, the degree of

protection was even less. It can perhaps be argued that the

market was overly impressed by Canada's position as a producer of

resources, leading it to ignore the indications that the Canadian
dollar was much more likely to fall in value than to rise.
                                 46



3.3(iv) Other factors
     An  assertion is sometimes made that Canadian issuers have to
place a greater proportion of their borrowings abroad in periods
of large borrowing requirements because of the inability of the
Canadian market to absorb them fully. The third equation in each
section of Table 3 (page 29 )   represents   a simple attempt to
evaluate this thesis by regressing the share of bonds issued

abroad (EXTSHARE) by each borrower on the interest rate
differential (INTDIFF), and on total bond issues of that borrower

(TOTISSUE), divided by nominal GNP.     In the case of provinces and

municipalities, this "market pressure" variable is significant,
while in the case of the corporate sector, although it has the

correct sign, it is insignificant. The estimated coefficients
indicate that between 1973 and 1976 the total issue variable would
account for increases of 13.7, 3.6 and 3.0 percentage points,

respectively, in the share of provincial, municipal, and corporate

borrowing abroad. By way of comparison, the movements of interest
rates between the same two years would account for 7.8, 15.4 and
26.0 percentage points of the increase in the shares issued

abroad.

     There were also two policy changes in 1975 that contributed

to the increase in external borrowing. First, the official
request made late in 1970 to major borrowers to consider the

domestic market carefully before entering foreign markets, was
withdrawn early in 1975. Second, in mid—1975 the 15 percent
                               47



federal withholding tax on interest payments was removed on new

corporate bond issues having maturities of five years and over.
Although both these changes acted in the direction of increasing

external borrowing, they were clearly not sufficient by themselves
to explain the massive increases in 1975 and 1976.


3.4 Some implications

     When deciding in which market to issue bonds, borrowers are
forced to make forecasts of exchange rates into the distant

future. Given the enormous uncertainty regarding these forecasts,

it is not surprising that at times the decisions taken can, with
hindsight, be seen to have been at least questionable. In the

theoretical analysis above, we have argued that there was some
inconsistency between the expectation as to the future behaviour
of prices incorporated in bond interest rates, and that

incorporated into expected exchange rates. It is probably the
case that there was an element of truth in all the arguments

discussed above: (i) borrowers were still influenced by parity

psychology, or at least they were unwilling to believe that a

continually depreciating Canadian dollar was possible; (ii)
increases in long—term rates reflected in part increases in real
rates of interest and not solely inflationary premia; and (iii)

perceptions as to the absorptive capacity of Canadian markets
affected at least some borrowers.

     The result of these factors was the enormous borrowing abroad

in the mid—i.970s. The movement of the U.S. dollar from a high of
                                48



1.04 in August 1975 to a low of .9626 in June 1976, and its
consequent pause on a plateau at about .975 until November 1976,
are at least in part attributable to the massive capital inflows

from 1975 Q4 through 1976 Q4.
     If the Canadian authorities should succeed in bringing the

Canadian inflation rate down below the U.S. inflation rate for any

length of time, there may be some transitional complications

caused by a reduction in borrowing abroad by Canadian residents.
With long—term nominal interest rates in Canada lower than those

in the United States, Canadian borrowers may reduce their
borrowing abroad despite the fact that the expected appreciation

of the Canadian dollar would offset the extra cost of borrowing
abroad. The depreciation of the Canadian dollar that would follow

would complicate to some extent efforts to achieve better price
performance in Canada vis——vis the United States. The crucial
point is that as long as a fixed—rate psychology, at any qiven

exchange rate, continues to affect the way long—run exchange rate

expectations are formed, the Canadian dollar may go through
periods of overvaluation and undervaluation as long—term capital
flows respond to nominal rather than real interest rate

differentials. Furthermore, the problem will be compounded on the
way to equilibrium by the tendency of long rates to move more than
the expectations theory of the term structure would suggest.

Thus, international capital flows may present some difficulties in
achieving a lower inflation rate in Canada than in the United

States. However, when the market is convinced that such a result

can be achieved, then these adjustment problems will disappear.

4    REAL EFFECTS: THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES

     In this section we examine the effects of movements in the
terms of trade and the real exchange rate on the allocation of
resources27 and the distribution of income.
     A change in the relative price of raw materials has an impact
on the relative outputs of resource—based industries and

non—resource—based manufacturing. Movements in the relative price

of raw materials, the real exchange rate (on a unit labour cost
basis) and U.S. CNP affect the allocation of resources between the
tradable and non—tradable goods sectors of the economy and thus

the merchandise trade balance (both on a nominal and real basis).
Real exchange rate movements also have implications for the
distribution of income between wages and profits. Finally,

changes in the terms of trade and the real exchange rate affect
the perceived profitability of business fixed investment.

     If we believed that Canada could be adequately modelled as a

small open economy, then our analysis would proceed along the
lines of Salter (1959), Swan (1960), and Dornbusch (1974, 1975).
However, there is evidence presented in Longworth (1979a) that

Canada is not a price—taker for manufactured goods, especially in
the short run, and Appelbaum and Kohli (1979) come to the



27. The empirical approach is exploratory in nature, differing
    from the usual approach of estimating export and import
    equations directly. Our interest is with shifts of
    resources between identifiable sectors rather than just
    the trade balance.
                               50



conclusion that Canada cannot be modelled as a small open economy

for its exports. There has been little success in estimating
export supply curves at any level of aggregation. Most studies
therefore follow the Dornbusch—Krugman (1976) approach of

estimating export price equations as functions of foreign output
prices and domestic input costs. Export demands are then
estimated as a function of relative prices and foreign income, as
in RDX2, the Bank of Canada's econometric model (Bank of Canada

(1976))

     Inmodelling the effects of changes in the relative price of
raw materials and the real exchange rate, we choose to deal with a
three—sector model. Suppose that the three sectors of the economy
are: resource—based tradable goods (denoted by subscript R);
non—resource—based tradable goods (denoted by subscript NR); and
non—tradable goods including services (denoted by subscript NT)
We assume that wages are the same across sectors and do not
attempt to build a dynamic model of wage movements. Labour is the
only variable input in the resource—based and non—tradable goods

sectors,   hut both labour and resources are used in the
non—resource—based tradable goods sector.
     We assume that the law of one price holds for resources. If
the industry were characterized by perfect competition, then one

could write the supply function in logarithmic form as:
                                     51



     SR = a0 + al(pR_w) + a2kR                                   (11)



     where s      is the log of supply,

               k is the log of the capital stock,
               p is the log of the price, and
               w is the log of unit labour costs.


All the coefficients are positive. From the law of one price:


               + e



     where *    denotes a foreign variable, and
           e is the log of the exchange rate.



If there were oligopolistic elements in the industry, as there may
be in some mining industries and the newsprint industry, then the

reduced—form output equation may include foreign demand as well:


     SR = a0 + al(pR_w) + a2kR + a3y*                            (11')



     For the non—resource—based tradable goods industry (which we
define as manufacturing other than pulp and paper, wood and
primary metals) ,    prices   in the rest of the world are assumed to
depend on the costs of the two inputs, resources and labour:
                                                   52


             =                 (1_A)(w*)
        NR       Ap        +                                                 (12)




The domestic country's price equation is a modified

Dornbusch—Krugman equation that expresses domestic prices as a
weighted average of the foreign price and domestic costs:


        NR =     (pNe)           +
                                     (1o)(XpR       + (1—)w)                 (13)

             =             + (1_A)[cJ(w*+e) + (1—cY)wJ
                 APR                                                         (13')




This price equation implicitly defines supply behaviour. Foreign
demand is assumed to be of the form:


             =         +                       +
                 d0         dl(pN+e_pNR)            d2y*                    (14)




Thus from equations (12) ,                 (13')    and (14):



        dN = d0        +
                            d1(1_A)(1_cJ)(w*+e_w)          +
                                                               d2y*          (15)




which   relates foreign demand to the real exchange rate in terms of
unit labour costs (w*+e_w) .                  Domestic demand for domestically—
produced tradable goods will also be positively related to

(w*+e_w) , as well as to domestic real income, which will be a

function     of the terms of trade and foreign income y. If the two
                                     53



demands are summed, the reduced—form output of non—resource—based

tradables (q) will be a positive function of the real
exchange rate, foreign income, and (pR—w) if the latter acts as
a proxy for income gains resulting from improvements in the terms
of trade:28

         =
              q(w*+e_w, y, pRw)                             (16)




     Equilibrium in the market for non—tradable goods is assumed
to hold when demand, which is a function of real income (yr) and

the price of non—tradables relative to the price of tradables, is
equal to supply, which is a function of the capital stock and the
price of non—tradables relative to unit labour costs.


         =
             dNT(yr,   NTT =       sNT(kNT, PNTW)           (17)



In particular one might assume

     In the type of simple model proposed above we have neglected
a number of influences, particularly domestic monetary and fiscal

policy. We assume to a first approximation that these exert equal
impact on all sectors and so we concentrate on the ratios of

outputs in the various sectors (particularly since this is how one
can easily measure changes in the allocation of resources). Since

the effect of changes in relative prices on output is likely to

    equation, reduced form output would be an increasing
    function of yr and PNT—w.

dominate the effects of induced real income, the model predicts

that the ratio of output in resource industries to output in the

non—resource—based tradable goods industry would be related
directly to the price of resources relative to unit labour costs,

inversely to the real exchange rate and, with indeterminate sign,
to U.S. GNP. The ratio of the output of tradables to the output
of non—tradables is predicted to be directly related to the price
of resources relative to unit labour costs, the real exchange
rate, and U.S. GNP.3°
     In    the following sections, the preceding model is applied to

the Canadian economy during the period 1971—78. Specific emphasis
is placed on:


     —    The composition of industrial production between

          resource—based and non—resource—based industries.
     — The
           division of output between tradables and non—
          tradables.
     — The merchandise trade balance.

     —    Income distribution.
     —    Investment behaviour.




30. There may be a considerable asymmetry in the system, however,
    because in the short run the supply of tradables can drop
    considerably, but since it takes time to increase the
    capital stock, the supply cannot increase appreciably unless
    the economy is initially operating at low levels of capacity
    util ization.

     Particular attention is paid to three distinct sub—periods:
Period I       1972 Qi — 1974 Q2 — a period associated with a

               merchandise terms of trade improvement of 18 percent.
Period II      1974 Q3 — 1976 Q4 — a period associated with a

               lower terms of trade and a steady worsening of

               Canada's competitive position (in terms of relative
               unit labour costs)

Period III     1977 Q1 — 1978 Q4 — a period associated with a

               steady devaluation of the Canadian dollar and a

               steady improvement in Canada's competitive position.


4.1 The composition of industrial production between resource—
     based and non—resource—based industries
     A rise in the price of resources (raw materials) relative to
manufactured goods should cause output in resource—based

industries to increase more rapidly than in non—resource—based
industries —   not   only because the output price has risen for
resource industries but possibly because the foreign output price

for non—resource—based tradables may not have risen sufficiently
to cover the increased costs of the inputs of raw materials.

     By classifying forestry, mining, pulp and paper, wood and
primary metals as resource—based industries, and other

manufacturing as non—resource—based industry, one can then look at
the ratios of the real domestic product indices for these two

groups as presented in Figure 10.        In Figure 10 one can see the
increased relative output effect of the rise in the relative price
of raw materials in the 1972 Q4 — 1973 Q4 period. After that,

output in the resource—based industries declines relative to that
of other manufacturing. However, if one abstracts from the trend
decline in the output of resource—based industries relative to the
others one notes that production in resource—based industries (see
Figure 11), was above trend from 1972 Q4 to 1975 Qi, generally the
period that raw material prices were high relative to unit labour
costs (Figure 12). One reason for the downward trend in relative
outputs may be the low level of investment in many sectors of the

mining industry, where it appears it may often be more profitable

to establish new mines in developing countries rather than in
Canada.

     As raw material prices declined and manufacturing prices
increased, the ratio fell below trend from 1975 Q2 to 1976 Q3.
The loss of competitiveness defined in terms of unit labour costs

appears   to have affected the non—resource—based industries more
strongly in the 1976 Q4 — 1977 Q4 period, Similarly, the recovery
in competitiveness since then may have had more of an effect on

the production of non—resource—based goods.
     The model presented in the preceding section suggests that

the ratio of the output of resource—based industries (rdpres)

relative to that of non—resource—based tradable goods industries

(rdpnre) ,   should vary directly with the ratio of the price of
resources (proxied by the price of raw materials —— prm) to

domestic unit labour costs (w) , and inversely with the real

exchange rate (w*+e_w) ,   given prm and w.3- If the movement


31. Note that prm_w=prm*w*+w*4e_w* and thus holding the foreign
    relative price prm*_w* constant, the sign of the real
    exchange rate is indeterminate in the model.

in relative capital stocks is captured by a time trend, then we

can estimate the following equation for 1971 Qi — 1978 Q4:


     (t—statistics are in brackets)


     rdpres—rdpnre = .013 + .067(prm—w) — .003(TIME)
                       (.99)   (1.73)           (6.80)


        = .590    S.E.R. = .033        D.W. = .54



or, with correction for first—order correlation:


     rdpres—rdpnre = .019 + .0l0(prm—w) — .0042(TIME)
                       (.71) (.17)              (3.04)


       =   .762   R2 = .194    S.E.R. = .022        D.W. =   1.45


The real exchange rate variable did not enter significantly in
preliminary regressions and therefore was deleted. The evidence
is also very weak concerning the effect of the ratio of the price
of raw materials to domestic unit labour costs.

4.2 The division of output between tradable and non—tradable
     goods
     One can write the relative price of domestically—produced

tradables to non—tradables as:



       T" E ) E


       NT
                               61


where      Pp   is the domestic price of tradables (a

                geometrically weighted average of the price
                of resources and the price of non—resource—based
                tradables),
           E    is the exchange rate, and

           NT is the price of non—tradables.


If the law of one price holds, T= PT/E. However, in our

model we do not assume that this law holds for non—resource—based

tradable goods; thus T is only a major determinant of the
movements of Pp/E.

     The stylized facts for the 1970s are as follows: In Period   I,

T and PT/E were rising relative to NT with E showing
little variation; in Period II, P'p and Pp/E were falling

relative to NT and E was again exhibiting little change; and
in Period III, E was rising. Relative outputs moved as expected
given the changes in relative prices, with the output of tradables

rising relative to the output of non—tradables in Periods I and
III, and falling in Period II. These results are shown in Figure
13 using two different definitions for tradable goods. The first

definition encompasses forestry and mining as well as
manufacturing. In the second case we concentrate on manufacturing
alone.

     If foreign demand affects output directly in addition to its
impact via prices, then the growth in the U.S. economy in 1972—73

and 1977—78 likely contributed to the increased output of the

tradable goods sector in those years. The pattern of the U.S.
decline in 1974 and recovery in 1975—76 is not accurately mirrored
in the pattern of tradable goods production in Canada in the
1974—76 period, however, and thus cannot be the sole explanatory
variable.

     The theory presented above suggests that the ratio of

tradables production to non—tradables production (rdptra—rdpntr)
should be positively related to the price of raw materials

relative to unit labour costs, the real exchange rate (w*+e_w) and
U.S. GNP (gnp*) relative to trend.32 Since manufactured
goods constitute the majority of tradable goods, a similar

equation should hold for the split between manufactured (rdpman)

and non—manufactured goods (rdpnm). The following simple
regressions were estimated for 1971 Qi — 1978 Q4:


     rdptra—rdpntr = — 5.58 + .l09(prm—w) + .l33(w*+e_w)
                       (5.12) (4.18)        (2.09)
                         — .0083(TIME) +       •799(gnp*)
                              (6.63)           (5.13)


    P   = .654   2 = .773             S.E.R. = .010     D.W. = 1.58



     rdpman—rdpnm = — 4.80 + .092(prm—w) + .173(w*+e_w)
                      (4.13) (3.24)        (2.51)
                        —    .0051(TIME) + .685(gnp*)
                             (4.14)           (4.13)


     P = .715    R2 =       .640      S.E.R. = .010     D.W. = 1.43



32. Throughout, small letters denote logarithms.

        The equations strongly bear out the expected positive impacts
of increased raw materials prices and the real exchange

rate.33 In the second equation the coefficient on TIME is
approximately the negative of the coefficient on gnp* times the
trend increase per quarter in gflp*; thus only deviations in gnp*

from trend affect the output split. In the case of rdptra—rdpntr,
there    is a slight downward trend independent of the effect of the
trend in gflp*.

4.3     The merchandise trade balance
         The   merchandise trade balance (in volume terms) is
determined by       the difference between the domestic output of
tradables and the domestic demand for tradables. In this

preliminary study we have provided an explicit model only for the
output of tradables, leaving the domestic demand for tradables to
future research. One may note, however, that there is a
resemblance, however rough, between the path of the relative

output of tradable goods in Figure 13 and the constant dollar
merchandise trade balance in Figure 14.

        the extent that the domestic demand for tradables varies
        To

inversely with the ratio of tradable goods prices to wages, an
increase in the real exchange rate, i.e., a depreciation, should
both increase the supply of tradables and decrease the domestic

at the same time an exogenous terms of trade improvement causes
real income gains, these decreased demand effects may be partially

offset.

     The exogenous increase in the price of tradables relative to
the price of non—tradables led to a steady improvement in the

current dollar merchandise trade balance in Period I to a peak    of
$3.1 billion in 1974 Ql (see Figure 14). However, since Canada
had experienced real income gains because of the terms of trade

improvement, domestic demand for tradables outstripped the

increased output of tradables. Thus there was a steady worsening
of the constant dollar merchandise trade balance from $1.9 billion

in 1973 Ql to —$2.1 billion in 1974 Q2.
     Period II can be divided into three sub—periods. From
1974 Q3 — 1975 Ql, the constant dollar trade balance worsened from

—$2.4 billion to —$2.6 billion because of the appreciation of the

real exchange rate and the U.S. recession; the current dollar
trade balance deteriorated even more because of an exogenous
decline in the terms of trade. From 1975 Q2 — 1976 Qi, both the
current and constant dollar trade balances remained at very low
levels. Even though the relative output of tradables was falling

in 1976 Q2 — 1976 Q4, there was a slight improvement in both the
current and   constant   dollar trade balances, perhaps because of the

effect of the U.S. recovery.

     The 1977—78 period shows a significant response of the

constant dollar trade balance to the depreciation. The current

dollar trade balance did not improve as significantly because of a
                                     67



decline in the terms of trade which stemmed both from the
depreciation and a decline in the price of raw materials relative

to the price of manufactured goods.



4.4 Income distribution
     If output prices rise relative to the prices of variable
inputs, profits per unit of output will increase. Since Canada is
a net exporter of resources, a rise in the price of raw materials

relative to wages should increase profits. If the prices of
non—resource—based tradable goods are at least in part related to
foreign prices of such goods, which are in turn related to foreign

unit labour costs, profits will be positively related to the real
exchange rate. This can be derived in a more rigorous manner as
follows. Let P be the GNP deflator. From the nominal gross

national product identity:


     (P)(GNP) = PROFITS + WAGES       + MISCELLANEOUS


     i - PROFITS + WAGES    +   MISC
         (P)(GNP)  (P)(GNP)   (P)(GNP)



     PROFITS ——            MISC           W
                  1   —
     (P)(GNP)             (P)(GNP)


     where W is unit labour costs.
                                         68



Then, if the miscellaneous components to nominal GNP ratio follows
a time trend, a log—linear approximation to the above equation is

provided by


        —         = a +   bTIME + c(p—w)
            gnp


where small letters represent logarithms and IT is the log           of   real

corporate profits.
      The output price is a geometric weighted average of domestic
unit labour costs, foreign unit labour costs (in domestic
currency) and the price of raw materials. Thus


      p =   cw    + 3 (w*+e) +   (l—a—)prm
and
        —   gnp    = a + bTIME +   c'   (w*+e_w) +   c'   '(prm—w)



      where c' =       c   and c'' =    c(l—°—)


      Table 5 shows that with increasing relative prices of

tradable goods in Periods I and III, real profits (i.e., in terms

of the GNP deflator) both in manufacturing (as a proxy for

tradable goods) and in the economy as a whole, rose, whereas the

decreasing relative prices in Period III contributed to their

decline.34 The following regression was estimated for 1971
Qi — 1978 Q4:



34. The share of profits in GNP can be found in Table 7.

The signs are correct and the magnitudes in the expected range

(less than one) ,      but   the coefficient on the real exchange rate is

imprecisely estimated.
       The movement in the price of raw materials relative to unit

labour costs was the major contributing factor in the increase in

corporate profits from 9.0 percent of GNP in 1970 to 13.6 percent
of GNP in 1974. A worsening of competitiveness (a decrease in the
real  exchange rate) and a decline in the price of raw materials
relative to unit labour costs caused a decline in corporate
profits to 10.6 percent of GNP in 1976. The depreciation
(increase) of the nominal and real exchange rates caused a

recovery of profits to 11.2 percent of GNP in 1978.


4.5 Business fixed investment

       In modelling business fixed investment, we first suppose that
the desired capital stock depends on expected output and the
relative prices of capital and labour. We further suppose that
expected output is influenced by the current level and rate of

change   of output and the expected real exchange rate.             It is

35.   Corden (1977) has a good discussion of the effects of a
      depreciation on income distribution.
                                  71

likely that the rate of adjustment of the actual capital stock to
the desired capital stock will be influenced by the current rate

of capacity utilization and perhaps a corporate liquidity

variable, such as corporate profits.
      Given the large depreciation, both in nominal and real terms

over the 1977—78 period, and the resultant increase in the
production of tradable goods, and therefore, in the rate of

capacity utilization in the tradable goods industry, one would
have expected a significant increase in busines fixed investment

during 1978. However, such investment increased by only 1 percent
in 1978 over 1977, while real corporate profits increased by 14.4

percent, real domestic product (RDP) increased by 3.4 percent, and
the real exchange rate depreciated by 9 percent (see Table 6).

      A closer examination (see Table 7) does show that from the
very weak investment level in 1978 Q1, real investment steadily
increased by 8 percent over the course of the next four quarters.

Thus investment has been increasing, but perhaps not as quickly as
one would expect given the depressed level from which it was
starting (only in 1978 Q3 was the 1975 Q3 level surpassed)

      In the above sections of the paper we have discussed the

reasons for the depressed state of the tradable goods industry in
1975—76 (and hence of investment in the industry in the 1976—77

period) .   We   now turn to the possible reasons for the slow pick—up

in investment activity after the recovery in tradable goods
production in 1977—78:

(a)   Initially, output is increased through heightened short—run
productivity, then through the hiring of additional labour, and

then through new capital investment.
       Rates of capacity utilization in manufacturing did not begin

to pick up significantly until the second quarter of 1978. On an

over—all measure, capacity utilization was not exceptionally high
until the fourth quarter of 1978. Output had risen because of
increases in short—run productivity and the expanded hiring of

workers.

(b) There are long lags from the time of an increase in the
desired stock of capital until the new investment is put into

place.

       The severely depressed period that manufacturing industries
had come through in 1976—77 might have meant that expansion plans
were not ready. Much of the machinery and equipment needed is
produced to order and occasionally the waiting times until

delivery can be considerable.

(c)    There is much uncertainty over the permanence of the

depreciation.
       Discussions in some quarters concentrate on the effects of
movements in the nominal exchange rate alone on Canada's
competitive position instead of looking at all the factors that

affect the real exchange rate. There may still be a notion that
the Canadian dollar will perhaps return towards parity with the

u.s.   dollar.   If this   were the case then exporters would see their

gains in competitiveness as temporary and potential investment
would not seem as profitable. The longer that the exchange rate
remains at a depreciated level, however, the more likely it is
                               75



that the depreciation will be looked upon as permanent.
(d) A depreciation may cause a lower desired capital to labour
ratio since a high percentage of machinery and equipment is

imported.
      This consideration certainly cannot be overlooked from a

theoretical point of view, but we tend to think that it is
unimportant empirically, relative to the large changes in the
expected profitability of new investment.

(e)   Real corporate profits per unit of output were starting from
a very low level: balance sheets had to be "adjusted" before the
higher profits resulted in increased investment.

      There may be more jargon than theory involved here. If
projects are expected to be highly profitable, external financing
can be sought. However, it is true that during times of low
profitability, firms may run down their liquid assets because they

cannot borrow at what they perceive to be reasonable rates. Also,
stock prices were low when profits were low and so debt/equity

ratios increased. A run of profits may be necessary before firms

can return to their desired debt/equity ratio.

      Our over—all impression is that, particularly in the light of

the severe profit squeeze faced by the tradable goods industries

in 1975—76, one could expect the lags from the perceived increased
profitability of investment projects to the actual investment to

be long, perhaps longer than normal. This, in addition to any lag
in perception that the real depreciation is indeed likely to be
                                 76


permanent, may be enough to explain the small increase in
investment   activity in 1978.

                              APPENDIX
        FOUR EMPIRICAL MODELS OF THE EXCHANGE RATE: 1971—76



       In this Appendix we present a simple monetarist model, the
Haas—Alexander model, and two     other   models that are presently

available only in unpublished form. The following common notation
is used:



BB—OP —     The basic balance less official purchases of foreign

            exchange, measured in U.s. dollars.
BORR    —   Net long—term capital inflows relative to Canadian GNP.
BR      —   The Canadian Bank Rate less the U.S. discount rate.
CA      —   The Canadian current acccount balance.
D       —   Zero in the l950s float; one in the 1970s float.
F       —   The 30—day forward exchange rate.
GNBIA —     Gross Canadian new borrowing (issues sold abroad).
L       —   Net stock of Canadian short—term liabilities to
            foreigners (measured in U.s. dollars).
M       -   Ml.
MTB     —   Canadian merchandise trade balance.
P       —   Price   level (GNE deflator).
R       —   The 90—day interest rate (finance paper or

            commercial paper).
RES     —   Canadian stock of foreign exchange reserves.
RU      —   The rate of unemployment.
S       —   Spot exchange rate (Canadian dollars per U.S. dollar)
                                               78


se         —    Expected spot exchange rate:

                      =          =   .2342 + 1. 3542St_i —

                             —
                                 .2342(RESt/RESt1)


TOT    —        Canadian terms of trade (ratio of export to import
                prices)
W      —        Wealth.
Y      -        GNP.



In the following equations:
(a) small letters denote logarithms,
(b)   unstarrec3 variables are Canadian,
(c) starred variables are U.S., and
(d)   a UUtt superscript denotes unexpected.

Absolute values of t—statistics are in brackets.
