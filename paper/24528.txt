Do Opioids Help Injured Workers Recover and Get Back to Work? The Impact of Opioid
Prescriptions on Duration of Temporary Disability

                                           ABSTRACT

We estimate the effect of opioid prescriptions on the duration of temporary disability benefits
among workers with work-related low back injuries. We use local opioid prescribing patterns to
construct an instrumental variable that generates variation in opioid prescriptions but is arguably
unrelated to injury severity or other factors directly affecting disability duration. Local
prescribing patterns have a strong relationship with whether injured workers receive opioid
prescriptions, including longer-term prescriptions. We find that more longer-term opioid
prescribing leads to considerably longer duration of temporary disability, but there is little effect
of a small number of opioid prescriptions over a short period of time.

I. Introduction

        When used in accordance with evidence-based guidelines, opioids are an important tool for health

care professionals in their quest to provide compassionate and reasoned care. However, what began as a

well-intentioned effort to relieve undertreated pain has developed into an opioid crisis of epidemic

proportions (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2018). Aside from the direct adverse effects

of opioid use and addiction, there may be important consequences for key economic outcomes. Indeed,

some speculate that the rising use of opioids has contributed to the decline in U.S. labor force participation

of men (Krueger, 2017).

        While short-term opioid therapy can provide pain relief to some patients, the benefits of opioid

therapies must be weighed against risks of addiction development, abuse, or other potential side effects (see

the review in Noble et al., 2010). Evidence suggests that patients who receive multiple opioid prescriptions

or patients who are prescribed large daily doses are at greater risk of experiencing overdoses (Paulozzi et

al., 2012; Bohnert et al., 2011; Dunn et al., 2010; Franklin et al., 2005; Gomes et al., 2011). Opioid use is

associated with nonfatal overdose hospitalizations (Coben et al., 2010), increased likelihood of emergency

department visits (Braden et al., 2010), and historically has been a major cause of deaths from unintentional

poisoning (Paulozzi and Annest, 2007; Paulozzi, 2012).

        Opioid use is common among workers injured at work, with recent studies showing that more than

half of injured workers off work for more than seven days with pain medications who did not have surgery

received an opioid prescription, and many of them received opioids on a longer-term basis (Thumula et al.,

2017). This raises the question about the potential impact of opioid prescriptions on outcomes that workers

experience after an injury: Given the risks from opioids, are there nonetheless important benefits that might

make the tradeoff worthwhile? We focus on a key potential benefit from the point of view of workers’

compensation policy—the duration of temporary disability. Although some of the adverse effects of opioid

use would be expected to lengthen duration of temporary disability, there could also be some benefits, via

pain reduction, which enable faster return to work. To address this question, we use detailed workers’

compensation claims data to examine the relationship between multiple measures of opioid prescribing and

the time that injured workers spend on temporary disability benefits while recovering from an injury.


                                                       1
        Work-related injuries represent a substantial share of injuries that occur to working adults. Nearly

half of all trauma injuries to working adults were deemed to be work-related and were covered by workers’

compensation insurance, and one in five injuries for soft-tissue conditions were deemed work-related

(Victor et al., 2015). This suggests that opioid medications provided in the workers’ compensation system

are a non-trivial part of the prescribing to which working adults are exposed.

        Several studies establish a correlation between opioid prescribing and longer durations of

temporary disability benefits. However, this relationship could be non-causal, driven by prescribing of

opioids for more severe injuries that, independently, are associated with longer durations of disability.

While past studies tried to control for injury severity, unmeasured injury severity may be correlated with

both opioid prescribing and the duration of temporary disability. Moreover, opioid prescriptions may be a

marker for worker characteristics that result in longer time away from work unrelated to the actual opioids,

or, conversely, workers who want to return to work more quickly may choose to use opioids to speed up

their return to work. Thus, a causal analysis of the effects of opioid prescriptions on the duration of

disability is needed.

        In this paper, we use empirical methods designed to estimate the causal effect of opioid

prescriptions on the duration of disability. We rely on an instrumental variables (IV) approach that isolates

the variation in individual opioid prescriptions that is driven by local prescribing patterns, rather than by

individual characteristics, preferences, or decisions of workers (or their providers), such as injury severity

or desire for faster return to work. This strategy assumes that local prescribing patterns influence whether

an injured worker receives prescriptions for opioids, in a manner that is independent of the characteristics,

preferences, or decisions of workers or their providers that directly affect the duration of disability. Our

results reflect a combination of the effects opioids may have on the duration of disability because of

reductions in pain as well as the potential addictive nature of opioids—effects that presumably act in

opposite directions. We do not examine therapeutic, pain management effects of opioids.

        The assumption underlying our identification strategy is plausible because, given the rich controls

included in our models, we should account for injury severity and other sources of variation in the

propensity to return to work that could otherwise be correlated with both opioid prescribing and the


                                                       2
duration of temporary disability. Moreover, we present a number of supplemental analyses intended to

explore threats to the validity of our IV—and these analyses closely replicate our main results. That said,

one can never prove that an identifying assumption is valid, and we note possible remaining factors that

could raise questions about a causal interpretation of our IV estimates. Our evidence is non-experimental,

and hence how compelling this identification is rests on how one views the validity of our instrumental

variables research design, and the analyses we present exploring threats to this validity. Nonetheless, if one

is skeptical, our evidence is still informative about the associations between local opioid prescribing

patterns and the duration of temporary disability, and raises the question of what non-causal explanation

could otherwise account for the evidence.

        Finally, from the point of view of the local average treatment effect interpretation of IV estimates,

we believe the effect we identify off of variation in prescribing patterns is policy relevant. Presumably

policymakers can shape opioid prescribing patterns through a variety of policies; we discuss some of these

policies in the conclusion, although we do not yet have direct evidence of their effects on longer-term

prescribing in workers’ compensation.

        We examine several measures of opioid prescribing, but our most important empirical results

concern longer-term prescribing of opioids. We estimate the impact of opioid prescriptions on the duration

of temporary disability benefits, which are received for periods when workers cannot work while

recovering from injuries. The duration of temporary disability benefits is a proxy for the length of time

until return to work, and it is strongly correlated with this length of time, but is not identical. However, the

duration of temporary disability benefits can be measured in a very large sample available for analysis. It is

the standard return-to-work measure used in research on workers’ compensation, and the measure more

likely to co-exist with details on workers’ compensation claims such as the data we use.

        Our analysis focuses on claims for which the primary diagnosis is a low back injury, for several

reasons. Low back cases are quite common in the workers’ compensation system, 1 and prior research has



1
 Cases with spine sprains, strains, and non-specific pain cover between 11 and 19 percent of claims with more than
seven days of lost time across states included in the CompScope™ Benchmarks studies (Table TA.8b, Dolinschi and
Rothkin, 2017).

highlighted higher use of opioids for low back pain claims. 2 In addition, evidence-based treatment

guidelines recommend against long-term use of opioids for these cases—reserving opioid prescriptions for

the most severe cases and only for limited duration, 3 suggesting that some of the longer-term opioid

prescribing for this group of cases may be excessive. Finally, it is most straightforward to develop controls

for injury severity for a narrow group of injuries.

2. Prior Evidence on Opioid Prescribing in Workers’ Compensation

        Opioids prescribing for injured workers is common and varies widely across states. Thumula et al.

(2017) report that the percentage of nonsurgical claims with pain medications that had opioid prescriptions

varied from just over 50 percent to over 80 percent across 26 states, with 65 to 75 percent of workers who

had pain medications receiving at least one opioid prescription across most states, and 25 to 58 percent of

workers who had pain medications receiving two or more opioid prescriptions. 4 Longer-term prescribing of

opioids is quite common. Wang (2017) found that across 26 study states, between 4 and 18 percent of

workers with opioids received opioids on a longer-term basis, defined as having opioid prescriptions within

the first three months after an injury and three or more filled opioid prescriptions between the 7th and 12th

months after an injury (the same measure of longer-term opioids prescribing that we use). Both Thumula et

al. (2017) and Wang (2017) find recent decreases in opioid prescribing among nonsurgical cases, which

may be partly attributable to national, state, and local regulatory changes to combat opioid use and abuse,

including mandatory use of prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) by prescribers and

pharmacies, adoption of guidelines for prescribing opioids, regulation of pain clinics, implementation of

drug formularies, and requirements for continuing medical education on appropriate opioid prescriptions.

        Many studies found longer duration of temporary disability benefits for low back pain cases with

opioid prescriptions (Mahmud et al., 2000; Webster et al., 2007; Franklin et al., 2008; Volinn et al., 2009;

Shraim et al., 2015). These studies typically found stronger relationships with duration of temporary



2
  For example, estimates in Thumula et al. (2017) show higher use of any opioids and two or more opioids for low
back pain claims than in most other injury groups.
3
  See, for example, the discussion in Bigos et al. (1994) or Koes et al. (2001).
4
  Similarly, looking at cases with acute work-related low back pain in 2002–2003, Webster et al. (2009) found that the
percentage of cases with opioid prescriptions within the first 15 days after an injury varied from 6 percent in
Massachusetts to over 50 percent in South Carolina.

                                                          4
disability for larger numbers of prescriptions or amounts of opioids, longer-term filling of opioid

prescriptions, or more potent opioids (Schedule II versus Schedule III or IV). Similar evidence was also

reported for a broader sample of workers’ compensation cases (Gross et al., 2009). However, these studies

do not establish a causal link between opioid prescriptions and outcomes. Most of the studies were

primarily concerned with controlling for injury severity to try to compare disability durations for similar

injuries, which they did in different ways: focusing on a very narrow group of injuries (Mahmud et al.,

2000); controlling for condition severity with International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9)

coding (Webster et al., 2007; Shraim et al., 2015); controlling for the nature of the injury, body part, and

cause of injury (Swedlow et al., 2008; Gross et al., 2009); or controlling for medical severity ratings

derived from detailed medical records (Franklin et al., 2008).

          The central concern is that these studies do not account for correlations between unobserved

characteristics of workers, opioid prescribing, and return-to-work outcomes, and hence they may generate

biased estimates of the actual effects of opioids on disability duration. 5

3. Data

          Our analysis sample was derived from payment information on workers’ compensation claims—

the WCRI Detailed Benchmark/Evaluation (DBE) database. The DBE covers claims from national and

regional insurers (including residual market carriers), state funds, and self-insured employers (from their

third-party administrators). We extract data on workers, employers, injury characteristics, opioid

prescriptions, and duration of temporary disability benefits. Data on opioid prescriptions and duration of

benefits is based on payors’ records on payments made within 24 months after an injury. 6 The analysis

includes workers injured between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2013, 7 in the 28 states covered in the




5
  Some studies directly acknowledge this problem. For example, Franklin et al. (2008) state that “the correlational
nature of this study precludes the ability to draw causal inferences concerning the role of early opioid prescription. It
is possible that early opioid prescription is a marker for other patient or health care provider characteristics or
behaviors that might play roles in development of long-term disability” (p. 203). And Mahmud et al. (2000) state
explicitly that their study only “documented associations between certain initial clinical management factors and
disability duration. It was not possible to determine whether this association was causal in either direction” (p. 1,186).
6
  Our results are robust to using data at 12, 36, or 48 months of maturity (results available upon request).
7
  We define injury year 2009 (for example) as claims arising from October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2009.

DBE database. 8 These states represent over 80 percent of benefits paid (Sengupta et al., 2014).

Sample of Workers with Low Back Injuries

         Our sample is restricted to claims for which a low back condition was a primary diagnosis code on

at least two eligible physician office visits that occurred prior to invasive treatment (surgery or injection),

within the first year of an injury (following Yee et al., 2015). 9 The office visit criterion ensures that the

sample includes workers who were diagnosed with low back injuries prior to receiving extensive treatment

for such injuries, to avoid “diagnosis bias” resulting from providers selecting diagnosis codes that justify

their medical treatment. We further limit our sample to cases where more than two-thirds of the office visits

included a low back injury diagnosis, to increase the likelihood that our cases are predominantly low back

injuries. Finally, our study is restricted to claims with more than seven days of lost time. 10 About 4 percent

of all claims with more than seven days of lost work time satisfied our criterion for a low back pain

condition and, among these, our criterion for office visits.

Opioid Prescription Measures

         Information on opioid prescriptions comes from detailed prescription transaction data collected from

workers’ compensation payors and their medical bill review and pharmacy benefit management vendors. 11

We capture opioid prescriptions that workers filled, which were paid for by workers’ compensation payors.

We cannot measure whether workers take opioids, nor can we observe prescriptions filled outside the

workers’ compensation system. Prescription information is not available for every claim. For low back

injuries with more than seven days of lost work time, about 27 percent did not have information on filled

prescriptions, even though we would expect most injured workers in our sample to receive a prescription for

a non-narcotic analgesic. 12 Since we cannot be certain about the nature of the drug therapy when prescription

   We impose this condition to eliminate differences across states in waiting periods for the receipt of temporary
disability benefits. (Some states have waiting periods of fewer than seven days, but none have longer waiting periods.)

12
   We suspect that some workers in this group may have been prescribed common pain relievers that they already had
in their medicine cabinet, so they did not fill a prescription at the pharmacy. Other workers may have used their group

information is missing, the analysis sample includes only claims with filled prescriptions. 13

         We focus on longer-term opioid prescriptions, but also explore other measures, listed in the bottom

panel of Table 1. Some of these claims only had non-opioid pain medications, muscle relaxants, or other

non-pain medications; other claims may have received opioids for a short period of time; while other

claims may have received opioids on a longer-term basis. About 71 percent of workers in our sample

received at least one opioid prescription within 24 months after an injury during the study period. The other

29 percent received only prescriptions for non-opioid pain medications, prescriptions for muscle relaxants,

or other non-pain medications.

         Our measure of longer-term opioid prescribing captures workers who had opioid prescriptions

within the first three months after an injury and later had three or more filled opioid prescriptions between

the 7th and 12th months after an injury (following Wang, 2017). About 12 percent of workers with low

back injuries in our sample had longer-term opioid prescriptions. Table 1 also reports the shares of workers

with multiple opioid prescriptions but not longer-term prescriptions per this definition. Nearly 40 percent of

workers had two or more prescriptions but not longer-term prescriptions, and 28 percent had three or more

prescriptions but not longer-term opioid prescriptions.

Outcome: Duration of Temporary Disability Benefits

         Our outcome is the number of weeks of temporary disability benefits that workers receive within

24 months after an injury. 14,15 Workers receive temporary disability benefits while they are away from


health insurance to fill their first few prescriptions. Since we examine the sample of injured workers with a diagnosis
related to the lumbar region of the spine, it is hard to imagine that these claims had no medications prescribed.
13
   This has two implications. First, the sample of workers with prescriptions may be skewed toward costlier and more
severe cases. Second, some individuals classified as not receiving prescriptions may have received prescriptions via
group health, in which case our estimated effects of opioid prescriptions would be understated if the cases without
prescription information were included in the analysis sample and coded as not having opioid prescriptions.
14
   We calculate weeks of temporary disability benefits by dividing temporary disability payments that each worker
received by the worker-specific weekly benefit rate. In fewer than 1 percent of cases, there were missing data on the
wage or benefit rate, in which case we divided by the state average benefit rate.
15
   We collect information about both opioid prescribing and duration of temporary disability benefits over the same
period of time—24 months after an injury. This raises the possibility that some workers filled opioid prescriptions
after their temporary disability was over, which may raise concerns about Hill’s temporality condition (Hill, 1965).
However, this is unlikely to be a concern with regard to our findings. First, while it is possible that some injured
workers refilled opioid prescriptions after the end of temporary disability benefits, it is unlikely that they started their
opioid prescription only after the end of temporary disability. This is even less likely for longer-term prescribing—our
main focus—because the average duration for workers with longer-term prescriptions was 52 weeks. Reinforcing this
conclusion, we find similar results when we narrow our observation window to only 12 months after an injury.


                                                             7
work recovering from an injury. The temporary disability benefits often end when workers return to work,

when they are released to work by their doctor, when they reach maximum medical improvement, or when

they receive permanent partial disability benefits and/or a lump-sum settlement.

        Rules about how temporary disability benefits end vary across states. For instance, duration of

temporary disability benefits is typically longer in states with wage-loss benefit systems since these states

do not shift workers to permanent partial disability payments when workers achieve permanency in their

condition, but instead workers often continue receiving temporary disability benefits. 16 We therefore

compare duration of temporary disability within each state, where the same rules and procedures for

determining temporary disability benefits apply; we do this by estimating models with state fixed effects.

        The duration of temporary disability benefits does not exactly reflect the duration of time that

workers were away from work. For example, temporary disability benefits may end when workers start

receiving permanent partial disability benefits or when workers choose to settle their claim. In some states,

temporary disability benefits may be terminated while workers resolve disputes about ability to return to

work or disputes about their remaining impairment. 17 Finally, the ultimate duration of time off work may

not be observed for claims that remain open.

Other Controls

        We control for a rich set of covariates that could affect the duration of temporary disability

benefits. For example, older workers are less likely to return to work, and workers in some industries (such

as construction) may have unique return-to-work problems (Galizzi and Boden, 1996). We include the

following worker controls in our regression models: age, gender, marital status, tenure at the time of injury,

and preinjury wages. Workplace characteristics include firm’s payroll size and dummy variables




Finally, if opioid prescriptions help workers improve return to work, it would be inappropriate to exclude from the
analysis prescriptions that happened after the end of disability.
16
   In wage-loss systems, the benefit rate reflects the difference between current earnings and what workers earned
before their injury.
17
   We exclude from our sample cases with no temporary disability benefits that later received permanent partial
disability/lump-sum payments. These cases are likely disputes about compensability that were later paid as a lump-
sum settlement. We also exclude from the sample fewer than 1 percent of cases where the number of weeks of
temporary disability duration was unreasonably high, i.e., greater than the 104 weeks that we can expect with 24
months of maturity data.

distinguishing industries and occupations based on injury risk. 18

         Characteristics of the local labor market may also affect how long workers stay out of work. We

control for the county unemployment rate 19 and residence in a rural zip code. 20 We also control for two

other characteristics of the population that may affect ability to work—the percentage of residents with less

than a high school degree at the Primary Care Service Area (PCSA) level, 21 and the percentage of residents

who were disabled at the county level. 22

         We developed controls for injury severity specific to the low back conditions we study. 23 Our

controls categorize injury severity based on the diagnosis and the treatment that workers received. For

surgical cases, we developed a severity scoring system based on the intensity and extent of treatment that

workers received. This improves on approaches in prior studies that controlled for nature of injury, body

part, and cause of injury (Swedlow et al., 2008; Gross et al., 2009), or controlled for broad categories of

condition severity reflected in ICD-9 coding (Webster et al., 2007; Shraim et al., 2015).

         The idea behind our approach is that the extent of surgical intervention reflects the potential

severity of the injury that workers experience—more extensive procedures may reveal more severe injuries.

Taking into account medical bill level information about medical procedures and diagnostic codes, our

scoring system assigns points based on different types of surgical procedures (discectomy/decompression,

fusion, or both); number of levels operated on (one, two, or more than two); and number of procedures


18
   These include high-risk services, low-risk services, clerical/professional occupations (regardless of industry),
manufacturing, construction, trade, and other industries (see Dolinschi and Rothkin, 2017).

   Less-educated workers likely face many fewer jobs for which they are qualified.

   These last two measures are derived from Area Resource Files. The zip code to PCSA crosswalks used to construct
our data were obtained from The Dartmouth Atlas, which is funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the
Dartmouth Clinical and Translational Science Institute, under award number UL1TR001086 from the National Center
for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). See

the 2010–2014 American Community Survey (ACS) Summary File.
23
   We rely on these severity controls to avoid pitfalls from using ICD-9 based controls from administrative records for
subgroups of low back pain injuries, which may arise due miscoding or diagnosis-related group “creep” (Guller,
2006). Prior studies showed that using ICD-9 based groups to characterize spinal disorders was unreliable when
studying outcomes (Faciszewski et al., 1995, 1997, 2003), potentially reflecting lack of consistency in diagnosis
coding for spine conditions. Nonetheless, results from sensitivity tests with controls for ICD-9 based low-back pain
injury groups were not materially different from the estimates we report.

(one, two, or more than two). This measure ranges from zero to nine points, with more complex treatments

having a larger number of points. 24 Nonsurgical cases have zero points, but have separate controls for a

three-way classification based on intensity of treatments: cases with medications only; cases with

medications and physical therapy only; and cases with medications, physical therapy, and injections. 25 The

use of separate controls for surgical and nonsurgical severity is equivalent to interacting severity controls

with surgery and non-surgery indicator variables. We also control for whether there was a surgery or an

early MRI.

         Yijst is duration of temporary disability for worker i, in area j of state s, in year t. 26 OPSCRIPijst is

the opioid measure of interest. Xijst is a vector of control variables. YRt is a vector of year fixed effects, and

STs is a vector of state fixed effects. To be clear, we are estimating the effect of opioid prescriptions

relative to treatments that do not involve opioid prescriptions (or, in some specifications, receive either no

or shorter-term prescriptions), which of course can include other, non-opioid prescriptions.

         We first estimate equation (1) using ordinary least squares (OLS). This approach provides

descriptive evidence on the associations between opioid prescriptions and duration of temporary disability.

However, these associations may reflect unobserved worker and/or injury characteristics that are correlated

with both opioid prescriptions and duration. We think there are most likely two kinds of unmeasured

characteristics of workers/injuries that can lead to biased estimates of the causal effects of opioid

prescriptions. First, opioid prescriptions can be associated with unmeasured differences in injury severity

that directly affect duration of temporary disability benefits, leading the OLS estimate of β to overstate the

results were insensitive to introducing separate dummy variables for each value of this measure.

extent to which opioid prescriptions inhibit return to work (increase the duration of disability). 27 Second,

opioid prescriptions can be associated with unmeasured differences in propensity to return to work quickly.

We do not know, a priori, the direction of this association and hence the direction of bias from this

unmeasured propensity. If, for example, workers who have a higher propensity to return to work are also

more likely to fill opioid prescriptions (conditional on the other controls), because they use opioids to help

ease return to work, then OLS estimates can understate the negative effect of opioids on duration of

disability. Alternatively, workers less prone to return to work after an injury may seek opioid prescriptions,

in which case the bias would overstate the extent to which opioid prescriptions inhibit return to work.

Instrumental Variable Approach

         Our IV approach attempts to purge the estimates of the impact of unmeasured injury severity or

propensity to return to work and, hence, to obtain unbiased (formally, consistent) estimates of the causal

effects of opioid prescriptions. 28 This approach requires an exogenous source of variation that affects

opioid prescriptions but does not affect temporary disability duration except via its influence on

prescriptions. Our IV is local area prescribing patterns (OPLOCAL). 29 For each individual observation we

determine local area prescribing rates based on low back cases in an area (indexed by j). The opioid

prescription rate for injured worker i in area j (in state s) in year t is based on all workers in area j,

excluding individual i (we denote the number of observations in area j (in state s and year t) as Njst). Thus,



27
   While we believe we improve on the measures of injury severity used in past studies, we cannot be sure that our
measures fully capture injury severity.
28
   We use two-stage least squares (2SLS). We do not estimate duration models that are sometimes used to examine
spells of time away from work that are not fully observed (censored). Instrumental variables approaches are
considerably more complicated with duration data that could be censored (e.g., Bijwaard, 2009). Our results are not
sensitive to potential censoring concerns; the results change little when we use duration of temporary disability
measured at 36 or 48 months after an injury. Since we use a natural logarithm of temporary disability duration, our
approach (in the absence of censoring) is essentially a log-linear model that can be interpreted as a proportional hazard
model with a constant hazard for leaving disability (shifted by the independent variables).
29
   There is another potential reason to be concerned about obtaining spurious evidence of a causal effect of longer-
term opioids prescriptions from OLS estimation of equation (1). There could be a somewhat mechanical relationship
between long disability durations and longer-term opioids prescriptions because longer-term prescriptions are less
likely to be written when temporary disability ends quickly. In fact, the relationship is not this deterministic. For
example, in our sample about 11 percent of workers with longer-term opioid prescriptions had durations of less than
11 weeks, and about 20 percent had durations of less than 20 weeks. Conversely, 7 percent of workers without any
opioid prescriptions had durations of temporary disability exceeding 40 weeks. Of course, the IV approach addresses
this concern; there is no reason the HRR-level of long-term opioid prescribing would be mechanically or
deterministically associated with long duration of temporary disability for an individual.

         It is typical to interpret IV estimates as local average treatment effects that put the most weight on

effects for those whose opioid prescription variation is driven by variation in the local prescription patterns

(the “compliers”). In our view, this is a strength of the IV that we use, because variation in prescribing

patterns across areas is the type of variation that policymakers seem likely to be able to influence via

policies regulating prescriptions of opioids in workers’ compensation cases. We discuss examples of these

policies below when we interpret our estimates.

         We define local areas using Hospital Referral Regions (HRRs) developed by the Dartmouth

Atlas. 32 We use HRRs as the geographic unit for defining prescribing patterns because they provide a high

percentage of within-area prescriptions relative to other possible geographic measures we could use, while

allowing for variability in prescriptions across parts of the state. About 74 percent of filled prescriptions for

opioids were prescribed by physicians with offices in the same HRR as the worker’s residence (and another

14 percent were in a different HRR in the same state). Other definitions of geographic areas, such as

CBSAs, produced considerably lower percentages of prescriptions that were prescribed within the same

area as workers’ residences. We only use observations that are in areas with at least 15 observations within

each HRR and year combination for creating the IV. Our sample of states includes 219 HRRs, some of

which cross state lines. Given that we exploit variation in opioids prescribing rates at the HRR level, all

standard errors we report are clustered at the HRR level.



30
   Excluding individual i from this estimation avoids creating a mechanical correlation between the instrument and
individual opioid prescriptions—variation that would not be purged of unmeasured injury severity or propensity to
return to work.
31
   Note that OPLOCALijst is based on the observed surgical and nonsurgical mix of cases. We want the prescribing
pattern measure to reflect only the variation in prescriptions for the same kind of treatment, so that it should also
reflect the case mix. We use the same definition of opioid prescriptions (listed in Table 1) for both OPSCRIP and
OPLOCAL, depending on the opioid prescribing measure for which we are estimating the specification.
32
   These areas are determined based on use of medical services by Medicare patients. The Dartmouth Atlas divides the
United States into 3,436 distinct hospital service areas (HSAs); the areas are defined so that Medicare patients living
in an HSA get the majority of their health care from hospitals within the area. These areas are then grouped into 306
HRRs. For each claim, we determined the HRR from the zip code associated with the claim, based on the worker’s zip
code of residence. When an injured worker’s zip code of residence was missing, we used the zip code of the injured
worker’s employer. If both of those zip codes were missing, we used the zip code of the first physician office visit for
the injured worker. If all three were missing, we used the zip code in which the injury occurred.

                                                                  12
         Opioid prescribing patterns at the HRR level vary—often dramatically—within states. Figure 1

provides information on the distribution of longer-term opioid prescribing rates for our analysis sample.

The figure displays the minimum, maximum, and average across HRRs for each state in our sample. We

observe substantial variation in the rates of longer-term opioid prescribing both across and within across

states. For example, areas with the highest rates of longer-term opioid prescriptions within each state had,

on average, 30 percentage point higher rates of longer-term opioids than areas with the lowest prescribing

rates.

Instrument Validity

         One condition for the validity of the instrument is that it strongly predicts whether workers

received opioids (i.e., instrument relevance). We present evidence of strong predictive power of the IV

below. The second condition for a valid instrument is that the IV is not correlated with unobserved claim or

claimant characteristics that affect the duration of disability (such as unobserved injury severity or

propensity for return to work), conditional on the controls. We cannot directly test this exclusion

restriction. We do, however, present a number of analyses below that bolster this assumption, but we

cannot, of course, prove that the exclusion restriction holds.

         Variation in the instrument reflects prescribing patterns for all other workers (excluding the

individual) within the same HRR with low back injuries, which should be driven by the treatment patterns

followed by doctors within the local area, for other patients. It seems unlikely that prescription patterns for

other workers in the same local area would be correlated with an individual worker’s duration of disability,

conditional on their own opioid prescriptions. Nonetheless, there are possible reasons the exclusion

restriction could be violated. In principle, workers could somehow be sorted across high- and low-

prescription areas in a way that generates a correlation between prescribing patterns and unobserved injury

severity or propensity for return to work. However, this seems unlikely given our extensive controls. For

example, although particular areas could have overrepresentation of specific industries and, hence, injuries

that are correlated with both prescribing patterns and the duration of disability, we control for industry and

injury severity. Some areas may have an older workforce, and age could influence both prescribing patterns

and the duration of disability, but we control for workers’ ages. Moreover, none of these possibilities


                                                      13
explain why local prescribing patterns should matter once we condition on the individual worker’s opioid

prescriptions.

        Yet another dimension of sorting is the local variation in surgery rates for similar industries,

workers, etc. But we control for treatment variation and the case mix. Local labor market conditions could

also matter. For example, weak labor markets could create longer disability durations and perhaps also be

associated with more opioid use or abuse. To address this, we control for county-level unemployment rates

and the percentage of workers with less than a high school education. There could also be regional

variation in comorbidities that affect disability durations and are correlated with opioid prescriptions. But

this should be accounted for by our control for county-level variation in the percentage of disabled workers.

        It is possible, in principle, that workers strategically move to HRRs with higher rates of opioid

prescriptions when they are more likely to use (or want to use) opioids. But this source of mobility appears

unlikely given the size of the local areas that we chose for our analysis.

        A potentially more challenging possibility is that workers with a greater need for opioids may

gravitate to the high-prescribing doctors within an HRR. This would result in higher average prescribing

rates in areas where workers want to use a lot of opioids (even if the distribution of doctors by “innate”

prescribing rates—i.e., what we would observe, hypothetically, prior to this sorting—is the same in each

HRR). We address this concern by exploring variation in prescribing patterns measured at the physician

level rather than the worker level. In particular, we give each provider in an area equal weight when

constructing local area prescribing rates to avoid, say, inflating the local prescribing pattern in HRRs

where, over the course of treatment, workers gravitate to high-prescribing providers. We show, below, that

our results are robust to this alternative specification of the IV (and to using another closely related

approach). We believe that this additional evidence indicates that doctor shopping does not drive the

results. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that doctor shopping is reflected in the first provider a

worker visits—perhaps based on a priori information from other workers about which providers are more

likely to write opioid prescriptions. Thus, while our evidence makes it less likely that doctor shopping

drives our results and renders our estimates non-causal, we cannot decisively rule this out.

        Another potential issue that could undermine the validity of the IV is if physicians who prescribe


                                                       14
opioids also use other practices that lead to longer durations of disability. We cannot rule this possibility

out, although we think this problem is likely minor. First, if we were just using physician-level prescribing

as the IV, the IV could well be correlated with other physician practices. However, we are using HRR-level

prescription variation, and there is less reason to believe that individual-level treatment (aside from opioid

prescribing) varies with HRR-level opioid prescribing. Second, variation in other practices that is correlated

with opioid prescribing is not problematic if the other practices are ultimately driven by opioid prescribing

behavior. In that case, accounting for these other physician practices would be overcontrolling (controlling

for variation in opioid prescribing). Third, we control for surgery—a key difference in practice—and also

estimate separate models for surgical and non-surgical cases. Finally, we suspect that physician practices

have more to do with short-term rather than longer-term opioid prescriptions, and our key findings concern

longer-term prescriptions. 33

5. The Effects of Opioid Prescriptions

Descriptive Statistics

        Table 1 provides descriptive statistics on opioid prescriptions and claim outcomes, for various

measures of opioid prescriptions: whether workers had any opioid prescriptions in the 24 months after an

injury, the number of opioid prescriptions excluding longer-term use, and longer-term prescribing of

opioids. The first row shows that the average duration of temporary disability benefits was about 15 weeks

longer for claims where workers had any opioid prescriptions. The differences were still large, although

less pronounced in absolute terms, for median duration.

        Columns (4)-(7) indicate that the differences in measures of temporary disability duration were

driven primarily by workers with multiple opioid prescriptions, and more so by workers with longer-term

opioid prescriptions. Looking first at prescription counts and excluding longer-term use, we observe a

relatively small difference in duration (1 week) between workers with one prescription and workers with no

prescriptions. Workers with two prescriptions had 6 weeks longer duration (about a 50 percent difference),

and workers with three or more prescriptions had nearly 20 weeks longer duration (almost three times the



33
  Schnell and Currie (2017) document that doctors from higher-ranked medical schools, in the same specialty, etc.,
write fewer opioid prescriptions by provider, but do not have data on number of prescriptions per patient.

                                                         15
duration of workers with no prescriptions). However, we find much longer duration of temporary disability

for those with longer-term opioids, for whom average duration was nearly a year (51.6 weeks). These

statistics imply that it is important to separately examine the effects of more-intensive prescribing of

opioids, and not just any opioid prescriptions versus no opioid prescriptions. 34

        The lower panel of Table 1 reports additional information on opioid prescriptions, including the

distribution of observations by number of prescriptions and longer-term prescribing. The last two columns

show that outcomes and opioid prescribing varied substantially between surgical and nonsurgical cases.

Surgical cases had longer duration of temporary disability benefits (51 weeks, versus 19 weeks for

nonsurgical cases). Surgery is also strongly associated with opioid prescriptions—95 percent of surgical

cases had at least one prescription, and one-third of workers with surgeries had longer-term opioid

prescriptions. This difference is why we control in our models for whether a case is surgical or nonsurgical,

and let the local prescribing patterns reflect the surgical/nonsurgical mix at the HRR level. We also take

this one step further and estimate separate models for the two types of cases.

Effects of Opioid Prescriptions on Duration of Temporary Disability: OLS Estimates

        Table 2 reports OLS estimates that adjust for differences between claims based on characteristics

of workers, employers, injuries, and workers’ compensation systems. We show estimates using an

increasingly detailed set of controls. Specification 4 provides the most compelling evidence among the

OLS regressions, as it includes the controls for injury severity, worker characteristics, workplaces, and

location. Comparing the estimates for the prior specifications is informative about the partial correlations

among disability duration, opioid prescriptions, and the control variables. Since we estimate models for log

duration, the estimates approximately reflect the percentage change in the duration of temporary disability

for a one-unit change in the independent variables, although the approximation can be far from exact for

the kinds of large estimates we obtain here. For example, the estimate of 84.8 in the first column

(Specification 1) implies that the duration of temporary disability benefits was 133.5 percent higher when

workers had at least one opioid prescription than when workers had no opioid prescriptions (base category),


34
 Workers with only one prescription may include many workers who filled prescriptions but did not use them, or
who used them short-term but quickly curtailed their use.


                                                       16
for otherwise comparable claims, as shown in the second row of the table. 35 The estimates in Table 2

closely parallel what has been done in past research on opioid prescribing and duration of disability.

         While the estimates in Table 2 consistently point to a positive correlation between any opioid

prescriptions and duration of temporary disability benefits, conditional on the controls, the estimates are

sensitive to which controls we include. Going from Specification 1, with the fewest controls, to

Specifications 3 and 4, with the most controls, reduces the strength of the positive relationship between any

opioid prescriptions and duration of disability by about two-thirds (in terms of the percentage effect). Yet

the association remains positive and strongly statistically significant; in Specification 4, with all the

controls, we estimate that workers with any opioid prescriptions had a 42.9 percent longer duration of

temporary disability benefits than workers without opioid prescriptions. Given the mean duration of 11.3

weeks for workers with no opioids (Table 1), this is an increase of about 4.8 weeks. The table also shows

that workers with more severe injuries had long disability durations, as we would expect, and were also

more likely to receive opioids, so controlling for severity reduces the association between any opioid

prescriptions and disability duration. 36

The Role of Local Prescribing Patterns

         Before turning to the IV results, we present estimates of our first-stage regressions relating opioid

prescriptions at the individual level to local prescribing patterns—which provide our instrumental variables.

The predictive power of local prescribing patterns has to be strong for the empirical strategy to be

informative about the true effects of opioid prescribing patterns on duration of disability.



35
   Note that we have multiplied the estimated coefficients by 100 to express them as percentages. The 0.848
coefficient estimate, when multiplied by 100, provides an approximate percentage effect (84.8), but this
approximation is much more accurate for smaller estimates. A more precise estimate of the percentage change comes
from taking the coefficients reported in the table (from equation (1), β∙OPSCRIP), and computing 100∙{exp(β
∙OPSCRIP/100)−1}; using this calculation, the 84.8 estimate, for example, implies a 133.5 percent change. The
standard error of the implied percentage effect (not reported, but used to compute significance levels) is computed
from a first-order approximation to this function using the Delta method. The table also reports estimated coefficients
for some of the controls; full model estimates are available from the authors upon request.
36
   The injury severity measures are strongly correlated with the duration of temporary disability benefits. For instance,
for surgical cases, one additional point (one extra modality during a surgery) on the severity score is associated with
12 percent longer duration of temporary disability benefits. For nonsurgical cases, we found that cases that had
medications and physical therapy services only, when compared with cases with only medications, had much longer
duration of temporary disability. Nonsurgical cases that had medications, physical therapy, and injections had far
longer duration of temporary disability benefits than nonsurgical cases with only drugs.


                                                           17
         Table 3 provides estimates from the first-stage regressions, including the full set of controls from

Specification 4 in Table 2. The evidence indicates—in the first panel of the table—that the IV passes this

test for the estimation of the effect of receiving any opioid prescriptions. The estimate implies that a 10

percentage point increase in the local area opioid prescribing rate of any opioids is associated with a 3.4

percentage point higher likelihood that injured workers with low back injuries will have any opioid

prescriptions. 37 The F-statistic on the first-stage regression is very large (107).

         The remaining panels of the table report estimates of first-stage models for the different measures

of opioid prescriptions we use in subsequent analyses. Each case uses the local prescribing pattern that

corresponds to the individual-level prescription measure. We find that, regardless of the definition of opioid

prescribing, local prescribing patterns are strongly predictive of individual prescription patterns, with

injured workers in areas with higher prescribing rates significantly more likely to receive opioid

prescriptions.

         Note that the results in Table 3, in addition to helping validate our research method, provide

interesting information on the extent to which opioid prescriptions vary across local markets, even for

workers with the same measured injury severity, surgical mix, etc. We do not claim to know all of the

sources of variation in prescribing patterns across HRRs. But we would suggest that this variation points to

differences in prescribing behavior that can be shaped by workers’ compensation policy and opioids policy

more generally. And the strong relationships between local prescribing patterns and individual opioid

prescribing imply that policy-induced reductions in prescribing in high-prescription areas could

substantially reduce opioid prescriptions.

Effects of Opioid Prescriptions on Duration of Temporary Disability: Instrumental Variable Estimates

         Panel A of Table 4 presents the 2SLS estimates of the effect of any opioid prescriptions and

provides a comparison with the OLS estimates from Table 2. Again, we use specifications including the


37
   The local prescribing pattern is measured as a proportion from zero to one, and the dependent variable is either zero
or one, so that a 10 percentage point increase in the local prescribing pattern has an effect on the probability of any
opioid prescription equal to one-tenth of the estimated coefficient. Prior studies suggest that physicians play an
important role in shaping opioid prescribing patterns. For instance, Barnett et al. (2017) documented large differences
in opioid prescribing patterns across physicians even within the same hospital. As noted earlier, Schnell and Currie
(2017) also documented that physicians’ education is strongly associated with opioid prescription patterns.


                                                          18
full set of controls from Specification 4 in Table 2. 38

         Once we correct for the endogeneity of prescriptions or correlations with unobserved injury

severity, we find little evidence of a relationship between whether a worker received any opioid

prescriptions and duration of temporary disability. The 2SLS estimate (4.5) is close to zero and statistically

insignificant. Although the estimates in Panel A of Table 4 suggest that opioid prescriptions do not lead to

longer duration of disability, the specification based on any opioid prescriptions combines effects of short-

term use (only one prescription) and multiple prescriptions or longer-term prescriptions. Thus, we next

explore the effects of opioid prescriptions using different ways to characterize prescriptions. After

discussing this more complete set of results, we will return to the issue of interpreting differences between

the OLS and 2SLS estimates.

         Since the analysis in Tables 2 and 4 is based on one or more opioid prescriptions, we first turn to

examining how the results change if we estimate, instead, the effect of having two or more, or three or

more, opioid prescriptions. Both OLS and 2SLS estimates for these specifications are reported in Panel B

of Table 4, again for the specification including the full set of controls. The 2SLS estimates in Panel B

suggest that the impact of opioids varies with the number of prescriptions that workers filled. Cases with

three or more prescriptions, when compared with cases with no prescriptions, had longer duration of

temporary disability benefits, by 52 percent. This evidence, coupled with the weaker evidence of an effect

for two or more versus no prescriptions (a statistically insignificant 20.2 percent longer duration), suggests

that the results for any opioids in Panel A hide substantial differences across different numbers of

prescriptions, and that the effect of opioids on disability duration may arise only for workers with multiple

prescriptions.

         In Panel C, we report estimates for similar specifications, but now excluding from the set of

observations those who had longer-term prescriptions, as defined earlier. In this case, we no longer find

evidence of an effect of multiple opioid prescriptions on the duration of disability; the estimated

coefficients are closer to zero and not statistically significant.



38
  We report only the estimated coefficients of the opioid prescribing variable; full model estimates are available upon
request.

                                                           19
        The differences between the results in Panels B and C of Table 4 suggest that it is longer-term

opioid prescriptions that are responsible for longer durations of temporary disability. Panel D provides

direct evidence of this, showing model estimates where we now characterize workers by whether they had

longer-term opioid prescriptions. The 2SLS estimates in Panel D point to a strong effect of longer-term

opioid prescribing on the duration of temporary disability benefits; workers with longer-term opioid

prescriptions had durations of temporary disability that were 251 percent longer—or more than triple the

duration of similar workers, with similar injuries, without opioid prescriptions.

Interpreting the Magnitudes

        Our empirical analysis is intended to estimate the causal effects of opioid prescriptions. One can

interpret the individual-level estimates as the effect of a policy change that eliminated, for example, longer-

term opioid prescriptions. However, from a policy perspective we might ask a different question: What is a

reasonable expectation for the reduction in opioids that policy could bring about, and if it did so, how much

would we expect the duration of temporary disability benefits to fall?

        To get a handle on this question, consider a 5 percentage point decrease in longer-term opioid

prescriptions among workers with low back injuries, from an average of 12 percent to 7 percent of cases

(Table 1). This 5 percentage point decrease is a plausible policy effect, based on prior evidence that, after

the implementation of Kentucky House Bill 1, the percentage of claims with pain medications that had any

opioids decreased 10 percentage points, and the percentage of claims with pain medications that had two or

more opioid prescriptions decreased 6 percentage points (Thumula, 2017). 39 Based on the 2SLS estimate in

Panel D of Table 4, this change translates to a 12.6 percent decrease in the duration of temporary disability,

or 2.8 weeks shorter average duration of temporary disability for workers with low back injuries.

Bias in OLS Estimates

        In Panels A-C of Table 4, the 2SLS estimate is smaller than the OLS estimate, suggesting that OLS

provides an upward-biased estimate of the effect of opioid prescriptions on duration of disability. The most



39
  Kentucky House Bill 1 aimed to reduce opioid prescriptions by requiring prescribers to check the prescription drug
monitoring database prior to prescribing opioids, establishing standards for opioid prescriptions, and implementing
mandatory educational and patient treatment practices. The Thumula study did not present evidence on changes in
longer-term opioid prescribing.

                                                         20
plausible reason for upward bias, in our view, is failure of the severity controls to fully capture differences

in severity, in which case a positive relationship between opioids and unmeasured severity would overstate

the causal effect of opioid prescriptions. In contrast, the IV estimates using only the variation in prescribing

patterns across HRRs would break the link between unmeasured severity and opioid prescriptions and,

hence, eliminate the positive bias.

        In contrast, in Panel D of Table 4 the 2SLS estimate of the effect of longer-term opioid

prescriptions is larger, although not statistically significantly so, than the OLS estimate. This suggests that

there is another factor at work that biases the OLS estimate downward. Our conjecture is that the other

factor in this case is that some workers who want to return to work use opioids longer-term to enable them

to do so, and ignoring this “endogenous” choice to use opioids longer-term obscures part of the causal

effect of longer-term opioid prescriptions in increasing the duration of disability. This interpretation does

not mean that, overall, longer-term opioids enable return to work. Rather, it just means that for some

workers this mechanism is active. The 2SLS estimates imply that, on the whole, longer-term opioids lead to

substantially longer duration of temporary disability. There is no contradiction between different findings

for bias in the OLS estimates for longer-term prescriptions of opioids vs. short-term, limited prescriptions.

Short-term prescriptions may simply reflect unmeasured injury or treatment differences, while longer-term

prescriptions may be associated with behavioral differences.

Effects Relative to Broader Comparison Groups

        The main analyses just presented compare disability durations for those receiving two or more,

three or more, or longer-term opioid prescriptions relative to no opioid prescriptions. We view these

estimates as more comparable to each other since the untreated group remains the same. However, it is

possible that as we change the treated group to those with more or longer-term opioid prescriptions, they

become less comparable to those getting no prescriptions. Therefore, in Table 5 we report estimates where

the comparison is simply to those getting fewer prescriptions – e.g., 3 or more vs. 0, 1, or 2 prescriptions, or

longer-term opioid prescriptions vs. cases without longer-term opioid prescriptions (which includes any

other prescriptions). The results are qualitatively very similar. The 2SLS estimate for longer-term

prescriptions is larger, and, presumably because the distinction between the two groups is less sharp, less


                                                       21
precise (reflected also in a somewhat weaker but still strong first stage; compare to Table 3). The larger

estimate could just reflect greater imprecision. Alternatively, it may reflect the fact that workers who

receive shorter-term but not longer-term opioid prescriptions (who are omitted from the untreated group in

Table 4) have shorter disability durations as a result (i.e., causally) – consistent with the negative 2SLS

point estimates for multiple but not longer-term opioid prescriptions.

Heterogenous Effects

         The relationship between opioid prescriptions and duration of temporary disability may differ

between surgical and nonsurgical cases, perhaps because the same intensity of opioids may be more

medically-indicated for the same diagnosis in surgical cases than nonsurgical cases. The results for

nonsurgical cases are very similar to the full-sample results, as shown in Table 6. 40 We could not learn

much about the much smaller number of surgical cases (a bit over 10 percent of cases) using our strategy,

as the prescribing patterns IV did not strongly predict opioid prescriptions for this subset of cases.

Moreover, it is not meaningful to examine the relationship between any opioids and duration of temporary

disability benefits for surgical cases since nearly all surgical cases receive some opioids.

Robustness of Estimates

         We conducted several checks examining whether the results are sensitive to different definitions of

the dependent variable, to changes in the sample definitions, or alternative ways of constructing the IV that

address potential challenges to the validity of the instrument. 41 As we noted earlier, our results are robust to

using cost measures derived at different maturities. We continued to find a large, positive, and statistically

significant effect of longer-term opioid prescriptions across claims with different maturities (12, 36, and 48

months), with all the estimates showing an approximate doubling to tripling of duration. This evidence

implies that our findings are not influenced by open claims.

         We find similar percentage effects from using linear rather than log specifications for the duration

of temporary disability benefits. Our main results are also robust to changing the threshold size of the local

areas that we use for estimating local practice patterns.42

        In our main analyses, we limit the sample to primarily cases with a low back pain diagnosis. An

alternative sample specification is to relax some of the constraints imposed on the data. In particular, we

explored the sensitivity of our estimates to the sample that no longer excludes cases where less than two-

thirds of the office visits were for a low back pain diagnosis. We find that our pattern of results described in

the main specifications holds with this change in the sample. While the cases included in this analysis are

more heterogeneous, the precision of the estimates increases owing to the larger samples.

Validity of the Instrument

        We conducted a number of analyses that consider potential threats to the validity of our IV. First, in

our main specifications we used state fixed effects to control for state-specific factors that are constant over

the period of the study, such as time-invariant state-specific workers’ compensation system features. An

alternative approach is to control for state fixed effects interacted with year fixed effects, which will also

capture state-specific workers’ compensation policies (or other factors) that change over time. In this

specification, the impact of opioids is estimated from the variation in opioid prescriptions within each year

of data for each state. Because adding state-by-year interactions potentially eliminates a good deal of

identifying information—in particular, changes in opioid prescribing over time that are common to HRRs

in a state—we might obtain much less precise 2SLS estimates.

        Adding state-by-year fixed effects is most important if there are important determinants of the

duration of temporary disability that vary by state and year, that are correlated with opioids prescribing, and

that are not captured in our controls. We already control for time-varying local labor market conditions.

And there is not much variation in workers’ compensation policies in our sample period. Moreover, there

may be some policy variation that is useful as it could potentially drive variation in opioid prescribing—

such as policies on adoption and enforcement of prescription drug monitoring programs, rules about

dispensing of Schedule II or III prescriptions, and other limits on opioid prescriptions. We would not want

to control for policy variation that generates exogenous variation in prescribing patterns across states and



42
  This refers to either increasing or decreasing the minimum number of claims in an HRR to estimate the prescribing
pattern—a minimum we imposed to increase the precision of the estimate.

                                                        23
years. That is why our preferred specifications are those with separate state and year fixed effects.

        Table 7 provides coefficient estimates from our regressions for the original specifications, and the

alternative specifications that control for state-year specific fixed effects. The results are considerably less

precise, as expected—and we find a somewhat smaller effect of longer-term opioid prescriptions (that is no

longer statistically significant). However, the sign pattern of the estimates is the same, and, for longer-term

opioids, the point estimate of 89.9 still implies very large effects (approximately 146 percent longer

duration), and would still be statistically significant based on the standard error of the estimate without the

state-by-year interactions (33.0, from Table 4).

        An alternative approach to exploring whether our estimates are influenced by other workers’

compensation policy changes that would be expected to influence duration of temporary disability benefits,

and could—coincidentally—be correlated with state-by-year changes in opioid prescribing, is to revert to

using separate state fixed effects and year fixed effects, but to introduce controls for such policy variation.

Specifically, we control for the individual temporary disability benefits replacement rate, and an indicator

variable for whether the limits on maximum weekly amount of temporary disability benefits is binding. The

estimated effects of opioids prescriptions were nearly identical.

        The validity of the instrument depends on there not being unobservables in equation (1) that affect

the duration of disability and are correlated with opioids prescribing. The preceding analysis tries to assess

this by adding some potential omitted variables. An alternative, indirect approach is to ask whether the

2SLS estimates are sensitive to excluding controls that are plausibly correlated with important

unobservables. If the estimates are sensitive, it is because the IV is correlated with the controls, in which

case it might be plausible that it is also non-negligibly correlated with the residual. For example, we likely

do not measure injury severity perfectly, so sensitivity of the 2SLS estimates to excluding our severity

controls might suggest the IV is correlated with unmeasured severity. Table 8 presents OLS and 2SLS

estimates of our original specification as well as specifications without controls for injury severity. We also

report estimates that instead exclude the controls for location characteristics. The motivation is the same;

there could be local labor market differences associated with both duration of disability and with opioids

prescribing, and our controls for local labor market conditions may not be perfect. In both cases, however,


                                                       24
the results are very similar, suggesting there are not important unobservables that bias our IV estimates. Of

course, if the injury severity measures were not predictive of the duration of disability, then the fact that

excluding them has little influence on the results would not be informative. As noted earlier, however, the

severity measures are strongly correlated with this duration, in the expected direction. Similarly, the

location-related measures had the expected effects, with significantly longer durations for rural areas and

areas where county-level disability rates are higher.43

         Another concern is that “doctor shopping” generates a correlation between local area prescribing

rates and variation across HRRs in worker preferences for opioids. If these preferences are also correlated

with duration of temporary disability, this could invalidate our IV. To assess this, we define the IV

differently, measuring prescribing rates at the level of prescribers rather than workers. Whereas a worker-

level measure could reflect the sorting of workers with strong preferences for opioids to high-prescribing

providers, a provider-level measure could avoid the influence of this sorting. For example, suppose that

HRR A and HRR B each have two providers, one of whom prescribes longer-term opioids in 100 percent

of cases and the other in 0 percent of cases. Suppose that in HRR A, workers do not have particularly

strong preferences for opioids, and cases are split between the two providers, generating a worker-level

longer-term opioid percentage of 50. But suppose in HRR B workers all sort to the high provider. In that

case, the worker-level measure would be 50 percent in HRR A and 100 percent in HRR B, but the

difference reflects only worker sorting. The provider-level measure would be 50 percent in both HRRs,

which accurately reflects that provider prescribing is the same in both HRRs.

         Thus, to get a measure of provider prescribing behavior that should be less influenced by doctor

shopping, we create provider-level measures corresponding to the same measures used earlier, such as the

percentage of physicians who prescribed any opioids for low back conditions, the percentage of physicians



43
   Our approach is similar in spirit, of course, to regressing these controls on the instruments to see whether there is a
relationship, which if there was would raise more concerns about unobservables correlated with the instruments. The
insensitivity of the results to excluding either the injury severity controls or the local labor market controls implies
that these control variables are not very correlated with opioids prescribing. Also, the evidence from omitting injury
control obviates concerns that the injury severity measures we use are based on treatment and diagnosis, which could
be endogenous with respect to longer-term opioid prescribing if some physicians, for example, both “over treat” and
“over prescribe.”


                                                            25
who prescribed at least two opioid prescriptions, etc. To create these measures, we first determine whether

a physician/practice prescribed opioids (in the corresponding manner) for each of the workers for whom

they wrote prescriptions, and then average these measures across physicians in an area.44 As reported in

Table 9, using this alternative construction of the IV, the estimated effects of opioid prescribing on the

duration of temporary disability are similar to the prior results. The 2SLS estimates still point strongly to

much longer durations of temporary disability from longer-term opioid prescriptions.

         An alternative IV that addresses the same issue is derived only from the first prescribers that

patients visited. A typical case in a sample of low back injuries had five different prescribing physicians

and/or practices. Limiting the measurement of local prescribing patterns to only the first prescriber is

another way of addressing the concern that aggregate prescribing patterns reflect the impact of patients who

want more prescriptions finding providers who are more likely to prescribe opioids due to the nature of the

medical services that they provide. As reported in Table 10, the estimates defining the IV this way indicate

a similar relationship between opioid prescribing measures and duration of temporary disability to what we

found and reported in the earlier tables. These findings, like others reported in subsection, help bolster the

validity of our IV estimation strategy.

         Yet another potential source of correlation between opioids prescribing and duration of temporary

disability benefits is the possibility that events at a single employer (say, a large accident) lead to

simultaneous changes in longer-term prescriptions and in duration of disability, but the change in duration

is due to the common nature of injuries or slow recovery of jobs at the employer. To explore this possiblity,

we deleted observations from the dataset with multiple injuries at the same employer on the same day

(approximately 7 percent of observations in the longer-term prescribing sample). This has virtually no

impact on the estimates.

         Finally, it is possible that longer-term opioids prescribing for low back injuries of the type we study

are associated with other treatment differences, and treatment differences, rather than prescribing patterns,



44
  For this extension we use billing practice taxpayer identifiers to determine prescriber-level rates. Since practice
identifiers are not always available, we limit the sample to claims that have at least 90 percent of prescriptions with
practice identifiers. This reduces the sample that we can use to about 27,000 claims. While for many prescriptions this
identifies an individual prescriber, for some prescriptions this identifies a practice or even a large hospital.

                                                          26
drive the variation in duration. To assess this, we constructed an alternative opioid prescribing IV—based

on non-low back injuries. This IV should be correlated with general opioid prescribing patterns (and indeed

the first-stage for opioid prescribing for low back injuries remains strong); but it is less likely to be

correlated with other types of variation in treatment for low back injuries, because it is not directly related

to treatment of these injuries. Again, this led to similar results.

        In our view, this wide variety of analyses meant to assess the validity of the IV we use substantially

bolsters the credibility of a causal interpretation of our results. That said, it is not possible to prove that a

causal interpretation is valid, and, correspondingly, it is possible to think of other factors that could

invalidate the exclusion restriction. One such factor that we cannot get a handle on with our data is

physician quality; it is conceivable that this quality varies across HRRs, and that, for example, lower

quality physicians both write more longer-term opioid prescriptions and provide worse treatment that

lengthens the duration of temporary disability. Second, although our analysis dropping multiple injuries at

the same employer on the same day rules out some sources of employer differences that could affect opioid

prescribing and duration of disability across HRRs, there could be remaining differences that are not

captured in the “multiple events,” such as the presence of a large employer in a given HRR that directs a

substantial portion of care to a set of providers with common opioid prescribing behavior, and that also has

a systematic difference in return to work relative to other employers. Further work that rules out yet more

alternatives to a causal interpretation of our results—perhaps focused on physician behavior or employer

behavior—would be useful.

The Impact of Opioid Prescriptions Beyond Low Back Conditions

        We have focused on low back conditions because we can include detailed controls for injury

severity and, as noted earlier, the issue of opioid prescribing in such cases is critically important and has

been the focus of past research. But what happens if we instead look at all claims (with more than seven

days of lost time)? Extending the analysis to all cases requires a different approach to controlling for injury

severity, whereas the controls in our analysis of low back injuries were specific to these kinds of injuries. In

analyzing all cases with more than seven days of lost time, we must control more coarsely, simply adding

controls for injury type. We also define the prescribing-patterns IV to reflect opioid prescriptions within


                                                        27
each HRR, year, and injury group.

        Table 11 reports the results from this broader analysis. We find patterns of results that are similar

to what we found for low back injuries. The estimated effect of any opioids prescription is small, and

masks differential effects across cases with different numbers of prescriptions. We estimate that the effect

of workers having three or more prescriptions (excluding longer-term prescriptions) is to lengthen the

duration of temporary disability benefits by 32 percent; the corresponding estimate for low back injuries is

not statistically significant. Most important, however, is that the estimated effect for longer-term

prescriptions is similar to the earlier estimates for low back cases. The 2SLS estimate indicates that longer-

term opioid prescriptions lengthen duration by over 150 percent.

6. Conclusions

        We provide evidence on the effect of opioid prescriptions on the duration of temporary disability

benefits among workers with primarily low back injuries who had more than seven days of lost time after

their injuries. We use a research design intended to estimate the causal effect of opioid prescriptions,

whereas past studies of opioids and return to work have estimated associations that can reflect a

combination of causal effects and unobserved injury severity or other sources of variation in return to work

that influence both opioid prescriptions and the duration of disability. Our research strategy uses local

opioid prescribing patterns to isolate variation in opioids that is unrelated to characteristics of individual

workers, their injuries, and their providers that can affect both opioid prescriptions and return to work.

These local prescribing patterns exert a strong influence on whether injured workers receive opioid

prescriptions, an interesting finding in itself.

        We find that prolonged prescribing of opioids leads to longer duration of temporary disability

benefits among workers with work-related low back injuries. Our estimates indicate that longer-term opioid

prescriptions roughly triple the duration of temporary disability benefits, compared to similar workers with

similar injuries who do not get opioid prescriptions (or do not get longer-term prescriptions). Thus, we

clearly do not find evidence, on average, of beneficial effects of opioids prescribed in workers’

compensation cases—benefits that would need to be weighed against the costs of opioid use.




                                                       28
        Our evidence cannot directly address what role opioids play overall in changes in labor force

participation. However, our results are consistent with the effects of opioid prescriptions contributing to

lower participation by lengthening the time injured workers remain out of work.

        These results warrant a more detailed policy focus on longer-term opioid prescriptions. While

longer-term prescribing of opioids is not typically recommended for low back pain cases (ACOEM, 2008;

Bigos et al., 1994; Chou et al., 2007), it is striking to see that about 12 percent of our sample had longer-

term opioids and about 39 percent of workers had at least three opioid prescriptions. Since longer-term

opioid prescriptions lead to longer duration of temporary disability benefits, it is important to understand

the reasons why workers are receiving opioids on a longer-term basis, so that policy interventions can be

targeted toward reducing inappropriate longer-term use.

        Note that nothing in our research directly addresses the medical appropriateness of longer-term

opioid prescriptions, and indeed in some cases (as some of our evidence suggests), longer-term opioids may

enable return to work. But the evidence that workers in areas with higher rates of prescribing longer-term

opioids, for similar injuries, have longer disability duration suggests that there is at least some overuse of

longer-term opioids that is leading to longer disability duration. We need to understand what generates

variation in opioid prescription patterns across geographic areas and what policies could reduce

prescription rates in high-prescription areas.

        Research has started to provide information on changes in opioid prescribing after policy changes

intending to regulate use. These policy changes (and the associated studies) include: a Florida regulation

that banned physician dispensing of opioids (Thumula, 2013); Texas regulations implementing a pharmacy

closed formulary (TDI, 2013); Kentucky House Bill 1 regulating pain clinics and establishing standards for

dispensing and prescribing opioids, including requiring that providers check the state’s prescription drug

monitoring program before prescribing opioids (Thumula, 2017); and Washington State implementing

opioid dosing guidelines for chronic noncancer pain (Franklin et al., 2012; Garg et al., 2013). However,

more research is needed in this area, including verifying whether these policy changes reduce longer-term

opioid prescribing and, in turn, speed up return to work.

        While our analysis captures major dimensions of variation in opioid prescribing, we leave it for


                                                       29
future research to examine the effects of specific types of opioids or opioid combinations, as well as

interactions between opioid prescriptions and use and other care provided. We see no reason such analyses

would undermine our broad conclusions, but they could provide more specific guidance regarding how

opioids might be used to improve return to work. However, it might be harder to use our identification

strategy for estimating the causal effects of opioids on return to work, if more detailed local prescribing and

practice patterns are less predictive of individual treatment.

        Our results also offer important takeaways for future research linking opioids and outcomes. Our

results suggest that simple regressions, even those that account for injury severity, do not reveal the causal

effects of opioid prescriptions on outcomes. Even after controlling for observed injury severity, opioid

prescribing measures may still be a marker for unobserved dimensions of injury severity or for unobserved

worker characteristics related to return-to-work outcomes, in which case empirical associations between

opioids and return to work—or other outcomes—may not reflect the actual effects of opioid prescribing.

We have proposed an empirical strategy to estimate these causal effects, which we think is compelling.

Additional evidence on whether related strategies corroborate our findings would be invaluable.

Notes: The sample includes low back injuries with more than seven days of lost time with prescriptions. The data cover workers with primarily low back injuries
between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2013, across 28 states. Claims reflect duration of temporary disability payments within 24 months after an injury.
Longer-term opioid prescriptions are defined as having prescriptions within the first three months after an injury and three or more filled opioid prescriptions between
the 7th and 12th months after an injury. The one, two, or three or more prescriptions measures are also based on the period within 24 months after an injury. For the
opioid variables, the percentages across the none, one, two, three or more, and longer-term rows add to 100.

Notes: The sample includes low back injuries with more than seven days of lost time with prescriptions. The data cover workers
with primarily low back injuries between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2013, across 28 states. Claims reflect duration of
temporary disability payments within 24 months after an injury. All specifications include controls for state and year dummies,
as well as controls for worker and workplace characteristics (age, gender, marital status, preinjury wage and tenure, and firms’
payroll and industry). Specification 2 adds controls for low back surgery and early MRI; specification 3 adds severity controls;
and specification 4 adds controls for location characteristics (county unemployment rate, whether a zip code reflects a rural
area, percentage of population with less than a high school education at the PCSA level, and percentage of county population
who were disabled). The full set of estimates are available upon request. Estimated coefficients and standard errors are
multiplied by 100, and hence they should be interpreted as approximate percentage changes.

Notes: The sample includes low back injuries with more than seven days of lost time with prescriptions. The data cover
workers with primarily low back injuries between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2013, across 28 states. Claims
reflect duration of temporary disability payments within 24 months after an injury. Estimates are from OLS regressions
predicting opioid prescribing measures. Controls are described in notes to Table 2, corresponding to Specification 4. The
local prescribing pattern is measured as a proportion from zero to one, and the dependent variable is either zero or one.
Regressions are based on the sample with at least 15 observations within each HRR and year combination for constructing
an instrument. See Table 1 and notes for definitions of opioid prescription measures, and Table 2 notes for variable
definitions. The full set of estimates for this and all other tables are available upon request.

Notes: The sample includes low back injuries with more than seven days of lost time with prescriptions. The data cover
workers with primarily low back injuries between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2013, across 28 states. Claims reflect
duration of temporary disability payments within 24 months after an injury. Estimates are from OLS and 2SLS regressions for
the indicated measure of opioid prescriptions relative to the base category of “no opioid prescriptions” within 24 months after
an injury. Controls are described in notes to Table 2, corresponding to Specification 4. Regressions are based on the sample
with at least 15 observations within each HRR and year combination for constructing an instrument. Estimated coefficients
and standard errors are multiplied by 100, and hence they should be interpreted as approximate percentage changes. See Table
1 and notes to Tables 1, 2, and 3 for additional details on variables and sample.

Notes: The sample includes low back injuries with more than seven days of lost time with prescriptions. The data cover
workers with primarily low back injuries between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2013, across 28 states. Claims
reflect duration of temporary disability payments within 24 months after an injury. Estimates are from OLS and 2SLS
regressions for opioid measures reflecting experience within 24 months after an injury. Controls are described in notes
to Table 2, corresponding to Specification 4. Estimated coefficients and standard errors are multiplied by 100, and
hence they should be interpreted as approximate percentage changes. The instrumental variable used in this table
differs from other tables; see text. See Table 1 and notes to Tables 1, 2, and 3 for additional details on control variables
and sample.
