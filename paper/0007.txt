I.    Introduction
        Many people have opinions on which colleges are      of good   quality and

which are poor; the bases of these judgments can range from the number of

Nobel   Laureates on the   faculty to the national ranking of the football

team. A more systematic analysis       of quality would   try to   identify the
features   of colleges which enable those whom the colleges are serving

(students, alumni, taxpayers or society as a whole) to best achieve their

goals. Here we are concerned with the characteristics of colleges which

serve to increase subsequent monetary incomes of those who attend.

        Usually,   lifetime earnings are explained by variables such as innate
ability, experience in the    labor   force,   and years of education, although

other socio-economic, demographic and occupational        data can   be   inserted
to   increase the explanatory power of the model. This      paper attempts to
add a new dimension to the earnings function analysis by hypothesizing the
features of colleges which might yield financial payoffS in later life,

and then testing to see which of these traits actually do add most to the

explanatory power of the traditional earnings function. Several methods

of identifying the mechanism by which these quality traits affect income

will be tested, including rates of return to quality estimates and tests
                                  —2—


for the interaction of school quality with individual ability and with years

of schooling, and also interactions among the various quality traits.

      There is a particular timeliness to this study. Several years ago in

his classic study, James Coleman argued that for elementary school students

differences in the characteristics of the schools that they attended were

unimportant compared to differences in other variables, in particular,

family background, in determining differential achievement rates among

students) More recently, Christopher Jencks has minimized the effects of

schooling in reducing cognitive and economic inequality.2 Samuel Bowles,3

an economist, and Alexander Astin,4 a psychologist, have come to similar

conclusions that differences in schools at various levels ranging from

elementary to higher education have only small effects on student changes

be they economic or cognitive. However, Astin5 does find that college

students demonstrate differential changes in affective behavior depending

upon the quality of the colleges they attended. Moreover, Spaeth and

Greeley found that their measures of quality had effects on occupational

prestige even after the addition of a number of other variables, which

seemed to have reduced quality to insignificance in the studies previously

referred to.6

      Eric Hanushek found for a sample of elementary schools that even

though differences in expenditures did not seem to affect the learning

rates of children, there were certain measurable characteristics of

teachers which did have an impact. In particular, Hanushek found that

differences in teachers' verbal aptitudes, the newness of their training,

and racial differences, which he interprets as differences in quality of

the training of teachers, did significantly influence children's facility

in learning.7 An implication of this result is that expenditures don't

matter because school monies are spent on the wrong things. If school

expenditures are for seniority primarily rather than for verbal aptitudes,

quality of training, and recentness of training, then we would expect

little relationship between expenditures and other quantifiable measures

of quality to the effectiveness of the school.

     To jump ahead to the major conclusion of this study, we find that at

the college level, differences in quality have highly significant effects

on differences in lifetime earnings patterns of students. These results

hold even after controlling for a wide array of other factors, including

individual student ability. It might be that expenditures at the college

level are more likely to purchase those inputs that will be effective.

During the period of our study, institutions of higher education were less

restricted by unions, teacher associations, and school boards in regard to

the types of inputs that they were able to purchase. Hence, even if the

same model were applicable to all levels of education, the input-output

relationships predictably should have been more effective at the college

level. It is a moot point whether the superior effectiveness of higher

education will be able to continue as unionism and other restrictions

grow at the college level.

      Our enthusiasm for the relevance to policy of the current study

must be tempered somewhat because of the nature of the sample. It is

usually the case in social science research on micro data sets that

certain desirable characteristics of a sample to be studied will have to

be sacrificed in order to get other desirable characteristics. Some

samples that have attempted to follow groups of individuals over a number

of years have found drop—off rates in responses that result in terrible

biases. Other groups studied have had high response rates at the expense

of reducing the representativeness by selecting individuals from a par-

ticular state or group of high schools, for example. Other data sets




                                                                             .
                                   —5—


have of necessity lacked a rnmiber of particularly crucial variables, as

is the case when survey research is unable to acquire aptitude test

scores of the individuals being studied. Our sample has been character-

ized by statistically acceptable response rates and also by the avail-

ability of virtually all of the vital variables required for the models

to be specified below. However, the representativeness of the sample

has had to suffer.

      The data used is now known as the NBER-Thorndike sample, and although

it has been described in detail in several other places,8 we might summarize

its imrta. characteristics here. The respondents were white World War

II veterans, all of whom took a battery of aptitude tests in 1942 to deter-

mine if they were qualified to be pilots. To take the test one had to have

above-average 1Q9 and be in good health. Those willing were surveyed by

Robert Thorndike in 1955 and by the National Bureau of Economic Research

again in 1969. They provided much information on earnings history, socio-

economic situation, and educational experience, including the names of

colleges attended as well as aptitude test scores)°

Screening Device. New York: National Bureau of Economic Research, forth-
coming.

   9me IQ variable used is a combination constructed by factor analysis of
several of the AFQT tests and has a mean of .30 and a standard deviation
of 1.86.


   0Ten thousand of these World War II veterans were surveyed by Thorndike,
and his work resulted in a book, Ten Thousand Careers. The same 10,000
people were sought by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 1969, and
approximately 6,000 of these people provided usable information to us.

      This particular sample precludes us from generalizing some of our

results so that they might be most relevant for current policy debates.

In the first place, no blacks are included in the sample, and also there

are no people from the lower half of the 19 distribution. Hence, we

must continually keep in mind that our results apply primarily to white,

high-ability members of our population. We must constantly be cautious

of the temptation to apply our results to blacks, other minorities,

women (who are also not represented in our sample), and the less able

members of our society. If one argues that the models developed in the

work reported here apply directly to these groups, then inferences about

them might be made. However, if we feel that the factors determining

the earnings functions for these groups are different from those deter-

mining the earnings functions for the ones in our sample, or if we feel

the relationships between the factors and earnings would differ between

these groups, then we will have to restrict our conclusions to the group

studied. Rather than waiting for the perfect data set, we shall present

the results for the data that we have developed. The caveats just stated

must be kept in mind. However, the basic result——the significance of

quality of college attended on lifetime earnings patterns--is important

enough to justify what follows.

      Two general types of attributes of colleges can be isolated and

measured (if imperfectly). They are as follows:

      1. Student QualitI. The argument is that a student benefits more

from college, and hence acquires more of whatever colleges give that en-

hances future earning power, when surrounded by high quality fellow


                                                                           .
                                     —7—


students. This has been   called   the peer effect. Intuitively, it does seem

that the opportunity to interact with intelligent and motivated peers should

enrich the college experience. We have several measures of average student

quality by schools: the average Scholastic Aptitude Test (S.A.T.) scores

of entering freshmen,11 and an index of intellectuality of students obtained
                                              12
by Alexander Astin through factor analysis.        Another variable which has

been developed by Astin, an index of selectivity based upon average level

of S.A.T. scores is also used as a dimension of quality.

        2. Instructional Quality. The second aspect of college quality is

the excellence of faculty. The hypothesis here is that better faculty

instill in students traits which will be beneficial in subsequent years.
                                                             13
One measure of faculty quality is average faculty salary.         The assump-

tion is that higher paid faculty have either more experience (and higher

rank), better teaching ability, more professional prestige from research,

or greater opportunities to earn elsewhere; all of these being indicators




        course an individual's IQ will be highly correlated with his S.A.T.
scores. However, here we are looking at the effect of average S.A.T.'s
of all students at a college on an individual's subsequent income, control-
ing for the individual's IQ.

of greater productivity in their professorial roles)4 Another measure of

school quality is school expenditure for instruction, research and library

per full-time equivalent student. Here, the argument is that high quality

faculty are attracted by expenditures beyond those on salaries alone.

Also, holding these expenditures per faculty member constant, a larger

expenditure per student implies a greater teacher/student ratio.15 Thus,

this measure is a test of the influence of teacher/student ratios as well.

The hypothesis is that both expenditures per faculty member

and faculty per student are aspects of quality.16 Unfortunately,

data of this kind ignore differing definitions of "full-time faculty" at

different colleges. Teaching loads range from one course to four or more

per semester at different colleges and these differences may alter teacher

effectiveness. Other problems with this proxy for quality arise since it

allows for no nonpecuniary attractiveness of particular colleges for par-

ticular faculty members. Schools located in undesirable areas (urban

ghettos with high crime rates or isolated rural areas with no cultural

life) may be forced to pay high salaries for even mediocre quality faculty.




   140ne might ask about the relationship between these traits and academic
salaries; and also which of these have more important affects on students'
later incomes.   However, data limitations enable us here only to look at
the gross relationship between faculty salaries and student incomes.


            is true if we assume contact hours per faculty member are constant.

                     =              (Fac.)        (Contact Hrs.)
Obviously     Stu.       (Fac)   (Contact Hrs.)     (Student)


   16Quality can be thought of as attributes of colleges which increase
learning which, in turn, makes students able to earn larger incomes in
later life.
                                  —9—


Schools with attractive surroundings (scenery, a few top scholars, cultural

life or exceptionally good research and teaching equipment and plant) may

be able to attract high quality faculty for low salaries. Low salaries

may be paid to top quality faculty where opportunities for lucrative out-

side consulting jobs abound. Of course, students may or may not get

benefit from "good" faculty who are away consulting much of the time. In

any case, the hypothesis we will test is that schools which pay large

salaries to faculty members who meet relatively small groups of students

are more beneficial to students' subsequent earning power than those

which pay low salaries or have large classes.

      A related quality measure refers to the total incomes or expendi-

tures per student of the colleges. It might be argued that schools

which spend (or receive) larger amounts per enrollee provide a higher

quality education, an educational experience more beneficial in post—

school years.

      As an additional test of school quality we have a subjective measure

made by Gourman. These ratings propose to be a "consensus of reliable

opinion and judgment obtained from many and various sources deemed to be

dependable and accurate.17 The study evaluates individual departments as

well as administration, faculty, student services and other general areas

such as library facilities. An average of all items is calculated,

Institute, 1967.
                                   — 10 —




resulting   in an overall Gourman Index between 200 and 800. The interpretation

of these ratings depends upon the weights given to the various criteria.

Unfortunately, these weights are not published. However, the index is one of

the few quantitative ratings of a large number of colleges.

      There is aquestion of whether or not all the measures of quality are

really standing for the same thing. Table 1 presents correlations between

pairs of college attributes. In qeneral these exceed .5.

      Table 2 presents regressions with individual colleges as units of ob-

servation. These enable us to consider the relationships between the non-

monetary quality measures and the expenditure data and school size. It is

obvious that the non—dollar quality measures are significantly influenced

by expenditures as a whole, faculty salaries, and size of student body.

Size is negatively related to average SA.T. scores and the Astin measures;

that is, better peer group influences apparently are found in smaller

schools. Gourman ratings are positively influenced by size. Interestingly,

we explain about 50 per cent of the variance in the peer group measures by

our model, but 70 per cent of the Gourman ratings are explained.

      It is interesting to compare these relationships with those discussed

by Charles Elton in a recent paper)8 Elton finds that in quality ratings of grad-

uate departments de by people engaged in academic careers, there is a

very strong relationship between size of department and its quality rating.

Elton   correlated the quality measures obtained by Allan Cartter19 and by
                    20
ose and Anderson with the number of areas of specialization within a

department, number of faculty, number of Ph.D. degrees awarded, number of

full-time students, number of first—year students, and ratio of part-time

to full-time students. He found that tests of statistical significance

indicated that these variables differentiated the departmental ratings

beyond chance expectations. He concludes that in the ratings obtained

from opinion-poll type surveys, the prime determinant of the probability

of a department having a high-quality rating is its size, as measured by

the variables noted. The Gourman ratings that we use resemble the

Cartter-type ratings in that they are derived from opinions of an in-

dividual. It is for this quality variable that undergraduate enroll-

ment is significantly and positively related to the institutional rating.

On the other hand, enrollment or institutional size is negatively or in-

significantly related to measures of average SAT scores of entering

freshmen, either those obtained from Case and Birnbaum21 or those derived

by Alexander Astin.        The implication is that we might want to focus on

quality measures, at least in part, which are based on more or less ob-

jective data rather than exclusively on quality variables derived by

surveying opinions.

      It should be noted that quality variables used below are based either

on undergraduate evidence, like the SAT-score data, or on university—wide

characteristics, such as expenditure data and the Gourman    ratings.   In

other words, a school is evaluated equally regardless of whether an individ-

ual attended it as a graduate or an undergraduate student. An implicit

assumption in these cases is that the quality rankings of an institution

in its undergraduate schools do not differ from the quality rankings based

on its graduate programs.

     We do have ratings of graduate schools that have been prepared by

specific departments. We were less anxious to make use of these graduate

ratings for a number of reasons. If we could specify not only the institu-

tion attended for graduate training by the individual in our sample but

also the department, then the departmental ratings by graduate schools would

be optimal. However, since we do not know what departments were attended by

our respondents, we would be forced to weight the ratings of the different

departments and combine them into one rating of the graduate institution as

a whole. Secondly, most of the departmental ratings of graduate schools

are provided for only a certain number of schools, particularly the best

schools.    Although the Roose—Anderson ratings have been expanded to cover

well over 100 graduate schools, many of those graduate schools attended

by our respondents were not included. In our sample only 775 people

attended graduate schools that had Roose—Anderson ratings. One thousand

and ninety-two people attended graduate schools that had our Gourman ratings.

            However, we did want to make sure that using university—wide

ratings (Gourman)      was not a significantly inferior strategy than that

of using the Roose—Anderson ratings for those who attended graduate

school. Table 3 makes the appropriate comparisons. In our earnings

function, which is developed below, we insert in the first column the

quality of the undergraduate     and   graduate schools attended, as measured

by Gourman,   and in the second column, the quality of the undergraduate
school as measured by Gourman     and   of the graduate school as measured by

Roose and   Anderson. The explanatory power of the      model is virtually

identical   to   two   decimal places. Moreover, this significance of the

graduate quality variable is almost identical as well. Other variables

have similar effects also. Comparing Column 1 and Column 4 reveals that

the results using Gourman     quality   measures for both   the   undergraduate

and graduate institution do not vary too much depending upon the size of

the   sample, the larger sample being all individuals who attended graduate

schools   with Gourman ratings   and the smaller sample being all those who

attended   graduate schools   with Roose-Anderson ratings.

       Finally, it is    evident from Column 3   that the use of     the Roose-
Anderson rating of graduate schools along with the Gourman          rating   of

graduate schools does not improve the power of the model very much. Indeed,
when the two graduate-quality variables enter together, the high degree of

correlation between them reduces their individual coefficients to statis-

tical insignificance.

        Given these results, it was decided that the work of this study would

be conducted without using the Roose—Anderson ratings of graduate schools.

So the rating   of a school is the same whether       an individual attended

it as an undergraduate or a graduate student. If the other approach had

been used, the results would not have been significantly different.


II. Formulation of a Testable Model

        Investments in human capital serve to increase people's skills, knowl-

edge and   similar    attributes   which, in turn, enhance their capabilities to
do productive work. One function           of schools is to increment   the productive
capacities   of those who      attend--to   increase their human   capital.   Of course,

there are other ways of augmenting human capital besides formal schooling

(e.g., investments in health and on-the-job-training).

        A student acquires human capital in school by combining his own time

and   abilities with       the resources provided by the institution. Formally,

we can think   of a    production   function   for human capital   through schooling
in   any period as:

                                                                                   (1)
                     AHi      f(Ri Ti 8)


where        is the number of units of productive capital acquired by a person

in period i from attending school, R1 is the school's rate of input of
                                        — 18 —




market resources, T is the rate of input of the investor's time per unit

of calendar time, and B is the individual's physical and mental powers.

We would expect the three variables on the right side of (1) to interact

with each other.

          Up to period t, total human   capital   acquired from schooling would

be

                          t
                  Ht      E f(R1,       B)                                    (l)23
                         i—i


(1') is specified as a linear relationship so


                          t
                          S f(R Ti B)        csER
                                                    + BET. + B                    (2)
                         i=l


It is assumed that the individual's skills, B, do not change. We allow for

interactions of R, T, and B later by adding additional cross-product terms

and also by subdividing the sample. For the empirical specification of (2)

for people having completed their schooling, B is measured by IQ, ST. by

years of schooling obtained, and ERiE market inputs of the school, by the

measures of quality of the colleges attended. The quality measures

represent features of educational institutions which are costly.

         It is difficult to measure the output units of this "human capital
production function," which are really units of productive skills ac-

quired in school. We will see below that this is not                      a   problem.

         The   human capital earnings function asserts that current period in-
come           equals the sum of those earnings obtainable without any invest-
ment    in human   capital (Y) and those earnings                obtained as    a return on
human capital      acquired up to that point              in   the individual's life.

Formally,


                   Y
                    t
                        —Y
                                0   +rHt +U                                                   (3)



         In (3), r is the rate of return to units of human capital accumulated
in all   periods up to t.

        The    focus of this study is on the relationship between earnings and
the human capital production function relevant to schooling. This re-
lationsh.ip can be explored by estimating empirically the reduced form ob-
tained by substituting (2) into (3), to get

                        —   Y       +
                                        r(aERi   +   8ET + B)                                 (4)



Note   that we cannot interpret the coefficients on years, IQ and quality as
rates of return since the coefficients are equal to r times a weighting
factor. The formulation of (4) used in the empirical section below to
study   people no longer in school is:



                   lnYlnY+aEXP+bEXPSQ+cYR$+dIQ
                                                                                              (5)
                                           + a QUAL +            +u
                                             — 20   —




''         is   log of 1969 earnings, EXP     is   years of experience in the full-time

labor      force   (years   since   first job), and EXPSQ is the squared value of EXP

to take account of the nonlinear influence of on-the-job training on

earnings.24 YES         is years    of schooling, IQ is a measure of the level of

ability (presumably affected by a combination of genetics and environ-

ment) and QUAL is a measure of the quality of college attended (institu-

tional inputs or traits of one kind or another). The last three factors

are important since in part they determine the amount of human capital

acquired through schooling and hence (indirectly) affect earnings.25

V are several occupational dummies. The occupational dummies               were   par-

ticularly necessary, since teachers are traditionally paid less than

other people with the same education (sometimes allegedly because of

nonpecuniary benefits) and doctors receive more. The overrepresentation

of highly paid but relatively low educated pilots was also controlled for.




   24See B. Chiswick, "Interregional Analysis of Income Distribution,"
for the development of a model which requires the dependent variable
to be log of earnings and both EXP and EXPSQ as independent variables.
Also see J. Mincer, "The Distribution of Labor Incomes: A Survey with
Special Reference to the Human Capital Approach," Journal of Economic
Literature, March 1970.

The Vi's can   also   stand   for   other variables like health, location, socio-

economic background, etc. in some of the estimates.

       The quality measure     used in    this section is that for the last college

attended   by the respondent. This particular form of the quality variable
was selected, since it appeared in preliminary work that those who went
to more than one college (for example, graduate school) had incomes
affected primarily by the nature of their final college.26
       For these regressions, a variable was devised as the Q for those
not going on, and             for those with more than four years of college.
This enables   a single average "income elasticity" of college quality and

ignores   different payoffs to quality depending       upon years. This   is some-
what less cumbersome to deal with than two separate variables, although
it will be seen that the quality coefficients do differ depending upon
attainment.


   26For those with thirteen or more years of schooling the following
equation was estimated:

           lnY69a+bQUG+cZ.Q+dQD+eiVi+u                                          (6)


where Z — 1 if years of education was 13 to 16 inclusive and 0 otherwise,
UG and          are measures of undergraduate and graduate college quality,
respectively and V. are other variables like ability, years of education,
experience, and several occupational dununies • With this formulation the
coefficients c and d were significant Ct-teats) but b was not. The
implication is that undergraduate quality matters only for those who do
not go beyond four years of college. In some of the estimates below
e QUAL was replaced by fZ.Q + g          where Z — 1 if years of education
was 13 to 16 inclusive and 0 otherwise.

III.   The Empirical Estimates

       This study only considers those with at least some college. For pur-

poses of some of the work reported below, individual's were included in

the regressions only if they attended colleges for which all the quality

measures were available. This was done so that comparisons between differ-

ent quality measures in the regressions would not be clouded by varying

degrees of freedom. (We would have to eliminate individuals in particular

regressions when the quality measure was not available for their schools,

or the computer would assign a value of zero to quality which is wrong.)

There were 1,511 people in this sample.

       The question arises whether this biases the study due to the par-

ticular    types of schools remaining for which all the quality data are
available. Biases would exist if one particular quality of school re-
fused information. At first glance, one might predict that schools of
low quality would be the ones reluctant to     report.   However this is not
generally   true. Many schools provide the services of granting college

educations and degrees to high school graduates who are not qualified

to enter schools generally considered to be high quality institutions.

It is in the interest of these low quality schools to become known by

less qualified college aspirants. On the other hand, a number of

schools with "good reputations" may   be   reluctant to report statistics

for fear   of revealing quantitative evidence that their reputations may
not be fully justified. Hence there appear to be reasons why both

high and low quality schools would not report. Some schools may have




                                                                               .
                                         — 23   —




other   reasons, unrelated to quality, for not reporting. For example, some

schools   only require S.A.T. scores from lower quality applicants (those

graduating   in the bottom 75 per cent of their high school          classes must

report   S.A.T.). Some schools might not feel that their available data are
relevant, as when most faculty members are only part—time employees of the
college. Other   schools   might not   want     to take the time   to   compute the
data desired. There is no reason why these nonreporters should              fall into

any particular  quality group, and the evidence confirms this.27
        A potentially more serious problem with the quality data is that
most of the information on schools is for the post-1960 period, whereas
the   respondents attended around 1950. Unfortunately, earlier data on

colleges are not available, schools have been willing and able to use

computers to make information available only in recent times. The

assumption   is that   the correlation of college quality is        unchanged over
time.    This assumption is probably not too bad particularly in a gross
sense (good schools are     still   good but the ranking of the good schools
might vary somewhat).
        One of the few   sets of data on college attributes available over
a reasonable period     of time is those on average salary. Data for 36




   27The colleges remaining in our sample range from the very top to the
very bottom of each of the quality measures. However, the 1,511 individ-
uals left for our study appear to have somewhat higher incomes, years of
schooling and ability than the full sample with thirteen or more years.
Some implications of this and comparisons with less restricted samples
will be described below.
                                          — 24   —




schools    were made available to me for the years 1939—40, .1953—54, 1959—60,

and 1969_70.28

         Several   tests were performed and      these revealed     significant serial
rank correlation.       Analysis of variance revealed that          the variation of

rank across    schools at each point in time was significantly greater than

the variance of rank     of   a   school over time.29     Table 4   reveals the
Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficients and           tests   of significance for

values of average salary in        particular    years.   Both   tests indicate a

strong   tendency for schools to be of roughly the same rank            quality over
time.
         It will   be shown below that the quality measures for later periods

are highly correlated with earnings of those who attended earlier. One

is   tempted to argue that if quality measures for the more relevant year
were obtainable, these would reveal an oven stronger relationship with
earnings. However, the        question of effects of college quality are too

important   to put aside on the grounds that current data are imperfect.3°


   28These were obtained through the generous cooperation of Mrs. M.
Eymonerie of the American Association of University Professors, Washington,
D.C. The thirty—six schools were not identified specifically but represent
a cross section of American colleges.


   29The F-ratio was 12.43 and the critical F for the given degrees of
freedom for significance at the 1 per cent level is 1.99

   30it has been suggested that if graduates from certain colleges earned
high incomes for reasons unrelated to our quality measures, they might
have subsequently donated large sums to their Alma Mater• This would
have enabled colleges to then obtain high marks in our quality measures.
In this case high incomes supported high quality. Moreover high current
incomes might be due to current prestige of ones Alma Mater regardless
of the quality during the time attended.

         For   graduate departments there have been periodic ratings of quality

since 1925. We 8elected studies made in 1925, 1957, and 1969. We then

aggregated department rankings to give each of the schools that appeared

in all three rankings an overall institutional ranking for each year. We

than took rank correlations of the school standings over time. It appears

that the correlations between rankings in 1969 and 1957 and the correlation

between rankings in 1957 and 1925 both were approximately .7. The corre-

lation between rankings in 1969 and 1925 was .54. Hence, it appears that

even    over long periods of time institutional quality has bean roughly con-
stant.    These rankings of graduate schools over time appear in Table 5.

         Table 6 provides the estimation of earnings functions with differ-

ent quality measures. It appears that regardless of how quality is

measured,      the   traits   of   one's school significantly   affect the log of
subsequent     earnings (i.e., log of 1969 earnings). These affects are

after controlling for the individual's IQ, years of education and experi-

ence. The t-values on quality (ten measures) range from 3.744 to 6.049

with 1,506 degrees of freedom. Here we use a single variable——the quality

of last college attended (graduate or undergraduate where appropriate).

        We should pause at this point to note that the coefficient on years

of schooling is only slightly over .03 in all the earnings functions of

Table   6.     These   coefficients should not be interpreted as the       rate of

return to years of education. According th the theory of human capital

it can be shown       that    the rate of return to years of schooling equals the




                                                                                     .

                  Actual opportunity costs + direct costs
                        Annualized opportunity cost


Hence the     coefficient on years is the (private) rate of return only if

k =   1.    Actual opportunity costs equal annualized opportunity costs less

the   amount that   a student earns, perhaps when schools are closed during

the summer. If direct costs exactly equal student earnings, exactly 100

per cent of potential income would be invested in obtaining human capital,

k would equal 1 since     both numerator and denominator have been reduced to
annualized     opportunity costs, and r would be the rate of return per year

of attendance at an average quality school by a student of average ability.

the G.I. Bill of Rights. These students had no direct costs of schooling

and received subsistence payments as well. As an approximation we assume

that, as students, our sample members received $100 per month plus tuition

under the G.I. Bill.3' From the 1950 Census we can deduce that an average

in the sample. Hence it appears that k equals roughly .35106 and equals



      In order to estimate rates of return to years in college, we should

multiply the years coefficient by 2.85. The rates of return appear to be

roughly 9.7 per cent. Gary Becker estimated the returns to a white male
                                               34
college graduate to be 13 per cent in 1949.

      There are several reasons why the present estimates are below those

of others. First, our sample includes only people who have at least some

college education; and so, our coefficients reflect the return to an extra

year of college not the return to college training compared to the return

to high school attendance. The second reason for the low rates of return

to higher education (relative to previous studies) is the preponderance of

teachers in our sample. Teachers have high education and relatively low

annual earnings. This   exception     is noted explicitly in some of the later

   33Assuming a nine month    school year,   k —                      =   .35106.
The crudeness of this assumption should be obvious.

Although Becker acknowledges the crudeness of his estimate,      it has
                                                                    been
widely  cited. Although  there is some reason to believe that the present
estimate is more accurate, since we were able to control explicitly for more
factors, we should not argue too strongly on this point except perhaps to
say that Becker's estimates of the returns to a college degree might be a
bit too high. Our estimates are very crude also.

regression estimates. Finally, an examination of the drop outs in our sample

indicates that they were usually pulled out of school by good earnings

opportunities, not pushed out due to poor achievement.

        Another reason for the apparent low pay of f to extra "raw years" in

school is that we are controlling for college quality. It is probably the

case that those with more years also attended higher quality institutions.35

Thus part of the return to extra years is reflected in returns to quality

rather than returns to years. The coefficient on years rises to slightly

over .04 when quality variables are omitted from the earnings functions;

and this would imply a rate of return to years not controlling for quality

of about 12 per cent. Of course, the ability variable also detracts from

the coefficient on years, since there is a positive relationship between

innate ability and educational attainment.36

        After establishing that quality is important, however measured, the

task of inferring which aspect of quality is most important is more diffi-

cult. The question we are raising here is not the rate of return to dif-

ferent types of college quality, but, more simply, the effect of certain

aspects   of quality on   income. Mere we are looking at the significance   of


   35
     The correlation between years and quality of the last school attended
is about 25.

   36Taubman and Wales (in press) estimate an upward bias in the coefficient
on years when the IQ is omitted of about 30 per cent. This depends on the
specification of their model and on the particular measure of IQ used.




                                                                                 S
the coefficients on quality in regressions which explain differences in in-

dividual incomes; later we make an attempt to estimate rates of return to

quality. Table 6 shows      that average   faculty salary has the highest t-value,

closely followed by the average S.A.T. scores of entering freshmen and

Astin's measures of intellectuality and selectivity. One is tempted to

conclude that faculty quality and peer group effects are the most important

(in terms of subsequent earnings) features of college quality.              The peer

group effects are in line with the conclusions of James Coleman in the

study of lower levels of education.37

        The R2   in the earnings function before adding the quality variable
was • 0602 •    The addition of the average salary variable raises the R2 by

.0223 to .0825. Once again, the quality variables measuring student
characteristic add the next largest amounts to R2.38 Interestingly,
according      to the t-test and the   addition   to R2   criteria,   the income and
expenditures for a full—time equivalent student are the least important
quality variables. The Gourman statistics which purport to take all

      381t has been suggested that the average college S.A.T. variable might
be a better proxy for the innate ability of the particular student than
 is             variable that we use. The average S.A.T. variable may be
      the ability
 picking up ability traits of the individual not  captured by our individ-
 ual ability measure. If this were the case, the suggestion of a peer
 group effect would be wrong. To really confirm the peer group effect
 requires both individual and college S.A.T. scores but we lack the former.
 It would also be useful to have variance of S.A.T. by college which is
 not available.

factors   into account, fall somewhere    between the   power   of   the faculty and

student   quality measures, and the expenditure measures.

        The relative weakness of the expenditure data might be explained by

the   fact that they are deflated by the number of full-time equivalent
students. Indeed, average faculty salary, a prime component of expendi-
tures, is the most powerful measure of quality. Welch has argued that
for state elementary and high school systems, size is a factor having a
significant positive effect on earnings; that is, an important aspect of
school   quality as we   define quality.39 If colleges enrolling a large
number of   students are of higher quality than    colleges     enrolling fewer

students,   then the expenditure data deflated are actually ratios of two
factors, each a   positive influence on earnings. If       expenditures per
student are high because expenditures are high, holding constant size of
college, we would expect a strong positive relationship with later earn-
ings. On the other hand, if the variable is large because the number of
students is small, holding expenditures constant, we would expect a
n.gative relationship between the ratio and income • In a large sample of
schools, the expenditures per student probably vary for both reasons and
so the over all effect is blurred. Another reason to suspect that the
expenditures   per    student data will not correlate highly with income      of

graduates is that     only   part of each dollar spent finds its way into

projects   which makes students more productive (i.e. what value is there

to earning ability of gardening expenses for the college greenery). Of

course, a happier student may learn more and hence earn more.

      We can calculate a quality elasticity of income--the percentage

change in income for a percentage change in quality. However, these

elasticities   cannot be used to compare impacts of quality. A 1 per

cent change in average S.A.T. level is not comparable to a 1 per cent

change in average salary. These elasticities are presented in Table 6

(second line from the bottom). If we could calculate the cost of a 1

per cent change in each of the quality measures, only then could we see

the returns to each. This will be attempted later in this paper.

      Table 7 presents two specifications of the earnings equation which

include more than one quality variable. In the first, it is evident

that average salary and S.A.T. scores have separate and statistically

significant influences on income. The second version shows that when

additional types of quality measures are added, the importance of faculty

salaries and average S.A.T. scores still stand out, but the other vari-

ables add nothing extra statistically. It appears that two separate and

important aspects of quality can be identified, namely, faculty quality

and peer group (student) effects.4°




   40A8 stated earlier, the significance of the average S.A.T. scores might
be measuring the effects of students' own abilities not captured by IQ.
However, there seems to be no reason why 1963 S.A.T. scores would better
represent ability than would the ability measures taken in the Air Force
usually before college attendance. Other variables used to measure
quality apparently relate to income only as proxies for the same effects
measured by faculty salaries and average S.A.T. scores. Of course, it
might be that other aspects of quality are important but are omitted from
our model or are merely poorly measured.

IV. The Interaction Between Years of Schooling and College Quality

          To measure college quality's impact by the characteristics of the

    last college attended by an individual is a useful technique to provide

    answers to questions about the relative importance of various college

    attributes and changes in these intportances over an individual's life

    cycle. However, it appears that quality does indeed have a differential

    effect depending upon the number of years of schooling obtained. Since

    this is the case, we must give more attention to the particular specifi-

    cation of the earnings functions which include measure of college

   quality.

          Table 8 reestimates the earnings functions for six of the cases

    reported earlier. The earnings function in this case inserts a measure

    of undergraduate quality for those with sixteen or fewer years of school-

    ing and a measure of graduate quality for those who attended graduate

    school. In this case, the results are similar to the earlier ones ex-

    cept it appears that undergraduate quality is more important for those

   with sixteen or less years of schooling than is graduate quality for

    those who go on.41 The coefficients on Q were higher and the t-tests




          positive correlation between 2UG and        for those with more than
    sixteen years implies the coefficient on graduate quality is higher than
    it would be if Q were entered for those with more than sixteen years.
   When this was done the Q variable was not significant for those with
   more than sixteen years. On the other hand, several individuals attended
   graduate schools for which average faculty salary and average S.A.T. scores
   were not available. Hence, in those cases the GRAD appears as 0 and this
   tends to lower the slope of the graduate quality coefficients in these two
   cases.

more    significant   in all cases compared to GRAD Since quality appears to

affect differently those who did and those who did not go on to graduate

school, we are led to subdivide the sample further.42 Since the quality

effects differed by years of attainment, it is logical to run separate

earnings functions for those with sixteen or less years of schooling and for

those with seventeen or more years. This was done in Table    943 In only
one   case reported in Table 4 (Gourman-—larger, less exclusive sample) was
undergraduate   quality statistically significant for those who went on to

graduate school. However, in almost all cases, impact of the last quality

was greater (or equal) for those with more years; clearly the effects of

quality appear greater for this group if we combine effects of undergraduate

and graduate quality. These results are at odds with    those presented in
Table   8, where the impact of quality was greater for those with sixteen

or less years. However, in the specification used in Table 9 we are no




   42The second change in the specification of Table 8 is that four dummy
variables were inserted to account for "occupations." These serve to
increase the coefficient on years for reasons elaborated upon elsewhere.
Pilots had low education and high earnings, whereas teachers generally
had the reverse.

Gourman——for their undergraduate schools and for their graduate school.
if they attended. Columns 7 through 10 contain a larger sample, omitting
only those without Gourman and expenditure data. The larger sample had a
lower mean IQ and lower average "Gourman" quality schools. It is interest-
ing to note that the lower quality sample revealed smaller impacts of
college quality than did the more exclusive groups. This will lead us into
our study of the interaction between ability and quality in the next
section.

longer constraining the coefficients on other variables to be the same
regardless of years attained, since we estimate different functions by
years    of schooling. We can also note that those with seventeen or more

years probably were of the highest ability and so the interaction be-

tween IQ and quality is suggested.

         It might be the case that the differences which are observed by

comparing coefficients on most variables in Table 8 with those in

Table    9 are   not   statistically significant. The question arises whether
it is necessary to separate individuals by schooling attainment in order
to estimate earnings functions--whether or not there are statistically

significant differences in the functional forms according to the number
of   years obtained. Moreover, it is possible that structures might

differ according       to attainment of individuals separated more finely than

merely between those with sixteen or fewer and seventeen or more years

of schooling. In particular,        we might suspect that the   earnings function
for those who have received a       bachelor's degree differs from those who

attended college but withdrew before obtaining the degree. To answer

this type of question, CHOW tests were performed on the earnings func-

tions presented in Table 10. Here we have earnings functions for those

with fewer than sixteen years of schooling, exactly sixteen years of

schooling, and more than sixteen years of schooling, along with an earn-

ings    function for the total sample.        CHOW tests were performed by com-

paring the earnings functions structure of those with less than sixteen
years with those people having sixteen years, and also by comparing

In each case the null hypothesis is that the two functions being compared

do not have statistically different structures, Comparing the function of

those with fewer than sixteen years to those with exactly sixteen years

we cannot reject the null hypothesis and so conclude that these two func-

tions have the same structures in a statistical sense. However, when

comparing those with sixteen or fewer years with those with more than

sixteen years, the F value exceeds its critical level and, hence, we are

led to reject the hypothesis that the structures are the same. This

suggests that the two earnings functions estimated for those with six-

teen or fewer years and those with more than sixteen years do indeed

differ statistically

      The important conclusion from this section is that the effects of

quality and the other variables introduced in our earnings function

differ according to whether or not post-graduate education is obtained.

However, there is no need to separate individuals with no graduate work

into groups depending on whether or not they obtained the bachelors

degree. This leads us to accept the conclusion suggested by Table 9,

namely, that the impacts of quality are greater for those with post-

graduate training compared to those with sixteen or fewer years of

schooling.




   44When comparing those with less than sixteen years to those with exactly
sixteen years the calculated F was .3576 and the critical F was 1.84 at the
5 per cent level. Hence we cannot reject the null hypothesis and conclude
that the two cases have the same structure. When comparing those with six-
teen or fewer years to those with seventeen or more the calculated F is
3.790 and the critical F is 2.25 at the 1 per cent level. Hence we reject

     However, in a few of our tests, we continue to estimate one earnings
function for those with only undergraduate, and those with graduate train-

ing combined. In these cases, we see effects of quality when other vari-

ables are constrained to have the same (average) influence regardless of

years attained.


 V. Results at Different Points on the         Life   Cycle

         College quality, no matter how defined, does affect earnings twenty

years after attending. It is also interesting to ask whether or not

quality of college has an increasing or decreasing effect on earnings over

time. To this end, we estimated earnings functions which include two

quality arjables_undergraduate college quality for those with sixteen

or fewer years of schooling, and quality of graduate school for those

who attended to explain log       of   1969 income, log   of   1955 income, and log

of real income in the initial year of         full-time employment.45

         A   positive correlation between UG and GRAD for those with more
than sixteen years implies the coefficient on graduate quality is higher
than it would be if     were entered for those with more than sixteen

             When this   was done, the      variable was not significant for
years.

 those   with more than sixteen years.
         Three different quality measures are used: the Gourman Index,
 average faculty salary, and average level of S.A.T. math scores of

entering    freshmen.46 The results appear as Table 5. The three 1969 re—

gressions are comparable to columns 1, 3, and 5 of Table 3, where the

quality last variable is not separated by years of attainment. Also, in

Table 11 four occupational dummies are inserted to account for exceptional

income-schooling relationships. Pilots generally had high earnings con-

sidering their education. Teachers usually have much schooling and low

incomes due to fewer hours and alleged non—pecuniary rewards. Doctors

have high incomes, partially due to monopoly elements in their profession;

however, the reason for high pay for lawyers is less clear. The average

of coefficients on        and       is not much different than the comparable

coefficients in Table 8.

        It should be noted, however, that in terms of significance of the

quality variables (t-tests or addition to a2), the 1969 and 1955 results

are rather similar. Moreover, IQ has roughly the same effects on earnings

in both years, and for some reason the coefficient on experience is

greater   in 1955.   Another difference is that the coefficient on years of

education   variable is smaller when using 1955 education. It should be
noted   that in 1955 respondents averaged about 6.6 years of experience.




   46lndividuals were eliminated unless all three appropriate quality
measures were available for them. When the regression for Gourman was
rerun not eliminating for absent S.A.T. or salary data, the sample was
larger, of slightly lower IQ, and had slightly lower average college
quality. In that case, for all three years both the      and       had
smaller (but significant)coefficients. This indicates a positive inter-
action betieén IQ and school quality.

 There   is   evidence that there is a positive relationship between   years of
 education    and   investment in on-the-job training. It is likely that those

 with more years of schooling had been foregoing more earnings while in-

 vesting on the job in the first few years of employment. However, by six

 years out, returns to all human capital acquired appear, and so differences

 in income by education are clouded. On the one hand more earnings are

 foregone by the more highly educated as they obtain more training. On

 the other hand, this group begins to reap returns to their human capital.

The less educated group invests less in OJT (less income is foregone), but

their earnings are lower.

         Table 11 also shows earnings functions explaining income in the

initial year of employment (when experience for each respondent was

zero). Years of education still has a significantly positive effect with

coefficients of over .045. If the argument concerning the 1955 regres-

sions were true, we would expect a negative relationship between income

and years of schooling in the first year in the labor force.        The argu-
ment is that the more educated person is investing further by giving up

income to acquire on—the-job training. Here it appears the more educated

earn more in the first year.

      The IQ variable now becomes significantly negative, perhaps indi-

cating a tendency for those more able to invest more on—the—job train-

ing in initial years in the      labor   force. If the relationship between

ability and investment in on-the-job training is stronger than that be-

tween years    of   education and OJT, this might explain why the coefficient




                                                                                  .
                                                —47—




on   years remains significantly positive in the initial year earnings func-

tions. Moreover, to the extent that years of schooling serves as a cre-

dential, or screening device, to allocate those with more years into

better paying first jobs (which still might provide on-the-job training),

we would also expect a positive coefficient on years.

         Another   problem in   comparing the earnings functions at different

points    in the life cycle is the differences in data reliability. The
1969 income data were obtained in a 1970 survey and the 1955 income was
learned from a survey in 1955. However, the initial year's income was
obtained by asking a "recall" question in 1969. The implication is that
the initial year earnings figures are far inferior to those from the
other two years studied.
         Schooling quality    is never statistically significant in the initial

year earnings functions for either those with sixteen or fewer years or
those with graduate training. It is apparent that the importance of
college quality grows with experience in       the   labor force. One reason
might   be that    students   in better colleges are better prepared to benefit

from   on-the-job training in their post-school lives.
        Tables 12 and 13 reestimate the earnings functions for different
points   in the life cycle separately for individuals who attended sixteen

or fewer years and for individuals who attended graduate school. More—

over, in these estimates education is defined as that education possessed

by   the individuals in 1955, and the occupational categories are also

based on 1955 responses rather than responses obtained in 1969. Despite

 these revisions in the estimates, the results are virtually identical with

 the previous table. Education is significant throughout the period, as is

 IQ generally. However, college and graduate school quality is not sig-

 nificant for either group in their first year in the labor force, but it

 becomes statistically significant by 1955 for both groups and becomes

 even more significant with a larger coefficient in the 1969 earnings func-

 tion. It is also interesting to note that about 6 per cent of the variance

 for those who had sixteen or fewer years of education can be explained in

each of the years. However, for those with some graduate education the

R2 rises from roughly .06 in the initial year of earnings to .12 in 1955

and to .19 in 1969. It appears that the variables in our earnings func-

tion become progressively more important determinants of earnings over

time for those with the highest levels of education, whereas the factors

not included play a larger and constant role over time for those with

sixteen or fewer years of schooling.47




ual
   47Christopher Jencks attributes the large amount of variance in individ-
     earnings not explainable by traditional variables to the fact that
luck and random forces predominate and are the main influences on individ-
ual income  differences. Certainly there are random elements involved in
lifetime earnings streams. We would like to stress the things we do know
about income determination rather than the things we don't know. However,
it does appear from these regressions at different points in the life
cycle that random elements are a weaker force for those people who attend
graduate school, and this luck or randomness seems to decline over time
for those who have attended graduate school. On the other hand, the un-
explainable portion of income differences among individuals is the same
for those with sixteen or fewer and those with more than sixteen years of
schooling when they initially enter the labor force. However, the role
of these random forces does not seem to decline over time for those who
do not go to graduate school, contrary to what happens for those who do



                                                                              .

            The strong results we get when we attempt to explain differences in

     individual incomes at different points in the life cycle lead us to see

    whether a similar model explains the growth rate of income for individ-

    uals between the years 1955 and 1969. It appears        once   again in Table 14 that we

    can only explain a small amount of the difference in growth rates among

    individuals for those who had sixteen or fewer years of education.

    Moreover, none of the variables in the model that were significant in

    explaining income differences in any one year had a t-value greater

    than 2 when used to explain the growth rate of income between the two

    dates specified. For those with more than sixteen years of schooling

    the R2 is almost . 15, more than four times greater than the R2 for the

    undergraduates.      It appears that differences in years of education, IQ,
    and   quality   of at least undergraduate school have statistically sig-
    nificant effects in explaining the growth rate of income. These re-
    sults are even more difficult to interpret because of the small sample
    sizes. The samples are small because the income growth figure was cal-
    culated only for those who had incomes in both 1955 and 1969.


VI. How Quality Makes Its Impact

           Earlier in the paper we noted that institutional variables relating

   to student quality and some relating to faculty salaries were separate

   and significant determinants of college quality. Since then, we have

   reverted to using the Gourman     ratings   as our measure of quality.

   These are highly correlated with the S.A.T. and salary data but are avail-

   able for a larger number of institutions. This enables our sample sizes

 to   be larger, a fact that is particularly important when we start sub-

 dividing the samples. This section will continue to employ       the   Gourman

 ratings   for these reasons.

        The assumption so far   has been   that quality has its impact as a

 Continuous variable. The assumption is that not only do good schools

mean more in terms of lifetime earnings than do bad schools, but also

 that schools better by a certain number of points are worth a certain

amount more in terms of lifetime income. That is, there is some trans-

formation coefficient that can tell us how much more in terms of, say,

dollars in 1969 it was worth to our respondents to have attended a

school better than another by a certain number of quality points. It

is now time to ask whether quality does function as a continuous vari-

able or whether the significance of quality when used as a continuous

variable resulted merely because gross differences in schools are im-

portant but fine gradations of differences are not.

        To this end, we separated our sample into those with sixteen or

fewer years and those with seventeen or more years, and within each of

those two subgroups we looked at individuals who had attended schools

in each of four quality quartile rankings. These results appear as

Tables 15 and 16. For those without any graduate training, the co-

efficients on undergraduate quality within each quality quartile was

virtually always insignificant. In several quality quartiles the co-

efficient on quality was negative also. Variations on quality within

a quartile appear to be significant only for those who attended schools

in the top quality quartile.*


   *The significant quality variable was the expenditure per student - a
different criteria than the one used to divide individuals into "quality
quartiles."

        For   the undergraduates it should be noted that the effect of years

attended rose continually from the lowest to the highest quartile. This

is a sign of a positive interaction between years attended and college

quality in affecting lifetime earnings. More about this will come later.

It also appears that the impact of IQ rises continually from the lowest

to the second—highest quality quartile, but IQ becomes statistically in-

significant for those attending schools ranked in the top-quality quar-

tile.

        The results for those students who had at least some graduate

training are quite similar. For students attending schools in the

lower two quality quartiles, the quality of their undergraduate or

graduate school attended was insignificant and at times negative.

surprisingly, those who attended graduate schools ranked in the third

(next to highest) quartile revealed significant effects of quality of

graduate schools on 1969 earnings, and those in the fourth quartile, or

the highest quality schools, revealed a somewhat weaker effect than was

revealed in the third quartile,     but   one nearer to significance compared

to those in the lower half of the quality distribution. It also appears

that the effect of years attended on income falls between the lowest and

next—to-highest quality quartile but is highest and significant in the

top—quality quartile also. Differential impacts of IQ across quality

quartiles also appears U—shaped, with IQ being most significant in the

lowest quartile, declining through the third quartile, and being rela-

tively high again in the top-quality quartile.



                                                                                .

         The results for both   undergraduate       and graduate students appear to

 imply that although large differences in college quality matter, once

 we have subdivided individuals according to gross differences in the

 types of college attended, small differences within these categories

 don't much matter. As a test, we developed a set of dummy variables

 that for any individual equaled zero in three cases and one for the

variable representing that quality quartile in which the school he

attended fell. We then estimated an earnings function for all those

with sixteen or fewer years and then for all those with more than six-

teen years, inserting dummy variables representing three of the four

quality quartiles. This estimate appears as Table 17. It appears

that to be in the top—quality quartile of schools
                                                             implies a higher in-
come, and to be in the bottom quartile implies a smaller income than

average, but the two middle quartiles basically yield average coeffi-

cients. We then    divided   quality distribution of schools into
                             the

eighths rather than quarters and inserted seven of the
                                                       eight dummies as
independent variables in the earnings function. This is presented in
Table 18. Once    again it              that to be
                             appeared                 in   the top two-eighths of
the   quality distribution if you had only attended as an undergraduate,

or to be in the top three-eighths of the
                                                quality distribution if you

had some graduate training, would result in a statistically significant,

higher—than_average income. Moreover, it also appeared that those who

attended schools of the lowest quality had
                                                    lower-than-average incomes.
In conclusion, it appears that it matters whether you are attending a

good or a bad school. It is better to go to a good school. However, within
any set of, say, good schools, it does not matter much about small differ-

ences in quality.

        Another way to look at sante type of question is to see the significance

of quality, as measured by the Gourman ratings, for schools within a par-

ticular categorization of institutions. The categorization we select is that

of the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education. They place institutions into

categories such as "leading" and "other research" institutions (codes 10 and

20), "large" and "small doctoral—granting" institutions (codes 30 and 40),

four-year   colleges with "large" and "small program selections" (codes 50 and
60),   and "liberal arts" colleges,   "highly selective," and "others"   (codes 70
and    80). We have combined certain of these categories and looked at the

effects of Gourman quality on earnings of individuals who attended particular

categories of institutions.

        Table 19 reveals that for those without graduate training, differences

in expenditures per student, as well as differences in Gourman ratings, were

significant factors in income determination, even when students were initially

categorized into those who attended one of the four university types and those

who attended one of the four types of college. However, quality differences

set to matter more (according to the t-test) for those attending universities

than it did for those attending colleges. For those who had some graduate

training, it appeared that differences in Gourman rating or expenditures      per
student were significant for those who attended graduate school at leading

research or doctoral-granting institutions (codes 10 through 40). Apparently,

134 people who went to graduate school went to institutions with codes be-

tween 50 and 80. Presumably, these were people who got only a master's

degree, and for them differences in Gourman or expenditures were not sig-

nificant factors in the earnings function.

         It should be noted that when individuals were further separated into

finer classifications, as determined by Carnegie (that is, research univer-

sities, doctoral-granting universities, four-year colleges, and liberal

arts colleges), it appeared that quality became progressively less inipor—

tant as the Carnegie codes      increased   for undergraduates as well as for

graduates.48 However, it should be noted that for both those with less

than    seventeen   and with seventeen or more years of schooling, differences

in quality were most     significant   for those at research institutions and

for those at doctoral-granting institutions. When the average S.A.T.

scores of entering freshmen and average faculty salary variables were

used as measures of quality within Carnegie classes, they were signif i—

cant primarily at the leading research universities and doctoral institu-

tions as we1l. These results are not presented.

        We have established that small differences in quality of institu-

tions attended do not explain income differences among individuals

categorized according to the quartile rating of the university they

     attended.   However, quality does explain income differences among people

     categorized according to the type   of   institution attended. This implies

     that the variation in quality of institutions categorized into combined

     Carnegie classifications is greater than is the variance in quality

    among institutions classified by quality quartiles. When we look at

    smaller combinations of Carnegie classes or at individual Carnegie

    classes, it appears that college quality is not as important an ex-

    planatory variable in explaining income differences of people attending

    a particular type of college.


VII. The Trade-Off Between Quantity and Quality of Education

          So far we have determined that quality coefficients increase in

    size and significance with years of school attended (the coefficients

    are higher for those with graduate school training compared to those

    with only undergraduate training). Moreover, the years's coefficient

    rises as the quality of colleges attended by undergraduates rises (the

    evidence is from comparing quality quartiles into which those attend-

    ing sixteen or fewer years have been divided). The year's coefficient

    is U-shaped when comparing graduate quality quartiles for those with

    seventeen or more years. That is, the year's coefficient is high in

    the lowest quartile, falls in the second quality quartile, but con-

    tinues to rise, with the highest quality quartile demonstrating the

    largest year's coefficient. These results imply that the payoff to

    going to a good school is higher if you go to school for more years.

However, this does not answer the question of whether we can say that two

years at Harvard are better than more years at a lower quality institution.

Rather, these results imply that more years at Harvard are worth more than

fewer   years at Harvard.
        Table 20 divides    those people who attended school for seventeen or

more   years according   to the   quality of their undergraduate   institution.

The   purpose here is to see whether the quality of a graduate school and
the   impact of more years attended varied according to the undergraduate

institution attended. It does appear that the year's coefficient is

significantly greater for those who attended undergraduate schools ranked

in the lowest two quality quartiles. The year's coefficient is not even

statistically significant according to the t-test for those in the top

half of the undergraduate quality distribution. Hence, it appears that

extra years are more important for those who went to a bad undergraduate

school than for those who went to a good one. Moreover, it appears that

the payoff to quality of graduate school rises continuously as we move

from individuals who attended the lowest quality undergraduate schools

to those who attended the next-to-highest quality. However, for those

who attended the highest quality undergraduate schools the payoff to

quality of graduate school is almost as low as that in any quartile. It

appears that there is a complementarity between the quality of undergraduate

school and the quality of graduate school. Once again even though you can

partially compensate for going to a bad sähool by attending for more years,

the payoff to going to a good school is higher for those whose earlier ex-




                                                                                  .
perience was also at a good school.

VIII.TheDifferences in Effects of Quality in
    Public and in Private Institutions

           There   are a number of reasons for looking at the effects of quality
    of institutions attended broken down according       to those who attended pri-

    vate institutions and those who attended public ones. In the first place,

    the question might be raised of whether or not a private institution can

    allocate   its expenditures more effectively and, hence, make a given ex-

    penditure per full-time equivalent student more effective in terms of

    lifetime benefits for the student. Here I refer to the multitude of

    constituencies that, by necessity, are served by a public institution.

    If one looks at athletic programs, for example, it seems that in general

    it is the public schools that engage in these most extensively.* It might
    be that a public institution has a greater diversity of objectives than

    does private institutions, regardless of its quality. This does appear

    to be the case. Tables 21 and 22 show that basic expenditures per

    student and expenditures on faculty, research, and library facilities

    both affect those with sixteen or fewer and seventeen or more years of

    schooling more when they attend a private school than when they attend a

    public school. This implies to me that any level of expenditures will be

    directed towards activities which are more beneficial in terms of future

    lifetime   earnings by a private school.
           Moreover, it appears that   the   returns to quality,   as measured by

    the Gourman Index,    are higher for those attending private than for those
    attending public schools. The Gourman      Index   is a composite of a number
    of characteristics,   including size of the institution. Hence, it appears



               *For example, in Playboy Magazine's predictions of the 1973 top
    twenty college football teams in the nation, they anticipate that 17 of the
    top twenty teams will be from public institutions. See Playboy, September,
    1973. p. 172.

    that   one might obtain a high Gourman   rating   for many different reasons,

    including size of institution, effectiveness of instruction, interest

    of alumni, quality of students, etc. One        might   explain the greater

    effectiveness of Gourman   quality   in the private schools by the fact

    that a private school with a high Gourman rating might have obtained

    that high rating because of different characteristics than those pos-

    sessed by a public school with high ratings. For example, a private

    school might be rated high because of the effectiveness of its in-

    structional   proqram, whereas a public school might be rated high be-
    cause of its size. However, it is useful to note that whether quality
    is   measured in terms of expenditures per student or in terms of this
    subjective evaluation, the payoff to quality is higher at private in-
    stitutions. This probably   says something about the meaning of the

   quality variables and implies that a high rating on a quality index of

   one kind or another might mean a number of things. Probably the private-

   public differentiation is a significant way of subdividing the quality

   measures. This does not say that private schools are more effective for

   obtaining higher lifelong earnings than are public institutions. Rather

    the results imply that if one had to choose between two schools with the

    same quality ratings, the private school would be the more effective one.


IX. The Interaction Between School Quality and      the
    Ability of the Individuals Who Attend
           So far we are able to conclude that an individual's lifetime earn-

   ings pattern will vary depending upon the nature of the institutions of
                                         — 70 —




higher   education he attends. The traits of universities we observe to be

important include subjective evaluations, objective data on institutional

differences, college type as defined by the Carnegie Commission, and

whether or not the institution is under private or public control. Al-

though we have controlled for certain characteristics of the individuals

in   our sample, the focus so far    has been     to determine   the average   impacts
of different   aspects of institutional quality on incomes of all members

of our sample considered     together.
        It is possible that   the   impacts of college quality differ depending
upon the nature of the individuals attending. That is, college quality
differences might be more important,       or     less important, in a sample of

individuals with exceptionally high, or exceptionally low, ability. If

the   relationship between   quality   of college    attended and subsequent earn-

ings of an individual depends upon the level of the individual's ability

than there is said to be     an interaction between individual ability and
school   quality in the earnings    relationship.49       It is the purpose of




     49The relationship which includes interaction between ability and college
quality   may be written

                  ln Y     a + bQ + cA + gQ.A,                                   (1)


where in Y is log of income, Q is college quality and A is the individual's
ability. Hence


                 dY_b+gA.                                                        (2)


If g is greater than zero, than the effect of any level of school quality
is greater, the higher the ability of the individual concerned. A negative
g implies an inverse relationship. This specification assumes a linear
interaction between the two continuous dependent variables. Another type
of test can be suggested which does not constrain the interaction to be
linear. The method involves grouping the sample by similar IQ levels (e.g.
IQ quartiles) and estimating earnings functions separately for each IQ
quartile. Comparisons can be made of quality coefficients across groups.

 this section     to   determine whether   or not there is   an interaction between
 school quality    and individual ability in the sense just described.

         First,   sepaate regressions similar       to   those presented in Table 6
 (i.e., including IQ, YRSED, £XP, and EXPSQD along with quality of the
last institution attended) were estimated for individuals in our sample
with   IQs above the sample mean (700        observations) and    below the mean

 (811 observations), The question asked is whether the effect of quality

differed according to the ability of those who attend. Table 23 presents

the elasticities, derived as the product of the coefficient on quality

Cd in Y/dQ) and the mean values of quality. According to the t-test, the

impact of quality       is significantly greater    for the higher ability sub-

sample   for all definitions     of quality but one.5° (For S.AT. math the

elasticities were not significantly different.) These regressions from

which Table 23 is derived reveal that coefficients on IQ were generally

 nafler for the high-ability group; the coefficients on years in school

and experience were generally larger for the high-ability group. The

model explains 9 to 10 per cent of the variance in 1969 income for those

with ability above the mean, but only 4 to 5 per cent            of the variance of
income of the lower-ability group was explained.51




   50The t—test was H0 : BH
                             BH
                                   theis       coefficient of quality for the
high ability half of the sample and B is the quality coefficient for
the low ability half.               L


   51When S.A.T. and average salaries are put in together, their effects
are both more significant (t-test) and larger (size of coefficient) for
the high IQ half of the sample.

   °The tests are whether there are significant differences in the elasticities for the high and low IQ parts of the
sample. Differences are significant where t—values exceed 2.0 (approximately)

        These strong results led us to subdivide the sample further into IQ

 quartiles, separately for those with sixteen or fewer years of schooling

 and for those with seventeen or more years of schooling. These regres-

 sions appear as Table 24. For the first group the Gourman measure of the

quality of the undergraduate institution attended was used, and for those

with some graduate training the measure of both undergraduate and graduate

institutional quality were inserted. For the undergraduate group the ef-

fect of college quality was greatest for the lowest IQ quartile. However

from the second lowest to highest IQ quartile college quality appeared

to have an increasing effect. For those with some graduate training,

this   "U-shaped" effect of quality was evident in regard to the measure of
graduate institution attended. The lowest IQ quartile had a large and
statistically the   most significant effect on 1969 earnings. However,
from the second lowest to the highest IQ quartile the effects rose,

starting with an impact below   that of the lowest quartile but rising so
that   the highest IQ quartile reveals the largest impact of graduate

quality on earnings. It should also be noted that undergraduate quality

was not statistically significant except in the top IQ quartile for those

who had graduate training.

       It is interesting that most of the other variables which are used

in the earnings functions appearing in Table 24 do not reveal systematic

patterns   across IQ quartiles for either educational attainment group.
Moreover we are never able to   explain much more than 10 per cent of the

variance   in income for those with no graduate training but we always

explained   over 26 per cent of the variance in income of those with graduate

training.

      It appears then that regardless of whether or not one went to graduate

school the effect of going to a good school was greater for those with

greater ability compared   to most   of those with lesser ability. However, it

is also true that those in the lowest ability group were significantly

affected by the quality of the institutions they attended, probably as much

as those in the highest ability group.

      It should be stressed again that no matter what one's ability is, he

will be better of f attending a good school compared to one of lower quality.

However it appears that if one falls into either the top or bottom extreme

of the IQ distribution, the impact of going to a good school or to a bad

school would be greater than if one falls in the average range of ability.

We should also remember that the sample beinq studied contains individuals

falling in the upper half of the IQ distribution for the nation as a whole.

This implies that our top IQ quartile resembles the top eighth in the

nation and our bottom IQ quartile probably contains people with IQ's

slightly above the national norm.

      We must also keep in mind the fact that the range of qualities of

institutions attended by those in our top quartile probably includes

better institutions than are included in the range of institutions

attended by those in the lowest IQ quartile. If our estimations had re-

vealed a continuously positive interaction between ability and college

quality, this might have been due to the fact that the effect of
                                      — 76 —




differences   in institutional quality were somewhat greater among individ-

uals who attended better quality institutions. However Tables 5 and 6

revealed earlier that the impacts of quality according to relative

quality of institutions attended was somewhat tenuous. Hence the "U-

shaped" interaction between ability and college quality appears con-

sistent with earlier results.

        So far within IQ quartiles we have inserted college quality as a

separate variable. The question arises whether the explanatory power

of the model would be increased significantly if we insert the measure

of quality explicitly as   an   interactive variable with ability. To this

end   we have estimated the four equations which appear in Table 25.
Equation 1 attempts to explain earnings differences among all those
with less seventeen years   of schooling   by our traditional set of vari-
ables   including a measure of the quality of the undergraduate institu-

tion attended. Equation 3 replaces the single variable measure of

undergraduate quality by a set of four variables. First we create

four dummy variables. The first being one if an individual falls in

the lowest IQ quartile and zero otherwise, the second being one if the

individual falls in the second lowest IQ quartile and zero otherwise,

etc. For any one individual three of the dummies will be zero and only

one will equal one. Each of the four dummies are then multiplied by the

quality of the individual's institution. Hence for each individual we

have four variables one being the quality of the college the individual

attended and the other three being zero. This is a way of seeing




                                                                              .

whether quality has a differential impact depending upon which ability
quartile the individual falls in. Similarly equation 2 estimates the

generalized earnings function for those with some graduate work, and

column 4 is the same equation but with quality measures for the grad-
uate institutions attended being sorted into four IQ groups.

      In equations 3 and 4 we are basically asking the same type      of

question   as were asked when the sample was subdivided and equations
estimated   separately for individuals falling into different IQ quar-

tiles. However in the equations currently being considered we cofl-

strain coefficients on years of schooling, experience, IQ, and the

occupational effects to be the same for all individuals within a

schooling attainment category. Hence in one respect these latest es-

timates are less general    and more restrictive than the   ones in the
previous    tables. It is   interesting to note that for undergraduates    in

this case the coefficients on quality fall continuously from the low-

est to the highest IQ quartile.      Indeed   the coefficient on the quality

variable multiplied by the highest IQ dummy       is not even statistically
significant.    On the other hand the quality coefficients for those

with some graduate work rise continually from the lowest to the high-

est IQ quartile. Since there is no reason to constrain the model such

that other variables have the same effect regardless of the individual's

IQ category, more reliability should be placed on the equations in

Table 24.




                                                                                .

         The latest table was prepared to see if the total power of the model

has increased when interaction is explicitly introduced. The                in equ-

ation 1 when quality was introduced as a single variable for undergraduates

was .0729 and the R2 in equation 3 when quality was interacting with four

IQ dunmies was .0732. An F-test to determine whether or not there was a

significant difference in R2's between the two        equations   revealed very

clearly that there was no significant difference. Similarly when com-

paring equation 2 and equation 4 there was no significant difference in
                              52
R2,s of .3047 and .3054.

      We can conclude that institutional quality is a significant factor

in determining an individual's lifetime earnings. Moreover most tests

reveal that the impact of quality is somewhat greater for individuals

with more ability compared to individuals with less. However it does

appear   that the   least   able in our sample   (who resemble the average in-

dividual in the society as a whole) are affected by the quality of the
institution they attended by roughly the same amount as are the top
people in terms of ability in our sample. Moreover, it seems             that any

tests of interaction between institutional quality and individual ability

should be based on estimates of earnings functions which allow other

variables therein to take different values for individuals of different

levels of ability. That is, inconsistencies in results develop when the




   521n both cases the significant F-level at 5 per        cent   was   2.60 and the
F for undergraduates was .32 and for graduates .57.
                                      — 80 —




model is constrained such that all, individuals in the sample are similarly

influenced by years attended, experience, occupational choice, and the

like. However, the differences in impacts of institutional quality, on

individuals of different levels of ability do not appear to be major.

Our model's explanatory power is not strengthened when we introduce

college quality as a variable explicitly interacting with ability. If

there is an interaction, the joint influence of quality and ability does

not add much to the separate influences of the two factors on income.

        It probably is sufficient to assert that both institutional quality

and individual ability are significant factors in the earnings function

and stop there. A policy implication is that each individual should seek

the best quality schools possible regardless of ability. If the question

for the broader society is whom to encourage to attend the institutions of

highest quality the problems become confounded and very difficult. It

appears that the most able students should be encouraged to attend the

best schools because their income from so doing will increase by the

largest percentage as revealed by the coefficients on quality. However,

the policy question involves much more than efficiency since even the

least able students will get extra income from going to a better school.

        One   further attempt to get at the relationship between individual
ability and institutional quality was made. Separately for those with
sixteen or fewer and seventeen or more years of schooling, the sample
was divided into those with IQ's above the mean and those with IQ's

below   the   mean. Within each of these IQ halves the sample was divided




                                                                              .
                                     — 81 -




into    those who attended schools of above mean quality and those who attended

schools of below mean quality. For each attainment level four samples of

individuals were obtained: those with below average ability at below aver-

age institutions, those with below average ability at above average quality

institutions, those with above average ability at above average institutions,

and those with above average ability at below average institutions. These

resulta are presented in Table 26. Once again when comparing the eight

separate earnings functions estimated, the results are more or less system-

atic but the reasons for them are somewhat unclear. Within only one of the

eight estimates were differences in individual abilities significant in ex-

plaining 1969 income. Ability differences among individuals with some grad-

uate training, below average IQ, attending below average quality institutions

had a significant effect. But thia was the only case. On the other hand

in seven of the eight estimates differences in years attended had a signifi-

cantly positive effect on later income. For undergraduates the coefficient

on years was most important in the high IQ, high college quality group. We

must remember that the years coefficient in this case is constrained to being

no greater than sixteen and so this result might be interpreted that among

all those with a B.A. or less who attended college, the payoff to attending

would   be   greatest if you graduated and if you graduated from a better-than-

average quality school and had above average IQ. It should be pointed out

that the coefficient on years in this case was lower than that coefficient

in virtually all of the cases of people attending for more than sixteen

years. For some reason, those doing graduate work with lower than average

ability    attending high quality institutions did not have a significant pay-

off to additional years of schooling beyond bachelor's degrees. However

those with lower than     average   ability doing graduate work at lower than

average quality institutions found the largest rewards to attending for

extra years: in this cases getting the graduate degree probably had

special value in detracting from the individual's ability and institutional

quality.

        The coefficients on the relevant quality measures appear more system-

atic and quite interesting. For both attainment categories individuals

attending the high quality institutions were revealed to have a significantly

positive relationship between quality of institution and subsequent earnings.

This result applied to individuals in both the high and low IQ halves of the

sample. On the other hand, individuals who attended institutions of below

average   quality revealed that differences in quality of institutions attended

did not significantly affect income regardless of attainment and of whether

or not they were above or below average in IQ. For undergraduates it

appeared that the returns to quality of their institution attended were

greater and more significant for those with below average 1Q, implying some-

thing of a trade-off between    institutional     quality and   individual 's ability.

For   those   with some graduate work, the coefficient on quality was larger for

those in the higher IQ higher quality subset although the difference between

this coefficient and the coefficient on quality for those             (with below averagE

ability) in high quality institutions was very small. Finally, it should

be noted that the coefficient on years attended and on quality          were lowest
                                       — 84 —




for    those without graduate training who fell in both the below average

ability and below average college quality categories. The explained

variance was the lowest in this case as well. As usual, we can explain

substantially more of the variance for those with more than sixteen

years of schooling.

        Once again when we subdivide the sample into such fine detail, we

get results which differ depending upon the category studied. However

it does appear that there are positive interactions in a number of the

cases. Differences in individual abilities, years of schooling obtained,

and quality of institutions attended have generally significant effects

on lifetime earnings patterns. The magnitude of the relationship be-

tween   any of these     explanatory variables and income varies but in no

case   is the explanatory variable able to explain huge amounts of the
variance of income. Indeed the R2 never goes above .35, even when the
independent variable list includes dummies for certain professions and
occupations.     It   is sufficient to say that each of the three major   vari-

ables are significant in contributing to the earnings model, and this is

based primarily     on   the consistency of the positive impacts of institu-

tional quality,      ability, and years of schooling on subsequent earnings
rather than    on   the revelations regarding interaction among these.

X. The Introduction of Family Background Variables

          The "proper" method of measuring socio-econcmic status is still being
  debated. Karabel and         Astin53   have recently argued     that socio-econcmic

  status   is positively correlated with college quality. If this is                  so, then
  omission of SES as an explanatory variable has biased upward                 the   effects we
  attribute to quality. Iloreover,         }Iauser54   and   Bow].es55 have   attempted to
  prove that   father's income (rather than education or occupational status)

  is the appropriate measure of SES.

          Our data set has measures of father's educational attainment and
  father's occupational status. The latter is composed of three dummies

   (indicating high, medium, and low). We also have a measure of wife's

  father's education. Each of these has been used to stand for SES and

  are probably correlated with father's income which we do              not   have.

          Table 27 introduces the SES variables available in our sample into

  our standard earnings functions separated by those with and without grad-

  uate training. Several facts stand out. The introduction of SES measures

  reduces the size and statistical significance of the quality variables

only    very slightly and these quality variables are     still powerful   in ex-

plaining individual income differences.56 It is also interesting that

for those without graduate work, incomes were significantly positively

affected by the educational attainment of wife's father and        if   one's own

father was in an occupation in the      top third   of the status scale. How-

ever none of the SES measures were significant in explaining income

differences among those with graduate training. Despite the power of

the   SES variables in the lower   educational attainment group, we can      ex-
plain only 9 per cent of the variance in log of income there but 31 per
cent of    the variance for those with more than sixteen years of school.

These   results do not change when the occupational dummies are dropped
except that wife's father's education becomes significant for the
graduate group as   well.   In   this case the differences in proportion of

variance   of income explained is smaller. When regressions were run by
IQ quartiles including the SES measures, the        same U-shaped patterns

appeared   for the quality variables.
  Unless our SES measures are grossly     inadequate, which is doubtful,

it appears that college quality has impacts above those which might
really be reflecting family background. Once again it appears that
quality   of schools attended has a real effect and is not merely a

proxy for other factors.

 XI. Implications

             We have found that quality of institutions of higher education

 has   an important impact on lifetime earnings of those who attend.
A subjective evaluation of institutions (the Gourinan index) was
used to measure quality in many of the estimated equations, but
it appears that certain objective traits which contribute to these
evaluations can be isolated. In particular, average student

quality as measured by the average SAT scores of entering freshmen,

and    faculty   salaries are strongly related to the Gourman   indez÷
and    the   most important of the measureab].e institutional traits in

the    earnings functions of former students.
         Quality    seems to be more important for students with   more years
of higher education and also for more able students. It affects
later incomes more than it influences incomes immediately upon entering
the labor force. Differences       in institutional quality among private

colleges      are more important than   those among public schools. These results

hold even after controlling for certain occupational choices, individual

ability, and socio-econoiuic background.

         There are certain limitations on the usefulness of the results

as presented so far. Although we have made statements about the statis-

tical relationship between school quality and later earnings, we have

been unable to do much cost-benefit or rate of return analyses.

That is, although the average SAT scores of entering freshmen is a

significant factor in later earnings of individuals who attend, we do

not know (1) how a school might go about improving the average SAT's,
                                             —89—




 (2) how much it would cost to raise average SAT's by any      amount or
percentage, and hence, (3) the rate of return to students (and presum-

ably the school) of the school successfully raising the average SAT

scores    of its students. Almost all our measures of quality cannot
easily   be considered in cost terms, and so     rates of return to these
aspects   of quality are impossible to estimate.

         However, we do have data on average expenditures per student

for faculty, research and library which we have used to measure

college quality at times throughout this study. It is possible to

get something like an estimate of the rate of return to these expendi-

tures, by considering the percentage change in 1969 income of a student

for a given percentage change in per student expenditures roughly 20

years earlier. For the following calculations we use the 1969

earnings functions in Table 13 where quality is measured by per

student expenditures.

         By multiplying the mean expenditures per student times the

coefficient    on the expenditure variable we can get the percentage
change   in an individual's   1969   income for a percentage change in
expenditure per student at the institution he attended earlier.

          The coefficient on expenditures is din Inc
                                                    d Exp.
         and   d in Inc
               d   Exp
                            time   mean expenditures
         equals    d Inc/Inc which is the percentage change in income
                   d Exp/Exp   for a one percent change in expenditures.

For those with 16 or fewer years, a one percent change in per studente

expenditures at their undergraduate college resulted in a .147 percent

increase in 1969 income; and for those with graduate attendance, a

one percent increase in per student expenditures by the graduate

schools resulted in a .180 percent increase in 1969 income.

         Using   sample means for   1969 incomes of our sample members and

per   student   expenditures by the institutions, it can be shown that

a one dollar per student increase in spending by an institution would

result in an increase in income twenty years later of $2.51 for those

with 16 or fewer years and of $2.82 for those with        17 or more years.58

         When evaluating this investment by the schools (or the govern-

ment   or alumni who finance institutions) in      increasing per student

spending,   we must recognize that the     payoff we have reported comes

twenty   years after the fact. Hence we must ask what is the       value


today   of $2.51 tweny-one years later in one case, and of      $2.82 nineteen


years    later in   the other. This, of course, requires knowledge about

discount rates applied by those to whom the benefits will accrue.




          58The relevant means are as follows:
                                                       UG              GRAD
                            1969 income              $16,500         $18,200
                            Per Student Expenditures      966          1,160
                            Job Experience in 1969     21 yrs.         19 yrs.

        For example a 1% increase in spending per undergraduate (i.e. $9.66)
 would result in a $24.26 increase in 1969 income (.00147 times $16,500).
 Hence, a $1 increase in spending would imply a 1969 salary increment of
                                            other variables in the earnings
 $2.51. These results are holding constant
 functions.
