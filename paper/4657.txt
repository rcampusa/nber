of explaining the structure of worldwide rates of return than does the classic CAPM. In the
specification of that test, moments of rates of return were allowed to vary over time in relation
to a number of lagged "instrumental variables". Dumas and Solnik used instrumental variables
which were endogenous or Internal" to the financial market (lagged world market portfolio rate
of return, dividend yield, bond yield, short-term rate of interest). In the present paper, I use as
insmiments economic variables which are "external" to the financial market, such as leading
indicators of the business cycles. This is an attempt to explain the behavior of the international
stock market on the basis of economically meaningful variables which capture "the state of the
economy'1. I find that the leading indicators put together by Stock and Watson (NBER working
paper no. 4014, 1992) as predictors of the U.S. business cycle also predict stock returns in the
U.S.. Germany. Japan and the United Kingdom. These instruments lead again to a rejection of
the classic CAPM and no rejection of the international CAPM.

  Introduction

  Previous work by Dumas and Solnik (1993) has shown that a CAPM which

  incorporates foreign-exchange risk premia (a so-called 'international CAPM")

  is better capable empirically of explaining the structure of worldwide rates

  of return than is    the   classic CAPM. The teat was performed on the conditions

  version    of the two competing CAPHs. By that is meant that moments of rates o
  return were allowed to vary over time in relation to a number of lagged
   instrumental variables'. Dumas and        Solnik   used instrumental, variables which
  were endogenous or "internal' to the financial market           (lagged   world market
  portfolio rate of return,      dividend   yield, bond yield, short-term rate of
  interest).
       In the present paper, I aim to use as       instruments   economic   variables whic
  are external" to the financial market, such as leading indicators of
  business   cycles. This is an attempt to explain the behavior of the

  international stock market on the basis of economically meaningful variables

  which   capture the state of the economy'.
       The stock market is widely regarded as the best predictor of itself. A
  large body of empirical work shows that asset prices are predictors of the
  future level of activity or, generally, the future Level of economic
  variables)     Several leading indexes of economic activity make use of          this
  property   of asset prices.2


                        (1977) show that asset returns predict inflation in the
       1'Fama and Schwert
United States. Stambaugh (1988) has extracted the information concerning
future economic variables that is contained in bond prices. Several authors
have observed that stock prices lead GNP (Fama(198l, 1990), Fama and Gibbons
(1982), Geske and Roll (1983) and Barro (1990)).

      2The list of NBER leading indicators includes, besides exchange rates:
(i) the yield on a constant-maturity portfolio of 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds,
(ii)   the spread between the intrest rate on 6-month corporate paper and the

                                               2
      It may, however, also be true that external" variables can serve to

   explain asset returns. Faaa and French (1989) show that much of the movement

   in "internal" variables is related to business conditions; for instance, the

   term structure spread peaks during recessions. Kandel and Stambaugh (1989)

  show that expected returns peak at the end of a recession and Harvey (l991b)

  shows that the ratio of conditional mean return to variance is

  countercyclical. We show below that a particular set of leading indicators

  (which does not include asset prices) predicts the stock markets of four

  economically developed countries with an in-sample     which is comparable (and

  in some cases superior) to that of "internal" variables.

     From a theoretical stan'!;c!nt, it should be clear that any intertemporal

  General-equilibrium model, such as the models of domestic or international

  business cycles that have appeared recently,3 would generate asset prices

  that would be functions of the stats variables of the economy. In these

  models, the conditional expected values of rates of return would be functions

  of state variables as well. Assuming that the mapping from state variables to

  asset prices is invertible1 conditional expected returns must be functions of

  asset prices. This explains why the stock market predicts itself; a large

  enough number of asset prices can serve as proxy variables for the state

  variables,

     In the course of this substitution, however, the model has lost some of its


rate on 6-month U.S. Treasury bills, (iii) the spread between the yield on a
constant-maturity portfolie of 10-year U.S. T-bonds and the yield on 1-year
tLS. T-bonds. See Stock and Watson (1989). The Department of Commerce list
includes, besides money supply, the Standard and Poors 500 Industrials index
(See Survey of Current Business, current issues).

Crucini (1993), Canova (1993) and Dumas (1992).

empirical, content since the link to the underlying physical. economy has been

severed. Even if one found that stock returns are related to stock prices in

the theoretical way, that would still leave open the question of the

contemporaneous relationship of this perfectly working stock market to the

economy. Does the stock market wove of its own accord or does it remain in

line with the conditions of physical production? More is achieved when

underlying state variables are identified and expected returns are related to

them, than when expected returns are related to asset prices. This paper is a

preliminary investigation into the nature of "the state of the economy", as

revealed by the behavior of asset returns.

   Capital Asset Pricing models can serve as a tool, or sift, in the

identification of state variables. First, one finds variables that can serve

to condition returns (i.e., that have some power to predict rates of return).

Second, one verifies whether the conditional distribution satisfies some asset

pricing restrictions. For instance, can the first moments of returns be made

to match time-varying risk prersia built on second moments, as the conditional

form of the classic CAPH would suggest they should? If not, either the model

is incorrect or the variables have been improperly chosen. The search for the

relevant state variables, which will account for the time variability of asset

returns, is also a search for the relevant model specification.

   This paper is organized as follows. Section 1 is a short reminder of the

"pricing kernel" or marginal-rate-of-substitution approach to CAPM tests.

Section 2 explores the behavior of worldwide asset returns on the basis of

U.S. instrumental variables. Section 3 does the same thing on the basis of

country-specific   instrumental variables. Section 4 concludes.

 1. The pricinf kernel methodology

 The pricing-kerneP method, or marginal-rate-of-substitution method, which

 was initiated by Gallant and Tauchen (1989) and Hansen and .Jagannathan (1991).

 was used in Bansal, }tsieh and Viswanathan (1992) and generalized by Dumas and

 Solnik (1993) to test CAPMs.



 1.1.   The international CAm
Let     there   be L   + 1   countries, a set of m — n         assets -- other than the
                                                           + L +   1


measurement-currency          deposit, - - comprised of n equities or portfolios of
equities,       1.. non-measurement-currency currency deposits and the world portfolio

of equities which is the mth and last asset. The non-measurement-currency

deposits are singled out by observing the above order in the list; i.e., they

are the (n + l)st to (n + L)th assets.

      The international Capital Asset Pricing model is Equation (14) in Adler

and Dumas (1983):



(1)      E[rjIfl1] —
                                Ai1v(r.rj              101) +


where
         rj
                is the nominal return on asset or portfolio J,            j   —   1.. .m,   from time
t - I. to t, in excess of the rate of interest of the
                                                                       currency in which returns

are measured, rt is the excess return on the world market portfolio and
                                                                                                0t-l
is the infonation set which investors use             in   choosing their portfolios. The

time-varying coefficients                  I —   1.. .L,   are the world prices of foreign

exchange risk. The time-varying coefficient Atl is the world price of

market risk. The model takes into account the fact that investors of different

countries view returns differently.


                                                 S
      Equation (1.1) is the result of an aggregation over the several categories

of investors. Equation (14) in Adler and Dumas (1983) provides an

interpretation of the prices of risk. A is a wealth-weighted harmonic mean of

the nominal risk aversions of the investors of the various countries -.                      the

world nominal risk aversion, as it were. A is equal to I -               A       times the
                                          i                                  m
weight of country i in the world where a country's weight is determined by its

wealth tines one minus its nominal risk tolerance.

      By contrast, the classic CAIN ignores investor diversity and assumes1 in

effect, that everyone in the world translates returns into consumption as do

the residents of the reference currency country. Hence, no exchange-risk

hedging premium appears. In the above notations, the restriction of the

international CAPK to the classic CAlM is stated as:




(2)                                Ai1 —    0       i —   I.. .L,   Vt



      In Dunas   and   Solnik (1993). a way has been found of writing the

international CAFM in a parsimonious way, that minimizes the number of

parameters to be estimated. Introduce u, the unanticipated component of the

market's marginal rate of substitution between nominal returns at date t and

at date t-l.           has the property that:




(3)                      EtutlOtli — 0.



Define u as:




                                                6
 (4)               u — 10,t-l +
                                   E1Ai,ti r÷1                  +   Ai r.
 And define h        as:


 (5)               hit —
                               -                     Li — 1         El.



Then, Dumas and Solnik (1993) show that the international CATh Cl) Day be

rewritten as:



(6)                E(hJtIQi] — 0,            —       1,.. .m.

Equations (3) and (6) are the moment conditions used in the GIOf estimation.



1.2. Auxiliary assumptions of the econometric analysis

In this subsection, we state two auxiliary assumptions that are needed for

econometric       purposes. They are identical to the auxiliary assumptions used in
Dumas and Solnik (1993).


Assumption   .1   of the   empirical   analysis: the information 0t-l is generated by a
vector   of instrumental variables
                                         Z1.

       is a row vector of A predetermined instrumental variables which reflect

everything that is known to the investor. One goal of this paper is to

identify the list of Z variables. Assumption 1 is a strong assumption which

does not simply limit the information set of the econometrician; it limits the

information set of the investors and, therefore, their strategy space.


                                                 7
      Next, we specify the way in which the market prices, A, move over time. We

assume that the variables, Z, can serve as proxies for the state variables

and that there exists an exact linear relationship between the As and the U:



Assumption 2:


                  —
                      -ZI16.
(7)        Ai1 —      Z1 i
           Amtl —     z1 ra

Here the £s and Øs are time-invariant vectors of weights which are estimated

by CMX. under the moment conditions (3) and (6).

      Given Assumption 2 and the definition (1.10) of u, we have:



(8)             u —   - Z15    +
                                   Z1              +
                                                       z1 #m    rt




with u satisfying (3). Equation (8) serves to define u from now on.



1.3. Data

We consider the monthly excess return on equity and currency holdings

measured in a common currency, the U.S. dollar. The excess return on an equity

market is the return on that market (cum dividend) translated into dollars,

minus the dollar one-month nominally risk-free rate. The return on a currency

holding is the one-month interest rate4 of that currency compounded by the

exchange rate variation relative to the U.S. dollar, minus the dollar one-


        4These are Euro-currency interest rates provided by Lombard Odier.

   month risk-free rate.

         In this study, we take four countries into account: Germany. the United

   Kingdom, Japan and the United States. More precisely, we consider eight assets

   in addition to the U.S. dollar deposit: the equity index of each country,5 a

   Deutschemark deposit, a Pound Sterling deposit, a Yen deposit and the world

   index of equities. In the CAflI, we include only three exchange risk premia - -

   as many as we have exchange rates in the data set.

         Available index level data cover the period January 1970 to December 1991

  which is a 264 data point series. However, we work with rates of return and in

  earlier work we needed to lag the rate of return on the world index by one

  month in the instrumental-variable set; that left 262 observations spanning

  March 1970 to December 1991. For the sake of comparability, we use here the

  same    time   series of returns.

     As we consider below various instrument sets, preliminary statistics will

  be provided concerning rates of return and their predictability.



  2. U.S.    instrumental   variables




  We first investigate a set of instruments common to all securities. We choose

  United States business cycle variables as a common set. In the next section,

  we explore country-specific variables. The choice of U.S. variables as a

  common set is Justified by Figure 1 which plots coincident indicators of the

 business cycle in the four countries of our sample from 1948-01 to 1993.06.6

  It wakes it plain that in most upturns and downturns the U.S. economy has

  lead the two European economies of our sample. Japan has had at the most two

  downturns s.nce the war; the United States has undergone downturns at about

  the same time. That the U.S. lead other economies is confirmed by Figure 2

 which shows the crosscorrelogram of coincident indicators between the U.S. and

 other countries.7 Figure 2 reveals that U.S. lead Japan and Germany by at

  least twelve months and more strongly lead the U.K. with a lead time of four

 months approximately. That fact also explains Harvey's (l99la) finding that

 U.S. stock market intenial variables are at least as good predictors of

 worldwide rates of return as are country-specific, internal variables.

     Below, we consider two sets of U.S. economic indicators: the Main Economic

  Indicators of the OECD and the component indicators specifically selected by

  Stock and Watson (1992) to lead the U.S. cycles and predict recessions. Each

  time we consider a set of instrumental variables, predictability of returns is

  assessed   by OLS and conformity with the international and classic CAPMs is
  assessed by means   of   the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM).


  2.1.   U.S. Main Economic Indicators (OECD)

  I extracted from the 0.E.C.D. Main Economic Indicators (monthly data) the

  following variables in their seasonally adjusted version for the twenty years

  of our   rate-of-return   sample: (i) the U.S. level of total inventories in


     6These are the coincident indicators calculated by the Center for
International Business Cycle Research (GIBCLQ. as an overall measure of the
overall performance of a country's economy.

     7These represent the correlation between the U.S. and other countries at
various leads and lags, calculated after linear time detrending.


                                           10
 manufacturing industries (noted INV), (ii) U.S. residential construction put

 in place (RES), (iii) U.S. total value of retail sales (RSAL), (iv) U.S.

 percentage unemployment out of the civilian labor force (UNit?)8 (v) U.S.

 commercial bank loans (WAN), (vi) the U.S. money supply 143 (noted 143). All of

 these were selected as being presumably "forward looking variables". Series

 (iv) is stationary naturally. Other series were included in their first

 difference form. Even though it is properly classified as an "internaP

variable, the lagged rate of return on the world market portfolio was added as

an instrument in an attempt to capture potential lagged impacts of instruments
              9
on returns.




   table I contains some descriptive statistics on rates of return,

instrumental variables and their ability to predict rates of return. I

summarize in Table 2 the R2s that have been achieved by Main Economic

Indicators (column 2) and, for purposes of comparison the R2s that had been

achieved by Dumas and Solnik (1593) by means of "internal" variables (column

1). It is observed that the predictive power of the Main Economic Indicators

is generally lower than was that of the "internal" financial   variables. One

variable has a consistent ability in predicting rates of return worldwide: the

increase in U.S. inventories in manufacturing industries1 with a positive

increase of that variable being followed by lower returns.


     8Business cycle experts know that unemployment lags the cycle. The use of
this variable was not a good idea but I refrained from making any changes to
my original list for fear of accusations of data mining.

   9The coefficient of this predictor will be found to be insignificant.

                                      11
      Using these variables as instruments, I proceed to estimate the
 international and the classic CAPMs. The results appear in Tables 3 and 4
 respectively.       The international CAPM yields a p-value of 0.0144 and is
rejected. The classic        CAPM                            is also rejected.
                                    produces a p-value of 0.0064       and

It is not clear whether it is legitimate to test a hypothesis when the
unrestricted model (in this case the international CAPK) is itself rejected. A
Newey-West test does not reject the hypothesis that exchange rate risk
receives a zero price (j —           0. i —   l...L)   (see Table 5, pvalue — 0.086).


2.2. U.S. Leading Economic Indicators (NEE1t)
In    a recent article, Stock and      Watson (1992) have proposed a         leading index

(called flI2) which        does not   refer   to financial variables and       is   instead

constructed from the following leading indicators of the U.S.                 business
           10                                                                                 11

(ii) Average weekly hours of production workers in manufacturing, in level

form (LPHRM), (iii) Vendor performance: percent of companies reporting slower

deliveries, in levels (IVPAC), (iv) Manufacturers'                unfilled   orders in the




     10AlL variables are seasonally adjusted. In addition, Stock and Watson
(1992) include the Trade Weighted Nominal Exchange Rate between the U.S. and
other countries as a leading indicator. We do not        use it
                                                         because it    a      is
financial variable (although it obviously has real effects).

       Observe that we use some of Stock and       Watson's variables in level form,
othersin first-difference form. The issue of stationarity arises.. There is no
evidence that the level variables are non stationary. However, there is a
question of consistency in the comparisons; here we have Housing
authorizations in levels, whereas Construction put in place - - an MEl variable
--   was   used in first-difference form in Section    2. Further investigation is needed.

     Table 6 reports the results of multiple 015 (and          heteroskedasticity
  corrected)    regressions of rates of return     on   these variables.13 For purposes

  of comparison, the overall performance ((2) is transcribed in Table 2. This

  set of instruments predicts stock returns worldwide about as well as do the

  financial    or internal variables used by Dumas and       Solnik. They predict

  currencies    less   well. The outstanding contribution to predictability is that

  of the indicator IVPAC (Vendor Performance) whose t-statistics in regressions

  of the various securities rates of return are respectively: -2.72, -4.23,

  -2.96, -4.05, -0.138, -1.42, -1.62, -4.30. The signs are as expected: an

  increase    in the number of firms   reporting   slower deliveries is followed by
  lower returns on securities. The larger values of t occur          for stock returns.

  The forecasting of currencies presumably rcquLres btlateral instrumental

 variables; U.S. business cycle variables by themselves are insufficient.

 Another valuable contribution is that of HSBP (Housing authorizations), also

     13The indicated variables were used in a VAR          form by Stock and Watson to
predict increments in their index of coincident indicators (XCI). I use here
the raw variables, in the form described, without the VAR form and without
lags. I did reconstruct the implied VAR coefficients that Stock and Watson
used but found that the VAX form predicts securities returns with
approximately the same degree of success as do the raw variables.

  with the anticipated sign.

     Many time series (280 series precisely) were mined by Stock and Watson to

  select variables, and their lags in order to make up an index that predicts

  the three-month increments in their U.S. Index of coincident indicators (XCI.

  defined in Stock and Watson (1989)). It turns out, however, that these

  variables (without lags) also predict U.S. and other stock returns about as

  well as do internal variables. That is not   the   result of data mining.14



    Thereis, of course, an issue concerning the precise timing of releases of
  economic data. Internal variables are observed in real time in the financial
  markets whereas some economic variables are released several weeks after the
  end of the month. In the statistical analysis we have simply used the data
  pertaining to month t-l to predict rates of return over the month
  (t-L, t). That procedure is not congruent with actual release dates. However,
  the variable that is most effective in bringing about predictive performance
  is vendor performance IVPAC. IVPAC   is released by the National Association of
  Purchasing Managers a mere two days after the end of the month.
    Even if economic data are released with some delay by statistical agencies
  and would1 therefore, be available to external observers at that time only, it
  is also true that the investors, whose intonation set we are trying to

     14The correlations between monthly securities returns and one-month

   enjoy the benefits of early estimates.

     Furthermore, financial market prices and flows of goods and services act

  as aggregators of information faster than do statistical agencies. My goal in

   thi, article is not to show that external1 economic variables are superior in

  their predictive ability to internal, financial variables. I use them because

  I believe that their message is more meaningful. I am comfortable with the

  idea that news about economic variables may be released" through the

  channel. inter all., of financial market prices. Even then, I am interested in

  identifying the relevant economic variables.

     The reader may nonetheless wish to know how the results would have been

  affected by a different assumption on the timing of releases. In order to

  provide that information to hi., I have shown in Table 2 the levels of R2s

  attained when the Stock and Watson variables are delayed further by one and

  also two months. Not surprisingly, the predictive performance for stock

  returns deteriorates gradually.15 The predictive performance for currencies,

  which was poor in the first place, is not markedly affected.




     Tables 7 and 8 report on the tests of the two CAPMs based on the Stock and

  Watson leading variables. The overidentifying restrictions of the

  international CAflI are marginally accepted with a p-value of 0.067 and the




     151n my opinion, the gradual deterioration in predictive power that
occurs confirms that earlier results were not pure chance and that. there was
se bong fAde predictive power in the first place.

  3.    Worldwide instrumental variables
  In    tests of conditional CAPMa, it is             predict well, the market rate
                                              crucial to

  of    return and, in tests of the international, conditional CAPM, it is
  important to predict well the rates of return on currencies. Exchange rates
  are bilateral variables. Their prediction should not        logically be based on

  unilateral    instrumental variables, such as U.S. leading indicators. In this-
  section, 1 consider instrumental variables reflecting the business cycles of
  the four countries of our sample. I use leading indexes of the four
  countries' cycles simultaneously.




       The Center for International Business Cycles Research (CIBCR) publishes
  every month a leading index of the business cycle for eleven countries. The
  growth rate of the index provides advance warning of a growth cycle uptrun or
  downturn.17 I    used   the leading indicators of Japan (JALDT), the United
  Kingdom (UKLDT), former West Germany (WGLDT) and the United States (USLDT), in

      16When the Stock-Watson instruments are lagged one month further, the
international CAPM is marginally rejected (p-val. — 3.9Z) and the domestic CAPm
is marginally accepted (p-val — 9l71).
       17Descriptions of various leading      indicators are available in Lahiri and
Moore    (1991) and Moore (1992).

                                              16
 their growth rate form, as instrumental variables. The forecasting performance
 of   the   five   variables (including a constant)       is   reported in Table 9. it2 are

very    low, of     the order of U or U.     It did not        seem worthwhile to pursue a

 test of any CAPI4.

      The fact that a leading index shows poor forecasting performance for stock

returns does not preclude the component series of the index from faring many

times better. For instance, the Stock and Watson XL12 index predicts returns

very poorly but we reported in Subsection 2.2 that its components provide the

best forecasting basis that we have found so far. This remark applies even

more in the case of the ciza           indexes    since they are meant to be qualitative

predictors of upturns        and   downturns, not     quantitative predictors     of the

subsequent movement in the business cycle.

      Accordingly, I have also investigated the predictive ability of the series

which compose the country leading indexes of the CIBCR. For each country. I
used as instruments every component series that was available on a monthly
basis. Then, e.g., German stock returns were predicted                on the   basis of German
instruments        alone but the Deutschemark/dollar return was predicted on the

basis   of German and US, instruments; the worldwide stock returns were
predicted on the basis of all country instruments put together. In Table 2 a
column, marked 'LDT components, contains the                     obtained by this method.
The number of instruments is large;         yet, the forecasting performance reached

for stocks is no better than that of the tiBEt            component series. For
currencies,        the performance is better (R2s of the order of 102). However, due
to   their large number, these instruments cannot be used to test CAPMs by GM.
     Instruments ought to be selected in each country for the purpose of
predicting increments in business cycle coincident indicators. This would be a

                                                 17
replication of the Stock and   Watson procedure with worldwide data. Then, the
selected instruments could be investigated for the ability to forecast

securities returns. This will be left for future research.



4. Conclusion

This preliminary investigation was meant to highlight the links that exist

between predicted activity levels and conditionally expected stock returns.

The following conclusions emerge from it:

i. The nonfinancial leading indicators selected by Stock and Watson (1992)

for the purpose of predicting United States business cycles seem to offer also

50DB potential for the prediction of worldwide stook returns. Outstanding

contributions to predictive power were made by the variables IVPAC (Vendor

Performance) and HSEP (Housing authorizations). Furthermore, the signs of

these variables' coefficients made intuitive sense. IVPAC is an especially

valuable predictor since its value is released a mere 48 hours after the end

of the month.

ii. Using the Stock and Watson instrument set, the international, conditional

CAPM was marginally not rejected while the classic, conditional CAlM was

rejected.

iii. Other sets of instrumental variables that I have tried so far (U.S. Main

Economic Indicators. dECK country leading indexes) have not proven as

successful both in regard to their power of prediètion and in regard to their

ability to discriminate between asset pricing models.

   Other, more subtle clues could be gathered from the data and could point

the way toward future research. The first issue that I would like to raise

concerns the link between predictability of returns and the power of asset


                                       18
 pricing tests. The OECD Main Economic Indicators (MEI5), as used here, have

 lower predictive power than did the Stock Watson leading series, while these

 series in turn had a lower predictive ability than did the "internal?

variables used by Dumas and Solnik and others (see Table 2). In tests of asset

prices, the MEts rejected both th, classic and the international models, while

the Stock-Watson variables rejected one model and marginally did not reject

the other. In Dumas and Solnik (1993). the discrimination between the two

asset pricing models was much sharper (the classic caPM was rejected while the

international one had a p-value of 221). As we improve the degree of

predictability, should we expect better discrimination between models? Since

our goal is not to predict but to identify state variables of the economy and

to determine which asset pricing model is correct, how much importance should

we give to the predictive power (the R2) of the instruments?

   The second issue concerns the choice of instrumental variables. In this

respect, it is important to avoid the pitfalls of data mining. That is the

reason why I never modified my list of MEl indicators and why I chose to work

with the Stock and Watson variables which have been preselected to predict

activity and not to predict stock returns. This defense against accusations of

data inning is all the stronger as the correlations between stock returns and

activities levels are small (see footnote 14). As we attempt to predict

worldwide stock returns, should we be content to use U.S. variables, such as

those of Stock and Watson, on the grounds that the U.S. business cycle seems

to lead other cycles? Or can we hope to attain greater predictibility by

using country-specific indicator variables? If so, should these variables be

selected on the basis of their ability to predict local levels of activity?

  A third issue that will deserve more scrutiny is the influence of time


                                      19
lags. Time lags are both of economic and statistical significance.

Economically speaking, only innovation in a data series is capable of

constituting news. News are the primary moving force behind realized returns.

it is not clear, however, to what extent the past information and the lag

structure that were identified as giving the best prediction of activity

levels   should also be relevant as determinants of conditionally expected
returns.   We   did observe here (footnote 13) that   the   use of the Stock and
Watson lags did not improve the predictability of returns.
   Finally, from the point of view of the statistical specification, Thierry
lJizman will point out in his discussion that the levels, the first differences
of   indicator variables and their first differences at different lags do not

convey   the same   information concerning the   stage of the business cycle the
economy is in and do not have the same power to predict returns. How does one
determine which specification is preferable for our purposes?
