                                           ABSTRACT

        Between 1946 and 1976, the European powers granted independence to all of their large
colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia. This paper attempts to provide an economic explanation
for this remarkable ending to the era of colonialism. The main theoretical innovation is to
consider the effect of population increase on the allocation of time by the indigenous population
between productive and subversive activities. The analysis suggests that the increase in
population during the colonial period increased the potential return toextralegal appropriation of
the profits of colonial companies until the colonies became a net burden on the metropolitan

governments. The analysis also suggests that there was less subversive activity in colonies in
which the market for indigenous labor was monopsonized because
                                                                        monopsonistic employers
internalized the potential negative effect of extralegal appropriation on net profits.

           At the end of World War II, most of Southeast Asia as well as most of Africa consisted
  of European colonies. But, between 1946 and 1976 the European metropolitan
                                                                                                     powers
  granted independence to all of their large colonies in Southeast Asia and Africa (with the
  exception of Southern Rhodesia, which became independent in 1981). Is there an economic
  explanation for this remarkable series of decisions that brought the era of colonialism to
  an end?
           The large European colonies in Southeast Asia and Africa were similar in important
 respects. An important motivation for establishing each of these colonies was the income
 to be earned by exploiting their natural resources. In most of the colonies the main natural
 resource was agricultural land, but in some colonies (for example, Northern Rhodesia and
 the Belgian Congo) extractable minerals were more important. Moreover, in all of the
 colonies the exploitation of natural resources involved the employment of large amounts
 of indigenous labor. Perhaps most interestingly, in all of the large European colonies in
 Southeast Asia and Africa the indigenous
                                           population and, hence, the potential supply of
 indigenous labor apparently increased substantially during the colonial period.'
       There were also important differences
                                             among the large European colonies in South-
 east Asia and Africa. In some colonies, especially colonies like Algeria, the Dutch East
Indies, French Indochina, British India, and Kenya, in which production was carried out
on many relatively small farms, the market for indigenous labor seems to have been com-
   'Holland (1985) refers to "a population explosion.., almost everywhere in the colonial world." For all of
Africa Matas (1973) estimates that total population, whichapparently was not growing prior to the colonial
period, increased by more than 150 percent from 1900 to 1971. In individual African colonies, Can-Saunders
(1936) and Clark (1967) estimate that the population of Algeria increased by about 90 percent from 1901 to
1931 and by about 92 percent from 1920 to 1962, the Colonial Office
                                                                     (1964) reports that population growth
began in Kenya in the 1920's and readied an annual rate of three
                                                                      percent by the 1960's, Thompson and
AdloIt (1957) report estimated population increase in Fench Subsaharan Africa of 37 percent from 1926 to
1951, and Allen (1964) estimates that the population of Northern Rhodesia grew at an annual rate of about
2.5 percent from 1923 to 1943. For all of Asia, Matras estimates that total population increased by about
146 percent from 1900 to 1971. In individual Asian colonies, Nitisastro (1970) estimates that the population
of Java the major island in the Dutch East Indies, increased by about 90 percent from 1916 to 1960 and
Kumar (1983) estimates that the population of British India increased by more than 50 percent from 1872
to 1941.

  petitive, whereas in other colonies, like those in French Subsaharan Africa, British West
  Africa, Northern Rhodesia, and the Belgian Congo, in which one or a fewlarge plantations,
 trading companies, or mining companies employed, either directly or indirectly, most of
 the indigenous labor, the labor market seems to have been monopsonized.2 in addition, in
 some colonies, such as Algeria, the Dutch East Indies, French Indochina, British India, and
 Kenya, subversive activity by the indigenous population was intense in the period before
 independence and seems to have played a major role in inducingihe metropolitan power
 to grant independence, but in other areas, such as French Subsabaran Africa, British West
 Africa, Northern Rhodesia, and the Belgian Congo, subversive activity seems to have pre-
 sented only a minor problem for the metropolitan power. Interestingly, the cases in which
 anticolonial subversive activity was intense are also cases in which the market for indige-
 nous labor seems to have been competitive, whereas in the cases in which the labor market
 seems to have been monopsonized subversive activity was not intense.
       This paper attempts to provide an economic explanation for the end of colonialism
in Southeast Asia and Africa. The main theoretical innovation is to consider the effect
of population increase on the allocation of time by the indigenous population between
productive and subversive activities. Among other questions, the analysis asks whether
and, if so, how the increase in population during the colonial period was a factor in the
process leading to the end of colonialism. The analysis also seeks to explain the apparent
relation between the structure of the colonial labor market and the amount of anticolonial
subversive activity.

 consists of a large number, N, of identical indigenous families. The indigenous families
 divide their time between productive and subversive activities. The productive activity
 is wage employment offered by the colonial company or companies that are exploiting the
 natural resources of the colony.3 The subversive activity is banditry or similar forms of
 extralegal appropriation of the profits of the colonial company or companies.4
        The income of an indigenous family from wage employment is w, where w is the
 wage rate and I is the fraction of its time that this family allocates to wage employment.
 The total income of indigenous families from extralegal appropriation is f3Rir, where R
 is the total number of units of indigenous natural resources, lr is the gross profits obtained
 from each unit of indigenous natural resources, and /3 is the fraction of gross profits lost to
 extralegal appropkation. This total income from extralegal appropriation is dividedamong
 the indigenous families proportionately to the time allocated by each family to extralegal
 appropriation. Thus, the income of an indigenous family from extralegal appropriation is
(iRirb/NB, where & is the fraction of its time that this family allocates to extralegal
 appropriation and B is the fraction of its time that the average family allocates to
extralegal appropriation.5
       A natural assumption is that, for /3 < 1, /3 is an increasing function of NB/B,
   3TIIIS model does not consider other employment arrangements, such as sharecropping, and abstracts
from the possibility of employment in an indigenous sector. Introducing these complications would not
change the qualitative conclusions drawn below.
   4An alternative would be to model subversive activity as an attempt to take control of the natural
resources of the colony — that is, as a direct attempt to drive out the metropolitan power and its colonial
companies — rather than as an attempt only to appropriate the current profits of colonial companies. The
main results of the analysis would obtain in this alternative framework as well.
    51n this model the allocation of time to extralegal appropriation reduces aggregate output and income
 by taking time away from productive activities. But, given aggregate output and income, the total gain to
indigenous families from extralegal appropriation exactly equals the total loss to colonial companies from
extralegal appropriation. In other words, the analysis abstracts from the possibility that the process of
extralegal appropriation destroys output. This possibility would leave the indigenous families with a total
gain that is smaller than the total loss to colonial companies. The analysis also abstracts from the possibility
that, in addition to the income from extralegal appropriation, indigenous families receive a nonpecuniary
benefit because extralegal appropriation advances the cause of independence. This possibility would make
the total gain to indigenous families larger than the total loss to coloniai.eompanies. Introducing these
complications also would not change the main results of the analysis.

 unit of indigenous natural resources. A simple technology of extralegal appropriation that
 incorporates this assumption is
                                                          for
                                                                                                            (1)

 where         0. In equation (1) the parameter                    determines the effectiveness of time
 allocated to extralegal appropriation. As long as jI is less than unity, the larger is                     the
 larger is both the average and marginal effect of NB/R on j3.° Given equation (1), the
 income of an indigenous family from extralegal appropriation, f3Rirb/NB, is equivalent,
 for /3<1, to irb.
      Each indigenous family takes to and qnr as given and selects £ and ii, subject to
 the constraint L + b = 1, to maximize its income i. The above assumptions imply that

                                               i=wt+,rb.                                                   (2)
 Given equation (2), the Kuhn-Tucker conditions for maximizing i imply

                                               0          for   wct

and 6 = i—i. Equation (3) indicates, among other things, that each family would allocate
all of its time to one activity only if the return to that activity is not smaller than the
return to the other activity and that each family would allocate time to both activities only
if the returns to both activities are equal. In equilibrium, because all indigenous families

To simplify the aaalysj further we incorporate in the parameter         the effect of whatever efforts the
metropolitan government makes to suppress subversive activity in the colony. In addition, we implicitly
include expenditure on suppressing subversive activity in the fixed costs of administering the colony that
are introduced below. For a more general model of extralegal appropriation activity and its suppression, see
Grossman (1991).

 allocates to wage employment, and 6 is equal to B.
 A Competitive Labor Market
     Suppose that each colonial company exploits one unit of indigenous natural resources
— for example, each unit could be a standard sized farm —
                                                           and      that the number, R, of
such resource units and, hence, the number of colonial companies is large. With a large
number of employers, the labor market is competitive.
      Output per unit of indigenous natural resources, which is the same as output per
colonial company, is A/i0, 0 C a c 1, where ii is units of labor time employed on each
unit of indigenous natural resources and where A is a parameter that reflectsproductivity
as well as the relative price of product produced by the colonial companies. Given this
technology, the gross profits obtained from each unit of indigenous natural resources, which
is the same as the gross profits of each colonial company, are

                                      ,r=Aha_wh.                                         (4)
Each company takes the wage rate as given and selects h to maximize lr. This maxi-
mization implies that h satisfies

The market-clearing condition for the labor market is

                                        Rh=NL.                                          (6)

     Taken together, equations (4), (5), and (6) imply that the market-clearing wage rate
equals the marginal product of labor and satisfies
                                              Aa                                         -

  Equations (7) and (8) show that the wage share of output is a and that the profit share
  of output is 1 — a. Total gross profits of the colonial companies are


                                             Rir=(1—a)Y,                                                (9)

 where Y = AJP_0(NL)0 is the total output of the colonial companies.7 The
                                                                          profits of
 the colonial companies net of extralegal appropriation are

                                     (1- /3)R7r = (1- fI)(1 - a)Y.                                    (10)

        By substituting equations (7) and (8) for wages and profits into equation (3), which
 describes the labor-supply behavior of each indigenous family, and equating £ to L, we
 can calculate the equilibrium behavior of the average indigenous family. Then, substituting
 into equations (7) and (10), we can calculate the equilibrium wage rate and the equilibrium
 net profits of the colonial companies. There are three possible cases depending on the value
 of N/fl.
       I) If      .<      then we have to > 7r and indigenous families choose £ = 1.
 In this case, the population is sufficiently small that, even with all time allocated to
 wage employment, the wage rate is larger than the return to extralegal appropriation.
Consequently, indigenous families allocate all of their time to wage employment. Moreover,
with B = 1 — L = 0, the fraction of profits lost to extralegal
                                                                              appropriation, /3, is also
zero. Accordingly, from equation (7) the equilibrium wage rate is

                                              =
                                                  (N/R)'—'                                           (11)
and from equation (10) the net profits of the colonial companies are

 Equations (11) and (12) imply that with a small population the equilibrium wage rate is
 a decreasing convex function of population and that net profits are an increasing concave
 function of population. In other words, with a small population the conventional wisdom
 is correct that population growth depresses wages and raises profits from the exploitation
 of natural resources.

                                                                     wage employment that is
 positive, less than unity, and a decreasing function of population, the marginal product
 of labor and the wage rate are equal to the return to extralegal appropriation. Moreover,
with B =        1 —   L, we have, from equation (1), /3 =          — j-, and both B and /3
are positive and increasing functions of population. In this case, from equation (7) the
equilibrium wage rate is

Equations (13) and (14) imply that with a larger population the equilibrium wage rate as
well as gross profits become independent of population and act profits are a decreasing
linear function of population. In other words, with a larger population the opportunity to
engage in extralegal appropriative activity overturns the conventional wisdom that popu-
lation growth depresses wages and raises profits.
      III) If      >   j-1,    then we have vi =       and indigenous families choose L = a.
Moreover, with B =         1   —
                             L, we have, from equation (1), /3 = 1. In this case, the
population is so large that, in order for the wage rate to equal the return to extralegal ap-
propriation, the indigenous families must allocate enough time to extralegal appropriation
to appropriate all profits. In this case, net profits are zero.


                                                 7
         Taken together, these three cases imply that, if population is positive, but not too
  large, then the net profits of the colonial firms are positive. Moreover, the highest net
 profits occur at a population such that = j-, which is the largest population for which
 no time is allocated to extralegal appropriation. In sum, with a competitive labormarket,
 if the indigenous population is small — specifically, if      C      — then population
 growth increases the profits earned in the colony, but that, if population continues togrow
 — specifically, if   reaches        — then
                                             further population growth generates extralegal
 appropriative activity and steadily reduces the net profits earned in the colony.
        Suppose that the government of the metropolitan power incurs a positive cost, dl, to
 administer this colony and provide necessary infrastructure. Equations (12) and (4) imply
 that, if the population of the colony is within.a critical range such that       is larger than
             but smaller than #fl')[l —
                                             f()_0J,  then the net profits of the colonial firms
 exceed dl. Accordingly, assuming that this critical range is not empty, if the criterion
 for establishing and maintaining a colony is that the metropolitan government can impose
 sufficient taxes on the colonial firms to cover the cost of administration and infrastructure,
 then this colony will be viable if and only if its population is within this critical range.
If the metropolitan government is willing to subsidize this colony (for example, because
of strategic geopolitical considerations), then the critical population range can be larger.
But, as long as the metropblitan government is not willing to bear the entire cost dl,
the bounds of the critical population range are positive and finite. This analysis suggests
that a colony with a competitive labor market and a growing population has a life cycle
in which a period of falling wages and rising profits is followed by a period of constant
wages, positive and increasing subversive appropriative activity, and declining net profits,
until finally, assuming that there is not an offsetting decrease in the ratio c/a, the colony
becomes a net burden on the metropolitan government and is given its independence.S
  1The analysis of two related models, in Grossman (1993, 1994), suggests that, it either a tax-financed
wage subsidy or a lasd reform were administratively feasible, then these policies could reduce the amount


                                                   8
 With independence, sovereignty is transferred to an indigenous government, which can
 redistribute the profits from the exploitation of indigenous natural resources either by
 taxing or by expropriating the colonial companies.

 A Monopsonized Labor Market
        Suppose that, instead of R colonial companies each exploitingone unit of indigenous
 natural resources, a single colonial company exploits all 1? units of indigenous natural
 resources. As the only employer of indigenous labor, this company monopsothzes the labor
 market.
        Assume, for heuristic purposes, that this monopsonist faces the same technologies
 of production and extralegal appropriation as the competitive companies. Specifically, for
 the monopsonist output per unit of natural resources is M and ji is the fraction of gross
 profits lost to extralegal appropriation. Accordingly, the monopsonist's net profits are

                        (1 — fl)R1T   =   (1
                                               —
                                                         — tv/i), with h =                              (15)

     To maximize (I — /3)1?r, the monopsonist chooses a wage rate and an amount
of employment to offer to each and every indigenous family, subject to the labor.supply
behavior of each indigenous family, as given by equation (3), the dependence of j3 on B,
asgivenbyequation(]j,and L+B = 1. Thesolutiontothisproblemistoset w equalto
r and to set I and, hence, L equal to unity. in other words, the monopsonist sets the
wage rate such that each indigenous family is indifferent between allocating time to wage
employment and to extralegal appropriation and the monopsonist offers the indigenous
families sufficient wage employment to absorb all of their time.
       Accordingly, in the monopsonistic equilibrium indigenous families allocate no time
to extralegal appropriation. This property obtains because the monopsothst internalizes
the potential negative effect of extralegal appropriation on net profits. In other words, the

of extralegal appropriation and could prolong temporarily the viability of a colony with a competitive labor
market and a growing population.


                                                    9
 monopsonist does not take /9 as given, but rather takes into account that an increase in
 L both increases output and decreases B and, hence, decreases the amount of
                                                                                      profits
 lost to extralegal appropriation. In contrast, each competitive
                                                                 employer took L, B, and
 /3 as given and considered only the effect of the choice of employment on output.
        Substituting to = ir and L = 1 into equation (15), we can solve for the equilibriun
 gross and net profits of the monopsonist, which are

                                                      ARNa
                                                      l+Øt/R                            (16)
 and we can solve for the equilibrium monopsonistic wage rate, which is

                                      —
                                          '   —    3A(N/R)°
                                                   l+çbN/R
                                                                                         17

 Equations (16) and (17) imply that both the monopsothstic wage rate and the profits of
 the monopsonist are smooth hump-shaped functions ofpopulation and that both functions
have a maximum at a population such that              =       In other words, with a small
population, population growth raises profits, but also raises wages as the monopsonist
equates the wage rate to the potential return to extralegal appropriation. With a larger
population, however, population growth depresses both profits and wages. As population
continues to grow, both profits and wage approach zero asymptotically.
      Comparing equation (16) to equations (12) and (14), we see the following: First,
if    <          then the profits of a monopsonist are larger than the total
                                                                                  profits of
competitive companies. But, as population grows, the profits of a monopsonist increase
more slowly than the total profits of competitive companies. Second, if population grows
until   = j-9—, then both the profits of a monopsonist and the total profits of
                                                                                competitive
companies are at their highest levels, and they are equal. Third, if population continues to
grow so that % >          then the profits of a monopsonist decrease more slowly than the
total net profits of competitive firms and the net profits of a monopsonist again become
larger than the total net profits of competitive firms. Note, however, that in this case

                                              10
  the profits of a monopsonist are smaller than the total gross profits of competitive firms.
  With a large population, the larger net profits of a monopsonist result from the ability of
  the monopsonist to internalize the potential negative effect of extralegal appropriation
                                                                                             on
  profits.

        Comparing equation (17) to equations (11) and (13), we see the following: First,
 if     <        then the monopsonistic wage rate is less than the competitive wage rate.
 But, as population grows, the monopsonistic wage increases, whereas the competitive
                                                                                         wage
 decreases. Second, if population grows until        =   then the monopsonistic wage
 and the competitive wage become equal. Third, if population continues to grow so that
   > 1S.., then the monopsonistic wage decreases and
                                                     again becomes less than the com-
 petitive wage, which remains constant. Note that with a large population the indigenous
 families allocate no time to extralegal appropriation in the
                                                                monopsonistic equilibrium, but
 not in the competitive equilibrium, even though the monopsonistic wage is less than the
 competitive wage. The explanation is that the total gross profits of competitive companies,
 but not their net profits, are larger than the profits of a monopsonist.
      Most importantly, equation (16) implies that, similarly to the competitive case, if
the population of the colony is neither too small nor too large, then the monopsonist's
profits exceed cl?1 the cost of administering and providing necessary infrastructure for
the colony. Thus, a colony with a monopsonized labor market and a growing pop ulation
will have a life cycle that is similar to the life cycle of a colony with a competitive labor
market. Specifically, with either a monopsonized labor market or a competitive labor
market, population growth produces a period of rising profits followed by a period of
declining profits, until finally the colony becomes a net burden on the metropolis. But, for
any given level of dl?, or any given level of dl? less the subsidy that the metropolitan
government is willing to provide to the colony, the critical population range for which the
colony remains viable is larger with a monopsonized labor market than with a competitive
labor market. In addition, with a competitive labor market the period of rising profits has

                                            11
 falling wages arid the period of falling profits has both constant wages and positive and
 increasing extralegal appropriative activity, whereas with a monopsonized labor market
 wages rise when profits are rising and wages fall when profits are falling and there is no
 extralegal appropriative activity.

 Summary                        -

      This paper has suggested an economic explanation for the decisions of the Euro-

 pean metropolitan powers between 1946 and 1976 to grant independence to all of their
large colonies in Southeast Asia and Africa. This explanation emphasizes the substantial
population increase during the colonial period and argues that this increase in population
increased the potential return to extralegal appropriation of the profits of the colonial
companies. The analysis suggests that a colony with a growing population has a life cycle
in which population growth produces a period of rising profits followed, because of the
increasing potential return to extralegal appropriation, by a period of falling net profits
until the colony becomes a net burden on the metropolitan government.
      The analysis also distinguished between colonies in which the market forindigenous
labor was competitive and in which subversive activity by the indigenous population was
intense prior to independence and colonies in which the labor market was monopsonized
and in which subversive activity was not intense. The analysis attributes this relaéion
between the structure of the labor market and the amount of subversive activity to the
ability of a monopsonist to internalize the potential negative effect of extralegal appro-
priation on net profits. Although with a monopsonized labor market subversive activity
was not intense and the colony remained viable for a larger population, population growth
still depressed net profits and the colony still eventually became a net burden because
the monopsonist had to keep the wage rate equal to the potential return to extralegal
appropriation.
     In most of the colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia, population increase reflected


                                           12
mainly natural population growth, but in some colonies immigration was important. In ei-
ther case, population increase during the colonial period presumably was not an exogenous
event, but rather a result of changes produced by colonialism itself — specifically, increased
employment opportunities and decreased mortality due to the introduction of European
technologies. Given the relation between population increase and the net profits of colonial
companies, the metropolitan powers at first would have welcomed the population growth
that colonialism induced, but eventually this population growth. became the undoing of
colonialism itself.
