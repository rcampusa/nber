       The current high rates of return to human capital stimulate a supply response via increased

investments in education and training. The so increased human capital stock exerts downward

pressures on the rates of return that reduce the skill differential in wages.

       This paper reports estimates of: the responses of investments in post-secondary education.

measured by enrollments, to changes in the rate of return; responses of investment in job training,

measured by incidence; and effects of accumulated human capital stocks, measured by

educational attainment, on educational wage differentials. Enrollment responses and attainment

effects are shown to be separated by a time lag of about a decade.

       The parameter estimates are based on annual CPS and NCES data, covering a recent 25

year period. If demands for human capital cease their acceleration, the rate of return is expected

to decline about 25% over the current decade, judging by the estimated parameters and lags.

          Investments in Education and Training in the U.S.'

                (Levels and changes since the 1960's)



Introduction


    A look at the contemporary American educational system is a
study in contrasts and paradoxes:


     1.     In quantitative tens, levels of enrollment and
            attainment measured in years of schooling remain among
            the highest in the world. So are the expenditures on
            schooling which amount to about 7% of GNP without the
            inclusion of student opportunity costs, and over 10% when

            they are included. The total cost is high not merely as
            a result of the large numbers of students enrolled, but
            also in terms of cost per student year; In 1989 this was

            about $4300 per student enrolled in elementary and
            secondary schooling, and about $10,000 per student in
            post—secondary schooling2, without the inclusion of
             opportunity costs. As is oft repeated, U.S. costs per
             student are the highest in the world.
                  Qualitative assessments present two contrasts:

          Funding by the National Science Foundation is gratefully
acknowledged.    The work benefitted from excellent research
assistance provided by John Higgins.
     2    By 1990—91, these costs per student rose to $5,300 and
over $12,000, respectively.
                                3

         While by international standards, U.S. outlays for
         education are very high, by the same standard students at

         high school levels and below do regularly less well than

         their peers abroad on tests of knowledge and achievement.

         Despite the longest schooling (about 80% completed high
         school) a recent study of the Department of Education
         reports that nearly a half of U.S. adults cannot read
         English properly or handle arithmetic for the purpose of

         elementary tasks.3     At the same time, the higher
         educational system in the U.S. is still considered to be

         a model of excellence. One wonders how long the supply
         of students to higher education can remain unaffected by

         prior educational experience, especially if school
         education continues to expand in response to growing
         demand for a skilled labor force and/or if selectivity
         standards in admissions begin to decline.



    2.        The past two decades were especially turbulent:
          first decelerating then accelerating demands for human

         capital were accompanied by apparently perverse changes
          in supplies: Thus the proportion of college graduates
          increased rapidly in the 1970's, while it stabilized in
          the 1980's just when demand for skills accelerated.

            Data on schooling levels, costs, and rates of return

     are available and are not controversial. The challenge
     in analyzing the developments of the past two dec-des
     lies in identifying changing demands for human cap.tal

     and the supply responses, if any.         In Part I of this

     paper I present a brief survey of the current levels, and

     an analysis of the recent trends in demand and supply
     resulting in and responding to changing profitabilities
     of education.



3.          A comparable survey of job training investments
     encounters the biggest hurdle in the diffidulties of
     estimating the guahtitative levels or volumes of
     training, and in gauging profitabilities or rates of
     return on these investments. I have recently published
     a report on such estimates (Mincer, 1991) .        These are
     somewhat more reliable with current data, which were not

     available 30 years ago when I first (Mincer, 1962)
     ventured to estimate national levels of job training. In

     Part    II I briefly describe the results and analyze the
     trends in profitability and volumes of investments in job

     training. Did the growth     in demand   for human capital in

     the 1980's apply to job training as well, and did job
      training investments increase as a result? The answers

      based on indirect as well as more direct evidence appear

      to be positive.
                      S

     In both analyses of school education and of job
training, the evidence shows that investments in human

capital respond positively to profitability, that is to
changing skill differentials.    Yet the supply of   the
acciunulated stock has not as yet (1991) begun to reduce

current profitabilities which are high by historical
standards. Lags in the educational pipeline, growing

costs, and perverse demographics represent delays and
impediments to timely supply effects.   It is also very

likely that the poor performance of elementary and high
school students represents a major bottleneck for the
supply adjustment,

                       I. School education



1.   Levels. Enrollments. Costs. Attainment


     In 1989 46 million students were enrolled in elementary and
secondary schools. In the same year 13.1 million students were
enrolled in post—secondary education, including 3.8 million in 2-
year colleges, 6.8 million in 4- year colleges and universities,

and 2.5 million in postgraduate schooling.


     The educational attainment of young people, most at whom
completed schooling, is described in Table 1.        The Table shows
increases in high school and college completions in the 1970's and

a levelling off in the 19805.


     Table 2 shows educational attainments in international

perspective.


     Among six foremost developed countries, the U.S. working age
 population (25—64) has the highest educational levels measured in

 school years completed. However, in the younger population (25—34)
 Japan and Germany overtook the U.S. in the proportion of high
 school graduates, and Japan comes close to the U.S. in the

 proportion of college graduates.    The more rapid expansion of
 education in Japan and Germany in the        past   2—3 decades is

 consistent with their high rates of income growth.
                                  7

    To visualize the process by which the human capital stock.

measured by attainment, arises in the figures of Table 1, it is
necessary to look at investment behavior measured by enrollments in

Table 3.    Here, all three columns show moderate declines in
enrollment rates in the 1970's and large increases in the 1980's.
Note the difference between the investment behavior shown in Table

3 and the human capital stock behavior shown in Table 1.          The

filtering of enrollments to ultimate attainments during this period

can be described simply: Of the 80—85% of the 25-29 year old
population who were high—school graduates (col. 1, Table 1) 50-60%
enrolled in college in October after graduation during the 1980's

(col.l, Table 1) but only one—third of high-school graduates
continued to be enrolled through ages 18—24 (col. 2).             This

represents about 25%—30% of the (18—24) population group (col. 3).
Half a dozen years later a somewhat smaller proportion of the age

group (25—29) attained at least 16 years of schooling (col. 2 in
Table 1).



     Table 4 shows the expenditures on elementary and high—school

students and on post—secondary education (public and private) in
current dollars and as a proportion of GNP.              In 1989 the
expenditures on elementary and high—school students were over $200

billion, or about $4,300 per   student,   and constituted 4.1% of GM?.

Expenditure of $131 billion on post—secondary education constituted

2.7% of CUP, amounting to about $to,000 per student. These figures

exclude opportunity costs of students. The latter are on average
                                   a

about    as high as the direct   costs   at the post—secondary     level.

Adding those at that level only yields a total f ure (for all
levels) of $462 billion which was close to 10% of GF          Although no
comparative Table is shown, the average annual cost per student is
higher in the U.S. than in other countries. In l         S U.S. costs per

college student (excluding opportunity costs) were at least 50%

higher    than in countries next in rank.'

2.      changes Over Tine

        Table 1 shows that educational attainment   of   the population in
the early working ages (25—29) grew strongly in the 1970's but
stagnated in the So's. Figure 1 portrays the annual time series.
Figure 2 shows the concurrent time series of the rates of return to

school education, or the college "wage premium" measured by the
percent wage differential between college and high school
graduates, at 6—10 years of experience3.            As Figure 1 shows,
educationalattainment rose steadily to a historic high in the late
70's when "rates of return" (Fig. 2) reached a historic low. But
there has been no increase in attainment since then, while it
           Those were West Germany and Sweden, according to
 Clotfelter et. al, 1991 (p. 23)
             The pattern is similar though more shallow when the iole
 labor    force is included.     The "rats of return" here is on
 opportunity costs alone, excluding tuition net of student subsx4ies
 and earnings. "Wage Premium" is another term for this. Measures
 of the college wage premium at the end of the first decade of
 working life is last contaminated by differential job training
 (see Mincer, 1974 on "overtaking"). Similar patterns are produced
 by coefficients of schooling in wage functions.
                                  9

appears that the need for a more highly skilled labor force
accelerated as suggested by the rising "rate of return".        The

apparently perverse behavior of the educational supply of human
capital, in relation to profitability of school education, poses

several questions: Economic theory predicts a positive response of
the supply of human capital to its profitability. Is the response
missing, or perverse? Or is the rate of return a consequence of
exogenous shifts in educational supplies, such as changes in public

subsidies or family income?



     To answer these questions it is important to disentangle the

demand and supply factors which produce changes in the rates of
return.   And it is important to keep in mind the distinction
between stocks of human capital (attainment) and investment flows
(enrollment). It is the flows that respond to profitability, while

the stocks accumulated over a number of years affect the
profitability later on.



3.   Anatomy of changing Drofitabilities of education in the past
     Quarter    Century


     A lively   literature has grown in the past few years concerned

with the dramatic changes in the rates of return to education.6
These have grown in the sixties, fell in the 70's to reach a low

      6
         Murphy and Welch (1989), Blackburn, Bloom, and Freeman
(1990), Katz and Murphy (1991), Bound and Johnson (1991), Mincer
(1991).
                                    10

level of about 4%, a decline which was labelled or diagnosed as
"overeducation" at the time. They have since rebounded in the Go's

to reach heights at 12% or more in the past half a dozen years.
The much increased inequality in labor incomes over the past decade
is widely viewed as a corollary of this development.'



     By now a consensus has emerged that the decline of the rate of
return in the 70's was mainly due to the rapid influx of the large

baby boom generation of college graduates into the labor market,
and the steep rise of the rate of return in the 80's was due
primarily to increases in skill biased or labor saving demand,
while supply remained stagnant, as the "baby bust" generation began

to enter the work force.       In€ernational competition in low—skill

intensive products, the growth of unskilled immigration, and the

decline in union density played some, though apparently minor parts
 in the changing wage structure. Most studies agreed that skill-
 biased labor demand was the major factor in the 1980's, but
 inferences Ofl   the   technologically—based increases in demand were

 mainly of a residual sort, rather than directly estimated. Only
 two studies identified demand shifts empirically.          Of these,

 Krueger (1991) estimated the contribution of computerization to the

 growth of educational wage differentials in the 1980's, and my own
 work (1991, 1993) utilized information on R & D intensity as the

 demand shifter, covering the period 1963—1987 annually.          This

 variable grew in the 60's, stagnated in the 70's, and grew rapidly


            Juin, Pierce, andflurphy (1992), Levy and Murriafle (1992).
                                 it

in the 80's.



     Tables 5a&b shows the results of my regression equations which
best pert orned in explaining the variation over time in "rates of

return" to college education. As shown in Figure 2, the year—to—

year educational percent wage differentials between young college

and high school graduates are very    closely tracked (ccl. 3 in Table
5a) by relative supplies of college graduates (REST) with negative
sign and positively by changes in relative demand for educated
workers.   The latter is indexed by research and development
expenditures per worker (ROE) as well as by trends in relative
service employment (RSG). Pt all the factors, ROE accounts for
most of the explanatory power.



     with the decline of average productivity growth, the labor
saving changes in demand took the f on of increases in demand for

workers with post—secondary education and decreases in demand f or

workers at lower educational levels. The reduction in wages of the

latter in the 1980's may in part be attributed to the growth of the

negative balance in international trade, but as col. 1 of Table 5a

suggests, its explanatory power is weaker, and when the ROE
variable is included the effects of the trade balance vanish.


     When the time series is extended back to 1957 and up to 1990,
                                12

in Table Sb the results are qualitatively similar, and the
elasticities of the demand variables close to unity, and of
relative supply in the young labor force (age 25-29) is about -.7.



     A number of micro—level studies (Allen, 1993; Griliches, 199])

show that the technologically based skill—biased demand hypothesis
is consistent with a variety of observed changes at detailed

industry levels.   Equations 4 and S in Table Sa point also to
capital—skill complementarity as a factor in growing demands for

educated workers. Capital intensity was measured by expenditures
on new equipment per worker (EQ) which grew in the 1980's. It is
not clear, however, whether the skill bias of new equipment
represents anything different than the effects of new technologies

embodied in the equipment.



4.   suonly Responses to Changing Demand


     While supplies of educated workers played a part in the drama,

 they appeared to behave perversely, especially in the 80's when
 demand took off. As already indicated this does not signify a lack

 of response of supply to changes in demand. Since tF.     stock of

 human capital (here educational attainment) that is t:.      supply

 which affects wage differentials is built up over a nw er of

 years, the flow of investments (i.e.        enrollments) mt.;t be


           It should be noted that Table 5a covers the more
 homogenous groups of white males, while Sb covers all males.
 Differences will be explored in future research.
                                13

investigated to detect responses to profitability. I now report on

the response of enrollments in post—secondary education as observed

annually over the 1967—1990 period:


     Economic theory tells us that investments in education respond
positively to prospective rates of return, as well as to parental
education and income. More precisely, those with sufficient access

to investment funds compare rates of return on school education
with profitabilities of alternative investments, such as financial

rates. Most, however, are limited by family income.        (Parental
education is an index of it, as well as of preferences for
educational investments). Since our measure of educational wage
premia is not a rate of return, as it misses direct costs, (net)
tuition costs must be taken into account as well. Avoiding a more

laborious effort, I used gross tuition costs, as these apparently
behaved similarly to the net costs:       Subsidies to students and
earnings of students did not grow in the SO's while tuition costs

rose greatly (Clotfelter,1991). The proper measure of financial
rates of return is the real expected long term rate.       We tried
several expectationa). hypotheses to construct such rates without
much success in the regression analysis. When put alongside the
educational premium,     the   variable     was   not   significant.
Conventional financial wisdom claims that the real rates (nominal

minus inflation) are usually very low. Educational rates of return

(here r1) are substantially higher, so the differential would move

very much as the r1 does.       The prospective wage premia are
                                    14

visualized     (presumably     by     families   and   the   "teenage
econometricians") as the ratio of wages of college to high school

graduates about a decade after graduation (6—10 years of
experience) which they currently observe. This is the "overtaking
stage" of experience which is minimally affected by job training
(Mincer, 1974) another dimension of human capital investment on

which I report In Part II.


     In Table 6 I report results of three regressions of successive

educational flows:       enrollment rates in October following high
school graduation (cal. 1), enrollment rates of high school
graduates in the following years (ages 18—24) (col. 2), and the
 resulting proportion of population of young people ClS—24)
 enrolled (col. 3).       Roughly 6—10 years later this population
 reaches the "overtaking" age and constitutes the effective relative

 supply (shown in Figure 1 and RESY in cal. 1 of Tables Sa & b)
 which in turn affects educational wage differentials at that point

 (almost a decade later).           A more comprehensive, though not
 necessarily better measure of relative educational supply includes

 people of all ages, not merely the younger ones.        This variable

 (REST) was used in the regressions of Table 5a, beyond cal. 1.



      At all stages shown in Table 6, the response to wage premia is

 positive and significant, tuition has a negative effect and the

 proxy f or parental education (andor permanent income) is positive.

 All are   significant   except for tuition for continuing students and
                                  15

together track the time series of enrollment quite well (with
adjusted R' of 75, 69, and 79%, respectively) as shown in the three
panels of Figure 3•9 When the residual u—hat of the first column
regression is added as a variable for continuing students (column
2 & 3) it is positive and significant. It    raises the R-squares to
82 and 88 percent respectively.        The variable u—hat represents
unmeasured factors, such as learning ability and achievement prior

to high school graduation that promotes persistence in further
schooling once enrolled in college.



     The educational pipeline from enrollment to attainment implies

a lag which is shown in Figure 4. The optimal lag, determined by

a regression of attainment in the young population (Figure 1) on
enrollment of roughly the same cohort was 8 years. This regression

yielded an       — 0.93, when the proportion of college graduates in

the 25—29 age group is regressed on enrollments of 18—24 year olds

8 years before. Similarly, if the dependent variable is the cohort

at 6—10 years of working age (years since completion of schooling)
the optimal lag is again 8 years, and R' = 0.89.          A similar,
slightly weaker result is obtained when the cohort with 1—10 years



          It is interesting to note that, with only one exception
(Mattila, 1982), none of the voluminous research on the demand for
education related it to the (prospective) rate of return to
education; various studies single out components of costs and/or of
returns for investigation (see Freeman, 1986).        In the cross—
section,  some of the variables which we could not capture (or were
silent) in time series are shown to be significant, as for example
number of siblings, single parents, and local unemployment (Hecknan
and Cameron, 1993).
                                16

of experience is used as the relative supply (proportion with 16+

of schooling) variable.


      It is this relative supply variable which affects the ran of

return negatively, holding demand variables constant - as shown in
Table Sa&b. Figure 4 shows how well the enrollment series (lagged

8 years) fits relative supply, by shifting the attainment series of
the young population 8 years back. Enrollment growth in the GO's
produces the growth of attainment prior to 1975, Jhile the static
enrollment rate in the 70's leads to the stagnation in the supply

in the SO'S.     In turn, the growh of enrollment in the 80's

predicts an increasing relative supply in the 90's among the young
cohorts, as shown in the extrapolation of the lower graph in Figure

 4.   The predicted increase in attainment from 1991 to 2000 is,

 according to Figure 4, about 8 percent points.


      Parameter estimates of REST in Tables Sa&b imply an elasticity

 of —0.72 of the wage premium with respect to the relative supply.
 The predicted increase in attainment of 35% in the young population

 (8/23 in Figure 4) would reduce the college premium by 35% x 0.72

 = 25.2%.   If the current college premium is about 12%, the supply

 response would return the college premium nearly two—thirds     the

 way toward its long—run average (1957—1990) a decade from 19


       In this scenario over halt of the skill, shortages would be

 eliminated by the end of the decade following the year 1993. This
                                 17

prediction relies on supply effects alone, and assumes no further

growth in demand, in direct costs of schooling (such as tuition),
and no changes in the composition of the work force.         These
assumptions are considered in the concluding section.



II. Job Training Investments


                         1. Aacsreclate Casts



     There are no official data on national investments in job
training comparable to data on enrollments and costs of schooling,

published by the U.S. Department of Education. Three decades ago,

I attempted to estimate job training volumes based on the human

capital hypothesis which attributes growth of life—cycle wages to
investments in formal and informal job training and learning as
well as to investments in job search and mobility (Mincer, 1962).


     The availability of direct information on job training in
recent data panels, though far from adequate, makes it feasible to

attempt once again estimates of investment volumes and of rates of

return to job training. Empirically grounded direct estimates are

clearly preferable to the largely hypothetical procedure of thirty
years ago. In addition, some information is now also available on
employer   investments in training of workers.


     In   my recent study (Mincer, 1991, 1993) I estimated costs of
                                     18

job training in the economy for 1976 and 1987 using three entirely
different methods: (1) In the "direct" method time (hours) spent in

training per year was valued at wage rates prior to training, or of

comparable non—trainees.        (2) A second method uses information on

casts of formal training programs and on time spent on them, and
inflates the cost to a total training level, using information on

time    spent in all training,     including informal training which is

the bulk.       (3)   The third method is the "indirect" one which uses
wage profiles, as in the old (1962) paper, but with wage gains due

to mobility netted out.          The direct estimates (1) and (2) are
rather close. The indirect estimate (3) exceeds the former two by
about one—third. This suggests that human capital investments can
account for three—fourths of the growth of the (cross—sectional)

wage profile, leaving a minor role to other, not mutually
 exclusive, explanations.


        The "indirect" approach dates back to my 1962 work which was

 based on Census data for 1959.               Costs of job training were

 estimated from typical (cross—sectional) wage profiles of male
 workers, classified by education level: Increments of wages over

 each    year of experience in the cross-sectio&° were summed over
 experience and across education groups and capitalized by internal

                                                which are not returns

  on individual investments.
                                19

rates of return." The arithmetic is straightforward: The annual

wage increment is:

                             tsw.=rc



where r is the internal rate of return and ; the investment cost
over the year t. The conclusion was that total costs of human
capital investments during the working ages were large, almost a

half of total costs (including opportunity costs) of school
education.



     No "direct" estimates of training costs were available at that

time. These became feasible for 1976 when a special time—usa study

of the PSID (Duncan and Stafford, 1980) reported job training
information. Wage data were available for the same year in the
regular PSID panel. Thus for 1976 both "direct" and "indirect"
 estimates can be constructed and compared.



     The "indirect" approach based on wage profiles was implemented
 on the 1976 data in a much less laborious fashion (Mincer, 1991)
 than in the 1962 study. The simplification was made possible by
 the use of a parametric wage function. A semi—log wage function

 (Mincer, 1974)




      " The rates were estimated from pairs of successive education
 wage profiles.

k, is the initial fraction of earning                capacity devoted to

investment, and T the investment period. All the parameters were
estimated in a non—linear procedure by H. Rosen (1982).


     Based on the Rosen estimates Table (7) shows my calculation of

inferred investment costs)2 With w the average wage in each age
bracket, N the number of workers in it and k, the mean investment

ratio in the age bracket,


                                  1= ENWk



summed over all brackets yields the average ratio of training
 investments per hour to wage per hour. The resulting 8.5% ratio
was applied to the wage bill in 1976 National Income Accounts and
 yielded a figure of $88 billion of worker post—school investments.

 Netting out mobility investments estimated as 15% of the above
 figure (JovanoviC and Mincer, 1981) leaves the indirect estimate of



       For greater detail, see Mincer (1991). Rosen's parameters
 are estimated on wages of males. My estimates average male and
 female investment ratios, with the latter assumed to be a half of
 the toner, and applied to the wage bill of
                                            females which was about
 40% ot the total in 1976.
                                 21

job training investment costs that would produce the observed
(within fins) wage growth at $75 billion in 1976.


    All that is needed for the "direct" estimate of job training

investment costs is the time spent in training per period and the
period opportunity cost of that training. The 1976 PSID Time Use

Survey is the only such survey of time allocation on the job during
a week's period. The data are shown in Table (8). The calculation

is simple: It is the product of columns 1 through 4 summed over
all ages: Total costs per week


                             Tr=E w*PJ


where w is the wage foregone, h hours of training per week,13 and
N, the number of workers receiving training during the week.     So

estimated, total annual costs of job training amounted to about $56
billion in 1976.



        One check on this order of magnitude which may be viewed as

another method of estimating on-the—job training is available from

a survey of companies published in Training Magazine. The survey
reported expenditures on tonal training of about $40 billion in
1987.     The time spent in tonal training was about a week per



       The Time Use Survey lists separately training time without
production and time with production ongoing. Only a third of the
latter was (conservatively) estimated as training time. The two
components are summed in col. 2.
                                22

trainee. This does not include time spent in informal training or

learning on the job which is the preponderant manner of training in

the U.S. Indeed, the PSID Time Use Survey suggests an average of

about five weeks (200 hours) of training per year, so if the time
spent in all forms of training in 1987 was the same as in 1976, the

report from firms would suggest a figure of about 200 billion of

1987 dollars in 1987.      Projecting the 55.7 billion (in 1976
dollars) to 19B7 (assuming the same ratio of training expenditures
to the wage bill) yields about $150 billion in 1987 dollars.
Apparently the training ratio increased by 1987,11 50 the estimates

based on the two entirely different and independent surveys are not

far apart.



     The "indirect" estimates of job training expenditures based on
wage profiles and the "direct" ones using the PSID Time Use Survey

provide the best comparison as they were taken in the same year
 (1976). since growth in the wage profile over the working age is
 likely to include factors other than job training it is reasonable

to find the "indirect" estimate to be larger (75 billion) than the

direct estimate (56 billion). This suggests that roughly 75% of
 the (cross—sectionally) observed intra-f in wage growth over the

 life—cycle is attributable to job training or learning, while 25%

 is likely to contain factors which produce an upward sloping 4age

profile other than human capital investments.'5



2. profitability of Job Training Investments


     Another objective of the study was to estimate profitabilities

of job training. That wage growth is related to in-firm training
is a finding in many studies. Viewing this growth as a return on

the investment costs produces positive rates of return which vary

depending on the data, demographic group, and period.


     Table 9 presents components of rates of return on investments

in job training. Estimates -of effects of a year with training on

wage (w) growth shown in column 1 are not comparable to effects of

an additional year of schooling at the average level of schooling.

The reason is that job training is not a full—time (full—year)
activity. If it takes 25 per cent of worktime during an average
week of a year with training, the rates of return on worker
opportunity costs are four times higher than the estimated rates of

wage growth.

        A series of rough calculations suggests that a generous
margin of error could lower this ratio to 65% or raise it to 85%.
The other models which posit an upward slope of the wage profile,
aside from job training, include employer schemes to economize on
costs of monitoring (tazear), on costs of turnover (Salop and
Salop) and wage outcomes of job matching (Jovanovic). No empirical
evidence exists on the quantitative empirical importance of these
undoubtedly plausible models.
     As I show below, growth of the cross—section wage profile is
affected also by changes in the age distribution. These changes
were pronounced in the 70's, and reversed in the SO's. Indirect
 (wage profile) estimates of job training investments are,
therefore, overstated in the 70's and understated in the 80's.
                                     24

        Let k = h/H, the fraction of work time devoted to job
training.      Here h is hours of training during the period (week,

month, or year) and H average hours of work during the period. Let

w be the pre—training and w the post-training wage.             Then the

(uncorrected) rate of return on training is r' = ((w1— w,) * H]         /

    *    h].   Here the numerator is the annual dollar increase in

earnings, the return on the investment, while the denominator is

the opportunity cost of training.           Let C = (w1 - w0)/w, be the

percent increase in wages due to training; then the (uncorrected)

rate of return is r' =     4/k.   The first three columns of Table 9 show

estimates of w, k and r' based on the PSID, the EOPP, and the two

young    cohorts of the IlLS.

        The r' rates appear to be implausibly high. However, they need
to be corrected downward, if skills acquired in training
                                                           If training is
depreciate,     and if the payoff period is short.
 portable, the latter factor may be ignored, as the median age of
 trainees is about 30, so that, without depreciation, the payoff

 period may exceed 30 years.              Depreciation, however, can be
 substantial, as suggested by Lillard and Tan (1986) .            For the

 previous NtS young cohort, they estimate an initial wage tin of
 10.8 per cent due to training and a subsequent decline of 1. per

 cent per year following training. This translates
                                                            into a .   per
 cent    exponential   rate of decline due to depreciation in return.., per

 year. My attempts to estimate a depreciation rate in the 'SW
 using the Liflard and Tan (1986) procedure yielded a depreciation
                                          25

rate close to 4 per cent. This smaller figure in the PSID may be

due to the broader coverage of all males, compared to younger males

in NLS: if training has substantial elements of specificity,
mobility would create wage depreciation. Since mobility of young
workers exceeds substantially the mobility of older workers, a
smaller depreciation rate in the PSID may be reasonable.


     The estimate of corrected rates of return (r) is obtained as

follows: given annual depreciation rates (d), and the payoff period

T, equate costs or foregone earnings while training (kw0) to the

present value of the stream of gains (Aw) the first year following

training,

                                        the next year,

      Column 4 shows estimates of r, with 'P assumed >= 30.             since

 the estimates of d were obtained by ignoring labor mobility, they
 could reflect negative effects of mobility on gains from (partly)
                                  26

firm specific (nontransferable) training. The polar alternative is

complete specificity which makes the payoff period T equal to the
length of tenure in the firm in which training was received, and
d=O, if there is no obsolescence within the tenure period T. (The
observed average values of T are shown in col. (7)   In this case,

r =   r'(l   —   (l+r)11 according to equation 1; r was solved by
iteration, and the results are shown in col. (5) .   These numbers
are rather surprisingly close to those in col. (4).      Thus, the
estimates do not depend much on whether the observed depreciation
is true and training is largely transferable, or it is an artifact

due to substantial specificity.


      To calculate the profitability rate of employer's investments

in training we need to know their returns and costs. In principle,
the way to assess returns is to compare increases in productivity
resulting from training with increases in wages. The excess is the

return on costs borne by the firm. Two recent studies using very

different data and approaches suggest that the productivity
increase is over twice that of the wage increase caused by
training. This is found by Barron et al. (1989) in the EOPP data,

where a productivity scale is used to gauge the increase.
Blakemore and Hoffman (1988) use production and turnover data by
 industry to estimate effects of tenure on wages and on output per

unit of time. They   find a doubling of productivity compared to
wages, implying that returns to employers are similar to returns to
workers. If employer costs are also about the same as those of
                                   27

workers, the uncorrected r' ( in col. 3 of Table 9) would be the

same for employers as for workers.          And if depreciation is
negligible, the employer rate of return would be again the same as

that of workers as listed in col. (5) in which observed tenure is
thern assumed payoff period. Note that this is always true for the

employer who gains only as long as trainees stay in the fin -
whether or not training is transferable. However, if depreciation
is positive during workers' stay in the training firm,    employers'
rates are lower than those indicated in cols (5) or (4)    .
                                                               Using   a

4 per cent depreciation rate for the PSID and 12 per cent for the

young NLS group results in a lower limit for employer profitability

rates, shown in col. (6). only in the case of complete specificity
of training would worker rates also be the same.


     The assumption that employer costs are just about equal to
worker costs is more speculative than the proposition of roughly

equal return (r') .   It   can be defended, if we consider time costs

of workers (E kw0) to be absorbed by workers, while time costs of

supervisors, trainers, and of coworkers are absorbed by employers.

Except for the time when trainees learn by watching others at work,

the time spent on training is the same for trainers and trainees.

 If so, the EOPP data (Table 1 in Barron et al., 1989) suggest that
 trainers spend two—thirds of the 150 hours of training reported       to
 be spent by trainees during the three months of new hires. Since
 wages of trainers, supervisors and co—workers are higher than wages

 of trainees, employer costs are likely to be about as high as
                                28

employee tine costs in the groups covered by the LOP?. Whether

this ratio of employer to employee time inputs can be generalized
is unknown. Neither iS there any evidence that employees absorb
precisely the costs of time they spent and employers the rest. In
the absence of information on the actual division of costs between
employers and workers, we can still consider the profitability of

training if we know total costs and total returns. The fragmentary

evidence described above suggests that these totals are roughly
double the costs ascribed to workers and returns observed for
workers. consequently, the profitability rates in cols. (4), (5),

and (6) remain conceptually valid, as measures of profitability of
training, regardless of who bears the cost.



     What does the range of estimates in Table 5a tell us about
adequacy of training? As soft as it may be, this evidence is all

that could be marshalled.     Are the rates too high, suggesting
under—investment? Column (5) in which depreciation within the firm

is negligible but training is not portable suggest quite ample
profitability, even if trainees stay in the firm no longer than

non—trainees! In other words, average worker mobility would deter

 neither them nor employers from investment in training. However,
 depreciation is probably not zero, so the correct figures are
 between col. (4), (5) and (6). We also need to keep in mind that:

 (a) the rates in Table 5a are average, not marginal.   Bishop (1989)

 suggests that marginal rates in the EON' are about half the size of
                               29

average rate'6; (b) rates of return to training are expected to

exceed those on schooling because they do not include consumption

returns.   Finally, the trade—off between training and mobility

investments, especially at younger ages, needs to be considered
before underinvestment in training can be determined.


     Consequently, there is no definite evidence of under-•
investment in these data sets, though it clearly cannot be ruled

out, given the average magnitudes within the range of estimates in

Table 3 (cols. 4, 5, and 6).


3. Job Training Response to. Growing Demand for Human Capital



      The growth of demand for human capital which accelerated in
the past decade resulted in increased rates of return to schooling

 and induced positive supply responses in enrollments. Do we find
 corresponding increases in profitabilities and volumes of job
 training? Several pieces of evidence yield affirmative answers:


      Indirect evidence on the growth of profitability and volumes

 is provided by analyses of changing wage profiles over the 1964—
 1990 period. Two basic factors affect the slope of the (cross-


      "    The EOPP sample shows the lowest rates of return.      It
 consists mainly of inexperienced, unskilled young workers.
      "    Gains from mobility amount to one—third of wage growth of
 male workers during the first decade of work experience (Jovanovic
 and Mincer, 1981).
                                    30

sectional) wage profile, that is the magnitude of age (experience)

differentials in wages: (1) Increased profitability andfor volumes

of job training steepen the profile, according to the human capital
wage function. Here the slope of the profile, (or it's early slope
measured by the coefficient of the linear ten of the experience

variable (X) )   is   the product rk,, where r is the rate of return on

post—school investments (read: mainly job training and learning)
and k the fraction of time spent in training. If demand for skill
training increases, the coefficient of X should rise because of
increased profitability and the induced increase in training.          (2)

The recent gyrations in the U.S. age distribution -        the   baby boom

and subsequent baby bust -     resulted   in changes in relative wages by

age.     The change in relative demographic supplies, or age
distribution, is therefore another factor apart from r and k to

affect the slope of the cross—sectional wage profiles. As studies
by Freeman (1979) and by Welch (1979) have shown the influx of
large numbers of "baby boomers" into the markets of the 1970's

increased the slope of the wage profiles, especially of college
graduates, less so for high school graduates.            However, as the
 "baby bust" cohorts entered the markets of the 1980's, the profiles

did not flatten. They remained steep for college graduates, and

steepened strongly for high school graduates.


       Table (10) shows that these changes in slopes of wage
                                31

profile&' are explainable by both demographic changes (D) and the

changing profitability of human capital (r). Wage profiles were
fit separately to CPS samples of high-school graduates and college

graduates using quadratic wage functions each year.       In turn the

coefficient of experience at X=i0, was used as the dependent
variable. Three independent variables were: 0 —   the   ratio of young

male workers (1 to 5 years of experience) to all (up to 40 years of

experience) in the respective schooling group; r1 —       the rate of
return to schooling, measured as the percent wage differential
between college and high school graduates with 6-10 years of work

experience. The third variable (u) is the male unemployment rate,

which is particularly large and sensitive to cyclical changes in
demand for young and less skilled workers.


     Clearly, the effect of declining profitability (r,) of college

 education on the slope of the wage profile in the 1970's was more

 than offset by the effect of the baby boom cohort entering the
 market while the growing demand for skills in the 80's indicated by

 the increased rate of return to schooling resulted in the increased

 profitability ( and volume) of training, hence steeper profiles
 especially among high school graduates, and partly among college
 graduates. The increased demand for job training steepened the
 high school wage profile, and prevented the college profile from

 males.    Additional factors affect wage profiles of women,
 especially discontinuity in labor force participation.
                                  32

flattening. The weaker fit to the male college profile in Table

(10) may be a consequence of the growth of numbers of female
college graduates. and of post—graduates - a question that needs to

be investigated.


     Similar experiments with wage profiles were reported by S.
Allen (1993) at a disaggregated level, within industries: Allen
correlated educational wage differentials within two-digit
industries with slopes of wage functions estimated in cross-section

and over time (    late   70's to late 80's)   The correlation were

positive and significant.


     The analysis of wage profiles indicates that either
profitability (r) or volumes (k) of training or both increased in

 the So's. The findings do not distinguish between r and k, though
 in parallel to school education we would expect that both rates of

 return and volumes of training increased, the latter in response to

 the former, as demand for skills increased.


      Direct evidence on increases in volumes of training over the

 1980's is available from two BLS Surveys (1983 and 1991).   This is

 the only pair of job training surveys in the 1980's that are
 comparable as their design is identical.


      The first survey was a supplement to the January 1983 CI'S
                                   33

(BLS   Bulletin   2226) and the second a similar supplement in iggi.

The surveys report on the incidence (frequency) of job training of
the work force, and, to a lesser extent on its duration.           (A

complete accounting would require reports on the product of the two

components, amounting to total manhours of training).



       Table (11) reports some of the salient levels and changes in
the incidence of job training between 1983 and 1991. two purposes

of training were distinguished in the surveys: (1) Training needed
to qualify for the current job, and (2) Training to improve skills
on the current job.



       While training requirements for jobs changed little, the
incidence of training for skill improvement on the current job
increased from 35% to 41% of all workers. In both surveys, the
dominant sources of qualifying training were schools and informal
on—the—job training, but for skill improvement, the distribution of

sources was almost unif on. A major change between 1983 and 1991
was the relative increase in incidence and duration of formal
company programs. According to Bartel and Sicherman (1993) formal

company training programs are more closely correlated with
technological change than other forms of training.

the job underwent skill improvement training as well, suggesting
that training activities tend to be continuous, though diminishing

over the working age. Some of the skill improvement training is
retraining, a component of training that is likely to grow in the

face of changing technology.


     En both surveys levels of qualifying and of skill improvement
training were positively related to the level of schooling.
Increases in training over time occurred in all schooling and age

groups, though somewhat more in the more educated and more
experienced groups.


     The positive correlation bttween training and school education

has been noted in many studies. Two explanations of this finding

may be proposed: those with greater learning abilities and facing
 lower discount rates (subjective and objective) are likely to
 invest in more schooling and, for the same reasons, in more job
 training. Alternatively, when schooling and training are viewed as

 heterogeneous tons of human capital, the same conclusion follows,

 if as productive inputs, training and schooling are complementary:

 That is to say, better schooling results in more efficient training

 on the job. It is difficult to distinguish these hypotheses. One

 piece of evidence (Bartel and Sichenan, 1993) is that not :ily
 years of schooling but also the quality of learning at given
 numbers of years of schooling, measured in aptitude scores, is
 positively related to training. If complementarity is the proper
                                35

hypothesis, it implies that the optimal way to improve skills is to

improve school learning. Indeed, employer complaints about their
being forced into providing remedial literacy and nuneracy programs
is a case in point.



     At any rate, although the data on training are far from
adequate, there is enough evidence to indicate that in recent
decades, education and training responded positively to the
changing profitability of human capital.



     If training and schooling are complementary, a conclusion that
we are under—investing in training would follow, at least in a
potential sense: Improvement in school learning would reduce the
costs (increase the efficiency) of training, so rates of return
would rise inducing an increased demand f or training.

Some Prognosis. Once Again.



     Since investments in human capital respond positivel'; to
profitability, we should expect reductions in the rates of r:turn

over the 1990's stemming from the accumulated supply due to the
growth of enrollment rates and of training in the 1980's. If so,

skill differentials in wages and overall wage and income inequality
should also tend to narrow in the 1990's. The question is:      how

much of a reduction can we expect?


     On the assumption that demand remains at current levels, that

is without further growth, we can look at the predicted growth of
the relative supply in the 1990's and the parameter estimates of
the supply effect on the rate of return: The relevant growth in

the educational supply of young workers is already knot.m: Figure
 (4) shows its prospective growth of educational attainment in the
90's resulting from increased enrollment rates in the 80's. If the

relevant supply is restricted to young people, the chart predicts
an increase of the proportion with at least college education from
23 currently to 31 percent by the year 2000, an increase of 35%.
Multiplying this increase by the relevant supply elasticity (-0.7)

yields a 25% reduction in the wage premium by the year 200220    if

 "normal" rates of return to schooling are 6—8%, this reduction
 would get us back at least half way toward the long—term average a



           Note in Table 5 that the supply effect on the wage
 premium lags 2 years.
                                    37

decade from now.       The reduction is likely to be smaller if the

relevant   supply   is not restricted to young (X<=lO) workers, but is

a function of relative school attainment (% of college plus) in the

overall work force.


     Two issues must be faced before we can accept these
predictions:    (1) Parameter estimates in Table Sa may not be the

most reliable — a task for econometricians to explore. We can,
however, use available alternative estimates to do some checking.

The supply effect on the college wage premium comparable to our
REST parameter in Table 4 which covers the whole labor force is
estimated by Katz and Murphy (1991) in elasticity terms to be -0.71

(their Table 9). This implies a somewhat larger elasticity for the
younger population, as stated above.



     (2) The assumption that demand for human capital will stop
rising is probably unrealistic. In the 1980's the rate of return

to education zoomed up 8 percent points, and this was due almost

entirely to accelerated growth of demand for human capital as

supply   remained static.      Even if the growth of demand were to
continue at half that pace, the upward pressure on the wage premium
would just about neutralize the supply effect, leaving skill
differentials as wide as they are now, implying a continuation of



          Our R&D index of demand stopped growing since the mid—
eighties.   However, its growth may well resume, once military
cutbacks are completed. Net tuition costs may also stop growing,
as subsidies increase, but budget deficits may prevent such moves.
                                38

pronounced skill shortages.


     These shortages might even increase if needed supply responses

are impeded by demography, including adverse changes in the family,

stagnating family income for a large part of the population, rising
tuition, and the inadequacies of learning at home, school and on
the job. As already noted, the learning bottleneck represents an
impediment to the expansion of job training as well, given
complementarity between learning at school and training.      Some

information and much advocacy is available. Yet a closer analysis

of these causes and of policy options remains urgent before we
embark on bureaucratic solutions.
