          This paper uses data from a nationwide sample of firms on employee

wages and characteristics     to reexamine the determinants of employee

productivity and earnings.       The data include several measures of job

I.   Introduction

         In recent years, a series of studies have been done which empirically

examine the determinants     of    (as   well as the relationship between) worker

productivity and earnings.        Several    strands have appeared within this

literature.       For instance, Medoff and Abraham (1980, 1981) have challenged the

traditional "humao capital" interpretation          of the experience—earnings      effect

(i.e., that experience raises wages because it enhances productivity),               using


performance ratings of professional and managerial employees from the files of

two large companies.1       In fact, they find no positive effects of experience on

within—grade performaoce.         But using different data, other authors     (e.g.,

Btown (1983), Maranto and Rodgers          (1984)) have found more positive effects of

              2
experience.

          More generally, the links between productivity and earnings and/or the

determinants      of each have been examined by others as well (e.g., Frank (1984),

Klein et. al. (1987), Weiss (1988)).            The effects of pay incentives     on worker

output and earnings have also received atteotioo,          (e.g., Seller (1984), Lazear

(1986), Weiss (1987), Brown (1987)), though we have seen little direct

evidence on output effects of incentives.4

          One reason for some of the conflicting       results in the papers cited

above is that almost every one is based on a unique sample of workers, making

results    from each very difficult       to generalize.   Of course, this primarily

reflects the fact that measures of employee productivity            are generally    not

available     for most employees and, when available,       they are generally quite

specific    to a given set of workers.

          In this paper, I use data from a nationwide survey of firms on employee

          characteristics   and performance     to reexsmine   the determinants   of
wages,

productivity and earnings.         The data are from the Employment Opportunity Pilot
Project     (80FF) Survey of Firms in 1980 and    l982. This survey of    about 3400

firms   (in 1982) includes a lengthy set of questions on the wages and

charscteristics     of the last worker hired by each firm.      In particular,   one set

of questions gauges subjective employer productivity scores (on a 0—100 scale)

at different points in time for this most recent employee.          These scores will

be used as our measures of employee performance.        In this study I consider the

determinants of both productivity and wsges between and within firms.

          We will present estimates of wage equations in which a variety of

experience measures (for both past experience and tenure on the current job)

as well as productivity scores sre used as explanatory variables.          To deal

with the problem firm—specific factors in the subjective productivity

measures,    we estimate some wage—change equations using data for different

points in time on each worker.     We also estimate productivity score equations

(in both levels and changes) to measure the extent to which determinants of

wages and of productivity are the same.        Other factors which presumably

influence    both wages and productivity,    such as hours   spent in training and the

presence of pay incentive    schemes, also will be considered,      as will be a

variety of demographic and firm—level characteristics.         By estimating wage and

productivity equations in both levels and changes and as functions of a broad

range of determinants,    this paper will build on previous work by John Barron,

John Bishop and others which considered some of these same issues.6

        The results of this paper can be briefly summarized here.        We find that

both previous experience and tenure have significant positive effects on wages

and productivity.    The previous xperience effects are mostly observed on

levels of wages and productivity,    and are strongest for experience that has

some application    to the current job.     The effects of job tenure, on the other

hand,   can be seen on both current levels and changes of wages and
                                                3




productivity.        We also find hours of training to be positively related to both

wage and productivity growth but generally not to levels of either.                Finally,

we find perceived       productivity   growth (as well as current productivity levels)

to be a bit higher for female than for male employees even though their wages

are significantly       lower.    The effects of pay incentive      schemes and various

firm characteristics       (such as unionism)       are noted as well.

          The rest of the paper is laid out as follows:            Section TI describes the

data and equations estimated         in greater detail, while      Section III presents the

results of estimated wage and productivity            equations.   Section TV contains the

conclusion and implications of this work.




II.     Data amd Equatioms

          The EOPP Survey of firms in 1980 and 1982 was administered in 28 local

areas that were sites for the FOP? experiments             in the late 1970's.    The sites

are heavily concentrated         in the South and aid—West,     and about half are

SMSA's.     Large and/or low—wage firms were overaampled within each site.

          The 1982 survey, which we use below, asked two general           types of

questions of employers:          one type covering    firm—wide characteristics    (e.g.,

number of employees,       fraction unionized,      number of vacancies,   etc.) and the

other covering the last worker hired during or before the previous year.7

Among the latter questions         in the 1982 Survey were the occupation, sex, age

and years of education       of the worker, as well as his or her wages —         both

starting and current       (or most recent if the employee was no longer with the

firm).     If some   sort of incentive scheme was used as part of the pay package,

the type of scheme (e.g., commission,         tips, piece rate, etc.) was noted as

well.
                                                       4




       In addition,          employers were asked to score that employee's                           productivity

on a scale from 0 to 100, where the former would reflect no productivity and

the latter the maximum          feasible output on the job.                   The question was asked for

different   points in the employee's              tenure at the firm:               the first two weeks,

the third   through twelfth weeks, and currently/most                         recently.           Separate

questions   were asked for "typical' employees                    on the same job so that relative

comparisons    could be made within the firm.

       A few different measures of employee experience are also available in

theae data.     One question asked how many months of previous                               experience    the

employee had that has some application to the current                             job.       Presumably,     this

question gauges occupation and/or industry—specific                           experience.          From the

question on the employee's age and years of education, we can also calculate a

standard measure of total labor market experience (i.e., age minus years of

education minus 6).          Finally,   tenure within the firm was specifically asked

from those employees who were no longer with the firm.                              For those still

present, tenure can be calculated from the date of hiring and the survey date.

       In addition to the tenure measures, several questions were asked about

the amount of time explicitly           invested in training by the new employee.                             Total

hours of formal and informal            training provided by management,                      supervisors,       or

trained personnel        as well as informal training provided by co—workers are the

ones used below.

       With all of these data, we are able to estimate equations of the

following   form:




      1)      ln (W5         PS5.   a + b*        + c            + d Y        +   f5Z.+

                                                                                     3       ij



      2)      ln                                   +                          +          +

          In addition to estimating equations 1) and 2) as indicated, we can also

        indicate the extent to which returns to training, experience, tenure,
ps1
etc. reflect returns to productivity.             Comparisons    of the coefficients   on the

        with those from simple wage equations containing these variables
ps1
similarly show us the extent to which "human capital" variables account for

observed    productivity   of individual workers.

          Of course, a major concern in all of this involves the subjective

nature of the PS1.         If the managers at each firm have different          notions about

what a particular productivity score means in terms of employee performance,

these firm—specific     effects may be correlated            with various regressors and thus

may cause biased coefficient estimates               (see footnote 7) in the wage

equations).      Job—specific factors in these evaluations (within I—digit

occupation and 2—digit iodustry) would cause similar problems.
                                                   6




          Fortunately,     the multiple observatione per worker and firm on wages and

productivity scores enable us to estimate difference equations in which these

firm—specific factors are eliminated.              Assuming that ac = a5, bc = b5, etc.,

first—difference       equations   could be estimated       in which all time—invariant

characteristics        of workers and firms are omitted as regressors, leaving only

tenure (as the difference in experience)               and training as time—varying    factors.

          However, the assumption of equal intercepts and coefficients may not

hold.     For the productivity—score      equations       in particular, various worker, job

or firm characteristics       may be associated with differences in employee

learning and therefore in productivity—growth,               or in employer evaluations of

such growth.        If nothing else, emnloyee learning or changes in employer

evaldations     over time would cause different           intercepts between   the PS5 and PS'

equations.

          Therefore,    we will present estimates of change equations below in which

intercepts and time—invariant         regressors       are both omitted and included, with

specification tests done for the validity of each.                There are also other well—

known problems with change equations         if independent variables are measured

with error, as subjective productivity scores might well be.8 In this case,

differencing    compounds    the relative magnitude        of the error and causes

downward—biased estimates (e.g., Freeman (1984)).               Because of this

possibility, we consider results from equations              in levels as well as those in

changes    below.

          Another issue which frequently arises in estimating productivity

differentials       among employees   is that of sample selection,       since those hired

do not represent a random sample of worker attributes              and the selection

criteria are likely correlated with the determinants of productivity (Brown,

1982).     This is somewhat    less of a problem for a sample of workers at many
firms than for those at one firm, since the former contain a more random

sample of employee    charactheristics.     Furthermore,   comparisons   of wage and

productivity equations ought not to be greatly plagued by this problem, since

similar selection    criteria   are operating   in both cases.

       A final issue here involves the fact that both starting and current

wages are observed in different       years for different workers,   since the most

recently hired worker before August 1981 might have been hired in earlier

years or may have left the firm before        1982.   Since the early 1980's were

years of high inflation as well as minimum wage increasesj0 annual wage

increases    due to these factors might cause upward biases in the estimated           wage

effecta of tenure.     Accordingly,   we include controls for OPT and minimum wage

levels and changes based on the starting and current/most         recent years in all

of the equations estimated below.'1



III.   Results
        In   Table I we present means and standard deviations      for the wages and

characteristics    of the "last worker hired" by firms in the 1982 survey.

       The results confirm the relatively low—wage nature of the sample, with

starting wages in 1980—81 of about        $5.00 an hour.   Most workers are high

school graduates employed in clerical, sales, and service occupations.

        As for productivity scores, we find the mean for initial productivity

to be close to 50 on the 0—to—lOO scale, while current productivity is

substantially    higher.   The average experience level of about eight years

indicates    that the average worker here is in his or her mid—twenties        in age.

About one—quarter    of total experience is considered "applicsble" by managers,

and tenure on the job averages slightly less than a year.          Over 70% of these

workers are still with their firms.              Thus, we are primarily      capturing    young

workers    very early in their tenure profiles in this sampleJ2                    This rather


non—representativenature of the sample must be kept in mind as results are

interpreted       below.

          We also find that the average worker in the sample is reported to have

over 50 hours of training, though most of it is considered informal.                      The

fraction of workers covered by the various               incentive   schemes is also quite

low.

Equations      for Wage and    Productivity     Levels
          In   Table 2 we present present of log (wage) equations,             with Table 2a

containing estimates         for starting wages and Table       2b containing       those for

current/most recent wages.          Experience,       tenure, and training variables       all

appear in quadratic form, with tenure appearing only in the current wage

equation.      For both wage measures, we present specifications               in which the

personal characteristics         and the productivity       scores first appear separately

and then together.          In addition to the experience/training          variables,    the

personal characteristics         include dummies for sex, education          and 1—digit

occupation.       Dummies    for the presence of incentive       pay are also included.

Firm characteristics include 2—digit industry, fraction unionized, plant and

firm    size,13   and site dummmies.         Finally, each equation includes CPI and

minimum wage level variables           for either the starting or current/most           recent

year.

          The results      in Column   1   for each wage equation show effects that         are

widely consistent with those in the literature.                Of particular    interest here

are the large estimated         effects of the experience       measures.    TJe   find that each

year of applicable experience           adds over 4% to the employee's       wages, while

general    experience adds about 1% per year.            The first year of job tenure adds

 doubt reflect       the concentration     of most of our sample on the steep, early part

 of the profile.

          The effects of formal training are much larger than those for informal

training by either management or coworkers.                 The former are positive and

significant      in the equations     for current wages and are marginally significant

in those for starting wages, while effects for other kinds of training are

not.     These   results are consistent       with our notions of workers bearing at

least some costs of training.             Quite strikingly, we find large effects of

incentive     schemes on pay, which are also much larger for current than for

starting wages.4           Finally, we find the usual positive effects of unionism,

education and being male (the latter being worth about 20%) on both wage

rates.

          In Cols.    2   of Table 2 we find the coefficients from simple equations           of

wages    on productivity scores, while in cola. 3 we have added all controls

except those for experience and training.                 These results show positive and

significant      effects of productivity       scores, with a 100—point increase (i.e.,

from the lowest to highest possible productivity)                raising wages by 18% to

23%.     On the other hand, a standard—deviation             rise in initial productivity

raises wages by only about 15% of a standard deviation across firms, and

current productivity shows similar results. 15

         The inclusion of the various controls              in Col. 3 has virtually   no effect

on the initial productivity coefficient and a fairly small effect on the

current productivity coefficient.             The coefficients     on the controls    themselves

are also not greatly changed.          But when the experience and training variables

are added in Col.         4, the magnitudes   of the productivity score effects are
                                             10




dramatically reduced.      in particular,    the effect on starting wages     is reduced

to about half of its previous size and that on current wages to about a third

of its previous size.      This suggests    that experience    and training are strongly

correlated with perceived productivity,        and may account for much of the

observed effect of productivity on wages across firms.           On the other hand, the

experience and training effects themselves are not much changed by inclusion

of the productivity scores.      The tenure coefficient       in the current wage

equation is reduced by the greatest amount, and the reduction is only about

13% of the original     one.   These results suggest that experience and training

have important non—productivityrelated effects on wages as well.

        Table 3 provides additional evidence on the determinants of perceived

productivity.     Tn this table we have estimated      coefficients   of productivity

score equations.     The results show significant,      positive effects of applicable

previous experience on productivity        scores, though the effect is much larger

for initial     than for current productivity.      A standard—deviationrise in such

experience    raises one's productivity     score   in the first two weeks by about   .35

of a standard deviation and one's current score by about           .20.


        For the latter, however, we find an even larger effect of tenure in the

firm.   A one year rise in tenure raises the productivity score by 23 points,

and a standard deviation rise in tenure raises the current productivity score

by about three—fourths     of a standard deviation.

        These sizable effects of previous experience and tenure on productivity

therefore    stand in sharp contrast to the results of Medoff and Abraham, who

found negative effects of experience        on productivity within grade.      The

differences in results between these studies might reflect the much wider

range of firms and occupations that are represented in these data relative to

theirs (which considered only professional/managerial          employees   at two

subjective productivity scores and wages, as well as the observed

these scores on wages, also enable us to have some confidence that the

productivity score levels are meaningful as measures of worker performance.'6

       On the other hand, we find generally negative effects of hours of

wage effect, they are unlikely to be of sufficient magnitude              to fully explain

the difference.18 The argument that sex differentials               in wages reflect

discrimination thus becomes more compelling.

          Finally,   we note positive but generally small and insignificant            effects

of unionism and worker education on their productivity scores.               It is,

however,     noteworthy that the positive union effects become significant (though

they remain much smaller than wage effects in percentage              terms) when the

experience    and training variables are omitted from the productivity score

equations.19




Equations for Wage amd Productivity Changes

          As noted above, there are some fairly serious questions          about the

validity or meaning of these results.         Variation in jobs within the 1—digit

occupation and 2—digit industry categories          for which we control may render

some comparisons     meaningless   and might account for a few of the anomalous

results    above, particularly for incentive       pay.   Variation in firm—specific

factors affecting     subjective employer evaluations might create biases in

either direction in the coefficients of Tables 2 and           3,   depending on their

correlations with individual regressors.           Any measurement    error in the

productivity scores would also cause downward biases in the magnitude of the

coefficients on these variables       in Table 2, which might explain their

relatively small magnitudes and their small effects on other included

variables.

          To deal with the problem of firm— and job—specific          factors in

productivity—scoremeasures, we estimate wage—change and productivity—change

equations and present these results in Tables 4 and 5 respectively.                As noted

above, differences     in estimated effects    for current wages      and productivity
                                            13



relative to their starting values may eliminate         the justification     for using a

strict first—differenceapproach and msy therefore imply the use of intercepts

and tine—invariant regressors in these equations.          Accordingly,    we present

estimates    in Tables 4 and 5 of equations      containing intercepts.     Only the

time—varying    regressors   (i.e., tenure and hours    of training)     are included in

the first few specifications of the wage change equation,           while eventually the

others are added as well.       Changes   in productivity scores are alan used as

regressors in Table 4 and as dependent variables         in Table   5.   The first—

difference versions of the wage equations do, however, appear in the Appendix.

       The results of Table      4 show that tenure and training both have


significant,    positive effects on wage growth.20 As before, the effects of

formal training are larger than those of informal         training, while both types

of training by management have nnre positive effects than time apent with

coworkers.     Interestingly,   training explains    little of the tenure effect on

wage growth.     We alsn find that wage growth is positively affected by

incentive    pay schemes.    On the other hand, previous experience bears no

relationship to wage growth.

       When changes in productivity scores are added to the wage change

equations, we again find positive and significant         effects, with the magnitudes

somewhat smaller than they were in comparable wage level equations.             However,

the presence of change in experience (i.e., tenure) in these equations             lowers

the magnitude of the productivity effect by a much smaller amount than did

experience in the wage level equations.          In this case, tenure and training

hours account for 10—15% each of the magnitude         of the productivity effect,

while all other controls account for little more.          Conversely,     productivity

changes account for about       10% of the estimated tenure effects on wage changes.

          We also     note   that   the   intercepts          in many of these equationa are

significant,        while the time—invariant            regresaors of Cols. 3 and 7 are mildly

significant as well.21 But as these are not significant                        in all cases, we

consider the results of first—differencewage equations in the Appendix as

well.     While the magnitudes of most affects are larger in these equations,                         the


qualitative results are very similar.                     Productivity changes now account for

about 14% of the wage change—tenure                    effect.

          In Table 5, we once again find significant and positive effects                      of

tenure on productivity score changes.22                       The magnitudes are somewhat    smaller

than were the comparable ones in Table 3, but they remain quite large.23 But

in contrast to the earlier productivity score equations,                       we now find that bott

formal and informal training also have significant                      positive effects on

productivity changes, even after controlling                       for job tenure.   As was suggested

before,    female emoloyees         show significantly higher productivity growth than di

males,    though there is no significant growth in their relative wages.                       The

large and significantly ppsitive intercepts in all of the equations                         suggest a

rise in employer evaluations of their employee's performance over time, even

after controlling for tenure.

          In sum, the estimates of wage—change and productivity—changeequations

reinforce our earlier findings that tenure raises both productivity and

earnings,    though it also has effects on earnings                    which are independent of

productivity.         We also find that hours of training contribute significantly tc

wage and productivity growth, even if they are not related to the levels of

either;    and that sex differences             in wages are not reflected in productivity

levels or growth.

          Before concluding,         we note again that the presence of measurement                 errot

in the subjective ratings may mean that wage change equations compound any

downward biases that existed in the estimated                       productivity score coefficients

of wage level equations.          The estimates of Tables 4 and 5 might therefore be

viewed as lower bounds to the true effects of productivity on wages and on the

wage—tenure relationship. Furthermore, the similarities between productivity

effects on wages and experience in equations for levels and these for changes

again suggest that the subjective productivity scores used in the analysis

here are meaningful as measures of worker performance.



IV.     Comclmsfom

          This   paper   uses   data from a nationwide sample of firms on employee

wages   and characteristics to reexamine the determinants of employee

productivity and earnings.          Productivity is measured by subjective

productivity ratings of recently hired workers by their employers.               The

primary determinants of productivity and earnings that we consider are

enployee experience and tenure, hours of training, pay incentive schemes, and

various demographics characteristics of workers.           Wage and productivity score

equations are estimated in changes as well as levels to eliminate job— and

firm—specific factors in these productivity scores.

          The results show that both previous experience and current job tenure

have positive and significant effects on wages and productivity.            These

results    appear in levels of wages and productivity for previous experience and

in both current levels and changes of wages and productivity for job tenure.

A good deal of the wage—productivity relationship is accounted for by

experience,      and the effects    are largest   for experience that has some


application to the current job.          On the other hand, experience and tenure have

additional effects on wages which appear to be independent of their

productivity—enhancing effects.
                                          16




        We also find that hours spent in training have positive effects on both

wage and productivity changes, though productivity levels suggest that less

initially productive workers may receive more hours of training than do their

counterparts,   within firms.    The various pay incentive      schemes,   which

generally have large positive effects on wage levels and changes, do not have

similar positive effects on productivity levels or changes.

        Finally, we find various other effects of individual and firm

characteristics. In particular,      female employees    show greater productivity

growth then do male employees, and their current productivity levels are

slightly higher as well.      These results    for females   and males   stand in sharp

contrast to their relative wage levels, which are significantly higher for

men.    The evidence   that higher wages for male workers reflect discrimination

is therefore strengthened.      We also find positive effects of unionism on

productivity scores of workers,     though in percentage terms these effects are

much smaller than are the effects of unionism on wages.

        A   few caveats must be kept in mind as these results are reviewed.         The

exact nature and meaning of the subjective productivity score variable remain

questionable, and this unusual sample of young and inexperienced workers must

be noted as well. Still, the results here strongly suggest that wages are

affected by a wide range of both productivity— and non—productivity—related

factors, including     discrimination and unionism.     The potential for training to

raise both wages and productivity is also documented.           More study of these

links   between productivity and earnings as well as the determinants of each             is


certainly warranted.

                                      FOOTNOTES




       1The seminal   piece   in the literature which stresses the productivity—


enhancing effect of experience is Mincer (1974).       But more recent theoretical

formulations stress that profit—maximizing firms may choose earnings profiles

that are steeper than productivity profiles with respect to experience (e.g.,

Lazear (1979)).

       A somewhat different question has recently been raised about whether

the returns to job tenure really reflect differences in "match quality" across


people and jobs as opposed to a return to tenure for people on the same jobs

(Abraham and Farber, 1987).     If, in fact, those with longer tenure have higher

quality matches, we would expect to see higher productivity among those with

longer tenure.

       2Maranto and Rodgers find that the experience of government       officials

in monitoring firm compliance with minimum wage laws raises their productivity

in uncovering violations.     Brown finds that most of the wage—tenure profile is

explained by the time which individuals       report that it takes for them to

complete training and become fully productive on their jobs.

       3Frank analyzes the distributions of sales and earnings among

automobile dealers and realtors, finding a narrower spread in the latter than

the former.   Klein et. al. and Weiss use data on output for production workers

at a large firm to analyze the effects of gender and high school graduation on

observed output and quits.     Another strand of this literature analyzes the

union effect on productivity and compares it with the wage effect.        This

growing literature is summarized in Freeman and Medoff (1984).

          4Lazear and Brown present theoretical arguments      on firm choice between

straight time and incentive pay, and Brown provides empirical evidence as

well.     Seiler and Weiss pr?vide evidence that individual incentives (relative

to straight time pay or group incentives) raises the variance of earnings

across individual workers and infer effort/output effects from this.

          5The 1982 wave of the survey was developed at the National Center for

Research on Vocational Education and administered by Gallup, Inc.

          6These papers include Barron et. al. (1986), Barron and       Lowenstein

(1986),    and Bishop (1987, 1988).       Results are discussed below where relevant.

          7The question calls for the last employee hired on or before August

1981.     Approximately 20 workers in this sample were,      in fact, hired    during

1982.     Frequencies of workers hired in 1979, 1980, and 1981 were 99, 206, and

1110.

          8The point that subjective performance ratings are characterized by a

fair amount of randomness is made in Hunter (1983).

          90f those who are no longer with the firm,      19 left in 1980, 167 left in

1981,   and about     190 left in 1982.    All who are still with the firm    report
wages for 1982.

          10CP1    levels (using 1967 as the base year) were 217.4, 246.8, 272.4,

and 289.1 respectively for the years 1979—82.          Minimum wages set by the

Federal government were $2.90 in 1979, 3.10 in 1980, and 3.35 in 1981.

          11The coefficients on the log(CPI) levels and changes are significantly

less than one in most wage level and change equations.          The data thus reject

deflating as a means for dealing with nominal wage adjustment.          The use of

year—level or year—change dummies in the appropriate equations         instead of CPI

and minimum wage variables led to fairly comparable results with regards           to

the effects       of experience and productivity on wages.

         12The youthfulness and low experience levels of the sample reflect not

only its focus on low—wage firms but also the fact that a sample of last—hired

workers will overrepresent high turnover, low duration workers and jobs within

firms.    This must be kept in mind as results are interpreted below.

          13Plant size actually refers to company employment levels within the


site,    for which exact magnitudes were gauged in the survey.          Total company

employment (i.e., both within snd outside the site) was then gauged using a

set of categories i.e., 1—100, 100—250,        250—500,   500—2000,   and 2000+.   We use

the continuous within—site measure and well as dummy variables            from total firm

employment.

          1Since we   focus here on wage levels rather than variances,        these

results are a bit different from those of Seiler and Weiss (see footnote 5)

who find higher variances when using individual level incentives,             It is,

however, quite plausible that the means and variances of worker compensation

are positively correlated.

          15These magnitudes are roughly similar to those found by Bishop (1987)

with these data.      He focused on relative wage and productivity differences

between employees within firms, using a relatively small sample of workers

with vocational education (in addition to the 'last worker hired") about whom

questions were asked in the EOPP Survey.

               is, of course,   possible that the correlations between wages and

productivity scores are explained by a tendency of supervisors to rate higher

wage employees with higher scores, thereby rationalizing the higher wages

which they receive anyway.       The experience—productivityeffects might also be


explained by a positive age—bias in scoring, as suggested by Rothe (1949).

          17The case for negative selection into training is somewhat weakened by

the positive correlations between hours of training and levels of education
                                             20



observed for these workers, though correlations with previous experience were

negative.     Both results are consistent with those observed by Mincer (1988)

and Lillard and Tan (1986).      Since    the estimated   performance effects are

within 1—digit occuption,     positive correlations with education and negative

ones with productivity are not implausible.

          18The presence of sex differentials in wages that are not observed in

productivity has been noted by Klein et. al. (1987).              Differential quitting

behavior between males and females has been noted by Viscusi             (1980) and Matzen

(1986).     However, the differentials calculated here already control for

currently observed tenure as well as training.            It is thus   unlikely that

expected tenure differentials     could   fully explain the observed wage effect.

          19Unionism here is positively (though weakly) correlated with previoua

experience (p=.07      for applicable and .03 for general experience) and

negatively correlated with hours of training        (   p=—. 05   for informal training

by management and —.03 for that with coworkers).           The latter result is

consistent with Mincer (1983).     When experience and training variables are

omitted from productivity score equations, the coefficient (and standard

error) on collective bargaining are .053 (.028) and .032 (.019) for initial

and current productivity scores respectively.           Moving from 0 to 100% unioniam

would thus raise wages by about 33% (Table 2) and productivity by about 10%

initially and 4% currently.

          20The positive effects of training on both wage and productivity growth

have been noted in these data by Barron et. al. (1986) and elsewhere by Mincec

(1985) and Lillard and Tan (1986).

       22Effects of tenure on changes in productivity scores in these data

have been noted by Bishop (1988).

           one standard—deviation change in tenure leads to a change in

productivity growth of about   .41 of a standard deviation.
