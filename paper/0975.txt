             Unemployment With Observable Aggregate Shocks


                              ABS TRACT



     Consider an economy subject to two kinds of shocks: (a) an observable
shock to the relative demand for final goods which causes dispersion in
relative prices, and (b) shocks, unobservable by workers, to the technology
for transforming intermediate goods into final goods. A worker in a particular
intermediate goods industry knows that the unobserved price of his output is
determined by (1) the technological shock that determines which final goods
industry uses his output intensively and (2) the price of the final good that
uses his output intensively. When there is very little relative price
dispersion among final goods, then it doesn't matter which final goods industry
uses the worker's output. Thus the technological shock is of very little
importance in creating uncertainty about the worker's marginal product when
there is little dispersion of relative prices. !-Ience an increase in the
dispersion of relative prices amplifies the effect of technological uncertainty
on a worker's marginal value product.

     We consider a model of optimal labor contracts in a situation where the
workers have less information than the firm about their marginal value product.
A relative price shock of the type described above increases the uncertainty
which workers have about their marginal value product. We show that with an
optimal asymmetric information employment contract the industries which are
adversely affected by the relative price shock will contract more than they
would under complete information (i.e., where workers could observe their
marginal value product). On the other hand the industry which is favorably
affected by the relative price shock will not expand by more than would be
the case under complete information. Hence an observed relative demand
shock, which would leave aggregate employment unchanged under complete
information, will cause aggregate employment to fall under asymmetric
information about the technological shock.

1. Introduction

         Recent theories of the business cycle have emphasized the

misaflocations associated with unobserved aggregate shocks.- Agents

are assumed to have insufficient information to distinguish a change in

their relative position from a change in their absolute position. Here

we develop a model where an aggregate shock (e.g., one which impacts on the price

level, or aggregate unemployment) is observed by everyone. However the

aggregate shock is such that it causes an increase in the uncertainty that

workers have about their marginal value product. We show that this leads

oa fall in employment below what would occur if workers had complete

information.

         Azariadis (1982) and Grossman and Hart (1981) have analyzed the

optimal labor contract between a firm    and its workers in a context where
the firm has better information about the real profitability of employment

than the workers. If the owners or manager of the firm       are   risk—averse

optimal risk sharing implies that the firm should cut its wage bill when

it suffers from low   profitability.   When   the   firm's profitability, ,

is   unobservable to the workers, however, there is no way that the wage bill

can be directly tied to s. Instead, it is optimal for the firm and the
worker to agree ex—ante to use employment as a device to induce the firm to

cut wages only when s is low. In particular the firm and worker agree

on a labor contract W(L;n) which ties wages W to employment L, and
                                —2—

public information n. Let n1 denote a public shock which creates

uncertainty about a particular firm's marginal product of labor. Let

be the situation where the economy suffers no shock and workers have

complete information about their marginal product. In situation n2, the

optimal labor contract will involve setting the marginal wage W'(L;n2)

equal to labor's marginal disutility of effort, say R; while in situation 1

it is optimal to set the marginal wage W'(L,n1) > R   in order to benefit

from risk sharing. This can be shown to imply that total employment will

be lower in situation 1 than in the complete information Walrasian equilibrium.

Consequently shocks which move the economy from n2 to n1 but keep total

employment in the Wairasian equilibrium constant will lower total

employment when there is asymmetric information.

       Section 2 reviews the model of an optimal asymmetric information

contract when the economy has only one type of firm. It is shown that

results derived when an individual firm's employment is the only public

information can be extended to situations where any other information not

under the firm's control is made public, as long as that information does

not perfectly reveal the firm's marginal product of labor.

       Section 3 presents an introductory model of the above situation

where the economywide shock impacts on the physical productivity of labor.

Workers know only the cross sectional distribution of productivities across

firms which is induced by the shock. For example workers may know that an

oil price shock lowers labor productivity by 75% in half the firms and

raises it by 75% in the other half of firms. However a given worker does

not know which half his firm is in. We show that the relatively lucky
                                  —3—


firms   do not increase employment by more than they would if their workers

had perfect information, while the unlucky firms decrease their employment

by more than they would if the workers had perfect information. Thus

total employment falls by more than in a Walrasian equilibrium, as a

consequence of an increase in the cross sectional dispersion of productivities.

Our basic principle is that the only thing that workers can observe is the

cross sectional distribution of marginal products. They use this to make

an inference about their own marginal product, assuming that their own

value is a random drawing from that distribution. Hence an increase in the

dispersion of productivities across firms makes workers more uncertain

about their own productivity. We are trying to model the idea that workers

know how the total demand for labor varies with the observed shock, but not

how their own firm's demand for labor is affected by the shock.
         Section 4 is the heart of the paper. An economy is considered where

there are 3 final consumption goods of which 2 are produced out of

intermediate goods, and the third is not produced using current resources

(e.g. real balances or the real value of the capital stock). The 2 final

produced goods X and Y are made from two intermediate goods K1 an

K2. The economy is subjected to two types of shocks only one of which is

observable by workers. First, the distribution of endowed wealth changes,

which changes the demand for the final goods X and '.      This results in
an observable change in the prices of the final goods. Second, there are

shocks 0, to the technology of transforming intermediate goods into final

goods. These shocks are not observed by workers, and change the intensity
                                 —4—



with which a particular final goods industry uses each intermediate good.

Workers only produce intermediate goods, but do not observe intermediate

goods prices.

       When workers in a particular intermediate goods firm, say 1, observe

a shock to the relative prices of X and Y, say which raises P          and

lowers P, they do not know how that affects the value of their marginal

value product because they do not know whether X or Y is intensively

using the output K1 which they produce. Note however when relative prices

are not very dispersed, it does not matter as far as the workers' marginal

value product is concerned whether X or Y is using K1 intensively.

We are thus able to derive a model where an observed increase in the

dispersion of relative final goods prices causes an increase in the uncertainty

workers have about their own marginal value product. That is, when workers

observe the prices of the goods they consume but not the prices of the goods

they produce, then an increase in the dispersion of observed consumption goods

prices will increase the uncertainty workers have about the prices of the

goods they produce. This model where workers know more about general economy

conditions than about the conditions in their own industry is the reverse of

Lucas' (1972) assumption that workers know more about their own firm's price

than they know about the economy wide price level.

       Using the results of Sections 2 and 3, Section 4 shows that an increase

in the dispersion of relative prices which would leave the complete

information Wairasian equilibrium unchanged, causes a fall in employment under

the above asymmetric information situation. This is proved under the

assumption that ex ante ,   workers and firms write an optimal labor contract
                            —5—

which apnropriately conditions on everything which will be observable

to both parties. Therefore, the contractionary effect of aggregate shocks

occurs despite the fact that contracts are conditioned on these shocks.

This is in contrast to models such as Taylor (1980) or Blanchard (1979)

where observable shocks affect output because wage contracts could not

be conditioned on those shocks.

       Section 5 contains our interpretations, conclusions and some references

to evidence. In particular we suggest the importance of publicly observed

but unanticipated changes in the price level (or rate of inflation) in a

monetary economy. When a large percentage of individual wealth is held in

the form of nominally denominated assets or liabilities, then changes in

the price level will case a redistribution of wealth between nominal

borrowers and nominal lenders. This wealth redistribution can be the source

of shocks to the relative demands for goods if borrowers and lenders have

different tastes. Output can contract as a consequence of the relative

price dispersion created by the wealth redistribution. A wealth redistribution

which would have no effect on total employment when agents have symmetric

information, will cause employment to fall when they are asyinmetrially

informed.

                    2. The Optimal Employment Contract

          We begin by analyzing the optimal contract between a single firm

and its workers. It is convenient to begin without distinguishing physical

productivity shocks from relative demand shocks. Thus we let             be

the random variable which is the source of variability in the marginal

value product of labor, i.e., output q is given by



(2.1)                         q =   sf()

where       is total employment at the firm and f( )        is   a strictly

concave differentiable production function. It is useful to consider

q as "real    output".
          In order to analyze the effect of public information on the
optimal   employment contract, we make the following conventions: There is

an initial date 0 at which time the firm and worker have the same

information, and neither party knows s. At date 1 the firm observes

s and the workers do not. However the workers observe a signal n

which gives them some information about s. The firm also observes n

at date 1. The firm chooses Q at date 1 after it observes n and

s. The workers observe 2,      so that the total wage bill w can be

made a function of both n and 9. We assume tI-tat q is not observed

by the workers, so that n and             are the only pieces of information

on which wages can be conditioned.
                                      —7—



         We assume that labor is supplied perfectly elastically at a real

wage rate of R per unit at date 1, i.e., we assume that a worker's

utility of real income I and labor is given by U(I—Ri) where U is

concave. We let U0 be the expected utility as of time 0 that a worker

can get if he does not work at the particular firm which we are considering.

It is notationally convenient to assume that there is only one potential

worker for this firm. In Grossman and Hart [1981, p.304] we showed that

all real values are unaffected if there are many workers and the firm can

give layoff pay to those workers who are laid off.


         An optimal contract involves a wage rule w(i,n) and an

employment rule 2(s,n) which maximizes the firm's expected utility

subject to the worker's expected utility being at least as large as U0.

Note that since s is not directly observable to the worker, the

contract must make it optimal for the firm to actually choose P(s,n)

and w(i,n) when the true state is s. This will be true if for each




(2.2)              sf((s,) -   w((s,n), > sf()     -




         That   is, Q(s,n) is the employment rule induced by the wage contract
            For reasons explained in Grossman and Hart [l981i982] we assume
that   the owners of the firm are risk averse and have a utility of profit

V(q—w), where V is strictly concave. Thus an optimal contract is

w(i,n), i(s,a) which
                                     —8—




(2.3) maximizes E v(f(P(,ii)) —       w((,i),i)        subject to (2.2) and


(2.4)                 E U(w((,ii),Ii) —   R9L(,))   >TJ0.


Note that the expectation is with respect to the joint distribution of

   and       which is assumed to be known to both the firm and worker at

time 0. We are using a tilde over a variable to signify that it is a

random variable.

         It is convenient to define the complete information employment

rule. If s were observed by the worker then an optimal employment

contract would involve setting the marginal product of labor equal to the

marginal disutility of effort R, and choosing the wage bill so that risk

is optimally shared between the firm       and workers. We denote this complete
                          *
information    rule by 2 (s), given by


(2.5)                          fI(9,*) =    R



          In Grossman—Hart (1981) we showed that when the worker has no

information i       about the realization of , then the optimal contract will

involve an employment function Z(s) which is everywhere below £*(s). We

now show the results of that paper can be applied to the situation here

where workers can observe n at time 1.


Proposition 1.        If 2°(s,n), w°(2,,n) form an optimal contract,
                                    0           *
i.e.    (2.2) —   (2.4) hold, then i (s,n) < 9 Cs) for all s and n.
                                     —9—



Furthermore, if for given n either (a) the conditional distribution of s

is continuous with support [s,s], or (b) it is a two—point distribution and
                                                      0         *
the worker is sufficiently nearly risk neutral, then 2 (s,n) < P (s,n)
                                                                                 *
almost surely for these values of s less than s and for which                        (s,n) > 0.


Proof.     Let TJ(n)      E[U(w°(9..°(,n),n) —      R.Q°(,n))nJ

        For each n consider the problem of choosing an optimal wage, and

employment schedule w(2;n) £(s;n) which


(2.6)      maximizes        E[V(f(2(;n)) —      w(2(;n);n)    I
                                                                  ni
           subject to:


(2.7)                       E[TJ(w((;n);n) — R2(;n))          n} > U(n)

                                               Is                           #5

(2.8)      sf(Z(s;n)) —   w(2(s;n);n)      > sf() — w(Q;n)    for all s,2


         All expectations are taken with respect to the conditional

distribution of          given that i = n.      Note that w°(i,n) and 2°(s,n)

must be a solution to this problem. For if for some n there is a

contract w(2 ;i),91(s;n) which makes the objective in (2.6) larger, then

the objective in (2.3) could be made larger by changing to w(2;n), 2(s;n)

from w°(i,n), 210(s,n)       at n = n.      Since (2.7) holds,     (2.4) would hold
for the new contract.       Note that (2.2) is identical to        (2.8).
         Note that with     n fixed the problem in (2.6) — (2.8) is exactly

the one that was solved      in   Grossman—Hart [1981]. There we assumed that

both workers and firms had a given distribution on                 say G, and chose

a w(2), 2(s) contract to maximize            EV subject to EU > U and

sf(2)—w(2) > sf(2)—w(2)      for all s,,Q      The   solution to that problem depends on
the distribution of s,      nnely G.        We could have noted this explicitly by

writing w(2;G), IL(s;G) but         this would have been unnecessary since we

kept G fixed. The problem in (2.6)—(2.8) notes the dependence of the
                                         -10-



 contract on information explicitly. Since for each n this problem is

 equivalent to that solved in Grossman and Hart [1981], it follows that

 9.,°(s,n) ..9.,*(s,n). Proofs of the statements in (a) and (b) regarding strict

 inequality appear in the text below, and footnotes 2 and 3.           QED


          The idea behind the Proposition is as follows. We can imagine

that at time 1 the worker and firm observe the realization of i before

 the firm observes the realization of .         Given that ii = n, this induces a

conditional probability distribution on , say          F(sln). We then imagine

that the firm and worker reopen their contract and negotiate an employment

and wage rule which maximizes the firm's expected utility conditional on

the information n, and which gives the worker a value of conditional

expected utility 13(n) which was preassigned at time 0. This contract

is for each n exactly like the one in Grossman—Hart (1981).

          A simple example is one where i takes on two possible values n , and
                                                                              a           nb.
When n = n         then s = s     for sure, so there is no uncertainty. On the
               a              a
other hand when n =
                         b'     s has a continuous distribution function on [s,s].

Clearly the conditionally optimal contract at n          is the full information
                                               a
      *
one £ (s ) —
           a
                   since there is no uncertainty. On the other hand when n = a,
                                                                              D

we can appeal to Grossman—Hart [l98l,p.305] to state that if V" < 0
                     *
then P(s,nb) < 9 (s) for almost all         s c {s,s) and 2(s,nb) =                That
                                                                      £*(s,n,0).
is, as long as s is not the highest possible, the optimal contract will with

probability one involve an employment level strictly less than that of the full

information contract. Equivalently the marginal wage T(2.,n) > R, for
 <

      Another case of interest is where n also takes on two values, with

a indicating that s =          as before. However now suppose that n., indicates
                          Sa
that only m possible value values of s have positive probability, say

              .   An argument similar to that given in Grossman—Hart [19821
s1,s2,...,s
or Azariadis [19821 can be used to show that 2.(s.,n.b) < £(s.). Further,

it will generally be the case that i(s.,n.D) < 9L.(si), except for the

largest s.. For example if m =      2        and the worker is only slightly risk

averse, then the employment inequality will be strict for the lower value
     3/
of s.—

       In the sections which follow we will assume that P(s,n) < 2(s)

when s is less than the largest possible realization of , and when n

imparts incomplete information about .

         3. General Equilibrium With Physical Productivity Shocks



         In the last section we reviewed our model of the optimal

employment contract when workers receive incomplete information about

their productivity. In this section we give the simplest possible

general equilibrium model for an economy which is subject to shocks.

We assume that workers know that the economy has received a shock, but

that they don't know how the shock affects their own firm. In this

model, aggregate unemployment will rise because an economy wide shock

increases the perceived variability of a worker's marginal physical

productivity.

         We assume that firm i has a production function given by

(i.i)                      q. =   s.f(.)
To illustrate our basic idea imagine that there is a steady state where

firms earn no rents. In this steady state all firms would have the same

profitability from employing labor. Hence s1 =
                                                      s2
                                                           =   ...   .   Now imagine

that the economy is hit by a shock. This shock will hurt some firms more

than others. That is, it induces a non—degenerate distribution of

across firms .   We   assume that the owner of the firm knows how his s is

affected, but that the workers only know the cross sectional distribution.

Lacking any further knowledge the workers assume that their own firm's

productivity is a random drawing from that cross sectional distribution.

        In the notation of the previous Section let        ii be the signal

observed by firms and workers about the economy wide shock. Let
                                           —13—




F(sn)      be the cross sectional distribution of productivities associated

with the news       =   n.    It is convenient to have a notation for the news
                                                                              *
that no shock has occurred. We denote the news by n = n                           ,   and let all

firms have s =      s    in that "steady state" situation:


                                     * *
(3.2)                          Pr-(s n )     =1

Further,    to model the idea that shocks lead to a cross—sectional dispersion

in s, assume that if             is a discrete random variable, then



(3.3)                        Pr( =   s.I = n)        + 1   for        +     and all Si.


         As an example of the above notation, consider the case where

there are two types of firms. Consider three possible pairs of productivities

for the firms: (s1,s2) =         (1/2, 1/2) or (1/3, 2/3) or (2/3, 1/3). In
the first situation s1 = s2           so there is no cross sectional dispersion;
                                             *
this    corresponds to the news n— = n           .    In the second situation type 1 firms
are adversely affected relative to type 2 firms, while in the third
situation type 2 firms are adversely affected. We assume that the worker in each
firm knows the type of his firm but lacks the information to distinguish between

the second   and third situations. That is, workers receive a signal                          ii




such    that, for example each of the latter two situation are equally 1ikdy.
If   this is the only news received then
         Pr(s   =            1, Pr( =   l/3nb)
                                                      =    Pr(   =   2/3 lab) = 1/2
                                             —14—


Note that in both situation 2 and situation 3 workers observe the same

signal I =              It is not crucial to our analysis that the workers in
                 n.1.

 all firms know only that their firm's s.                              is a random draw from the
                                        1
 cross sectional distribution F(s(n). Only notational complexity would

be added to what follows if we subscripted F with an i, as long as the

     shocks which increase a given worker's uncertainty about his firm's -

productivity       also are associated with a greater cross sectional dispersion of '.

        It   is useful to define the Wairasian (or complete information)

level of employment which would be associated with a particular cross

sectional distribution of the s.. Under complete information, when
                                              1
workers have a utility of income I and labor                                   given by U(I—R2),

employment would be given by


                                                  *
(3.4)                                   sf'(2. )            R


This defines the employment level                   *(s). If the worker in firm I

observes s.,, then he will write a contract with the firm agreeing to supply
           1
 *
£ (s.) when the firm's s = s.. The firm will agree to pay a level of total
                                         1

wages w(s ) which shares risk by equating the firm's and worker's marginal
             i
rate of substitution across states (i.e., there is some number y such that
        *
V'(s.f(9 (s.)) —        w(s,))   =   '' U'(w(s. )     —    RQ(s.))
                                                               1

given cross sectional distribution of s, F(sln), total economy wide employment

L (n) is given by



                         *          *                          r   *

 bounds on realizations of .

 In general there will be many cross sectional distribution of ,                  F(sn)   which

 keep L (n) = L    .        There is no reason why increasing s in some industries
 and decreasing s in others, should lead the Wairasian level of total

 employment to fall. We will see that under asymmetric information this

is not the case :           shocks which cause dispersion, represented by n
                    *
different from n        ,   will   tend to lead to a decrease in total employment.

         As we noted in Section 2, if s.
                                       1
                                         cannot be observed by the

worker in firm 1, but his employment 2..1                and the signal n are observed,

then the wage bill can depend only on 2. and n:w°(Qn). Proposition 1

allowed us to appeal to an earlier result to show that for an optimal

employment contract when                 is not degenerate,


                                     *                    *
(3.7)              2.°(s,n) < 2.. (s) for n n                 and s < s.



We can define the economy's total employment under asymmetric information

given that i = n, by



                                                              S

(3.8)                        L°(n) =     E[°(s,n) In]    =f       °(s,n)dF(sIn)
                                   —16—




         An immediate implication of (3.7) is that L°(n) < L(ri) for
       *
n     n .   That is, when the economy suffers no s shock so that there is no
                                   0 *        *
dispersion of s         across firms L (n )       L(n    ),   but   when dispersion occurs

this creates asymmetric information and employment falls below the Wairasian

level.      (Of course, if the shock is permanent then there will be a flow

of resources from the adversely affected industries to the benefically

affected industries, so that in the long run the returns in the various

sectors     are equalized, i.e., sf(i)_R2i =
         It is interesting to note that a type of multiplier occurs for some

types of dispersion changes. In particular, suppose the sources of dispersion
                   *         *                                       0      *
are   such that L (n) = L        for all n. Then since L (n) < L (n), an aggregate

shock    always lowers employment relative to the value of employment with no
shock, i.e., L0(n) < L (n )
                           0*       *
                                 =L .     Further   if   we choose some measure of

dispersion    for the cross sectional distribution of marginal products which

is continuous, then employment will be a monotonically decreasing function

of dispersion near the point of no dispersion. That is, suppose that

has two components           and i2, so       =
                                                  (i1i2) and
                    =
                        l' 2         = L      for some value of n1 say n1 and

all values of n2. Thus n1 is news about the level of Walrasian

                                                    information about the variance
employment:. Suppose that n2 represents
                                                                                =
of the Walrasian employment, i.e., a(n2) =          Var(*(,n1,n2)i1                 n1, 2 =

is    monotone increasing in n2 and equal to zero at say n2
                                                                            =   n.    Then

our previous statements imply that L°(n1,n2)                  will be a monotone decreasing
                                  —17—


function of cY(n2) say L(a(n2)), with L(O) L, in a neighborhood of

cl(n2) =   0.

           It is important to note that the aggregate level of employment is

not a useful signal to the workers given that they already observe n.

The aggregate level of unemployment does not tell each worker how his

particular firm has been shocked, it only reveals something about the

dispersion of s across firms. Alternatively, workers who observe the

aggregate unemployment rate do not have complete information because knowledge

of how an aggregate variable is affected will not tell them how their own

firm is affected. Thus our model is fundamentally different from that of

Lucas [1972]. There it is assumed that people know their own situation

much better than economy wide values. We have assumed the reverse: shocks

are such that workers know more about the economy wide variable L(n), than

they know about their own firm's productivity. Thus Lucas' model would yield

no unemployment when the aggregate level of unemployment is observable hi1e

our model does yield unemployment in such cases.-

                         4.   Relative Demand Shocks


        In this Section we consider a model with many commodities where

 relative demand shocks cause uncertainty about labor's marginal product

 in a particular firm. An important shock hitting the economy are changes

 in the price level (i.e., the price of goods in terms of money). Observed

 changes in the price level which are not anticipated cause a redistribution

 of wealth between nominal borrowers and nominal lenders. To the extent that

 all borrowers and lenders do not have the same homothetic utility functions

 for goods, the wealth redistribution will cause a change in relative prices.

 To the extent that workers do not know how the observed change in the wealth

 distribution affects their own firm this will cause an increase in uncertainty

 about their marginal value product. We can apply an analysis similar to

 that given in the previous Section to show that aggregate employment will

decrease more under optimal asymmetric information contracts, than it would

 in a Walrasian model.

        There are a number of difficulties in developing the above model.

One problem with modeling the effect of unanticipated price changes on

relative demands is that we should make an explicitly dynamic model of the

economy and put in some use for money. We expect to do that in future work,

but here will show, for a non monetary static economy, how a redistribution

of wealth will lead to larger changes in employment than would occur in a

Wairasian model. We will simply analyze the effect of changes in the

distribution of endowment wealth across consumers, in a multigood economy'
                                —19—




under asymmetric information.

       Another problem is that it is difficult to model asymmetric information

about relative demand shocks in a competitive economy. If a firm operates in

a competitive product market then its demand is completely summarized by the

price of the product it sells relative to all other prices. If workers buy

the products sold by firms then they will observe the prices and cannot have

imperfect information about each firm's   demand.
       To get around the above problem we assume that some firms produce

intermediate goods at prices which consumers do not observe. Further a worker

does not know how a change in the demand for a final consumption good affects

the demand for the particular intermediate good produced by his firm. As in

the last Section it is useful to assume that the only thing a worker knows

about the price his firm receives is that the price is a random drawing from

the current cross—sectional distribution of intermediate good prices which

other firms are receiving. We make the further assumption that the cross—

sectional distribution of intermediate good prices is the same as that of

final consumer goods. We now show that it is possible to construct a te.ic.ogy

of intermediate and final goods with the above properties.

       Let there be two produced final (i.e. consumption) goods X and Y.

Let there be two intermediate goods 1(1 and K2. There are firms which use

labor and competitively produce good K1 ("type 1 firms"), and other firms

which competitively use labor to produce good K2 ("type 2 firms"). BorI

types of firms have the production function F(.)    of the previous Sectizi,
                                  — 20—




Each final good is competitively assembled without the use of labor

according to the following linear production technology



(4.1)                    X=(l—O)K1+0K2

(4.2)                    Y=0K1+(l—@)K2

where 0 is the realization of a random variable 0. We assume that



(4.3)     0 < 0 < 1   and 0 is symmetric about 1/2


When 0 > 1/2, industry Y finds            more productive than K2, while

industry X finds that the reverse is true. The opposite is the case

when 0 < 1/2.   We will show that when 0 >    1/2 industry Y
will utilize only 1 and industry X will utilize only              Thus

when 0 > 1/2    an increase in the final demand for X will be good for

type 2 firms. When 0 <   1/2,   an increase in final demand for X will be

good for type 1 firms. Thus changes in final demand have benefits for

workers which depend on the realization of 0.

        We assume that there is a third consumption good Z which is not

produced by current goods or current labor, but some consumers have an

endowment of it. We normalize the price of Z to be 1. For the rest

of this Section all prices are measured in terms of Z. Let v be

the price of intermediate good K. Let           and P be the prices
                                          —21—


of X and Y respectively.

         There are two cases to consider:


Case (1) 0 <   1/2.
         In this case equilibrium involves industry X specializing in

the utilization of K1 and Y specializing in K2. This is because

so — > —--                   imply that neither firm would demand the output
    v1
of type 2 intermediate goods. From what follows it will be clear that

some of K2 must be supplied, which is only possible (given no demand

for it) if v2 =       0.   Similarly if   _a <           the   same follows for
                                              vi

          In either Case, for each realization of 0, the cross—sectional

distribution of (v1,v2) is the same as that of (P ,P ).                                That is, if P = p
                                                                                xy                 x   y
then v1 = v2      ,   and if some P                is say 30% of P             then v1 will be 30%
                                              x                          y
of v2. Thus for each 0, if there is a shock to the relative demand for

X vs Y, and this causes a large relative price differential with say                            P >
then     v1 and v2 will be very different. A worker who could observe

the distribution of intermediate goods prices, would have very poor

information about his own firm's price when P                             is much larger than

while he would have perfect information about his firm's price when

Px =P
    y
         A worker who works in the K1 industry does not know v1 or v2.

He only knows P         and P . When P = P       P he knows that v = v = P0

if B >    1/2.     Thus in the case where 0 take on exactly two values , say

0 -+b        or 0 =        — b, it will be the case that P = P                         implies that

v1 = v2 = P(-- + b) irrespective of whether 0 <                           1/2 or 0 > 1/2.    When

unless that distribution is degenerate.-1 For simplicity of exposition

we   will deal only with the case where S                    takes on two      values.

           It    is now   possible to model the optimal labor contracts                  for the

workers in the intermediate good industries. From (3.9) a worker who

observes P   and P , thinks that his firm's v is a random drawing,
          x        y
from the cross sectional distribution of v's which we denote by v

satisfying

                                  (.5 + b)              with probability 1/2

Thus using the notation of the previous Section the news n is the

particular prices Px                 and P

           The form of the optimal labor contract will depend on firms'                 and
workers' preferences. We make the following assumptions:


Workers and Firms in the Intermediate Goods Industries.

           All workers are assumed to be identical and to have ordinal
                                                            A1 A2 A3
preferences represented by the utility function X Y Z — RL                      ,   where

R is the marginal disutility of effort and             >   0       for all i, and

A1 + A 2   + A = 1.       Firms' owners are assumed to have the same tastes for
              3
                                                                                    x
                                                                                         A2A3
                                                                                          Z
consumption goods as workers and they have the utility functions X

The total worker and firm demand for X and Y is given by




                                A                              A

Define          A11 A22 A33. Thus the indirect utility functions of workers and

firms are respectively

The income of workers plus firms automatically nets out wage payments, so it

is given by the total income from production of intermediate goods plus their

endowments of the non produced good e1:



                          + 'F =                        + PY + e1

                                      — 25—


Let elF. e          be the part of   e1 owned by firms and workers respectively.
           1w
Note that the production of final goods from intermediate goods generates

no ex pt profit in any state of nature, by the linear technology assumption.

     We model the economy as if there are 2 dates 0 and 1. At

date 0 the workers and firms meet to sign a contract.          They know neither
o   nor what P       and P     will be realized, but they know the distribution
                x          y
of these variables. Furthermore we assume that the distribution of
                                                                               xy
                                                                            (P ,P )

is symmetric; this, coupled with our assumption that the distribution of

O is symmetric around 1/2 ,       implies   that workers are indifferent about

signing contracts with K1 firms vs K2 firms. Let n denote (P ,P ).
                                                                          xy
Then workers and firms write a contract which makes the wage bill paid at

date 1 a function w(i,n). At date 1 the firm observes 0 and its own

price v and n, while the worker observes only 2 and             n
                                                                      xy
                                                                    (P ,P ).

Finally, in the initial period the attitudes to risk of firms and workers are

represented by Von Neuman—Morgenstern utility functions defined over fimal
                                                   x
period consumption, given by V(X2Z3) and U(X                — RL) respectively.

We assume that U is concave and that V is strictly concave. To simplify

matters, we assume that there are equal numbers of workers and firms.

Thus in equilbrium each firm makes a contract with exactly one worker at

date 0.



Other Consumers

       There are other consumers who do not work or own intermediate goods'

firms. These consumers' only source of wealth is their endowment of the

non produced good e2. These consumers have Cobb Douglas utility functions
                                     —26—




but   with a different parameter from firms or workers. Their parameters

are y1,y2,3. Their demands are



                   d                              d
                        =

The only role of the "other consumers" is to generate changes in relative

prices due to changes in the wealth distribution. We could have considered

a wealth redistribution between firms           and   workers, but it is more difficult

to characterize the optimal labor contract when workers and firms                      have

different tastes for consumer goods.



Equilibrium

         Let e E (e1,e2). In equilibrium consumption prices n E (P,P) will

be a function of e. In turn, intermediate goods prices are functions of

n and 0 given in (4.9). Thus, given the distribution of n                             and 0, the

optimal labor contract w(9,n) ,2i(v.,n) for firms                         in   industry i

         Note that, for a given realization of the public information

n                and the private information 0, there will be lucky firms and

unlucky firms. For example, if P >           P   and 0 > 1/2, then from (4.9)

firms in intermediate goods industry 1 will receive a higher price for their

output (v1 = (1/2 +         b)P)    than firms in industry 2 (v2 =   (1/2 +
                                                                              b)P)—--
that is, labour is more profitable in industry I than in industry 2, while

if 0 < 1/2        the opposite is true. The firms know whether they are lucky

or not, i.e. whether 0 >           1/2 or 0 < 1/2,   but the workers know only,

given n, that their firm's v is drawn from the distribution specified

in (4.10). The conditional distribution of              given n is analogous to

the conditional distribution F(sln) in Section 3. One difference is that

in this section workers and firms are interested in real income
                                                                         ,    l,

           Note that at date 0, when contracts are signed, type 1 and 2 firms

face   the same probability distribution of profit. Thus the form of the optimal

contract will be the same for the two                    types    of firms. From now on, we will

therefore drop the subscript i and refer to the optimal contract as a pair

Since L1(v,n) =                               this simplifies to

Since 0 =

           Conditions (4.l5)—(4.17), (4.19) and (4.21) characterize a contract

equilibrium under asyimnetric information. The way to think of this equilibrium

is as follows. There is an exogenously given probability distribution of the
                                        -30—


endowment vector         =              In equilibrium there will be a price function
                             (e1,e2).
P() =                    which says what prices correspond to a particular realization

of e. This in turn determines intermediate price functions v1(e,O),v2(e,O)

according to (4.9). Corresponding to this, there are optimal labor contracts

in the two industries which are solutions to (4.15)—(4.17). These contracts

in turn generate supplies of output, given in (4.2la) and (4.21b), for each

realization of ia        (P,P). Finally, for the system to be in equilibrium,
                                                                              .J'
these supplies must clear markets, i.e. satisfy (4.19), for each n.±j
           It is useful to acamine the Wairasian (or complete information

equilibrium) as a function of E E (EE). In a Walrasian Equilibrium wages

in each industry are equalized to the marginal product of labor. This

implies that the Walrasian equilibrium P,P,,                satisfy

where (4.24) and (4.25) are equivalent to the condition that supply equals

demand in the two final goods industries (see the derivation of (4.19)).


      We now use Proposition 1 to show that there is less employment in

the   asymmetric information equilibrium than in the Walrasian Equilibrium
when there is dispersion in goods prices. We have seen that, for a given
realization of n = (P,P), there will be a lucky intermediate               goods

industry and an unlucky intermediate goods industry (if              >

                                                                               industr3r 1

                                                    conversely for industry 2).

Hence appealing to the result in Section 2, we see that a firm that is in

the lucky industry will equate the marginal product of labor to the marginal

disutility of effort, while a firm that is in the unlucky industry will set the

marginal product of labor above the marginal disutility of effort. That is,

in an asymmetric information equilibrium, when say P > P, employment

will satisfy

asymmetric information equilibrium denoted by                        the supply of

final   goods equals their demand, i.e. (4.24) and (4.25) hold:

      Thus    the only difference between the asymmetric information equilibrium
and the complete information equilibrium is the presence of a in (4.27).
     We now show that if the distribution of wealth is such as to lead to prices
which create uncertainty on the part of the workers about their marginal
product      then total employment is reduced below what it would be under complete

information. Further the prices of both produced goods relative to the

non   produced good are higher than under complete information.' Further the
output    of both industries will contract relative to the Wairasian level.


 Proposition 2:               If E         and E     generate a Wairasian equilibrium with prices

 say P >        P         and employments                          then the asymmetric information

 equilibrium P,P,2,,9. will have the property that P > p

Proof:        Comparing (4.28), (4.29) with (4.24) and (4.25) shows that it

is necessary and sufficient to prove that P > P                                       and P >   P               Suppose

case(a) P<P. Using the Supply =                                    Demand condition (4.28) and (4.24),

yields 9.>2. Thus, the marginal productivity conditions (4.22) and

 (4.26), imply that

But since      -     this   implies that P <          P.         Supply   Demand implies

that output of Y must be higher, so Z >               . But the marginal
conditions (4.23) and (4.27) then imply that

Now raise (4.30) to the power X1, (4.31) to the power                         and multiply.
This yields P > P, which is inconsistent with P < P
                                                                 x— x Py—< Py

Case (b) P . P. Supply         Demand implies that Q                      .    Then (4.27)
and (4.23) imply that P ÷ P > P ÷ P. This must imply that P <

The contradiction now proceeds exactly as in case (a).
                                                                                QED

         As in Section 3 we can show that the above Proposition implies

that increases in the dispersion of final good prices, which in the

Wairasian equilibrium would not affect total employment, will decrease

total employment under asymmetric information (note that if there is no

dispersion, i.e. P =    P   then   2..
                                          =
                                              ' 2..   =    2..    and so employment under

asymmetric information equals employment under complete information which

equals Wairasian employment). In particular, the
                                   —34—




Wairasian    equilibrium in (4.22)—(4.25) may be solved for prices and

employment as a function of the distribution of endowments e
                                                                                 (e1,e2)

using (4.20). Denote the solution by P(e1,e2), P(e1,e2),

                                          Note that the distribution of
2..(e1,e2) 1,e2) +
endowment   matters only     if tastes are different among consumers, so we

of course assume that                and A2          in such a way that           E
                                                                                      x
and Ey depend on e1          and e2. That is, assume that (EX,EY)                is    an

invertible     function of    (e1, e2). In this case there will be a         locus
of values for xE and E                            12
                                 such that £(e ,e ) =     9..,   where £         is a
constant. There will also be a locus of values where P(e1,e2) =                       P(e1,e2)
Clearly        can be chosen so the two loci intersect. These two loci

will not be the same. That is, changes in the wealth distribution can

be chosen which cause changes in relative demands such that (a) prices

change, (b) some industries contract while others expand and (c) the

Walrasjan total level of employment is the same. From Proposition 2 we

know that such changes will cause the level of total employment under

asymmetric information to fall.

          An example of the above situation occurs when             =        =   A,         = 0,
                                                                        A2
   = A.    this case shifts in wealth from the y consumers to the A
          In

consumers will raise the Wairasian level of P
                                             x and lower the Wairasian
level of py       If we start out with a distribution of wealth such that
e2 =   0, then P(e1,O) =      P(e1,0).    A redistribution of wealth would lower

the asymmetric information level of employment if it kept the Wairasian

level the same because it would create greater uncertainty among workers about
                                  —35—

 their own firm's marginal value productivity of labor.'

        We see that changes in the distribution of wealth will cause

 relative price movements, which create uncertainty on the part of labor

 about its marginal value product. We have taken the convention that

 unequal final goods prices are associated with uncertainty about the

marginal value product of labor within each industry To see that this

is just a convention, consider a world of perfect certainty. Free entry

would lead resources to be allocated across industries in such a way

that prices are determined by minimum average costs. Since firms have

identical productions functions, minimum average cost would be the same.

If we instead began with industries that had different cost functions,

then the steady state — no shock situation would      to final good prices

which are unequal. However the profitability of labor would be equalized

across industries. A shock which changed relative demands would, in

the short run, create unequal profitability of hiring labor across

industries. We assume that workers only know the distribution of

profitabilities across industries and they think their firm's labor

profitability is a random drawing from that distribution. Hence a

shock which changes demand from its steady state value would cause

uncertainty about labor productivity within each industry, which would

cause a drop in employment relative to the Walrasian level.

a decrease in total employment 2(e1,e2) when there is

                         5. Evidence and Conclusions

  5a. Relative Price Variability As A Cause of Aggregate Output Variability


       We have outlined a model of an economy subject to two kinds of

shocks: (a) an observable shock to the relative demand for final goods

which causes dispersion in relative prices, and (b) shocks, unobservable

by workers ,   to   the technology for transforming intermediate goods into

final goods. Workers in the intermediate goods industry cannot observe

the prices of the products they produce, but they can observe the cross

sectional distribution of prices. That is, they know whether conditions

are generally good or bad or dispersed, but not how their own particular

industry is affected. A worker in a particular intermediate goods industry

knows that the price of his output is determined by (1) a technological

shock that determines which final goods industry uses his output intensively

and (2) the price of the final good that uses his output intensively. When

there is very little relative price dispersion among final goods, then it

doesn't matter which final goods industry uses the worker's output. Thus

the technological shock is of very little importance in creating uncertainty

about the worker's marginal product when there is little dispersion of relative

prices. Hence an increase in the dispersion of relative prices amplifies

the effect of technological uncertainty on a worker's marginal value product.

     We considered a model of optimal labor contracts in a situation whete

the workers have less information than the firm about their marginal value

product. A relative price shock of the type described above increases the
                                 —38—




uncertainty   which workers have about their marginal value product. We

show that with an optimal asymmetric information employment contract the

industries which are adversely affected by the relative price shock will

contract more than they would under complete information (i.e., where

workers   could observe their marginal value product). On the other hand
the industry which is favorably affected by the relative price shock will
not   expand by more than would be the case under complete information.

Hence a relative demand shock, which would leave aggregate employment

unchanged under complete information, will cause aggregate employment to

fall under asymmetric information.
          Before discussing potential sources for the relative price shocks,

it is worthwhile to present some evidence that is consistent with relative

price shocks having a causal role in the determination of aggregate output.

Since our Propositions only compare the full information effect of relative

demand shocks to the asymmetric information effect we have no direct

conclusion as to whether an increase in relative price variability raises

or lowers employment. However, if we assume that the shocks to relative

demands have no effect under complete information, then our Proposition

implies that aggregate employment will fall when relative demand

variability rises.    (To be more precise we showed that positive

variability induces lower employment than no variability, but by continuity

it follows that employment will fall when variability rises over a range

near zero variability.)

        Fischer [1982] contains a survey of the literature on relative
                               —39—


price variability. He also studies the time series behavior of aggregate

output, relative price variability and other macroeconomic variables. In

a vector auto regression with relative price variability "put first,"

this variable can explain as much of the variability of output as interest

rate, money or inflation innovations (see his Table 8), i.e. about 10%

of the total variability of output. When relative price variability is

"put after" interest rates, money and inflation, it does as well as

inflation and money but worse than interest rates.

       The relatively high explanatory power of relative price variability

for output is of course consistent with models other than ours. For

example all of Fischer's results are consistent with a Walrasian model

where at time t, people get information that future output will fall and

that the different components of output will fall in differing proportions.

With a conventional money demand model this will imply that prices will

rise in the future in differing proportions, and this in turn will raise

prices today in differing proportions. Thus the future decrease in output

will lead to an increase in expected inflation, and variability of inflation

and high nominal interest rates, which is exactly what Fischer finds.

Fischer also suggests three other models which are consistent with his

observations.



(b) The Causes of Relative Price Variability

       The model presented in Section 4 assumes that a change in the

distribution of wealth is the source of a change in relative prices. There

are clearly many sources of relative price variability other than changes

in the distribution of wealth, e.g. variability in technology, tastes and
                                —40-


the prices of imports and exports. We have focused on wealth redistributions

as the source of relative price changes in order to provide the possibility

of a comparison with existing macroeconomic models. In particular assume

that the wealth redistribution occurs between nominal borrowers and lenders

when there is an unanticipated movement in the price level. Though we did

not present an intertemporal model with money and nominal prices, it would

not be difficult to append an additively separable utility of real balances

to preferences. Further we could model borrowing and lending associated

either with life cycle effects or random shocks to income)' In such a

model with nominal borrowing and lending unanticipated inflation will have

important effects on the distribution of wealth.

       Approximately 50% of "wealth" is held in the form of nominally

denominated debt.-' Imagine that the economy is composed of two types of

individuals one of which is a nominal borrower and the other is a nominal

lender. Then a 10% permanent drop in the price level will increase the

real wealth of the lender by 50% of 10% = 5%.      The reverse will happen

to the nominal borrower. To the extent that the permanent drop of 10%

in the price level is associated with expected deflation, then there will

be a second effect in the wealth distribution in the same direction. Namely

the real price of long term nominal debt will rise due to the fall in the

nominal interest rate. People over 55 (the "old") tend to be nominal creditors

while people under 55 (the "young") tend to be nominal debtors. Fischer and

Nodigliani (1978) estimate (to within an order of magnitude) that a 1%
                                   —41—


unanticipated increase in the price level will transfer wealth with a flow

value of about 1% of GNP.

         Wealth redistributions will have no effect on relative prices if

wealth is redistributed between groups that have the same homothetic preferences.

However there is some evidence that there are systematic differences among

individuals in their preferences by age. Michael (1979), p.41 used the Bureau

of Labor Statistics' consumer expenditure survey to find that there are systematic

and significant differences among individuals' consumption proportions by age.

The classification of borrowers and lenders by age may not be the most useful for

tracing the consequences of the wealth redistribution. We mention it here

only because it is the only classification for which there is evidence that

the individuals are jointly sorted by desired consumption proportions and debt

positions.

         There are some other obvious sources of wealth redistributions which

may be of sufficient magnitude to have caused observed output fluctuations.

For example unanticipated changes in nominal interest rates due either to

real or nominal factors will redistribute wealth between long term borrowers

and lenders, and this could be a source of relative price variability.

Alternatively, a large decrease in the real value of assets such as houses and

stocks can cause a large redistribution of wealth between the young and the

old. Exogenous changes in the productivity of capital could be the cause of

a change in the real value of assets.




(c)   Relative Demand Shifts vs Aggregate Demand Shifts

         The previous discussion may obscure some of the difference between
                                    —42—




our model and aggregate demand models of the cycle. To the extent that we

think that changes in aggregate demand can cause a wealth redistribution

which can cause employment fluctuations, there is some similarity between

our model and aggregate demand models. One important difference however

is that there is no presumption in our model that the sign of the aggregate

demand shock matters. A large unanticipated inflation can cause the same

increase in relative price dispersion as a large unanticipated deflation.-'

Hence there is no presumption that unanticipated inflation is expansionary

while unanticipated deflation is contractionary. To a first approximation

(i.e., where the Wairasian equilibrium total output is independent of the

wealth distribution), it would be the absolute value of the unanticiDated once

level change which would be negatively correlated with output in our model.

Further, if relative price variability is an independent variable explaining

output then unanticipated inflation should have little incremental explanatory

power.

         Fischer (1982) and Blejer and Leiderman (1980) use innovations in

inflation and relative price variability as explanatory variables for output.

Their results are suggestive for each variable having some independent

explanatory power for output in the Post World War II United States.'

         Fischer (1982) Figure 3, and Sims (1980) Table 3, both find that in

the Post World War II period positive price innovations precede a fall in

output. Our conclusion from this is that in the Post World War II period,

though the data are suggestive of an independent effect of price innovations,

the sign is the reverse of what would have been predicted by the models of

Sargent or Lucas, or Barro, (see Barro (1981) for a survey of models where

unanticipated inflation causes an increase in output).
                                  —43—




       The period before World War II is likely to be favorable to the

unanticipated inflation model. Sims (1980), Table 3, finds that negative

price innovations precede falls in output in the period between World War I

and World War II.) Unfortunately, we have not been able to find any evidence

which has attempted to distingusih the relative price variability hypothesis

from the unanticipated inflation hypothesis in that period. In the pre World

War II period, large unanticipated deflation may well be a proxy for high

variability of relative prices. This is consistent with Parks' (1978)

finding in his Tables 2 and 6.

       Thus it seems that further empirical research needs to be undertaken

to distinguish the hypothesis that unanticipated falls in money (or prices)

decrease output, from the hypothesis that monetary or price level shocks of

any sign decrease output. In addition further theoretical research needs to

be undertaken to develop models where the sign of the publically observed

shock, as well as its size, affects output.

1/ It is sometimes convenient to state that a feasible wage contract is

     a function w(s, r such that it is optimal for the firm to truthfully

     reveal s, i.e., for all s,,n
                        ,\     ,'
                       sf(2(s,n))    —   w(S,ri)    > sf(2(s,n)) — w(s,n)

     This inequality is equivalent to (2) because it can be easily verified

     from the inequality that w(s1,n =                   w(s2.n) when 9(s1n) =
     i.e.,   w(s,n) depends on s only through .

2/ The basic idea behind our result is that when s is not observed by
     the worker, 2*(s) can be induced by the wage contract only if

                 = R   .     But this implies that w(Z,n.) = w(O,nD) ÷ £R.            That

     is, the workers net income w —                2,R   is   constant for all s. The

     firm    bears   all the risk. As far as risk sharing goes, the firm and

     the worker would like to raise the firm's income in low s states

     in return       for lowering it in high s                states. When s is not

     observed this can be achieved by raising (2,nb) above R. This
                                      —45—



   implies, for some s < s, that 2(s,n.D) < 2?C(s). At s = s                          there must

  be efficient employment since it can be shown that 2(s,nb) is increasing

   in s, and if 9(s,nb) <                     then (*(s),nb) can be set equal to

   R, with no loss of incentive compatibility and higher utility for the firm

  without lower utility for the worker.

       The above result was proved by us for the situation where there was a

   discrete number of possible values for i. The continuous £ cases can

   be achieved by taking a limit of our previous result. Taking the limit

   does not lead to equality between 2(s,nb) and i*(s), for the reason

   given above: The worker bears no risk, and the efficiency loss from

   lowering 9(s,n,0) just below 9*(s) will always be smaller than the

   benefits from increased risk sharing (since at a productive optimum small

   changes in 2 have only a second order effect on sf(2.)—R).

3/ This can be seen as follows. When n =                        and      m   2, we are in the

   situation studied by Azariadis (1982), Let s1 < s2,                          E


         E (s2%) and w1 E w(21%) and w2                          w(P2,nb). Azariadis shows

   that in an optimal contract the inequality in (2.8) will be binding at

   s     s2 when the worker is (almost) risk neutral, i.e.,
                                 —
   s2f(22) — w2 =     s2f(i1)        w1.

1/   The inequality in eq. (3.7) depends on the assumption that the firm's

     manager is risk averse. If managers hold well diversified portfolio's,

     then a shock which increases the cross sectional dispersion of profitability

     will have no impact on the manager's wealth. Hence he will be risk neutral

     with respect to such shocks. However suppose that the manager is an agent

     for the owners of the firm. Then the owners will tie the manager's

     remuneration to the performance of his own company. An optimal incentive

     scheme between the owner and the manager will not permit the manager to

     diversify away the risk associated with his firm's performance since this

     will dilute the manager's incentive to maximize profit. See Hart (1982) for

     an implicit contract model between a firm and its workers in the presence

     of a moral hazard problem between managers and owners.


 2/ In more general versions of Lucas' model the aggregate unemployment rate

     may not be a suffficient statistic for the economy wide shock. However it

     is essential to his model that the economy wide shock itself (eg the

     money supply) is not directly observable.

1/ If there are no futures markets, and labor at time t is used to

     produce goods at time t+l, then it might appear that workers and

     firms could have different information about the value of employing

     labor at t. However, if the workers wage at date t+l can be made

     conditional on the date t+l spot prices that the firm learns at

     t, then it can be shown that employment under an optimal

     contract will be at the same level as if both the worker and firm

     observed the date t+l spot price at date t.

2/   W0 want to model the idea that workers know general labor market

     conditions better than conditions in their own firm. Thus workers

     observe the cross sectional mean and variance of employment from newspaper

     reports on the economy wide and regional unemployment rates. They do

     not know the state of demand for their own firm's product. Further if

     there are many firms in a given industry, then the employment level of

     other identical firms will provide a useful signal to workers in a given

     firm. We assume that no such signal is available. To the extent that

     firms in the same industry are not completely identical but are subject

     to idiosyncratic shocks to demand, then the employment level of other

     firms in the same industry may be a poor signal about a given firm's

     demand.

3/ It is not difficult to show that, under our assumptions, the optimal

    contract is unique.

4/ We must also add the condition that U(O) < 13   < U       ,   where   U       is that

    level of utility at which firms are indifferent between signing a contract

   with a worker and not operating at all. It is clear that from this that

    there will in general be different equilibria according to where U lies

    in this range. This indeterminacy results from our assumption that there

    is an inelastic, integral supply of workers at date 0 and would disappear

    if we had a smooth upward sloping supply curve of date 0 workers. It

   should also be pointed out that, while in the model of this paper

   equilibrium prices and employment will in general depend on the value of

   U, this is not the case if 13    and V exhibit constant absolute risk

   aversion. In this case the employment function Z(v,n) which solves

    (4.15)—(4.17) is independent of U (see Grossman and Hart [1982]).

5/ It can be shown that, under the usual assumptions, contract equilibrium

   under asymmetric information exists.


6/ Note that if a monetary contraction causes the change in the distribution

   of wealth, then prices of goods relative to the non produced good (money)

   will fall rather than rise. An implication of our result is that the

   decrease in supply which is associated with the increased uncertainty

   will cause prices in terms of money to fall by less than they would

   under complete information.
