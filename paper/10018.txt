Country Spreads and Emerging Countries: Who Drives Whom?

                                           ABSTRACT

A number of studies have stressed the role of movements in US interest rates and country spreads
in driving business cycles in emerging market economies. At the same time, country spreads have
been found to respond to changes in both the US interest rate and domestic conditions in emerging
markets. These intricate interrelationships leave open a number of fundamental questions: Do
country spreads drive business cycles in emerging countries or vice versa, or both? Do US interest
rates affect emerging countries directly or primarily through their effect on country spreads? This
paper addresses these and other related questions using a methodology that combines empirical and
theoretical elements. The main findings of the paper are: (1) US interest rate shocks explain about
20 percent of movements in aggregate activity in emerging market economies at business-cycle
frequency. (2) Country spread shocks explain about 12 percent of business-cycle movements in
emerging economies. (3) About 60 percent of movements in country spreads are explained by
country-spread shocks. (4) In response to an increase in US interest rates, country spreads first fall
and then display a large, delayed overshooting; (5) US-interest-rate shocks affect domestic variables
mostly through their effects on country spreads. (6) The fact that country spreads respond to
business conditions in emerging economies significantly exacerbates aggregate volatility in these
countries. (7) The US-interest-rate shocks and country-spread shocks identified in this paper are

plausible in the sense that they imply similar business cycles in the context of an empirical VAR

model as they do in the context of a theoretical dynamic general equilibrium model of an emerging

market economy.

1     Introduction

Business cycles in emerging market economies are correlated with the cost of borrowing that
these countries face in international financial markets. This observation is illustrated in

economies between 1994 and 2001. Periods of low interest rates are typically associated with
economic expansions and times of high interest rates are often characterized by depressed

levels of aggregate activity.1

tigate the role of movements in this variable in explaining business cycles in developing
countries. In addressing this issue, an immediate natural question that emerges has to do
with causality. Do country interest rates drive business cycles in emerging countries, or vice
versa, or both? Different authors have approached this question in different ways.

   One strand of the literature focuses primarily on stressing the effects of movements in
domestic variables on country spreads. Specifically, a large empirical body of research has
documented that country spreads respond systematically and countercyclically to business
conditions in emerging economies. For instance, Cline (1995) and Cline and Barnes (1997)
find that domestic variables such as GDP growth and export growth are significant determi-

nants of country spreads in developing countries. Other studies have documented that higher
credit ratings translate into lower country spreads (Cantor and Packer, 1996; Eichengreen
and Mody, 1998). In turn, credit ratings have been found to respond strongly to domestic
macroeconomic conditions. For example, Cantor and Packer (1996) estimate that about

80 percent of variations in credit ratings are explained by variations in per capita income,
external debt burden, inflationary experience, default history, and the level of economic de-
velopment. Cantor and Packer conclude, based on their own work and the related literature
extant, that there exists significant information content of macroeconomic indicators in the

pricing of sovereign risk. In this body of work little is said about the need to control for
the fact that movements in domestic fundamentals may be caused in part by variations in
country interest rates.
   On the other extreme of the spectrum, a number of authors have assumed that country
spreads are exogenous to domestic conditions in emerging countries. For instance, Neumeyer

and Perri (2001) assume that the country spread and the US interest rate follow a bivariate,
first-order, autoregressive process. They estimate such process and use it as a driving force of
a theoretical model calibrated to Argentine data. In this way, Neumeyer and Perri assess the
contribution of interest rates to explaining aggregate volatility in developing countries. They

find that interest rate shocks explain 50 percent of output fluctuations in Argentina, and


                                               2
conclude, more generally, that they are an important factor for explaining business cycles in
emerging countries.
   If in reality country interest rates responded countercyclically to domestic conditions
in emerging economies, then the findings of Neumeyer and Perri (2001) would be better

interpreted as an upper bound on the contribution of country interest rates to business
cycle fluctuations in emerging countries. For they rely on the presumption that movements
in country interest rates are completely exogenous to domestic economic conditions. To
illustrate how this exogeneity assumption can lead to an overestimation of the importance
of country spreads in generating business cycle fluctuations, suppose that the (emerging)

economy is hit by a positive productivity shock. In response to this innovation, output,
investment, and consumption will tend to expand. Assume in addition that the country
spread is a decreasing function of the level of economic activity. Then the productivity
shock would also be associated with a decline in the spread. If in this economy one wrongly

assumes that the spread is completely independent of domestic conditions, the change in
the interest rate would be interpreted as an exogenous innovation, and therefore part of the
accompanying expansion would be erroneously attributed to a spread shock, when in reality
it was entirely caused by a domestic improvement in productivity.

   Another important issue in understanding the macroeconomic effects of movements in
country interest rates in emerging economies, is the role of world interest rates. Understand-
ing the contribution of world interest rate shocks to aggregate fluctuations in developing
countries is complicated by the fact that country interest rates do not respond one to one
to movements in the world interest rate. In other words, emerging-country spreads respond

to changes in the world interest rate. This fact has been documented in a number of stud-
ies (some of which are referenced above). Thus, country spreads serve as a transmission
mechanism of world interest rates, capable of amplifying or dampening the effect of world-
interest-rate shocks on the domestic economy. Both because spreads depend on the world

interest rate itself and because they respond to domestic fundamentals.


                                              3
   In this paper, we attempt to disentangle the intricate interrelations between country
spreads, the world interest rate, and business cycles in emerging countries. We do so using
a methodology that combines empirical and theoretical analysis.
   We begin by estimating a VAR system that includes measures of the world interest rate,

the country interest rate, and a number of domestic macroeconomic variables. In estimating
the model we use a panel dataset with seven emerging countries covering the period 1994-
2001 at a quarterly frequency. Over the period considered, both country spreads and capital
flows display significant movements in the countries included in our sample. We use the
estimated empirical model to extract information about three aspects of the data: First, we

identify country-spread shocks and US-interest-rate shocks. The essence of our identification
scheme is to assume that innovations in international financial markets take one quarter to
affect real domestic variables, whereas innovations in domestic product markets are picked up
by financial markets contemporaneously. Second, we uncover the business cycles implied by

the identified shocks by producing estimated impulse response functions. Third, we measure
the importance of the two identified shocks in explaining movements in aggregate variables
by performing a variance decomposition of the variables included in the empirical model.
   To assess the plausibility of the spread shocks and US-interest-rate shocks that we identify

with the empirical model, we are guided by theory. Specifically, we develop a simple model of
a small open economy with four special features: gestation lags in the production of capital,
external habit formation (or catching up with the Joneses), a working-capital constraint
that requires firms to hold non-interest-bearing liquid assets in an amount proportional to
their wage bill, and an information structure according to which, in each period, output

and absorption decisions are made before that period’s international financial conditions
are revealed. The latter feature is consistent with the central assumption supporting the
identification of our empirical model. We assign numerical values to the parameters of
the model so as to fit a number of empirical regularities in developing countries. We then

show that the model implies impulse response functions to country-spread shocks and to US-


                                              4
interest-rate shocks that are broadly consistent with those implied by the empirical model. It
is in this precise sense that we conclude that the shocks identified in this study are plausible.
   The main findings of the paper are: (1) US interest rate shocks explain about 20 per-
cent of movements in aggregate activity in emerging countries at business-cycle frequency.

(2) Country spread shocks explain about 12 percent of business-cycle movements in emerg-
ing economies. (3) About 60 percent of movements in country spreads are explained by
country-spread shocks. (4) In response to an increase in US interest rates, country spreads
first fall and then display a large, delayed overshooting. (5) US-interest-rate shocks affect
domestic variables mostly through their effects on country spreads. Specifically, we find that

when the country spread is assumed not to respond directly to variations in US interest
rates, the standard deviation of output, investment, and the trade balance-to-output ratio
explained by US-interest-rate shocks is about two thirds smaller. (6) The fact that country
spreads respond to business conditions in emerging economies significantly exacerbates ag-

gregate volatility in these countries. In particular, when the country spread is assumed to
be independent of domestic conditions, the equilibrium volatility of output, investment, and
the trade balance-to-output ratio explained jointly by US-interest-rate shocks and country-
spread shocks falls by about one fourth.

   The remainder of the paper is organized in four sections. In section 2, we present and
estimate the empirical model, identify spread shocks and US-interest-rate shocks, and analyze
the business cycles implied by these two sources of aggregate uncertainty. In section 3,
we develop and parameterize the theoretical model and compare theoretical and empirical
impulse response functions. In section 4, we investigate the business-cycle consequences

of the fact that spreads respond to movements in both the US interest rate and domestic
fundamentals. Section 5 closes the paper.

2     Empirical Analysis

The goal of the empirical analysis presented here is to identify shocks to country spreads and
the world interest rate and to assess their impact on aggregate activity in emerging economies.
Our dataset consists of quarterly data over the period 1994:1 to 2001:4, for seven developing
countries, Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Philippine, and South Africa. Our
choice of countries and sample period is guided by data availability. The countries we consider

belong to the set of countries included in J. P. Morgan’s EMBI+ dataset for emerging-
country spreads. In the EMBI+ database, time series for country spreads begin in 1994:1
or later. Of the 14 countries that were originally included in the EMBI+ database, we
eliminated from our sample Morocco, Nigeria, Panama, and Venezuela, because quarterly

data on output and/or the components of aggregate demand are unavailable, and Bulgaria,
Poland, and Russia, because their transition from a centrally planned to a market-based
economic organization in the early 1990s complicates the task of identifying the effects of
interest rates at business-cycle frequencies.

deviations from a log-linear trend. A hat on Rtus and Rt denotes simply the log. We measure
Rtus as the 3-month gross Treasury bill rate divided by the average gross US inflation over the
past four quarters.2 We measure Rt as the sum of J. P. Morgan’s EMBI+ stripped spread
and the US real interest rate. Output, investment, and the trade balance are seasonally

adjusted. More details on the data are provided in appendix B.
       We identify our VAR model by imposing the restriction that the matrix A be lower
triangular with unit diagonal elements. Because Rtus and Rt appear at the bottom of the
system, our identification strategy presupposes that innovations in world interest rates (rus
                                                                                           t )

and innovations in country interest rates (rt ) percolate into domestic real variables with a

one-period lag. At the same time, the identification scheme implies that real domestic shocks
(yt , it , and tby
                  t ) affect financial markets contemporaneously. We believe our identification

strategy is a natural one, for, conceivably, decisions such as employment and spending on
durable consumption goods and investment goods take time to plan and implement. Also,

it seems reasonable to assume that financial markets are able to react quickly to news about
the state of the business cycle in emerging economies.3
       Note that the order of the first three variables in our VAR (ŷt , ı̂t , and tbyt ) does not
affect either our estimates of the US-interest-rate and country-interest-rate shocks (rus
                                                                                       t   and

rt ) or the impulse responses of output, investment, and the trade balance to innovations in
these two sources of aggregate fluctuations.
       We further note that the country-interest-rate shock, rt , can equivalently be interpreted
as a country spread shock. To see this, consider substituting in equation (1) the country

     Using a more forward looking measure of inflation expectations to compute the US real interest rate

     But alternative ways to identify rus
                                       t   and rt are also possible. In appendix A, we explore an identification
scheme that allows for real domestic variables to react contemporaneously to innovations in the US interest
rate or the country spread. Under this alternative identification strategy, the point estimate of the impact of
a US-interest-rate shock on output and investment is slightly positive. For both variables, the two-standard-
error intervals around the impact effect include zero (see figure 8). Because it would be difficult for most
models of the open economy to predict an expansion in output and investment in response to an increase in
the world interest rate, we conclude that our maintained identification assumption that real variables do not
react contemporaneously to innovations in external financial variables is more plausible than the alternative
described here.

interest rate R̂t using the definition of country spread, Ŝt ≡ R̂t − R̂tus . Clearly, because Rtus
appears as a regressor in the bottom equation of the VAR system, the estimated residual of
the newly defined bottom equation, call it st , is identical to rt . Moreover, it is obvious that
the impulse response functions of ŷt , ı̂t , and tbyt associated with st are identical to those

associated with rt . Therefore, throughout the paper we indistinctly refer to rt as a country
interest rate shock or as a country spread shock.
       We estimate the VAR system (1) equation by equation using an instrumental-variable
method for dynamic panel data.4 The estimation results are shown in table 1. The estimated
system includes an intercept and country specific fixed effects (not shown in the table). We

include a single lag in the VAR because adding longer lags does not improve the fit of the
model. In estimating the VAR system, we assume that Rtus follows a simple univariate
AR(1) process (i.e., we impose the restriction A4i = B4i = 0, for all i 6= 4). We adopt this
restriction for a number of reasons. First, it is reasonable to assume that disturbances in a

particular (small) emerging country will not affect the real interest rate of a large country
like the United States. Second, the assumed AR(1) specification for Rtus allows us to use
a longer time series for Rus in estimating the fourth equation of the VAR system, which
delivers a tighter estimate of the autoregressive coefficient B(4, 4). (Note that Rtus is the

only variable in the VAR system that does not change from country to country.) Lastly,
the unrestricted estimate of the Rtus equation features statistically insignificant coefficients
on all variables except those associated with the lagged US interest rate (B44 ) and the
contemporaneous trade balance-to-GDP ratio (A43 ). In addition, the point estimate of A43
is small.5 We suspect that the positive coefficient on tbyt in the Rtus equation is reflective

of omitted domestic US variables, particularly variables measuring US aggregate activity.
   4
     Our model is a dynamic panel data model with unbalanced long panels (T > 30). The model is estimated
using the Anderson and Hsiao’s (1981) procedure, with lagged levels serving as instrument variables. Judson
and Owen (1999) find that compared to the GMM estimator proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991) or the
least square estimator with (country specific) dummy variables, the Anderson-Hsiao estimator produces the
lowest estimate bias for dynamic panel models with T > 30.
   5
     In effect, the point estimate of A4,3 is 0.082, which implies that a large increase in the trade balance of
1 percentage point of GDP (∆tbyt = 0.01) produces an increase in the US interest rate of 0.08 percentage
points.

This is because in periods of economic expansion in the United States, the Fed typically
tightens monetary policy. At the same time, during expansions the US economy typically
runs trade balance deficits, which means that those small countries that export primarily
to the United States are likely to run trade surpluses during such periods. These omitted

variables would contaminate our estimate of rus
                                             t   insofar as domestic US shocks transmit to
emerging market economies through channels other than the US interest rate, such as the
terms of trade. Obviously, our estimate of world interest rate shocks depend crucially on the
maintained specification of the fourth equation in the VAR system. But clearly the estimate
of the country spread shocks is independent of the particular specification assumed for the

fourth equation of the VAR system. Using the unrestricted estimate of the Rtus equation
delivers impulse responses to US interest rate shocks that are similar to those implied by
the AR(1) specification but with much wider error bands around them.6 We estimate the
AR(1) process for Rtus for the period 1987:Q3 to 2002:Q4. This sample period corresponds

to the Greenspan era, which arguably ensures homogeneity in the monetary policy regime
in place in the United States.


2.2       Country Spreads, US Interest Rates, and Business Cycles

With an estimate of the VAR system (1) at hand, we can address four central questions: First,
how do US-interest-rate shocks and country-spread shocks affect real domestic variables such

as output, investment, and the trade balance? Second, how do country spreads respond to
innovations in US interest rates? Third, how and by how much do country spreads move in
response to innovations in emerging-country fundamentals? Fourth, how important are US-
interest-rate shocks and country-spread shocks in explaining movements in aggregate activity

in emerging countries? Fifth, how important are US-interest-rate shocks and country-spread
shocks in accounting for movements in country spreads? We answer these questions with
the help of impulse response functions and variance decompositions.

because of our maintained assumption that external financial shocks take one quarter to
affect production and absorption. In the two periods following the country-spread shock,
output and investment fall, and subsequently recover gradually until they reach their pre-
shock level. The adverse spread shock produces a larger contraction in aggregate domestic

absorption than in aggregate output. This is reflected in the fact that the trade balance
improves in the two periods following the shock.

impulse response fnction is that the country spread displays a delayed overshooting. In effect,


                                                    11
in the period of impact, the country interest rate increases but by less than the jump in the
US interest rate. As a result, the country spread initially falls. However, the country spread
recovers quickly and after a couple of quarters it is more than one percentage point above
its pre-shock level. Thus, country spreads respond strongly to innovations in the US interest

rate but with a short delay.8 The responses of output, investment, and the trade balance
are qualitatively similar to those associated with an innovation in the country spread. That
is, aggregate activity and gross domestic investment contract, while net exports improve.
However, the quantitative effects of an innovation in the US interest rate are much more
pronounced than those caused by a country-spread disturbance of equal magnitude. For

instance, the trough in the output response is twice as large under a US-interest-rate shock
than under a country-spread shock.
       We now ask how innovations in the output shock yt impinge upon the variables of our
empirical model. The model is vague about the precise nature of output shocks. They

can reflect variations in total factor productivity, terms-of-trade movements, etc. Figure 4
depicts the impulse response function to a one-percent increase in the output shock. The
response of output, investment, and the trade balance is very much in line with the impulse
response to a positive productivity shock implied by the small open economy RBC model

(see e.g., Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2003). The response of investment is about three times
as large as that of output. At the same time, the trade balance deteriorates significantly for
two periods by about 0.4 percent and then converges gradually to its steady-state level. More
interestingly, the increase in output produces a significant reduction in the country spread
of about 0.6 percent. The half life of the country spread response is about five quarters. The

countercyclical behavior of the country spread in response to output shocks suggests that
country interest rates behave in ways that exacerbates the business-cycle effects of output
shocks.
   8
    The negative impact effect of an increase in the US interest rate on the country spread is in line with
the findings of Eichengreen and Mody (1998) and Kamin and Kleist (1999). We note, however, that because
the models estimated in these studies are static in nature, by construction, they are unable to capture the
rich dynamic relation linking the two variables.

variance/covariance matrix of this h-step-ahead forecasting error is given by Σ               ≡ j=0 Cj Σ Cj0 , where
Σ is the (diagonal) variance/covariance matrix of t . Thus, the variance of the h-step-ahead forecasting
error of xt is simply the vector containing the diagonal elements of Σx,h . In turn, the variance of the error
of the h-step-ahead forecasting error of xt due to a particular shock, say rus         t , is given by the diagonal

for different values of h. The difference between the solid lines and the broken lines (i.e., the fraction of the
variance of the forecasting error due to rt ) is computed in a similar fashion but using the matrix Λ5 .

and fifth equations of the VAR system) are orthogonal to each other. But because ŷt , ît , and tbyt are
excluded from the Rtus equation, we have that the estimates of rus      t  will in general not be orthogonal to the


                                                                        14
proaches infinity, the decomposition of the variance of the forecasting error coincides with
the decomposition of the unconditional variance of the series in question.
    For the purpose of the present discussion, we associate business-cycle fluctuations with
the variance of the forecasting error at a horizon of about five years. Researchers typically

define business cycles as movements in time series of frequencies ranging from 6 quarters
to 32 quarters (Stock and Watson, 1999). Our choice of horizon falls in the middle of this
window.
    According to our estimate of the VAR system given in equation (1), innovations in the US
interest rate, rus
                t , explain about 20 percent of movements in aggregate activity in emerging

countries at business cycle frequency. At the same time, country-spread shocks, rt , account
for about 12 percent of aggregate fluctuations in these countries. Thus, around one third
of business cycles in emerging economies is explained by disturbances in external financial
variables. These disturbances play an even stronger role in explaining movements in in-

ternational transactions. In effect, US-interest-rate shocks and country-spread shocks are
responsible for about 43 percent of movements in the trade balance-to-output ratio in the
countries included in our panel.
    Variations in country spreads are largely explained by innovations in US interest rates

and innovations in country-spreads themselves. Jointly, these two sources of uncertainty
account for about 85 percent of fluctuations in country spreads. Most of this fraction,
about 60 percentage points, is attributed to country-spread shocks. This last result concurs
with Eichengreen and Mody (1998), who interpret this finding as suggesting that arbitrary
revisions in investors sentiments play a significant role in explaining the behavior of country

spreads.
    The impulse response functions shown in figure 4 establish empirically that country
spreads respond significantly and systematically to domestic macroeconomic variables. At
estimates of yt , it , or tby
                             t . However, under our maintained specification assumption that the US real interest
rate does not systematically respond to the state of the business cycle in emerging countries, this lack of
orthogonality should disappear as the sample size increases.



                                                       15
the same time, the variance decomposition performed in this section indicates that domestic
variables are responsible for about 15 percent of the variance of country spreads at business-
cycle frequency. A natural question raised by these findings is whether the feedback from
endogenous domestic variables to country spreads exacerbates domestic volatility. Here we

make a first step at answering this question. Specifically, we modify the R̂t equation of the
VAR system by setting to zero the coefficients on ŷt−i , ît−i , and tbyt−i for i = 0, 1. We then
compute the implied volatility of ŷt , ît , tbyt and R̂t in the modified VAR system at business-
cycle frequency (20 quarters). We compare these volatilities to those emerging from the
original VAR model. Table 2 shows that the presence of feedback from domestic variables

to country spreads significantly increases domestic volatility. In particular, when we shut off
the endogenous feedback, the volatility of output falls by 16 percent whereas the volatility
of investment and the trade balance-to-GDP ratio falls by about 20 percent. The effect of
feedback on the cyclical behavior of the country spread itself if even stronger. In effect, when

feedback is negated, the volatility of the country interest rate falls by about one third.
    Of course, this counterfactual exercise is subject to Lucas’ (1976) celebrated critique.
For one should not expect that in response to changes in the coefficients defining the spread
process all other coefficients of the VAR system will remain unaltered. As such, the results

of table 2 serve solely as a way to motivate a more adequate approach to the question they
aim to address. This more satisfactory approach necessarily involves the use of a theoretical
model economy where private decisions change in response to alterations in the country-
spread process. We follow this route later on.



3     Plausibility of the Identified Shocks

The process of identifying country-spread shocks and US-interest-rate shocks involves a num-
ber of restrictions on the matrices defining the VAR system (1). To assess the plausibility of
these restrictions, it is necessary to use the predictions of some theory of the business cycle



                                               16
as a metric. If the estimated shocks imply similar business cycle fluctuations in the empirical
as in theoretical models, we conclude that according to the proposed theory, the identified
shocks are plausible.
   Accordingly, we will assess the plausibility of our estimated shocks in four steps: First,

we develop a standard model of the business cycle in small open economies. Second, we
estimate the deep structural parameters of the model. Third, we feed into the model the
estimated version of the fourth and fifth equations of the VAR system (1), describing the
stochastic laws of motion of the US interest rate and the country spread. Finally, we compare
estimated impulse responses (i.e., those shown in figures 2 and 3) with those implied by the

proposed theoretical framework.


3.1    The Theoretical Model

The basis of the theoretical model presented here is the standard neoclassical growth model
of the small open economy (e.g., Mendoza, 1991). We depart from the canonical version
of the model in four important dimensions. First, as in the empirical model, we assume

that in each period, production and absorption decisions are made prior to the realization
of that period’s world interest rate and country spread. Thus, innovations in the world
interest rate or the country spread are assumed to have allocative effects with a one-period
lag. Second, preferences are assumed to feature external habit formation, or catching up

with the Joneses as in Abel (1990). This feature improves the predictions of the standard
model by preventing an excessive contraction in private non-business absorption in response
to external financial shocks. Habit formation has been shown to help explain asset prices
and business fluctuations in both developed economies (e.g., Boldrin, Christiano, and Fisher,

2001) and emerging countries (e.g., Uribe, 2002). Third, firms are assumed to be subject
to a working-capital-in-advance constraint. This element introduces a direct supply side
effect of changes in the cost of borrowing in international financial markets. This working
capital constraint allows the model to predict a more realistic response of domestic output


                                              17
to external financial shocks. Fourth, the process of capital accumulation is assumed to be
subject to gestation lags and convex adjustment costs. In combination, these frictions prevent
excessive investment volatility, induce persistence, and allow for the observed nonmonotonic
(hump-shaped) response of investment in response to a variety of shocks (see Uribe, 1997).


3.1.1   Households

Consider a small open economy populated by a large number of infinitely lived households
with preferences described by the following utility function

                                      X
                                      ∞
                                 E0         β t U (ct − µc̃t−1 , ht ),                     (2)
                                      t=0


where ct denotes consumption in period t, c̃t denotes the cross-sectional average level of
consumption in period t − 1, and ht denotes the fraction of time devoted to work in period t.
Households take as given the process for c̃t . The single-period utility index u is assumed to

be increasing in its first argument, decreasing in its second argument, concave, and smooth.
The parameter β ∈ (0, 1) denotes the subjective discount factor. The parameter µ measures
the degree of external habit formation. The case µ = 0 corresponds to time separability in
preferences. The larger is µ, the stronger is the degree of external habit formation.

   Households have access to two types of asset, physical capital and an internationally
traded bond. The capital stock is assumed to be owned entirely by domestic residents.
Households have three sources of income: wages, capital rents, and interest income on finan-
cial asset holdings. Each period, households allocate their wealth to purchases of consump-

tion goods, purchases of investment goods, and purchases of financial assets. The household’s
period-by-period budget constraint is given by


                       dt = Rt−1 dt−1 + Ψ(dt ) − wt ht − ut kt + ct + it ,                 (3)


where dt denotes the household’s debt position in period t, Rt denotes the gross interest rate


                                                  18
faced by domestic residents in financial markets, wt denotes the wage rate, ut denotes the
rental rate of capital, kt denotes the stock of physical capital, and it denotes gross domestic
investment. We assume that households face costs of adjusting their foreign asset position.
We introduce these adjustment costs with the sole purpose of eliminating the familiar unit

root built in the dynamics of standard formulations of the small open economy model. The
                                                                            ¯ = Ψ0 (d)
debt-adjustment cost function Ψ(·) is assumed to be convex and to satisfy Ψ(d)      ¯ = 0,

for some d¯ > 0. Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2003) compare a number of standard alternative
ways to induce stationarity in the small open economy framework and conclude that they
all produce virtually identical implications for business fluctuations.

   The debt adjustment cost can be decentralized as follows. Suppose that financial trans-
actions between domestic and foreign residents require financial intermediation by domestic
institutions (banks). Suppose there is a continuum of banks of measure one that behave
competitively. They capture funds from foreign investors at the country rate Rt and lend

to domestic agents at the rate Rtd . In addition, banks face operational costs, Ψ(dt ), that
are increasing and convex in the volume of intermediation, dt . The problem of domes-
tic banks is then to choose the volume dt so as to maximize profits, which are given by
Rtd [dt − Ψ(dt )] − Rt dt , taking as given Rtd and Rt . It follows from the first-order condition

associated with this problem that the interest rate charged to domestic residents is given by

                                                   Rt
                                       Rtd =                ,                                 (4)
                                               1 − Ψ0 (dt )

which is precisely the shadow interest rate faced by domestic agents in the centralized prob-
lem (see the Euler condition (11) below). Bank profits are assumed to be distributed to
domestic households in a lump-sum fashion. This digression will be of use later in the paper
when we analyze the firm’s problem.

   The process of capital accumulation displays adjustment costs in the form of gestation
lags and convex costs of installing new capital goods. To produce one unit of capital good



                                                19
requires investing 1/4 units of goods for four consecutive periods. Let sit denote the number
of investment projects started in t − i for i = 0, 1, 2, 3. Then investment in period t is given
by
                                                   1X
                                                        3
                                            it =         sit .                                       (5)
                                                   4 i=0

In turn, the evolution of sit is given by


                                             si+1t+1 = sit ,                                         (6)


For i = 0, 1, 2. The stock of capital obeys the following law of motion:

                                                                          
                                                                     s3t
                                   kt+1 = (1 − δ)kt + kt Φ                     ,                     (7)
                                                                     kt

where δ ∈ (0, 1) denotes the rate of depreciation of physical capital. The process of capital

accumulation is assumed to be subject to adjustment costs, as defined by the function Φ,
which is assumed to be strictly increasing, concave, and to satisfy Φ(δ) = δ and Φ0 (δ) = 1.
These last two assumptions ensure the absence of adjustment costs in the steady state.
The introduction of capital adjustment costs is commonplace in models of the small open
economy. They are a convenient and plausible way to avoid excessive investment volatility

in response to changes in the interest rate faced by the country in international markets.

The interpretation of these equations is straightforward. It is important to recall, however,
that, because of our assumed information structure, the variables ct+1 , ht+1 , and s0t+1 all

reside in the information set of period t. Equation (9) states that in period t households
choose consumption and leisure for period t+1 in such as way as to equate the marginal utility
of consumption in period t + 1 to the expected marginal utility of wealth in that period,



                                                 21
Et λt+1 . Note that in general the marginal utility of wealth will differ from the marginal
utility of consumption (λt 6= Uc (ct − µc̃t−1 , ht )), because current consumption cannot react
to unanticipated changes in wealth. Equation (10) defines the household’s labor supply
schedule, by equating the marginal disutility of effort in period t + 1 to the expected utility

value of the wage rate in that period. Equation (11) is an asset pricing relation equating the
intertemporal marginal rate of substitution in consumption to the rate of return on financial
assets. Note that, because of the presence of frictions to adjust bond holdings, the relevant
rate of return on this type of asset is not simply the market rate Rt but rather the shadow
rate of return Rt /[1 − Ψ0 (dt )]. Intuitively, when the household’s debt position is, say, above
                       ¯ we have that Ψ0 (dt ) > 0 so that the shadow rate of return is higher
its steady-state level d,
than the market rate of return, providing further incentives for households to save, thereby
reducing their debt positions. Equations (12)-(14) show how to price investment projects
at different stages of completion. The price of an investment project in its ith quarter of

gestation equals the price of a project in the i-1 quarter of gestation plus 1/4 units of goods.
Equation (15) links the cost of producing a unit of capital to the shadow price of installed
capital, or Tobin’s Q, qt . Finally, equation (16) is a pricing condition for physical capital.
It equates the revenue from selling one unit of capital today, qt , to the discounted value of

renting the unit of capital for one period and then selling it, ut+1 + qt+1 , net of depreciation
and adjustment costs.


3.1.2   Firms

Output is produced by means of a production function that takes labor services and physical
capital as inputs,
                                         yt = F (kt , ht ),                                 (17)

where the function F is assumed to be homogeneous of degree one, increasing in both ar-
guments, and concave. Firms hire labor and capital services from perfectly competitive
markets. The production process is subject to a working-capital constraint that requires

                                                22
firms to hold non-interest-bearing assets to finance a fraction of the wage bill each period.
Formally, the working-capital constraint takes the form


                                        κt ≥ ηwt ht ;   η ≥ 0,


where κt denotes the amount of working capital held by the representative firm in period t.
   The debt position of the firm, denoted by dft , evolves according to the following expression


                   dft = Rt−1
                          d
                              dft−1 − F (kt , ht ) + wt ht + ut kt + πt − κt−1 + κt ,


where πt denotes distributed profits in period t, and Rtd is the shadow interest rate at which
domestic residents borrow and is given by equation (4). As shown by the discussion around
equation (4), Rtd is indeed the interest rate at which all nonfinancial domestic residents
borrow and differs in general from the country interest rate Rt due to the presence of debt-
adjustment costs. Define the firm’s total net liabilities at the end of period t as at = Rtd dft −κt .

Then, we can rewrite the above expression as

                                                                                
                   at                                                    Rtd − 1
                      = at−1 − F (kt , ht ) + wt ht + ut kt + πt +                 κt .
                   Rt                                                      Rtd

We will limit attention to the case in which the interest rate is positive at all times. This
implies that the working-capital constraint will always bind, for otherwise the firm would
incur in unnecessary financial costs, which would be suboptimal. So we can use the working-

capital constraint holding with equality to eliminate κt from the above expression to get

                                                         d     
                 at                                       Rt − 1
                     = at−1 − F (kt , ht ) + wt ht 1 + η            + ut kt + πt .               (18)
                 Rtd                                       Rtd

It is clear from this expression that the assumed working-capital constraint increases the
unit labor cost by a fraction η(Rtd − 1)/Rtd , which is increasing in the interest rate Rtd .



                                                  23
       The firm’s objective is to maximize the present discounted value of the stream of profits
distributed to its owners, the domestic residents. That is,

                                                            X

We use the household’s marginal utility of wealth as the stochastic discount factor because
households own domestic firms. Using constraint (18) to eliminate πt from the firm’s objec-

tive function the firm’s problem can be stated as choosing processes for at , ht , and kt so as
to maximize

                                                 j→∞



The first-order conditions associated with this problem are (11), (18), the no-Ponzi-game
constraint holding with equality, and

                                                                    d     
                                                                     Rt − 1
                                           Fh (kt , ht ) = wt 1 + η                                   (19)
                                                                      Rtd

                                                     Fk (kt , ht ) = ut .                             (20)

It is clear from the first of these two efficiency conditions that the working-capital constraint
distorts the labor market by introducing a wedge between the marginal product of labor

and the real wage rate. This distortion is larger the larger the opportunity cost of holding
working capital, (Rtd −1)/Rtd , or the higher the intensity of the working capital constraint, η.11
  11
    The precise form taken by this wedge depends on the particular timing assumed in modeling the use
of working capital. Here we adopt the shopping-time timing. Alternative assumptions give rise to different
specifications of the wedge. For instance, under a cash-in-advance timing the wedge takes the form 1 +
η(Rtd − 1).


                                                              24
We also observe that any process at satisfying equation (18) and the firm’s no-Ponzi-game
constraint is optimal. We assume that firms start out with no liabilities. Then, an optimal
plan consists in holding no liabilities at all times (at = 0 for all t ≥ 0), with distributed
profits given by
                                                       d     
                                                        Rt − 1
                       πt = F (kt , ht ) − wt ht 1 + η            − ut kt
                                                         Rtd

In this case, dt represents the country’s net debt position, as well as the amount of debt
intermediated by local banks. We also note that the above three equations together with the

assumption that the production technology is homogeneous of degree one imply that profits
are zero at all times (πt = 0 ∀ t).


3.1.3   Driving Forces

One advantage of our method to assess the plausibility of the identified US-interest-rate
shocks and country-spread shocks is that one need not feed into the model shocks other than
those whose effects one is interested in studying. This is because we empirically identified

not only the distribution of the two shocks we wish to study, but also their contribution to
business cycles in emerging economies. In formal terms, we produced empirical estimates
of the coefficients associated with rt and rus
                                             t   in the MA(∞) representation of the endoge-
nous variables of interest (output, investment, etc.). So using the calibrated model, we can

generate the corresponding theoretical objects and compare them. It turns out that up to
first order, one need not know anything about the distribution of shocks other than rt and
rus
 t   to construct the coefficients associated with these shocks in the MA(∞) representation
of endogenous variables implied by the model. We therefore close our model by introducing

the law of motion of the country interest rate Rt . This process is given by our estimate of
the bottom equation of the VAR system (1), which is shown in the last columns of table 1.

       Because the process for the country interest rate defined by equation (21) involves the

world interest rate Rtus , which is assumed to be an exogenous random variable, we must also
include this variable’s law of motion as part of the set of equations defining the equilibrium
behavior of the theoretical model. Accordingly, we stipulate that Rtus follows the AR(1)
process shown in the fourth column of table 1. Specifically,

3.1.4      Equilibrium, Functional Forms, and Parameter Values

In equilibrium all households consume identical quantities. Thus, individual consumption
equals average consumption across households, or


                                            ct = c̃t ;    t ≥ −1.                                        (24)
  12
     In an economy like the one described by our theoretical model, where the debt-adjustment cost Ψ(dt )
are incurred by households, the national income and product accounts would measure private consumption
                                                                                             ¯ = 0, it follows

In calibrating the model, the time unit is meant to be one quarter. Following Mendoza
(1991), we set γ = 2, ω = 1.455, and α = .32. We set the steady-state real interest rate
faced by the small economy in international financial markets at 11 percent per year. This
value is consistent with an average US interest rate of about 4 percent and an average country

premium of 7 percent, both of which are in line with actual data. We set the depreciation
rate at 10 percent per year, a standard value in business-cycle studies.
       There remain four parameters to assign values to, ψ, φ, η, and µ. There is no readily
available estimates for these parameters for emerging economies. We therefore proceed to
estimate them. Our estimation procedure follows Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2001)

and consists of choosing values for the four parameters so as to minimize the distance between
the estimated impulse response functions shown in figure 2 and the corresponding impulse
responses implied by the model.13 In our exercise we consider the first 24 quarters of the
  13
    A key difference between the exercise presented here and that in Christiano et al. is that here the
estimation procedure requires fitting impulse responses to multiple sources of uncertainty (i.e., country-
interest-rate shocks and world-interest-rate shocks, whereas in Christiano et al. the set of estimated impulse
responses used in the estimation procedure are originated by a single shock.

impulse response functions of 4 variables (output, investment, the trade balance, and the
country interest rate), to 2 shocks (the US-interest-rate shock and the country-spread shock).
Thus, we are setting 4 parameter values to match 192 points. Specifically, let IRe denote the
192x1 vector of estimated impulse response functions and IRm (ψ, φ, η, µ) the corresponding

vector of impulse responses implied by the theoretical model, which is a function of the four
parameters we seek to estimate. Then our estimate of (ψ, φ, η, µ) is given by


             argmax{ψ,φ,η,µ} [IRe − IRm (ψ, φ, η, µ)]0Σ−1     e    m
                                                       IRe [IR − IR (ψ, φ, η, µ)],




where ΣIRe is a 192x192 diagonal matrix containing the variance of the impulse response
function along the diagonal. This matrix penalizes those elements of the estimated impulse
response functions associated with large error intervals. The resulting parameter estimates

are ψ = 0.00042, φ = 72.8, η = 1.2, and µ = 0.2. The implied debt adjustment costs are
small. For example, a 10 percent increase in dt over its steady-state value d¯ maintained
over one year has a resource cost of 4 × 10−6 percent of annual GDP. On the other hand,
capital adjustment costs appear as more significant. For instance, starting in a steady-

state situation, a 10 percent increase in investment for one year produces an increase in the
capital stock of 0.88 percent. In the absence of capital adjustment costs, the capital stock
increases by 0.96 percent. The estimated value of η implies that firms maintain a level of
working capital equivalent to about 3.6 months of wage payments. Finally, the estimated

degree of habit formation is modest compared to the values typically used to explain asset-
price regularities in closed economies (e.g., Constantinides, 1990). Table 3 summarizes the
parameter evaluation.


3.2    Estimated and Theoretical Impulse Response Functions

We are now ready to produce the response functions implied by the theoretical model and

to compare them to those stemming from the empirical model given by the VAR system (1).

US-interest-rate shock (rus

   The model replicates the data relatively well. All 192 points belonging to the theoret-
ical impulse responses except for three lie inside the estimated two-standard-error bands.
Furthermore, the model replicates three key qualitative features of the estimated impulse
responses: First, output and investment contract in response to either a US-interest-rate
shock or a country-spread shock. Second, the trade balance improves in response to either

shock. Third, the country interest rate displays a hump-shaped response to an innovation

                                                                      29
in the US interest rate. Fourth, the country interest rate displays a monotonic response to
a country-spread shock. We therefore conclude that the scheme used to identify the para-
meters of the VAR system (1) is indeed successful in isolating country-spread shocks and
US-interest-rate shocks from the data.



4     The Endogeneity of Country Spreads: Business Cy-

      cle Implications

The estimated process for the country interest rate given in equation (21) implies that the
country spread, Ŝt = R̂t − R̂tus , moves in response to four types of variable: lagged values
of itself (or the autoregressive component, St−1 ), the exogenous country-spread shock (or,

in Eichengreen’s and Mody’s, 1998, terminology, the sentiment component, rt ), current and
past US interest rates (Rtus and Rt−1
                                  us
                                      ), and current and past values of a set of domestic
                                                   ˆ , tby
endogenous variables (ŷt , ŷt−1 , ı̂t , ı̂t−1 , tby   ˆ
                                                      t    t−1 ). A natural question is to what extent

the endogeneity of country spreads contributes to exacerbating aggregate fluctuations in

emerging countries.
    We address this question by means of two counterfactual exercises. The first exercise
aims at gauging the degree to which country spreads amplify the effects of world-interest-
rate shocks. To this end, we calculate the volatility of endogenous macroeconomic variables
due to US-interest-rate shocks in a world where the country spread does not directly depend

on the US interest rate. Specifically, we assume that the process for the country interest rate
is given by


          R̂t = 0.63R̂t−1 + R̂tus − 0.63R̂t−1
                                          us
                                              − 0.79ŷt + 0.61ŷt−1 + 0.11ı̂t − 0.12ı̂t−1        (25)

               + 0.29tbyt − 0.19tbyt−1 + rt .


This process differs from the one shown in equation (21) only in that the coefficient on the


                                                 30
contemporaneous US interest rate is unity and the coefficient on the lagged US interest rate
equals -0.63, which is the negative of the coefficient on the lagged country interest rate. This
                                                                                             us
parameterization implies that, given the past value of the country spread, Ŝt−1 = R̂t−1 − R̂t−1 ,
the current country spread, St , does not directly depend upon current or past values of the

US interest rate. The process for the US interest rate is assumed to be unchanged (see
equation (23)). The precise question we wish to answer is: what process for R̂t induces
higher volatility in macroeconomic variables in response to US-interest-rate shocks, the one
given in equation (21) or the one given in equation (25)? As pointed out earlier in the paper,
to address this counterfactual question one cannot simply resort to replacing line five in the

VAR system (1) with equation (25) and then recomputing the variance decomposition. For
this procedure would be subject to Lucas’ (1976) critique on the use of estimated models to
evaluate changes in regime. Instead, we appeal to the theoretical model developed in the
previous section. The answer stemming from our theoretical model is meaningful for two

reasons: First, it is not vulnerable to the Lucas critique, because the theoretical equilibrium
is recomputed taking into account the effects of parameter changes on decision rules. Second,
we showed earlier in this paper that the theoretical model is capable of capturing the observed
macroeconomic dynamics induced by US-interest-rate shocks. This is important because

obviously the exercise would be meaningless if conducted within a theoretical framework
that fails to provide an adequate account of basic business-cycle stylized facts.
   The result of the exercise is shown in table 4. We find that when the country spread is
assumed not to respond directly to variations in the US interest rate (i.e., under the process
for Rt given in equation (25)) the standard deviation of output and the trade balance-to-

output ratio explained by US-interest-rate shocks is about two thirds smaller than in the
baseline scenario (i.e., when Rt follows the process given in equation (21)). This indicates
that the aggregate effects of US-interest-rate shocks are strongly amplified by the dependence
of country spreads on US interest rates.

   A second counterfactual experiment we wish to conduct aims to assess the macroeconomic


                                               31
consequences of the fact that country spreads move in response to changes in domestic
variables such as output and the external accounts. To this end, we use our theoretical
model to compute the volatility of endogenous domestic variables in an environment where
country spreads do not respond to domestic variables. Specifically, we replace the process

for the country interest rate given in equation (21) with the process


                            R̂t = 0.63R̂t−1 + 0.50R̂tus + 0.35R̂t−1
                                                                us
                                                                    + rt .                              (26)


Table 4 displays the outcome of this exercise. We find that the equilibrium volatility of
output, investment, and the trade balance-to-output ratio explained jointly by US-interest-
rate shocks and country-spread shocks (rus
                                        t   and rt ) falls by about one fourth when the
country spread is independent of domestic conditions with respect to the baseline scenario.14

Thus, the fact that country spreads respond to the state of business conditions in emerging
countries seems to significantly accentuate the degree of aggregate instability in the region.



5        Conclusion

Country spreads, the world interest rate, and business conditions in emerging markets are
interrelated in complicated ways. Country spreads affect aggregate activity but at the same

time respond to domestic macroeconomic fundamentals. The world interest rate has an effect
on the country interest rates not only through the familiar no-arbitrage condition but also
through country spreads. This paper aims at making a step forward in disentangling these
interconnections.

       We find that the answer to the question posed in the title of this paper is that country
spreads drive business cycles in emerging economies and vice versa. But the effects are not
overwhelmingly large. Country spread shocks explain about 12 percent of movements in
  14
    Ideally, this particular exercise should be conducted in an environment with a richer battery of shocks
capable of explaining a larger fraction of observed business cycles than that accounted by rus
                                                                                            t   and rt alone.



                                                     32
domestic economic activity, and, in turn, innovations in macroeconomic fundamentals in
emerging markets explain abut 12 percent of movements in country spreads.
   However, country spreads play a significant role in propagating shocks. For instance, we
find that US-interest-rate shocks explain about 20 percent of movements in output. This

is a large number. But most of the contribution of US interest rates to business cycles in
emerging markets is due to the fact that country spreads respond systematically to variations
in this variable. Specifically, if country spreads were independent of the US interest rate,
then the variance of emerging countries’ output explained by US interest rates would fall
by about two thirds. Similarly, a significant fraction of the variability in domestic activity

that is explained jointly by world-interest-rate shocks and country-spread shocks is due to
the fact that country spreads respond to the state of developing countries’ business cycles
(as measured by variables such as aggregate output). If country spreads did not respond to
variations in emerging countries’ domestic fundamentals, then the magnitude of aggregate

fluctuations due to US interest-rate shocks and country-spread shocks would fall by around
one fourth.
   This paper can be extended in a number of directions. A key relative price whose behav-
ior any model of emerging market economies should aspire to explain is the real exchange

rate. Both the theoretical and empirical models studied here are completely silent on this.
Extending the analysis to allow for a nontradable sector is therefore in order.
   Perhaps a more important issue to address concerns the microfoundations of country-
spread behavior. In this paper the theoretical analysis is limited to the case in which the law
of motion of the country spread is given. Nothing is said about why the country premium

depends upon variables such as output or the world interest rate. Enriching the theoretical
model by providing a more microfounded specification of country spreads is desirable. The
improved framework is likely to deal explicitly with issues of debt default, as it seems reason-
able to expect that the probability that a country will honor its external obligations is higher

the higher are variables such as output, investment, or the trade balance, and the lower is


                                              33
the world interest rate. The existing literature on sovereign debt developed in the 1980s is a
natural starting point. But this body of work still remains to be integrated into a dynamic
business-cycle framework of the open economy. A recent paper by Arellano (2003) is a step
in this direction. An important challenge that the resulting theoretical framework will face

has to do with replicating the delayed overshooting in the response of country spreads to
world-interest-rate shocks identified in this paper. In effect, our empirical findings suggest
that an increase in the world interest rate causes an initial decline in country spreads. After
the initial period, the country spread grows rapidly, reaching in a few quarters a level higher
than the pre-shock value.

   More generally, a central methodological theme of this paper is the combined use of
time series analysis and theoretical general equilibrium modeling. Most of the literature
extant limits attention to only one of these analytical tools. It is our belief that bringing
the prediction of empirical and theoretical models closer together will further enhance our

understanding of the forces driving business cycles in the emerging market world.

Appendix A: An Alternative Scheme for Identifying Country-

Spread Shocks

In this appendix we present an alternative strategy for identifying country-spread shocks.
Namely, we assume that innovations to the US interest rate and to country spreads can affect
real domestic variables contemporaneously and that innovations to domestic variables affect
country spreads with a lag. Formally, the empirical system takes the form

                                                                     

where the matrix A is assumed to be lower triangular. We continue to assume that the
US interest rate follows a unit variate AR(1) process. Table 5 presents the estimation of
system (27) using an IV procedure with country specific dummies. Figures 8 and 7 present
the associated impulse response functions to a US-interest-rate shock and to a country-spread

shock, respectively. Figure 9 depicts the decomposition of the variance of forecasting errors
at different horizons.

The dataset includes quarterly data for Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Philip-
pines, and Venezuela. The sample periods vary across countries. They are : Argentina

1994Q1-2002Q1, Brazil 1994Q3-2002Q1, Ecuador: 1995Q2-2002Q1, Mexico 1994Q1-2003Q1,
Peru: 1997Q2-2002Q1, Philippines: 1999Q3-2002Q1, South Africa: 1995Q1-2002Q1. In to-
tal, the dataset contains 220 observations.


                                                  35
   Quarterly series for GDP, total consumption, investment and net exports are from the
IMF’s International Financial Statistics. All of these variables are deflated using the GDP
deflator.
   In constructing a series for the gross real country interest rate, Rt , we use the relation

Rt = Rtus St , where Rtus denotes the gross real world interest rate and St denotes the gross
country spread. The spread is measured using data on spreads from J.P.Morgan’s Emerging
Markets Bond Index Plus (EMBI+ ). The world interest rate is measured by the interest
rate on three-month US treasury bill minus a measure of US expected inflation. Expected
inflation is proxied by the average percentage increase in the US GDP deflation over the

previous 4 quarters.
   EMBI+ is a composite index of different US dollar-denominated bonds on four markets:
Brady bonds, Eurobonds, U.S. dollar local markets and loans. The spreads are computed
as an arithmetic, market-capitalization-weighted average of bond spreads over US treasury

bonds of comparable duration.

     Notes: t-statistics are shown in parenthesis. The system was estimated equation
     by equation. All equations except for the R̂tus equation were estimated using
     instrumental variables with panel data from Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico,
     Peru, Philippines, and South Africa, over the period 1994:1 to 2001:4. The R̂tus
     equation was estimated by OLS over the period 1987:1-2002:4.
