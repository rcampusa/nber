Does Parental Quality Matter? Evidence on the Transmission of Human Capital Using Variation

                                           ABSTRACT

This paper examines the transmission of human capital from parents to children using variation in
parental influence due to parental death, divorce, and the increasing specialization of parental
roles in larger families. All three sources of variation yield strikingly similar patterns which show
that the strong parent-child correlation in human capital is largely causal. In each case, the parent-
child correlation in education is stronger with the parent that spends more time with the child, and
weaker with the parent that spends relatively less time parenting. These findings help us
understand why educated parents spend more time with their children.

I. Introduction

       Educated parents tend to have better educated children, and typically spend more
time with their children relative to less educated parents. One possible explanation
behind both phenomena is that educated parents are more productive in creating human
capital in their children. This paper examines this hypothesis using variation in parental
involvement stemming from parental death, divorce, and the increasing specialization of
parental roles in larger families.

       Although there is a large literature on the intergenerational transmission of human
capital, there exist large differences in the findings across methodologies. This paper
utilizes a new approach based on the idea that the strength of this transmission, if not
entirely genetic, should be a function of the “quality” of each parent, interacted with the
amount of time and influence ascribed to each parent. Examining this issue empirically is
challenging, since each parent’s role, time input, and labor force participation are likely
to be set as part of a household optimization, as well as being correlated with unmeasured
characteristics of the child and parents. For example, a child with learning problems may
receive more attention from his/her parents, thus leading to a negative correlation
between child outcomes and parental time inputs.

       To overcome these empirical obstacles, we use quasi-random variation in parental
influence. Parental death increases the role and time input of the surviving parent relative
to the one that passes away. Similarly, parental divorce typically leads a child to be
increasingly under the care of one parent, usually the mother, relative to the other. Both
of these shifts in parental time inputs and influence are intensified if they occur earlier in
a child’s life. Therefore, we analyze the incidence and the timing of both types of
unfortunate events in order to identify the causal effect of parental human capital on a
child’s human capital.

       However, parental human capital can have a direct effect on the production of a
child’s human capital through parent-child interactions, or an indirect effect by increasing
the earning capacity of a parent.       Parental death and divorce are cases where the
remaining parent’s human capital may exert a larger influence over a child’s outcomes


                                              1
due to both the direct and indirect effect – since a surviving or divorced parent is likely to
spend more time with her/his children and also to become a primary income source for
the household.

       We employ three complementary strategies to disentangle the direct from the
indirect effect. First, we show that our results are robust to including controls for parental
earnings, school fixed effects, and the socioeconomic status of the locality of residence.
Second, we exploit the fact that fathers typically earn more and spend less time with
children, so that if the primary mechanism is the indirect income channel, the effect of
losing a father should be greater than that of losing a mother. In fact, we find the
opposite. Lastly, we develop a model that shows that as family size increases, a mother’s
education should become more important relative to a father’s education if time
investments are important – since mothers empirically spend more time with children
relative to fathers in larger families. Thus, we provide three complementary pieces of
evidence that point to the direct quality of time effect being the main channel that links
parental education to their children’s outcomes.

       Our analysis of all three sources of parent-child interaction time is performed with
a large sample of all Jewish children born in Israel between 1974 and 1991 that attended
secular schools. The information for each child includes parental education levels, family
size, changes in parental marital status, and the year of any parental death. The sample is
quite large with over 22,000 children who lost a parent before the age of 18, over 77,000
children whose parents divorced before the age of 18, and over 600,000 children who did
not experience parental death or divorce before the age of 18. Our outcome variable of
interest is whether the child passes the “matriculation exam” in Israel by the end of high
school, a high-stakes test required to attend college, which is passed by roughly 57
percent of Israeli students.

       Our analysis using parental death as a source of parental influence compares the
effects of parental schooling on three separate sets of children: (1) children that did not
lose either parent by age 18; (2) children that lost a mother or a father before the age of
18; and (3) children that lost a mother or a father, but after the matriculation exam was
completed (after age 18).      Using variation across these groups, we test the idea that if

                                              2
education causes parents to be more effective in producing educated children, the
relationship between a parent’s education and his/her child’s human capital should
depend on whether that parent was alive and able to interact with the child before taking
the matriculation exam.

       The non-random selection of families that suffer a parental loss is addressed using
the number of years a child spends with the parent who eventually dies. Specifically, we
take a sample of children who are similar in the sense of having suffered the death of the
same parent before the age of 18, and examine whether the parent-child relationship in
education intensifies with the number of years together before the parent dies.
Furthermore, we leverage the discontinuity introduced by the timing of the test relative to
the parental death. Within a sample of individuals that lost a given parent, losing a parent
after the age of 18 should not have a causal effect on the outcome of a test which was
completed by the age of 18, while losing a parent before the age of 18 could have a large
impact on the same test. This discontinuity allows us to perform a useful placebo
analysis in order to examine the causal interpretation of our estimates.

       Our analysis using divorce as a source of parental influence is analogous. This
strategy examines children whose parents divorce, and tests whether the education of the
mother (the custodial parent in most cases) becomes more important relative to the father
if the divorce occurred before the age of 18.

       Our analysis using variation in family size is based on the idea that if income is
the primary channel linking parental education to children’s outcomes, the relationship
between them should be weaker in large families where financial investments must be
spread among more children. We further show empirically that mothers in larger families
spend more time with their children relative to fathers and that their education is a more
important determinant of children’s outcomes relative to fathers. These findings are
consistent with parental time being the main mechanism that links parental education to
children’s human capital.

       Our results display a consistent, striking pattern across each analysis that indicates
that parental education has a large causal impact on the human capital of children, and the


                                                3
size of the impact depends on the amount of time a child spends with each parent. If a
mother dies, her education becomes less important for the child’s outcomes, while at the
same time, the father’s education becomes more important. If a father dies, the reverse
happens – the father’s education becomes less important while the mother’s education
plays a larger role. Importantly, these relationships intensify when the parent dies when
the child is younger. That is, the effect of a father’s education decreases with the amount
of years the child spends with a mother that eventually dies, while the effect of the
mother’s education increases with each year that she remains alive. A similar pattern, in
reverse, occurs when the father dies. Furthermore, our placebo analysis shows that the
parent-child relationship in schooling does not depend on the child’s age at the time of
parental death if the death occurs after the matriculation exam was completed (in 12th
grade).     This finding suggests that our main results regarding those that lost a parent
before the test was taken are not due to the non-random selection of families that suffer a
parental death.

          The generalizability of these estimates is further supported by results using
parental divorce as the source of variation in parental influence. The human capital of
mothers who get divorced before the child turns 18 becomes a stronger determinant of the
child’s matriculation outcome relative to the father’s human capital. The same pattern is
found for children in larger families where parental roles are increasingly specialized –
the mother’s human capital becomes more important relative to the father’s as the
number of children increases.

          Overall, the similarity of the results across three different samples that comprise
the entire population (children who suffered a parental death, children who experienced
divorce, and those that experienced neither one) provides strong evidence that the amount
of parent-child interaction time is driving our results. In addition, we find two other
striking patterns which are consistent across all three analyses: the results are stronger
for girls relative to boys, and the results are stronger for children with less educated
parents. 1 The latter finding may be due to the idea that our outcome is not a “high

 The gender results are consistent with recent evidence that girls are more affected by their childhood
environment relative to boys (Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007) and Gould, Lavy, and Paserman (2011)).

achievement” measure, but rather is a milestone achievement for children that typically
come from families in the middle to low end of the socioeconomic spectrum.

        As indicated above, the intergenerational transmission of human capital has
received considerable attention in recent years. 2 Recent studies generally employ one of
two strategies: (i) using twin parents or adopted children to control for the genetic
transmission of human capital; 3 or (ii) using an instrument for parental education (such as
changes in compulsory schooling laws). 4

        Overall, the results from the twins and adoptees studies point to a small, but
significant effect of father’s education, and no effect of a mother’s education. 5 The IV
findings point to a small effect of the mother but not the father on child schooling levels,
but stronger effects on other outcomes like test scores and grade retention. 6 Although
the differing results in the literature could be due to differences in the time period and
country used in the analysis, studies which apply each method to the same data show that
the variation in results is largely due to the methods, not the different sources of data
(Holmlund et al. (2011) and Haegeland et al. (2010)). These papers suggest that different
strategies produce different results because each method is using variation in a different
part of the parental education distribution. For example, IV studies using compulsory
schooling laws are using variation in the 7th to 9th grade part of the distribution, while
adoptive parents tend to come from the higher end of the education distribution.

        Our main contribution is to introduce a new empirical strategy, using variation in
parental influence, to investigate the causal effect of parental education on the human
capital of their children. Following a previous version of the current paper (Gould and
Simhon (2011)), Kalil et. al.’s (2016) analysis exploited variation in time spent with

  These results are similar to those in the fourth strategy in the literature, which is to use a structural
approach. Belzil and Hansen (2003) find a negative effect of a mother’s education on her children, while a
father’s education has a positive effect.

   Larger effects are found for non-schooling level outcomes in Oreopoulos, Page, and Stevens (2006),

fathers due to paternal death, and found similar results on children who lost a
father. However, their study did not examine maternal death, which is important for
disentangling mechanisms. Nor did they consider variation in parental time inputs due to
divorce or family size. These extensions are important for exploring whether the results
for families that underwent a tragic parental shock can be generalized to the rest of the
population, and also for addressing the indirect effect of parental income.

         Our estimates are much larger than most of the literature which measures child
outcomes with their completed schooling levels. However, our findings are similar to
studies that yield significant effects on children’s test scores and grade repetition.                      In
addition, our analysis supports the idea that the differences in the findings within the
existing literature are due to each method using different parts of the parental education
distribution.     Across all three analyses, we find much stronger effects of parental
education from the lower part of the distribution, which is consistent with the idea that
the IV results are larger than the adoptee findings because the former is shocking the
lower part of the parental education distribution while the adoptee strategy is using
variation from the upper tail. 7

         Finally, our analysis sheds light on the important findings of Guryan, Hurst, and
Kearney (2008) that show how the time allocation of parents for child activities varies
with parental education. Specifically, they show that educated women spend much more
time with their children than less educated women, despite having a higher cost of time
and higher employment rates. This pattern holds across several countries, and persists
even after controlling for labor force participation. For working men, a strong, positive
relationship is also found between education and each category of childcare. 8 For


7
  Our analysis is also related to the literature on the general effect of parental death on child outcomes. See
Corak (2001), Lang and Zagorsky (2001), Gertler, Levine, and Ames (2004), Case, Paxson, and
Ableidinger (2004), Case and Ardington (2006), Chen et al. (2009), and Adda et al. (2011). However, we
are the first to extensively analyze how the effect of a parental death varies with the education level of each
parent and the age of the child when a parent dies. Our findings contribute to the literature on the effect of
parental death by confirming that the average effect is minimal, but that losing a parent is much more
detrimental when the parent is educated and when the child is younger at the time of the loss, and that the
adverse effect of the loss is mitigated by a higher level of education for the surviving parent.
8
  Guryan, Hurst, and Kearney (2008) show that mothers spend roughly double the amount of time on child
care than fathers, and this is true when comparing working mothers to working fathers. However, men
spend a larger proportion of their time with children doing recreational activities.

                                                      6
example, college-educated men in the labor force spend more than twice as much time on
all types of childcare activities than less-educated men. In general, educated parents have
higher opportunity costs of time, and this leads them to reduce their time allocation to
non-market related activities. As a result, we would expect parental education to reduce
their time investments in children as well, but since the opposite occurs, Guryan, Hurst,
and Kearney (2008) suggest that a “possible explanation for the educational gradient in
child care points to the question of whether parental time investments in children are
correlated with increased child human capital, and whether this relationship is stronger
for more-educated parents.” 9

        Our analysis provides evidence that this is the case. 10 In general, examining this
issue empirically is difficult due to the lack of data and because of the endogeneity of
parental time inputs with the characteristics of the child. For example, some parents may
spend a lot of time with their children because they have difficulties doing their
homework, which may lead to a negative correlation between parental time and child
outcomes. Alternatively, parents may enjoy spending time with children who are more
successful from a social and academic perspective, thus leading to a positive correlation
between parental time and child schooling.

        By using three sources of variation in parental time and influence, our analysis
shows that education makes mothers and fathers more effective in producing human
capital in their children. This finding contributes not only to the literature on whether
parental education increases child outcomes, but also sheds light on the mechanisms by
highlighting the importance of the interaction time between the child and each parent.


9
  This issue dates back to the work of Leibowitz (1974a, 1974b, 1977), which showed that child care time
is positively correlated with socioeconomic status, and that the reported time a parent spent with a child
was positively correlated with the IQ of boys but not girls, but was not associated with higher schooling
after controlling for IQ. Coleman (1988) also argued that a parent’s level of education would influence a
child less if the parent does not interact with the child.
10
   Very few papers have even examined this issue empirically. Datcher-Loury (1988) provides evidence
that time investments of well-educated mothers raise child schooling, but time investments by less-
educated mothers appear to be ineffective. However, Datcher-Loury (1988) uses PSID data which does not
have information on the actual time invested in childcare activities. Instead, time spent on childcare is
estimated using information on total housework time, hours worked in the labor force, and number of
children. The analysis in Datcher-Loury (1988) does not address the endogeneity of parental time
investments, and does not consider the time investments of fathers.


                                                    7
These investments in children not only affect a child’s education, but may well have
future payoffs in terms of health, fertility, crime, and marital success. 11




II. Theory

           To organize our empirical strategy and findings, this section outlines a simple
model which produces five empirical implications. The details and proofs of the model
appear in Appendices A and B, available online.                                     We highlight the challenges in
disentangling the mechanisms by which parental education affects their children’s human
capital and how each layer of our analysis can shed light on potential mechanisms.

           The model characterizes parental investments in their children’s human capital, 𝑘𝑘,
during a single period of childhood, which determines the child’s test performance at the
end of childhood (age 18). Parents choose their own consumption, 𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗 , time with the
child, 𝑙𝑙𝑗𝑗 , which are both parent-specific, 𝑗𝑗 ∈ {𝑚𝑚, 𝑓𝑓}; and an amount to invest financially
in the child, 𝑒𝑒. We assume that household utility at time t is a Cobb-Douglas function of
each parent’s consumption, time with the child, and the continuation value of the child’s
human capital, k. 12 Denoting the parameters of the household utility function by 𝛼𝛼’s
yields:

𝑢𝑢�𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚 , 𝑙𝑙𝑓𝑓 , 𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚 , 𝑐𝑐𝑓𝑓 , 𝑘𝑘� = 𝛼𝛼𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ln 𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚 + 𝛼𝛼𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ln 𝑙𝑙𝑓𝑓 + 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ln 𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚 + 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ln 𝑐𝑐𝑓𝑓 + 𝛼𝛼𝑘𝑘 ln 𝑘𝑘.

           Human capital at the end of childhood, k, depends on human capital at birth, 𝑘𝑘0 ,
and is a Cobb-Douglas function of the time spent by each parent with the child (provided
that both parents are alive), the financial investments in the child, 𝑒𝑒, and a total factor
productivity (TFP) term, 𝑅𝑅(𝑠𝑠𝑚𝑚 , 𝑠𝑠𝑓𝑓 ), which depends on each parent’s schooling, 𝑠𝑠𝑚𝑚 and
𝑠𝑠𝑓𝑓 . In our context, TFP represents the quality of parenting conditional on the amount of
time and money invested in the child. We assume TFP to be a non-decreasing function of


11
   For example, Lochner and Moretti (2004) show that schooling reduces criminal activity. In addition,
parental education could affect a child’s human capital by affecting the child’s health (Currie and Moretti
(2003)).
12
    Our model is inspired by that in Del Boca et. al. (2014), but we modify their model in a number of ways
described in the Appendix A.

                                                                  8
each parent’s schooling. Denoting the parameters of the production function by 𝛿𝛿 ’s
yields:

                              𝜃𝜃
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 = 𝑅𝑅�𝑠𝑠𝑚𝑚 , 𝑠𝑠𝑓𝑓 � + 𝑠𝑠𝑚𝑚 𝛿𝛿𝑚𝑚 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚 + 𝑠𝑠𝑓𝑓𝜃𝜃 𝛿𝛿𝑓𝑓 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑓𝑓 + 𝛿𝛿𝑒𝑒 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 + 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑘𝑘0 .

            This formulation allows for a parent’s schooling to affect both TFP (through
𝑅𝑅(𝑠𝑠𝑚𝑚 , 𝑠𝑠𝑓𝑓 )) as well as the marginal returns to time investments (through 𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗𝜃𝜃 ). 13 Genetics
are a confounding factor in many studies of the effect of parental schooling on children’s
human capital. In this setup, genetics are captured by the initial level of human capital,
𝑘𝑘0 , which is allowed to be correlated with 𝑠𝑠𝑚𝑚 and 𝑠𝑠𝑓𝑓 .

            Parents maximize their utility subject to the law of motion for human capital and
the time and budget constraints. The time constraint is:

𝑇𝑇 = 𝑙𝑙𝑗𝑗 + ℎ𝑗𝑗 ,      𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑗𝑗 ∈ {𝑚𝑚, 𝑓𝑓},

where ℎ𝑗𝑗 denotes hours worked by parent j. The budget constraint is given by:

𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚 + 𝑐𝑐𝑓𝑓 + 𝑒𝑒 = 𝑤𝑤𝑚𝑚 ℎ𝑚𝑚 + 𝑤𝑤𝑓𝑓 ℎ𝑓𝑓 + 𝐼𝐼,

where I denotes unearned income and 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 denotes the wage of parent j.

            We first solve for the optimal investments and then for the realized value of the
child’s human capital at the end of childhood. The model shows that a child’s human
capital is increasing in the schooling level of each parent, but the effect of parental
schooling cannot in general be separated from the effect of genetics represented by 𝑘𝑘0 .
This finding highlights one of the primary challenges to the identification of the causal
effect of parental schooling in the literature – namely, if parental schooling is (positively)
related to 𝑘𝑘0 , then a regression of a child’s human capital on parental schooling will be
biased upward (Implication 1).

            This obstacle can be overcome using variation in the timing of parental death
during childhood. Incorporating these elements into the model, we can difference out the


13
 This formulation allows for mother’s schooling to have a greater effect on TFP than father’s schooling as
would arise if mothers are more likely to make decisions that affect children, or vice versa.

                                                                       9
confounding factor of genetics by comparing the relationship between a parent’s
education and a child’s human capital for a parent who dies earlier in the child’s life to
that for a parent who dies at a later stage in the child’s life, or is living when the child
takes the test at age 18 (Implication 2).

       Beyond identifying the causal effect of parental schooling, we seek to distinguish
between the direct effect of parental education on the productivity of time spent with
children versus the indirect effect of parental education on family income.              To
disentangle these mechanisms, we leverage patterns in time allocation and wage rates
between mothers and fathers. Specifically, mothers typically work and earn less (overall
and per hour) and spend more time with children than fathers. Thus, the loss of a mother
will have a larger impact on time spent with the child and a smaller effect on family
income than the loss of a father. Consequently, a finding that the survival of mothers
increases the effect (on children’s human capital) of mother’s schooling more than the
survival of fathers increases the effect of father’s schooling implies that a parent’s
schooling affects children’s human capital through time investments and that the time
channel dominates the expenditure channel (Implication 3).

        The relative importance of the direct and indirect channels can also be
illuminated from how the death of a parent affects the importance of the surviving
parent’s schooling, which we refer to as “substitution.” Intuitively, and as shown by
Fadlon, Itzik and Nielsen [2015], for most households, mothers will increase time
working when a father dies, but when a mother dies, fathers will, if anything, spend less
time working. If time investments are not important, the increase in mother’s work when
the father dies will lead her schooling to become more important, but the death of a
mother will not induce the same increase in the importance of a father’s schooling and
may cause the father’s schooling to become less important.

       Therefore, a finding that the death of a mother leads to more substitution away
from mothers and toward fathers (as measured by the relative importance of their human
capital for children’s human capital) than the death of a father generates away from
fathers and toward mothers, implies that parental schooling affects children’s human
capital through time investments (Implication 4). A finding that later death reduces

                                            10
substitution more when a mother dies relative to when a father dies further indicates the
importance of time investments.

Divorce

       Although the incidence and timing of parental divorce is less likely to be
exogenous than parental death, divorce is far more common and has similarities to
paternal death in that mothers typically retain custody in most societies. Given this
institutional setup, our model’s predictions and results regarding paternal death are also
applicable to families experiencing parental divorce. As such, our empirical analysis of
parental divorce serves as a robustness check for our findings regarding paternal death.

Family Size

       Information about the mechanisms that connect parental schooling to children’s
human capital can also be obtained from variation across households of different sizes.
Intuitively, in the absence of an effect of time on children’s human capital, increases in
family size dilute the effects of parental schooling on children’s human capital because
financial investments are spread across more children. Moreover, parents in larger
families typically display a stronger degree of specialization in terms of their time
allocation to child rearing, and therefore, this variation produces testable implications for
how a child’s human capital depends on the schooling level of each parent. The model
shows that if time investments are important, a mother’s schooling will become more
important for the child’s human capital relative to the father’s schooling if mothers
increase their time with children relative to fathers in larger families. The reverse is true
if the relationship between parental and child human capital is due to parental income
(Implication 5). Therefore, variation in household size allows us to shed light on the
importance of the direct effect of parental time versus the indirect channel of parental
resources in the determination of the positive relationship between parent and child
human capital.

III. Data

        Our empirical analysis uses data from the official Population Registry of Israel
and the Ministry of Education. Every citizen of Israel has a record in the Registry with
his or her name, identity number, immigrant status, date of birth, date of death, marital
status, and the identity number of each parent. This information was used to ascertain the
number of siblings for each person and their birth order.

        These demographic variables were matched to the student-level data provided by
the Ministry of Education, which contain information on each student’s performance on
the various subjects (math, Hebrew, English, bible studies, science, etc.) which compose
the matriculation exam taken during the 11th and 12th grade. We received this data for all
high school students scheduled to graduate between 1992 and 2009 (born between 1974
and 1991), as well as information on each student’s gender, immigrant status, education
levels of both parents, and an indicator for the specific high school attended (without
revealing the name or location of the school). We restricted the sample to the majority
population of native-born Jews who attended secular public schools.

        Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the analysis of parental death.
(Appendix Tables A1 and A2, available online, provide the breakdown of parental death
by causes of death and by age of the child.) The first two columns present the sample
used in our analysis of maternal loss, by comparing the means of the variables for those
that did not lose a mother by the age of 18 to those that did. It is worth noting the size of
the samples used in our analysis – the data contain 6,173 children who lost a mother by
the age of 18 and 616,843 children who did not lose either parent before age 18 (this
group includes children who will be studied in the divorce analysis and family size
analysis). Table 1 shows that the passing rate of the matriculation exam is only 60% for
those who did not lose a parent, and slightly lower for those that lost a mother (54%).
These numbers show that passing the matriculation exam is an important milestone which
has a lot of variation.

        The first two columns in Table 1 present evidence that losing a mother is not an
exogenous event, since it appears to be correlated with family background characteristics.


                                             12
Families that suffered a maternal loss have lower education levels for both parents and
lower income levels. (To account for temporary fluctuations in wage income, we
measured each parent’s income with their estimated individual fixed-effect from a typical
Mincer-like regression of log income on education, age, and person fixed-effects using
wage data from 1988-1990.) The differences in parental characteristics are not dramatic,
but they could possibly explain why children who lost a mother had a lower matriculation
rate, without there being any causal effect of the death on the child’s performance.
However, our focus is not to explain this difference, but rather to examine how the
relationship between parental and child schooling changes when a parent dies, and how
this varies with the age of the child when the parent died.

       The last two columns of Table 1 present the means for the samples used in our
analysis of paternal death. Again, the samples are large. Roughly three times as many
children lose a father as lose a mother, which stems from the fact that fathers tend to be
older than mothers, and women tend to live longer than men. However, losing a father
seems to be less random than losing a mother. The difference in means between the
sample that lost a mother and those that did not, is smaller than the difference for paternal
deaths. However, as noted above, our strategy utilizes not only information on those that
lost a parent versus those that did not, but also variation within those that lost a parent
based on the age of the child at the time of parental death.

       Table 2 presents descriptive regressions for children who did not experience
parental death. A dummy variable for the student passing the matriculation exam by the
end of 12th grade is regressed using OLS on our core set of control variables: education
levels of both parents, ages of both parents when the child was born, number of siblings,
gender, cohort fixed-effects, and birth order. The first two columns show that entering
the education level of one parent but not the other yields coefficients that are very
significant, but most likely biased due to assortative matching in the marriage market.
This can be seen by the reduction, by almost a half, in the coefficient on either parent’s
education when the education levels of both parents are included in the third column.
Behrman and Rosenzweig (2002) found a similar pattern using data from the United
States, which shows that our Israeli data is similar to other studies.


                                              13
       Columns (4) and (5) in Table 2 show that estimates on parental education levels
are reduced in size, but still significant after controlling for school fixed-effects and for
the socioeconomic index of the locality. The next three columns show similar results for
the earnings of both parents – the wage income fixed-effect for both parents is positive
and highly significant, even after controlling for school fixed-effects and socioeconomic
status. The last two columns include parental education and income levels in the same
specification, and show that the effect of parental education is less sensitive to the
inclusion of parental wages than vice versa.

       Table 3 presents a preliminary analysis of parental death. The left panel shows
estimates for the children that did not experience parental death, the middle panel uses a
sample of those that suffered maternal loss, and the right panel uses a sample of those
who suffered paternal loss. A striking pattern emerges when comparing the coefficients
across the three panels. For individuals that lost a mother before the age of 18, the
estimated coefficient on the mother’s education is about 50 percent smaller than the same
specification for the sample that did not suffer a parental death. At the same time, the
estimated coefficient on the father’s education is about 10 percent larger.          Similar
patterns are found for parental income.

       Comparing the results for those that lost a father to those that did not lose either
parent produces the opposite pattern. The coefficient on the mother’s education increases
while the coefficient on the father’s education declines (by close to 50%). The death of a
parent apparently reduces the importance of that parent’s education level, while
increasing the importance of the surviving parent’s education. This pattern demonstrates
one of the main points of the paper – the effect of a parent’s education level on a child’s
schooling outcome depends on whether the child lived with that parent or not. This
finding implies that the transmission of human capital from parents to children is not
entirely genetic, and that children learn more from an educated parent. The rest of the
paper investigates these patterns more extensively and seeks to disentangle underlying
mechanisms.




                                               14
IV. Analyzing Maternal Deaths

       The first column in Table 4 uses a sample of all individuals that did not lose a
father and includes a dummy for losing a mother, a dummy for losing a mother before the
age of 18, and interactions between losing a mother before 18 with the education level of
each parent.    These interaction coefficients indicate that the effect of a mother’s
education declines significantly if the child suffered a maternal death before the age of
18, and the effect of the father’s education increases, but not significantly. This finding is
robust, and increases in size, when we control for school fixed-effects and the local
socioeconomic index. Column (4) interacts the dummy for losing a mother before 18
with the difference in the education levels of both parents, and shows that the mother’s
education becomes significantly less important relative to the father’s when a mother dies
before the child is 18 (the “substitution” process described in the theory section). These
findings show that losing an educated mother is more costly than losing a less-educated
mother, and that the effect of maternal education on her child’s schooling seems to
depend on whether she was around during her child’s youth.

       The right panel of Table 4 examines whether the importance of both parental
education levels varies with the actual number of years spent with the mother before she
dies. The estimates indicate that every year spent with the mother increases the influence
of a mother’s education on her child’s performance, but decreases the effect of the
father’s education. This analysis shows that a mother’s education becomes less important
relative to the father’s when a mother dies before the child is 18, but this pattern is
attenuated by the child spending more years with both parents before the mother dies (i.e.
less/more substitution if the mother dies later/earlier in life). Interestingly, the size of the
coefficients indicate that the effect of a mother’s education is essentially zero if she dies
right after the child is born (the coefficient in column (5) on the direct effect of losing a
mother is −0.0287 compared to the 0.0260 coefficient for all individuals), but every
additional year of life for the mother adds 0.0021 to the effect of her education on the
child’s passing rate. In contrast, the effect of the father’s education on the child’s passing
rate increases from 0.0262 to 0.0428 (0.0262 + 0.0166) if the mother dies when the child
is born, but every additional year that the mother lives reduces significantly the effect of


                                              15
the father’s education by 0.0013.            In other words, if the mother dies when the child is
born, her education has no effect on the child while the father’s education has a large
effect, but the effect of each parent moves towards one another as the child spends more
time with both of them rather than just the father.

         All of the findings in Table 4 are robust to controlling for school fixed-effects and
the local socioeconomic index. This robustness is notable because Table 2 showed that a
naive analysis which uses a sample of children that did not suffer a parental loss produces
coefficients on parental education that are sensitive to whether school fixed-effects are
included in the specification or not. In contrast, the interaction coefficients of interest in
Table 4 are not sensitive to the inclusion of school fixed-effects, which lends credence to
the causal interpretation of our estimates.

         Appendix Table A3 investigates whether the results in Table 4 are robust to the
inclusion of parental income variables in the specification. The importance of the
mother’s education overall and relative to the father’s education increases for each year
that the mother survives even with parental income variables and their interactions with
the incidence and timing of maternal death. Moreover, the interaction between the timing
of a mother’s death and the parental income variables are consistently insignificant. 14

         We now extend our analysis of maternal loss in several directions. First, we
examine the issue of remarriage by the surviving parent. When a mother dies before the

14
   The upper panel of Appendix Table A3 specifies interactions between each parent’s education or wage
level with the incidence of mother loss, as well as the timing of the loss. The bottom panel examines how
maternal loss and its timing affect the importance of the mother’s education or income level relative to the
father’s. We measured each parent’s income with their individual fixed-effect from a Mincer-like wage
using data from 1988-1990. Therefore, including parental income requires us to condition our sample on
those that did not lose a mother or father before 1991. The first two columns show that there is little change
when this sample restriction is made for the specification that does not include interactions for the timing of
maternal death. The next two columns show that a mother’s education or income become less important if
she dies before the child turns 18, while the father’s education or income becomes more important.
However, only one of the four coefficients is significant. Including parental education and income in the
same specification in column (4) yields stronger results for parental income, but the opposite is true when
interactions with the timing of death are included in column (7). This specification shows that a mother’s
education becomes significantly less important relative to the father’s education if she dies before the child
is 18, but every year she lives increases the relative importance of her education. This result is not
significant using parental income in column (7). Moreover, the addition of controls for parental income
and the interactions have no effect on the main results for parental education (columns (5) or (6) versus (7),
or (12) versus (14)). The right panel reports similar results in which children are excluded if either parent
had zero income.

                                                      16
child reaches 18 years old, almost 13 percent of the fathers remarried before the child
reached the age of 18. To see how this might affect our results, we restrict the sample to
cases where the father did not remarry in column (2) in Table 5.                This restriction does
not reduce the size or significance of our main coefficients of interest. The interaction
between the child’s age when the mother died and maternal education actually increases
from 0.0015 to 0.0018, while the interaction with paternal education remains at −0.0009.
This pattern suggests that the phenomenon of remarriage, if anything, biases our main
results towards zero. This finding is consistent with the idea that a mother who dies can
be at least partially replaced with a second wife, and therefore, the negative effect of
losing a mother can be mitigated by spending time with the new wife. 15 If the father does
not remarry, the effect is more acute, since no one else can compensate for the loss of
time spent with the mother other than the father.

        Table 5 also shows how the results differ between boys and girls. Columns (3)
and (4) show that the loss of a mother has an impact on both boys and girls (see the
coefficients on the interactions between “mother died when child < 18” with each
parent’s education level). However, the results are more significant and dramatically
larger for girls versus boys. For example, the interaction of the child’s age at maternal
death with maternal schooling is 0.0010 for boys and 0.0022 for girls. The analogous
interaction for paternal education is -0.0003 for boys and -0.0016 for girls.                     These
findings suggest that boys and girls are negatively affected by maternal loss, but the
effect for girls depends much more on the education levels of both parents.

        The idea that girls respond more to variation in their environments is supported by
recent evidence. Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007) found that being in a safer
neighborhood had beneficial effects on education, risky behaviour, and health for girls,
but not for boys. Gould, Lavy, and Paserman (2011) found that girls are affected more
than boys by the early childhood environment over the course of their lifetime across an
array of social and economic outcomes. Therefore, our results contribute to the growing



15
    Our data contains only an indication that the surviving parent’s marital status was changed after the
spouse died. If the status did change, this indicates that the surviving spouse did re-marry during the
relevant time period. But, we do not have information on the new spouse.

                                                   17
literature on the differences in the way boys and girls are influenced by their
environment.

       The estimates in Table 5 are also clearly much stronger for children who lost a
less-educated mother (less than 12 years of schooling) versus a mother with at least a
high school degree. As noted above, one of the explanations for the variation in the
findings of the existing literature is based on the idea that different identification
strategies are using different parts of the parental education distribution. Our findings are
consistent with the larger effects in the literature with instrument variables that shock the
lower end of the parental education distribution versus the weaker effects found in the
“adoptions” studies that shock the upper tail of the parental education distribution. Also,
our findings support the idea that basic knowledge in parents is the critical factor in terms
of imparting the human capital to children necessary to pass a critical, but minimal level
of academic achievement like the matriculation exam. If we examined an outcome for a
more advanced level of education (such as receiving a BA degree or more), it is possible
that higher levels of parental education could play a larger role.

       The results in Table 5 are also similar for families that lost a mother that was the
better educated parent versus situations where she was less educated than the father. The
similarity of the results across these two distinct groups provides evidence against the
idea that our main results are coming from cases where the mother was the more
dominant decision maker within the household – assuming that mothers who are better
educated than fathers are likely to have greater bargaining power and a greater role in
household decision-making. It also suggests that the effects are not being driven by
parental income in the sense that more educated mothers tend to have higher earnings
relative to their husbands than other mothers. The last two columns show that the effects
are larger for children with two or fewer siblings than children with more siblings.

       Appendix Table A4 examines the different components of the matriculation
exam: math, Hebrew (the verbal section since Hebrew is the native language), Bible
Studies, and English. The results for the overall matriculation rate are very similar to
those obtained for receiving a score on Hebrew above 70, and smaller and less significant
for the other components of the matriculation exam. In addition, the results are often

                                             18
similar to those obtained with a cutoff of 70 and 80, but they appear to be stronger in size
and significance using the lower cutoff level. This pattern again suggests that the effect
is coming more from the marginal students on the brink of failing the exam, who are
more likely to come from the lower part of the parental education distribution, rather than
the higher ability students not being able to achieve a high score due to the loss of their
mother.

       A placebo analysis is conducted in Table 6, which uses a sample of individuals
who lost a mother after the matriculation exam is completed at the end of high school. If
the results are similar for a sample of individuals whose passing rate would be unlikely to
be influenced by the future death of their mother, this pattern would suggest that our
previous results are likely due to the selection of individuals based on unmeasured
characteristics which are correlated with our variables of interest, rather than representing
a causal relationship.

       However, the results in Table 6 are markedly different from those in the previous
tables. The interaction coefficients between each parent’s education level and the age of
the child when the mother died are not significant, and are the opposite signs of those in
Table 4. These findings show that our main results regarding those that lost a parent
before the test was taken are not due to the non-random selection of families that suffer a
maternal death, and thus lend strong support to the causal interpretation of the results.




V. Analyzing Paternal Deaths

       This section analyzes the effect of parental education using paternal deaths
instead of maternal deaths. This analysis has two objectives. The first is to probe the
robustness of the main findings in the previous section, which showed that the
importance of a parent’s education in determining the child’s education outcome depends
on how much time the child spends with that parent alone versus both parents. The
second objective, as discussed in the theory section, is to compare the effects of losing a
father to those of losing a mother in order to shed light on underlying mechanisms.



                                             19
        Table 7 shows that losing a father affects the relationship between the child’s
outcomes and the education levels of both parents. This can be seen by the positive and
significant interaction between the mother’s education with losing a father before the age
of 18, and the significantly negative coefficient on a similar interaction with the father’s
education. Similar to the previous section, the table reveals that losing an educated
parent hurts the child more, but the loss can be mitigated by higher levels of education for
the surviving parent.

        Table 7 (column 5) also shows that every year spent with the father increases the
value of his education by 0.0006, compared to a negative coefficient on the interaction
with mother’s education of -0.0002. Although the latter estimate is not significant, there
is a positive and significant direct effect of the mother’s education when the father dies
below the age of 18. That is, a father’s death increases the importance of the mother’s
education, but it does not significantly differ across the age level of the child at the time
of paternal loss.

        Overall, the coefficients of interest are the mirror image of each other in terms of
their sign relative to the analysis of maternal death. This is what we would expect if the
estimates are picking up a causal effect, since in both cases where either the mother or
father died, the estimates are showing that the time spent with each parent increases the
importance of that parent’s education in the formation of human capital in their children.
However, this is not what we would expect if the estimates are spuriously picking up
unmeasured characteristics of the household and environment. Families that suffer a
maternal death are similar to those that suffered a paternal death according to their
observed characteristics – they both tend to be less educated and have lower income than
the general population. If their unobserved characteristics are similar as well, this should
generate similar patterns regardless of whether the mother or the father died. Our finding
that the coefficients completely reverse sign provides strong evidence that the results are
driven by the child’s interaction time with each parent, and not by a correlation between
parental schooling and unmeasured characteristics of the childhood environment.

        However, although the coefficients of interest reverse sign for parental death
versus maternal death, the magnitudes are much larger for maternal death. This can be

                                             20
seen by comparing the results for column (8) in Table 4 for maternal death to the same
column in Table 7 for paternal death. Losing a mother before the age of 18 in Table 4
decreases the effect of mother’s education relative to father’s education by -0.0195, while
losing a father increases the mother’s education relative to the father by 0.0100. Every
year spent with the mother before she dies increases the relative importance of the
mother’s education by 0.0014, while every year with the father before he dies decreases
the relative importance of the mother’s education by -0.004. Both coefficients of interest
are at least twice the size for maternal death relative to paternal death, albeit with the
expected opposite signs.

         As discussed in the theory section, this pattern is inconsistent with our main
results being driven by the indirect income channel rather than the direct effect of
parental human capital on a child’s outcome. Relative to mothers, fathers spend more
time working and less time with their children. Therefore, if the effect of parental
income on children is driving our results, we should expect the loss of a father’s income
to have a stronger effect on the child than the loss of a mother. Our findings indicate the
opposite – a child’s outcome is more sensitive to the loss or presence of the mother rather
than the father.   Appendix Table A5 shows that our main results are robust to the
inclusion of parental income variables and their interactions with the time of the father’s
death.

         Table 8 examines whether the findings vary across different types of families.
There is little change after restricting the sample to mothers who do not remarry. Similar
to the maternal loss analysis, the results are stronger for girls versus boys and for families
where the father is less educated (less than 12 years of schooling) versus more educated
(at least a high school degree). The findings do not seem to depend on whether the father
was more or less educated than the mother, but are stronger for smaller families.
Appendix Table A6 shows that the interactions coefficients of interest for the Hebrew
component of the matriculation exam are similar to the overall score, although the
findings for the other components are more significant than those found in the analysis of
maternal loss.



                                             21
        Table 6 performs a placebo analysis by using a sample of individuals who
suffered a paternal death, but at an age where it should have no effect on their
matriculation exam (after 12th grade). The interaction of the child’s age when the father
died with the father’s education is not significant, and the analogous interaction with the
mother’s education is also insignificant. These findings lend further support to the causal
nature of our estimates regarding those that lost a father below the age of 18.



VI. Divorce

       A parental death represents a tragic case where there is a dramatic shift in parental
influence. Divorce also shifts parental influence, albeit less extremely, usually by giving
custody to the mother. This section investigates the robustness of our findings to the
more common occurrence of parental divorce.

       Table 9 uses a sample of children that did not suffer a parental death before age
18, and examines how each parent’s education level affects the child’s matriculation
outcome and how this interacts with parental divorce. The first column shows the
relationship between parental schooling and the matriculation exam passing rate for all
children who do not experience parental death, and the next two columns split the sample
into those that experienced parental divorce before the age of 18 versus those that did not.
A mother’s education is a larger factor for the matriculation of children whose parents
divorced before they turned 18, while the father’s education is smaller in magnitude.
Consistent with our theoretical predictions, these findings are similar to the parental death
analysis – the education of the parent with greater influence is more important relative to
the education of the other parent.

       Column (4) of Table 9 shows that these patterns are statistically significant, while
the next two columns show that this finding is robust to controlling for school fixed-
effects and the local socioeconomic index. Column (7) leverages variation in the timing
of divorce, and shows that the mother’s education becomes more important than the
father’s in divorced families, but the effect gets smaller if the divorce occurs later in



                                             22
childhood. The latter effect is similar to the parental death results, but is not statistically
significant.

        The right panel investigates whether these patterns differ across various groups.
Again, the findings are stronger for girls relative to boys and when we use the lower half
of the parental education distribution (mothers who are not high school graduates). The
only slight difference with the parental death results is that we find stronger results for
children whose mother is more or equally educated than the father, as opposed to mothers
who are less educated than the father. This pattern could be due to children spending
more time with the father when he is more educated than the mother (a father’s time with
children is in general positively correlated his education), and/or perhaps with more
custodial power. However, the overall pattern of the results across different subgroups is
remarkably similar to the parental death findings, thus reinforcing the causal
interpretation and the generalizability of those results.




VII. Family Size

        We have provided a variety of evidence that the effect of a parent’s education on
a child’s schooling outcome operates through a direct time channel, not an indirect
income channel. This section exploits variation in family size to provide additional
evidence. In particular, our model shows that if parental education does not operate
through time, the effects of parental education should be declining in family size because
financial investments must be spread across more children. In addition, our model
predicts that mother’s education becomes more important relative to father’s education as
family size increases if parental time is important and if mother’s time with children
increases in family size relative to father’s time.

        Table 10 analyzes the effect of parental education on the child’s matriculation
exam passing rate, and how this varies with family size. The first two columns split the
sample of children (who experienced no divorce or death before the age of 18) into those
with fewer (less than or equal to 2) versus more (greater than 2) siblings. The estimated
effect for maternal schooling increases from 0.024 to 0.031, while the effect for father’s

                                              23
schooling increases slightly (increasing from 0.025 to 0.026).          Mother’s education
becomes more important in larger families, and this finding is statistically significant, as
seen in the remaining columns. In particular, the third column pools all children together,
and shows that each additional child increases the effect of mother’s schooling by 0.0038,
in contrast to an increase in 0.0010 for father’s schooling. Both findings are statistically
significant, and the bottom panel shows that the relative effect of mother’s education
versus father’s education increases significantly as well. These findings are robust to the
inclusion of controls for the socioeconomic index of the locality, log total family income,
and school fixed-effects. As our model shows, the finding that the education of both
parents becomes more important in larger families is inconsistent with financial
investments being the mechanism linking parental education to children’s outcomes. The
model also showed that the larger increase in maternal education lends further evidence
against the parental income mechanism if mothers specialize more in care-giving relative
to fathers in larger families.

        Table 10 also shows how these results differ across subgroups of the population.
The results are larger for girls relative to boys, and for children with mothers on the lower
end of the parental education distribution (less than a high school graduate) rather than
from the upper portion of the distribution. These patterns are strikingly similar to our
results using variation in parental influence due to death and divorce. This similarity
supports the external validity of those results to a much wider segment of the population,
and lends support to the idea that our findings across all segments of the population are
due largely to the role of parental time rather than income.

        Our main source of data does not include information on time use, so in order to
test the hypothesis of greater specialization of parental roles in larger families, we use the
Israel Time Budget Survey 1991/1992 to analyze a similar sample from the same time
period. Using a sample of married parents below the age of 60 who have at least one
child, we examine various categories of time use in Table 11. The first two columns
show that females (mothers) are less likely to work, and this gets weaker if the female is
more educated. An increasing number of kids reduces the chances that either parent
works, with no significant difference between mothers and fathers. The third column


                                             24
shows that an increasing number of children has no effect on time with children by men,
but has a positive impact on a woman’s time with children. Similar to the findings in the
US and other countries, column three shows that education increases time with children
for both parents, although more so for women.

       The right panel of Table 11 repeats the analysis but includes additional
interactions between education, the number of children, and gender. These interactions
are insignificant across all specifications. Thus, the finding that mothers spend more time
with children relative to fathers when the number of children increase (from column 3)
holds across parental education levels.

       Table 12 analyzes the employment status of mothers in our main data set from the
Ministry of Education. The first column uses the mothers of all the children in our data
set that did not experience a parental divorce or death, and the other columns restrict the
sample to various cohorts defined by the child’s year of birth. The table shows that
educated mothers are more likely to work.              Labor force participation for mothers
decreases in larger families, and this pattern does not depend on the relative education
levels of each parent.

       The findings in Tables 11 and 12 show that more children increase the amount of
time spent with children by mothers relative to fathers, with some evidence suggesting a
decrease in labor force participation for mothers as well. These patterns are similar
across the education levels of both parents, which indicates a general increase in the
specialization of parental roles in larger families.

       Based on the evidence in previous tables that mothers in larger families spend
more time with children relative to fathers, but do not increase their labor force
participation, the findings in Table 10 are not consistent with the model when parental
schooling affects a child’s human capital solely through income, but are consistent with a
time channel. Mothers in larger families are not providing more income to the family,
but they are investing more time with children.            Overall, these results support the
interpretation that the importance of parental schooling on child outcomes depends on the
degree of parental time and influence.

VIII. Conclusion

        This paper uses variation in parental involvement to identify the causal impact of
parental education on the development of their children’s human capital. We use three
distinct samples to analyze three different sources of variation in parental influence:
parental death, parental divorce, and the higher degree of specialization of parental roles
in larger families.

        In all three analyses, we find that a parent’s education becomes a more significant
determinant of a child’s human capital when that parent’s interaction time with the child
increases. Specifically, we show that a mother’s death reduces the importance of her
education in producing human capital in her children, but this reduction is less severe if
the child was older at the time of her death. In contrast, the father’s education increases
in importance when the mother dies, but by a lesser amount if the child was older when
the mother died. Strikingly, the same patterns exist in reverse when the father dies, but
the magnitudes are smaller – which our model shows is inconsistent with our main results
being driven by parental income rather than parental education.

        Further, we find that a mother’s education becomes more important relative to the
father when parents get divorced, and also in larger families. Since mothers in larger
families spend more time with kids relative to fathers, but do not increase their labor
supply, this pattern is once again inconsistent with our findings being driven by a
dominant role for parental income rather than the quality of parenting as proxied by
parental education.

        Although we use a completely different empirical strategy, our results are
consistent with recent evidence that parental education plays an important role on child
test scores and other behaviors. In addition, our findings help reconcile the variation in
results across recent studies. Holmlund, Lindahl, and Plug (2011) suggest that different
methods produce different results because each method is using variation in a different
part of the parental education distribution. Our results indicate that this is indeed the case
– we find much stronger effects of parental education in the lower part of the parental

                                             26
education distribution (less than 12 years of schooling) than the upper part. In addition,
we find that parental schooling has a bigger effect on children who are near the
borderline of passing the matriculation exam relative to those that are well above the
passing threshold.

       Across all three sources of variation of parental influence, we find stronger results
for girls versus boys and for parents coming from the lower end of the parental education
distribution. The similarity of the results across these distinct samples, which collectively
cover the entire population, reinforce the causal interpretation of the results and also
support the generalizability of these findings.

       Guryan, Hurst, and Kearney (2008) show that educated parents spend more time
with their children despite the higher opportunity cost of time. Our findings suggest that
educated parents are simply more productive in developing the human capital of their
children. This result should yield important implications in terms of understanding how
married couples allocate their time across various activities, how this is changing over
time, and how these trends might be affecting the outcomes of children.

Notes: Standard errors appear in parentheses. Significance levels are indicated by one, two, or three stars which represent 10 percent, 5 percent, and 1 percent levels,
respectively. All regressions are performed using OLS and include controls for mother's age at the time of the child's birth, father's age at the time of the child's birth, gender,
number of siblings, birth order, and dummy variables for each cohort year. The sample is restricted to children that did not lose a father up to the age of 18. The first three columns
include a dummy variable for losing a mother, a dummy for losing a mother before the age of 18, and interactions between losing a mother before 18 with the education level of each
parent. The fourth column includes an interaction between the difference in each parent's education with losing a mother before age 18, instead of interactions with each parent's
education. The right panel includes interactions between losing a mother before 18, each parent's education, and the age of the child when the mother died before the age of 18.

Notes: The sample is restricted to individuals who lost a mother after the age of 18 (left panel) or lost a father after the age
of 18 (right panel). Standard errors appear in parentheses. Significance levels are indicated by one, two, or three stars
which represent 10 percent, 5 percent, and 1 percent levels, respectively. All regressions are performed using OLS and
include controls for mother's age at the time of the child's birth, father's age at the time of the child's birth, gender, number of
siblings, birth order, and dummy variables for each cohort year. All specifications also control for socioeconomic status of
the locality, a dummy for whether the mother died before age 18, age mother died, education of the mother, and education
of the father.

respectively. All regressions are performed using OLS and include controls for mother's age at the time of the child's birth, father's age at the time of the child's birth, gender,
number of siblings, birth order, and dummy variables for each cohort year. The sample is restricted to children that did not lose a mother up to the age of 18. The first three
columns include a dummy variable for losing a father, a dummy for losing a father before the age of 18, and interactions between losing a father before 18 with the education
level of each parent. The fourth column includes an interaction between the difference in each parent's education with losing a father before age 18, instead of interactions with
each parent's education. The right panel includes interactions between losing a father before 18, each parent's education, and the age of the child when the father died before
the age of 18.

Notes: For every column, the upper and lower panels represent separate regressions. The sample is restricted to individuals who lost a father. Standard errors appear in
parentheses. Significance levels are indicated by one, two, or three stars which represent 10 percent, 5 percent, and 1 percent levels, respectively. All regressions are performed
using OLS and include controls for mother's age at the time of the child's birth, father's age at the time of the child's birth, gender, number of siblings, birth order, and dummy variables
for each cohort year. All specifications also control for socioeconomic status of the locality, a dummy for whether the parent died before age 18, age parent died, education of the
mother, and education of the father.

Notes: For every column, the upper and lower panels represent separate regressions. The sample is restricted to individuals who did not lose a parent and did not have divorced parents. Significance levels are indicated by one, two, or
three stars which represent 10 percent, 5 percent, and 1 percent levels, respectively. All regressions are performed using OLS and include controls for mother's age at the time of the child's birth, father's age at the time of the child's birth,
gender, number of siblings, birth order, and dummy variables for each cohort year.

Notes: For every column, the upper and lower panels represent separate regressions. The mean of the dependent variable in the upper panel of column 1 is 0.4853. The sample is restricted to individuals
who did not lose a parent and did not have divorced parents. Significance levels are indicated by one, two, or three stars which represent 10 percent, 5 percent, and 1 percent levels, respectively. All
regressions are performed using OLS and include controls for mother's year of birth, mother's age at the time of the child's birth, father's age at the time of the child's birth, gender, number of siblings, birth
order, and dummy variables for each cohort year.
