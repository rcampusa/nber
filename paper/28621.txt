                                         ABSTRACT

We evaluate the impact of a nationwide public health intervention on deaths from sudden infant
death syndrome (SIDS), using population data from Denmark in a regression discontinuity
research design. The information campaign­implemented primarily through a universal nurse
home visiting program­reduced infant mortality by 17.6 percent and saved between 11.5-14.5
lives over 10,000 births. The estimated effect sizes are 11-14 times larger among low birthweight
and preterm infants relative to the overall population. Improvement in infant mortality is
concentrated among those with lower socio-economic status and with limited access to health
information, thereby reducing health inequities at birth in Denmark.

1    Introduction
Medical innovations and public health achievements pioneered during the 20                                century led to
an increase in life expectancy from 32 to over 66 years, an improvement unprecedented in human
history. Decline in infant mortality accounts for the largest share in explaining the rise in longevity,
brought about by filtering and chlorinating water supplies, sanitation systems, mass vaccination,
sulfanilamides and antibiotics, improvements in food safety and nutrition, greater access to health
services, and advances in medical technology (Alsan and Goldin 2019; Anderson et al. 2020b, 2021;
Cutler et al. 2006; Cutler and Miller 2005; Horton and Steckel 2013; Meckel 1998; Miller and Goldman
2011; Ward and Warren 2006). Equally important have been the diffusion of knowledge gained
from these scientific advancements to mass populations and adoption of behaviors promoting
infant health, which usually requires well-coordinated, large scale government led campaigns.
    Acknowledging the crucial role of increased medical knowledge in obstetrics and pediatrics in
reducing infant mortality, developed countries established public health infrastructures to diffuse
practical knowledge to new parents and provide basic post-natal health services. One particular
strategy to achieve these goals is the use of home visiting programs, in which public health nurses
and social workers visit new parents to collect anthropometric measurements, observe the overall
health of the infant, provide basic medical services, supervise the infant's nutrition, and inform
the parents about the most recent medical guidelines on caregiving (Kamerman and Kahn 1993;
Buus 2001). Public health nurse home visits aim to improve population health by establishing
a care system around newborns, and have long been an integral part of the national healthcare
system in Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway,
and Sweden.
    In this study, we estimate the impact of government-directed and sponsored efforts to com-
municate newly emerged medical knowledge on infant mortality. We focus on Denmark's Home
Visiting Program, which served as the main public health policy tool to change the prone sleeping
position of newborns in an effort to reduce sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) deaths. Estab-
lished in 1937, the program reached almost all newborn children by 1962 and involved multiple
home visits in the first year after birth, with more regular visits in the first few weeks after birth. At
its initial stages, visiting public health nurses routinely collected anthropometric measurements,
provided physical examination, and, if necessary, physician referral, and informed parents about
the pediatric guidelines on infant nutrition and child care (Matthiessen 1967). The program has
evolved over time, but its core services remain the same, i.e. informing parents about childcare
guidelines, which are routinely updated with new medical evidence. One such important update
occurred in December 1991, with a drastic change in the recommended sleeping position for infants
    https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy.
    The causal estimates that reflect the contribution of at-scale diffusion of scientific knowledge such as the germ theory
of disease have been difficult to document due to lack of data, see Cutler et al. (2006); Deaton (2006) for a summary of
historical determinants of mortality.

from "on the stomach" to "on the back or the side", which was shown in case control studies to be
highly effective in mitigating the SIDS risk (Fleming et al. 1990; Mitchell et al. 1991; Ponsonby et
al. 1993; Dwyer et al. 1995). Postnatal home visits by public health nurses provided an ideal tool
to communicate the updated guidelines due to its capacity to reach all new parents and build a
trust-based relationship through repeated visits of the same nurse.
    We use a regression discontinuity design that involves comparing all-cause and cause-specific
mortality risk for monthly birth cohorts who were born just before and after the unanticipated
change in government recommendation and the subsequent information campaign to change
parental practices concerning the sleep position of their newborns. Although exact causes are
unknown, the majority of SIDS deaths occur before the age of 4 months, which provides an
opportunity to observe the immediate impact of changing sleeping environment on infant health
(American Academy of Pediatrics 2011).
    We show that the nationwide public health intervention was highly effective in reducing infant
mortality, especially among infants with poor baseline health and lower socioeconomic status.
Our estimates suggest that the campaign reduced infant mortality rate by 17.6 percent, which can
explain around one quarter of the overall decrease in infant mortality over the past 40 years in
Denmark. Decrease in deaths from SIDS and unknown causes fully account for the overall drop
in infant mortality. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in effect sizes by subgroups.
For example, we estimate that the intervention reduced infant mortality for low birthweight and
preterm children by 1.5 and 1.8 percentage points, which is 11 and 14 times larger than its impact on
the overall population, respectively. Furthermore, the intervention was most effective in improving
the health of infants whose mothers are immigrants or have lower education levels. These results
underscore the effective role that an information-based, large scale public health intervention can
play in narrowing early life health disparities.
    Our analysis contributes to two strands of literature. First is the literature investigating the
impact of public information campaigns on health behaviors. These investigations focus on the
role of information diffusion on influencing the public opinion and health behavior, such as energy
conservation, immunization, breastfeeding, dietary habits, smoking and alcohol consumption, etc.
(Weiss and Tschirhart 1994; Olds et al. 2007). However, most of the existing evidence come from
contexts in which the campaigns are targeted at specific groups, are implemented on a small scale
or at subnational levels. Second, we contribute to the literature investigating the interplay among
public health interventions, mortality transition, and health inequalities in high income countries
(Cutler and Miller 2005; Cutler et al. 2006; Watson 2006; Wüst 2012; Moehling and Thomasson 2014;
Komisarow 2017; Alsan and Goldin 2019; Anderson et al. 2019; Feigenbaum et al. 2019; Anderson
et al. 2020a).
    While prior literature documents the declines in SIDS deaths through public health policy
campaigns with varying success in Scandinavia and other high income countries, these analyses
   A more detailed description of the Home Visiting Program is provided in Appendix A.1.

                                                       3
are typically based on crude trend evaluations and case control studies relying on small samples
(Wennergren et al. 1997; Hauck and Tanabe 2008; MacDorman et al. 2013; Goldstein et al. 2016).
As we show in the empirical section, changing measurement error in SIDS classification over
time and the contemporaneous declining trends in infant mortality cannot be accounted for by
a descriptive investigation. Thus, the inferences drawn from these studies reflect an incomplete
picture of the true effect of specific interventions on infant survival. Our research design overcomes
these challenges by isolating the impact of a specific nationwide information campaign within a
narrow time frame and using outcomes that are not prone to typical diagnostic challenges to
classifying SIDS (Hauck and O Tanabe 2010; Hauck and Tanabe 2008). Perhaps more importantly,
we leverage population-level data to precisely estimate the impact of an at-scale intervention
on vulnerable subpopulations, which shows evidence of substantial benefits in targeting those
with poor baseline health, lower socioeconomic status, and thus limited access to useful medical
information. Countries with constrained resources or unequal access to health knowledge might
benefit from this type of targeted interventions to reduce infant mortality among susceptible
populations and improve early life health disparities. Our findings are particularly relevant for the
United States, that currently has a higher infant mortality rate than European countries driven by
higher postneonatal mortality (1­12 months after birth), a period in which SIDS is still the leading
cause of death (Carlin and Moon 2017; Chen et al. 2016).


2     Country Setting

2.1    Infant Mortality and SIDS in Denmark

Infant mortality in Denmark decreased from 134.2 over 1000 live births in 1901 to 20 in 1962, and
eventually to only 3.2 in 2019. Until the 1950s, unexplained deaths constituted a small fraction of
the overall infant mortality, but as deaths due to infections and other major causes continuously
declined over the second half of the century, unexplained infant deaths slowly shifted from the
periphery to the center of public health policy (Helweg-Larsen and Guldager 2001b). Formally
defined as a cause of death in 1969, reported SIDS rates steadily increased over the next 20 years
in many developed countries, including Denmark, eventually making SIDS the most significant
post-neonatal risk for infant mortality in industrialized countries (De Jonge et al. 1989; Dwyer and
Ponsonby 2009). Research in Denmark suggests that the changes in cause of death classifications
and the previous guidelines that recommended sleeping on stomach might explain the rise of SIDS
deaths (Helweg-Larsen et al. 1992).
      While the association between prone sleeping position and SIDS was known as early as the
1970s, the full recognition of medical community and the following policy action did not take place
until 1990, after multiple case control, cohort, and observational studies from the UK, Netherlands,
   Estimates between 1901 to 1962 come from Matthiessen (1967) and 2019 from World Bank Open Data (https:
//data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN?locations=DK.

                                                   4
Australia, and New Zealand (De Jonge et al. 1989; Dwyer et al. 1991; Fleming et al. 1990; Mitchell et
al. 1991). Encouraged by newly emerging scientific evidence, The Danish National Board of Health
introduced a new set of guidelines in December 1991, recommending that infants sleep either on
their back or side, which went against the existing guidelines that recommended sleeping on the
stomach (Guldager et al. 1990). The guidelines also included recommendations on avoidance of
overheating and infant's exposure to smoking during pregnancy and after birth. To disseminate
the new guidelines to pregnant women and new parents, a comprehensive information campaign
was launched in December 1991, with a key role assigned to the home nurse visiting program. The
information campaign targeting newborns also circulated in the Danish media, initiated through
a press release from the National Board of Health (Guldager n.d.; Helweg-Larsen and Guldager
2001a). While the new parents presumably received information on sleeping position at the
hospital after giving birth, the home visiting nurses played a special role in communicating the new
guidelines (Møller et al. 1994). Together with the Professional Association of Public Health Nurses,
the Danish National Board of Health published a special issue in the Public Health Nurses trade
magazine in early 1992. The special issue translated the new evidence on preventive measures
related to SIDS and the content of the new guidelines, and included all relevant references.
Furthermore, it included a description of the public health nurses' role in the implementation of
the new guidelines. The special issue was delivered to all public health nurses and obstetric nurses
together with a pamphlet for the parents that included a list of the recommendations regarding the
importance of sleeping on the back as well as avoidance of smoking and overheating. The parents
were informed of the new guidelines through material delivered by the healthcare personnel,
mainly the public health nurses.
    The Danish National Board of Health evaluated the information campaign in five regions in
Denmark in 1993 and determined that the vast majority of parents complied with the new sleeping
guidelines. A survey conducted by the evaluation team indicated that while almost all parents
had been aware of the importance of supine sleeping position, only about half of the parents had
been informed about the guidelines on smoking and overheating. Furthermore, the majority of the
parents reported that they had received the information from the public health nurse or the public
media. By 1993, approximately 13 percent of infants of parents with more than one child were
sleeping on their stomach, corresponding to a 38.2 percentage points decrease from the pre-1991
levels (Møller et al. 1994).
    See Appendix A.2 for a copy of the letter from the National Board of Health to all GPs, neonatal wards, obstetric
wards, hospitals in general, leading midwifes, and home visiting nurses dated the 10  of December 1991.
    In Danish: Faglig sammenslutning af Sundhedsplejersker.
    In Danish: Fagtidsskriftet Sundhedsplejersken.
    While the issue included approximately six pages of information on sleeping position, only a small section was
devoted to smoking and overheating.
    This material included the pamphlet aimed at the parents and two publications "Barn i vente" (in English: Expecting
a child) and "Sunde børn" (in English: "Healthy Children").
    Using data on smoking behavior that are available beginning 1991, appendix Figure B1 shows that smoking during
pregnancy continually decreased around the time of the change in guidelines with no apparent discontinuity in Decem-


                                                          5
      The risk of SIDS differs by several factors. For example, premature birth and higher order
births are associated with an increased risk of SIDS. Before the campaign, the prematurely born
babies were often laid on their stomach for sleep in the hospitals, as it was believed that this
helped them breathe more easily (Helweg-Larsen and Guldager 2001c). Most parents maintained
this practice upon returning home with their newborns. Parents with older children were also
more likely to put their children to sleep on their stomach following the previous guidelines.
Furthermore, the conventional wisdom was that placing babies on their stomach helped them
sleep more comfortably (Helweg-Larsen and Guldager 2001c). Additionally, children from certain
backgrounds are particularly vulnerable to SIDS. For example, an evaluation of immigrants' infant
care in Denmark from 1994 shows that immigrant parents were much more likely to practice prone
sleep position with their babies than were Danish parents (Sonne 1994). The home visiting nurse
program is especially important for providing information to the group of immigrants who often
live isolated from Danish social networks.


3     Data
We use several Danish population registries that are linked through a unique identifier to construct
a data set of all live births from 1973 through 2006. Information on birth weight, gestational
age, and parity are obtained from the Danish Medical Birth Registry (DMBR). Maternal age and
immigrant status are also obtained from DMBR. Mortality data including the exact date and cause
of death come from the Danish Registry of Cause of Death (Helweg-Larsen 2011).                         Information
on parental education comes from the Danish Education Registry. We categorize mothers to those
with (i) basic education (12 years or less of formal education), (ii) vocational education (vocational
training equivalent to high school, and (iii) further education (women with any post-high school
degree). We provide a detailed description of the variables used in the analysis in Appendix Table
C1.


4     Empirical Design
We use a regression continuity design based on birth month and year cutoff, which creates a
quasi-random variation in exposure to the drastically different sleep guidelines provided by the
government. In particular, our empirical strategy anchors on the fact that children who were born
after December 1991 were exposed to an at-scale information campaign that aimed to reverse the
sleep practice of newborns in Denmark.
      While the newly emerged medical evidence was publicly available to all parents even before
ber 1991. Despite the data limitation, we performed a regression discontinuity analysis using a bandwidth of 12 months
and did not find a statistically robust effect of guidelines on smoking.
    We exclude observations with no information or unrealistic values for birthweight and length.
    Unique identifiers in the registries link parents and children.


                                                          6
December 1991, we expect the government reach-out effort to have created meaningful exposure
differences in sleep practice among birth cohorts who were born before and after the information
campaign for several reasons. First, as discussed in Section 2, the focus of the reach-out efforts by
the public health authorities was pregnant women and parents who gave birth after the change
in childcare guidelines. Following the change in policy, parents received the updated instructions
on sleep position for infants mainly through home visits by a public nurse(Iversen 2017; Møller
et al. 1994). Second, since SIDS risk is highest in the first four months after birth, even a short
period of difference in exposure to the old versus new guidelines can introduce a significant
difference in mortality risk for newborns only a few months apart around the time of the change
in guidelines (American Academy of Pediatrics 2011). In other words, even if the information
campaign uniformly reached all parents regardless of their children's date of birth, we would still
expect the benefits to be higher for those who were fully exposed to the new sleeping guidelines
since their birth. Lastly, as documented in experimental interventions to promote healthy habit
formation, changing an existing health behavior is often challenging without the right incentives
(Loewenstein et al. 2016; Hussam et al. 2017). This is particularly salient in our setting, where there
may be more challenges to parental compliance given that sleeping on their stomach is viewed as
more comfortable for many infants as they wake up less frequently at night. (Horne et al. 2001;
Oster 2020, pp. 111-112).
   Formally, our research design can be expressed by the following empirical specification:


                                          =   +        + ( )+                                       (1)

                                               ( - , +  )

where     indicates mortality outcome for infant ,        is a binary treatment indicator for cohorts
born in January 1992 and later, and       is the running variable and calculated as the number of
months between the child's birth month and year and the end of December 1991. We fit two
continuous functions ( ) on each side of the regression sample, which includes infants who were
born  months before and after the change in guidelines, using an automated routine of optimal
bandwidth selection that minimizes the mean-squared error (MSE) following Calonico et al. (2019).
We also present results from a wide range of alternative bandwidths to test the sensitivity of our
estimates with respect the bandwidth choice. Standard errors are clustered at the birth month-year
level to account for within birth cohort correlations in outcomes. Finally, we use a uniform kernel
to weight the observations in our regression sample.
   In this setting,   captures the intent-to-treat (ITT) effects of a drastic change in Danish National
Board of Health guidelines on childcare, mainly communicated to new parents through post-natal
public health nurse visits. In a randomized thought experiment, the ITT estimates would capture
the difference in treatment and control group outcomes in a setting where the compliance with
treatment is imperfect and the control group has limited access to treatment. Therefore        reflects

                                                   7
a lower bound estimate of the true treatment effect. It is important to note, however, that these
lower bound effects might be more policy-relevant, given that most communication-based services
involve imperfect compliance and serve only those who would not have acquired the relevant
information otherwise. Causal interpretation of the estimated         further hinges on the following
assumptions: (i) quasi-random assignment, i.e. cohorts who were born just before and after the
change in guidelines slept in different positions but are otherwise comparable in their pre-treatment
characteristics; and (ii) exclusion restriction, i.e. there are no other policies that were implemented
around the same time and could also generate similar discontinuous mortality risk across birth
cohorts born around December 1991.
      We take advantage of the population-level administrative data to assess the validity of these
assumptions. First, we analyze whether a set of predetermined covariates including strong predic-
tors of infant mortality are continuous around the threshold to confirm quasi-random assignment
of exposure to policy. Second, we use cause-specific mortality data to confirm that any sharp
negative jump in infant mortality is exclusively driven by SIDS and other unclassified deaths and
test whether excluding those leads to a null treatment effect. This provides a powerful empirical
test on exclusion restriction, given the statistical power provided by the population-level data, as
well as the existing medical evidence that having infants sleep on their back is the most important
risk-reducing practice against SIDS (Dwyer and Ponsonby 2009).


5     Results

5.1     Descriptive Analysis and Preliminary Tests

We begin with a descriptive analysis of our main outcomes in Figure 1 Panel A and B, and
provide the changes in all-cause infant mortality and SIDS rates over 10,000 live births for infants
born between 1973 and 2006. With the exception of 1980s, infant mortality rate continuously fell
throughout the analysis period. The drop in the rate is particularly dramatic in early 1990s during
which it plummeted from around 80 per 10,000 in its 1980 levels to 50 per 10,000, corresponding to
a 35-40 percent decline within only four birth cohorts between 1991 and 1994.
      Figure 1 Panel B shows (i) the decline in infant mortality during the early 1990s shown in Figure
1, Panel A, is primarily driven by an abrupt decrease in SIDS deaths, and (ii) for infants born
between the early 1970s and 1990, the SIDS rate increases gradually despite a decreasing trend in
infant mortality, which includes SIDS deaths. For the most part, the increase in the SIDS rate in
the late during this period can be explained by improved classification of cause of death, though
epidemiological literature also points to the former clinical guideline that advised the parents to
put their baby to sleep lying on its stomach during 1980s (Helweg-Larsen and Guldager 2001b).
Crude trend suggests that birth cohorts born after the new guidelines were introduced in 1991
experienced a 3 to 4-fold decrease in SIDS-related mortality risk, which remained stable near zero
for cohorts born in the 2000s. Due to confounding secular trends in infant mortality and the time-

                                                    8
varying measurement error in SIDS classification, however, it is difficult to quantify the true effect
of a policy on infant mortality through a trend analysis without additional strong assumptions.
    To assess the internal validity of our research design, we first test whether cohorts born right
before and right after introduction of new sleep instructions differ in their observed characteristics.
In Table 1, we report the RD estimates using Equation 1, which reflects the differences in observed
predetermined characteristics of the treatment and control groups for a wide range of bandwidths.
The first column shows results of the continuity tests for the optimal bandwidth obtained using
Calonico et al. (2019) routine. The estimates in the remaining columns were obtained from samples
restricted from 24 to 72 months below and above the index threshold cohort of December 1991. We
caution against solely relying on statistical significance in interpreting the results of the balancing
tests. Given the very large size of our sample, the estimates from the balancing tests are unsurpris-
ingly precise at conventional levels. However, the coefficient sizes are inconsequentially small in
all cases.
    The results in Table 1 support the assumption of quasi-random assignment of the treatment
status around the vicinity of the RD threshold after accounting for the secular linear trends on
either side of it. The residual differences between the treatment and control groups are small
and most of them are not statistically significant, despite huge sample sizes. The only consistent
difference that we can detect is on birth order coefficients, which suggest that the treatment group's
birth order is 0.018 higher, on average, than the control group, which has a mean birth order of 1.76
(Table 1, column 1). While the sign of the coefficient suggests a negative selection into treatment, its
size is not clinically meaningful enough to have any impact on infant mortality.
    In Appendix Figure B2, we report the graphical representation of these estimates generated
using the optimal-bandwidth. As revealed by the figure, the treatment assignment does not
show any meaningful jumps around the policy threshold. The visual inspection also confirms
the findings in Table 1, showing that month-year birth cohorts who were born around the drastic
policy change have very similar baseline health and maternal characteristics. Given that some of
these covariates are strong predictors of infant mortality, the balance of these covariates across birth
cohorts supports the internal validity of our research design. Given the quasi-random assignment,
any statistical difference and economically meaningful divergence in infant mortality between the
treatment and control cohorts could thus only be explained by a change in parental practices
concerning the sleep position of their infants.
    Note that because we use population-level administrative data, there is no measurement error
in our running variable that could result from self-reported date of birth. Given the cohort-based
structure, it is also inconceivable that some parents might have manipulated the timing of their
childbearing in our context. Therefore, endogenous selection to analysis sample or bunching near
the cut-off do not constitute threats to the validity of our research design. These arguments are also
supported by Figure B3, which shows no change in population composition around the threshold
   As expected, controlling for these variables makes no difference to our reported results. See Table C2.

that could explain the dramatic drop in mortality.


5.2     RD Estimates on All-cause and SIDS-specific Mortality

Figure 2 shows the RD graphs from an analysis sample restricted by Calonico et al. (2019)'s MSE-
optimal bandwidth for our main outcomes. In panel (a), the SIDS mortality rate exhibits a clear
break towards zero immediately following the change in guidelines. Panel (b) includes deaths
from SIDS and unclassified causes, and here a similar break is observed. We quantify these breaks
in the first column of Table 2, which indicates a decrease of 11.5 SIDS deaths per 10,000 live births
from a control group mean of 17.8 SIDS deaths per 10,000 live births. Effect sizes are robust to
various sample restrictions and range between 10.5 and 12.2 based on the distance in birth months
to the index cohort, which varies between 24 and 72.
      All-cause infant mortality in panel (c) of Figure 2 also shows a clear break in infant mortality
immediately after the change in recommended sleep position. The coefficient size indicates that
13.5 deaths per 10,000 live births were averted due to change in public health guidelines, which is
slightly more than the estimates for the SIDS-specific mortality rate (Table 2, column 1). The point
estimates are remarkably robust to bandwidth selection and vary between 12.9 and 14.5, despite
the dramatic change in sample sizes. The relative effect sizes are large and indicate a 17.6 percent
decrease in infant mortality compared to the control mean of 76.68 deaths per 10,000 live births.
In Figure 2, we provide similar evidence for under-five mortality, which shows a reduction of 15
deaths over 10,000 live births (16.5 percent) induced by the government-led information campaign
against SIDS.
      In Figure 2, we also provide RD estimates for infant and child mortality from all causes except
SIDS and other uncategorized deaths. The rationale is to eliminate the possibility that any other
changes in medical knowledge or technology that occurred during the same period might have
differentially affected the health of infants in our treatment group, causing spurious correlation
between the new guidelines and infant mortality. Non-SIDS-related infant and child mortality
rates in Figure 2 (e) and (f) both exhibit a continuous downward secular trend with no sign of a
break around the period of change in sleep recommendation. The RD treatment effect estimates
in Table 2 indicate that these secular trends are fully captured by the local linear trend fits and
report precisely estimated null effects for both infant and child mortality of all known causes but
SIDS and other uncategorized deaths. These estimates constitute a powerful test of the exclusion
restriction because known causes of deaths excluding SIDS still constitute the majority of infant
deaths and show no sign of change among cohorts who were exposed to the new sleep guidelines.
Therefore, we conclude that our main estimates on infant and child mortality are entirely driven
by the government-led public health intervention through the change in the sleeping position of
    Because we use population data, at any randomly assigned threshold between -100 and 100 in the lower panel of
Figure B3, a standard McCrary (2008) test is more than 60 percent likely to reject the null hypothesis of no break. As a
result, we avoid using a formal test of break. The results of this simulation are not reported, but they are available from
the authors upon request.

5.3     Subpopulation Analysis

Given the well-documented differences in mortality risk based on health at birth and socio-
economic factors, we expect the provision of health knowledge to the population to also differ
by baseline health and socio-economic background. In particular, we expect that the new guide-
lines communicated through the home visiting program are more likely to be binding for infants
with a high baseline mortality risk and those born to parents who are less equipped with health
information to begin with. Accordingly, the updated advice on infant sleep position for parents
whose babies otherwise have a high risk of mortality should have a stronger response to policy.
      Table 3 provides the RD treatment estimates for these subgroups. The results indicate substan-
tial benefits of changing the sleep position for infants with low birthweight and preterm infants.
The first panel in Table 3 suggests that the rapid diffusion of new health knowledge saved between
119 and 182 lives per 10,000 births among those with low birth weight and 137 and 198 per 10,000
lives among preterm infants. These are very large absolute effects, and translate into a decrease in
the infant mortality rate by 17.3 and 32 percent compared to the baseline mean among the control
infants, respectively. These estimates indicate that the information campaign was particularly ef-
fective among parents of infants who were born with poor health. The large absolute and relative
coefficient sizes further underscore that the policy was also effective in narrowing the early life
health disparities that start at birth.
      Panel II of Table 3 provides the RD estimates for boys and first children only. These results
suggest slightly larger effects on boys and somewhat larger effects on second and higher birth order
children. The estimates in Panel II align with the existing medical literature that documents the
differential infant mortality risk of all major causes in favor of girls and earlier born siblings. Effect
sizes indicate from 13.2-18 saved lives per 10,000 boys and a marginally significant 9.2-11.2 saved
lives per 10,000 first-borns.
      Panel III of Table 3 report the estimated coefficients by maternal characteristics. When grouped
by mother's education, the subgroup estimates show that the estimated effects of the information
campaign on infant mortality are entirely driven by mothers with relatively few years of education
or a vocational education. None of the estimates for infants with mothers with any post-high school
degree are statistically different from zero, and coefficient sizes are small. The same coefficients for
infants with a mother with basic or vocational education, however, show a consistent improvement
in mortality with similar effect sizes; both are slightly larger than the estimated aggregate ITT
effects in Table 2. We conclude that the information campaign was most effective among mothers
with relatively fewer years of education. Estimates in Table 3 suggest large reductions in infant
mortality among children of immigrant mothers. For example, the estimate from the sample with
MSE-optimal bandwidth shows 35.9 averted deaths per 10,000 births, corresponding to a 42.8
percent decrease in infant mortality among this demographic group. We show the RD graphs

                                                   11
that depicts these estimates in Appendix Figures B4 and B5. Overall, the subgroup analysis shows
that providing newly emerged health knowledge was particularly beneficial for those who were
susceptible to adverse health outcomes as well as for those with lower socio-economic status and
limited access to information.


5.4     Robustness Tests

In addition to a wide range of bandwidth intervals, we further assess the robustness of our estimates
to controlling for covariates, the kernel used to weight our regressions as well as the the form of
the control function in Appendix Tables C2, C3, and C4, respectively. We conduct these robustness
checks for all outcomes and bandwidths that are reported in Table 2, which essentially replicates
our main results with different regression parameters. To ease the comparison of sensitivity
estimates, Figure B6 shows a graphical representation of 120 treatment effect estimates across six
outcomes, five bandwidths, and four specifications. The gray area in Appendix Figure B6 depicts
the MSE-optimal bandwidth range, which constitutes our preferred specifications.
      As illustrated in Appendix Table C2, our estimates are also robust to controlling for a set of
covariates, with the exception of a loss in precision in few specifications with very small bandwidths
due to reduced sample size and the use of birth of month fixed-effects. The results in Appendix
Table C3 indicate that using a triangle kernel to weight our regressions makes little difference in
our estimates. In Appendix Table C4, we show that the use of quadratic control function, as is
typical in RD studies, provide similar but less precise point estimates. In Appendix Figure B6,
we show that none of the choices that we make in our regression framework produce statistically
different estimates. In addition, we show that the point estimates are particularly robust for the
Calonico et al. (2019)'s MSE-optimal bandwidth choices. We interpret these results as a further
confirmation of the internal validity of study.


6     Conclusion
This paper demonstrates that basic health advice delivered to public directly via a universal home
visiting program had a profound effect on reducing infant mortality in Denmark. Our results show
that the public health intervention is responsible for one quarter of the decline in infant mortality
over the past four decades.        The decrease in infant mortality is entirely driven by a drop in SIDS and
other unclassified deaths, which is consistent with the fact that the information campaign mainly
aimed at reducing prone infant sleep position ­ the primary risk factor for SIDS. Furthermore, we
find substantial heterogeneity in the effectiveness of the public information campaign by health
at birth and socioeconomic background. In particular, infants with a poorer baseline health and
    Covariate-adjusted specifications control for gender, month of birth, and birth order fixed-effects, birth weight (in
natural logarithm), gestation (in weeks), dummy variables for mother's education and immigrant status.
    Between 1979 and 2019, infant mortality decreased from 8.5 to 3.2 per 1,000 in Denmark, whereas our preferred
estimate of the policy impact is 1.35, which roughly corresponds to (8.1 .35   25% of the overall decrease.
                                                                       5-3.2)

                                                           12
those born to socioeconomically more deprived parents experienced profoundly stronger benefits
in terms of the prevalence of SIDS-related deaths.
   Despite the breakthroughs in medical technology and developments in new treatments, a
significant number of children continue to die every year, not because of a lack of access to
advanced technology or effective treatments, but due to continued infant-care practices that place
children at a higher risk of death. For example, SIDS, which can be prevented by simple parental
actions, constitutes the leading cause of death among infants between one month and one year
of age in the United States. It is also one of the leading sources of ethnic and racial inequality in
child survival. In 2015, for example, prevalence of nonsupine sleep position among black children
was almost 38 percent, that is 16 percentage points higher than their white peers (Bombard et al.
2018). Not surprisingly, ethnic and racial disparities in child care are also directly reflected in SIDS
rates. In fact, similar persistent and even growing divergencies in health by socioeconomic status
are emerging in developed countries, including those with universal health insurance programs
(Elo and Preston 1996; Pappas et al. 1993; Mackenbach et al. 2003). Due to incremental changes in
medical technology, health behaviors are playing a decisive role in increasing health disparities.
The results of this paper represent a clear demonstration that well-targeted behavioral interventions
implemented at scale can effectively reduce health disparities that tend to persist despite better
technology and access to healthcare.

Appendix A              Additional Material on Home Visiting Program

A.1    Danish Home Visiting Program

The Danish Home Visiting Program was established by the National Board of Health under
legislation enacted in 1937. Initially established as a recommended program, the 1937 legis-
lation was later integrated into the Public Health Nursing Services Act in 1963, which stated
that municipalities "ought" to establish the service, but still did not make it compulsory
(Kamerman and Kahn 1993). Although most local jurisdictions adopted the program, it was
not until 1973 that it became mandatory, after which time all municipalities had to offer visits
to new families.        From 1973 through 1995, the organization of the public health nurses
was assigned to a leading public health nurse in the region.                   According to the guidelines,
first-time parents could be visited by a public health nurse around nine times between the
time of birth and the start of school, while parents with more than one child could receive
up to seven visits, depending on their needs (Danish National Board of Health 1985; Dan-
ish Nurses' Organization 2018). The public health nurses reaches almost 100 percent of the
population.
    The public health nurses have two distinct roles: (i) to offer care and support to the families
and promote health, with a specific focus on breastfeeding (ii) to measure the children and
check that the parents follow guidelines and report back to the authorities if they notice any
maltreatment (Sixhøj 2001). While it can be difficult to unite these two roles, this problem
seems partly to be solved by focusing on health promotion and repeated visits by the same
public health nurse to the family, which nurtures a relationship of trust between the families
and the public health nurses.
    Previous evidence suggests that home visiting programs assumed an important role in
improving infant health such that their impact went beyond early childhood to result in better
adult health, education, and earnings (Bhalotra et al. 2017; Bütikofer et al. 2019; Hjort et al.
2017; Moehling and Thomasson 2014; Wüst 2012). While there is consensus on the health
benefits of postnatal home visits by public health nurses, the existing studies are limited
in explaining which component of these programs (e.g., basic medical services, nutrition
advice, or public health information) makes them so valuable.
    See Lov om Sundhedsplejerske Ordningerne, Lov nr 409 af 13. juni 1973 (n.d.) for the corresponding law article.
    At that time there were 14 regions in the country.
    For example, Hjort et al. (2017) documents a clear decrease in infant mortality induced by Denmark's Home
Visiting Program in 1937, but it is not clear whether the referral of sick children to doctors, hygienic home
environments, breastfeeding advice, or a combination of all services drove these changes.

variable definitions. Each column indicates the bandwidth used to restrict the regression sample. Standard errors are
clustered at the month-year cohort level and are shown in parentheses. Significance levels are indicated by *** < 0.01,
** <0.05, and * <0.1.
