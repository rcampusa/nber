                                           ABSTRACT

This paper presents experimental tables created by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis
comparing industry-specific shares of the components of total output of globally engaged firms
located in the United States that are part of a multinational enterprise with those of firms that are
part of an enterprise entirely located in the United States. Recent research has shown both the
importance of accounting for trade in value added when estimating bilateral trade flows and that
multinational enterprises located in the United States account for the lion’s share of U.S. trade in
goods and services. However, trade in value added is typically accounted for using input-output
tables that are aggregated across all types of firms. The experimental tables are consistent with
other research showing that value added as a share of output is lower for foreign-owned firms
compared with domestic-owned firms and that exports and imports as a share of output is larger
for foreign-owned firms. We also find heterogeneity in the composition of output among different
types of domestic-owned firms. Future work will analyze this heterogeneity in more detail using
establishment-level data on production and trade.

This paper presents experimental trade-in-value added statistics estimated from extended
supply-use tables (SUTs) for the United States for 2005 and 2012 that account for firm
heterogeneity. We also present preliminary output from a microdata linking project between
the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau on the U.S. semiconductor
and other electronic components manufacturing industry to show how different firm
characteristics account for heterogeneity. Our experimental results show that imported content
of exports as a share of exports varies notably by firm-type within most industries, and that the
imported content of exports is concentrated in a few industries, the largest being petroleum
manufacturing. Based on these experimental results, most content of exports by firms in goods
producing industries is from U.S. multinational enterprises (MNEs) and most content of exports
in services industries is from non-MNEs. Estimates based on our microdata linking project
suggest that production patterns by ownership, firm size class, and export intensity each exhibit
firm heterogeneity to some extent. The ownership criteria best accounts for heterogeneity in
the value added share of production among the three criteria, while firm size class accounts for
heterogeneity in the export share of production better than the ownership criteria.



1 Introduction

        There is a growing body of research on improving the measurement of Trade in Value

Added (TiVA) statistics and the supply-use tables (SUTs) on which they are based. As noted in

Fetzer, Howells, Jones, Strassner, and Wang (2016), this work began with efforts in academia

(e.g. Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)), in government (e.g. U.S. International Trade

Commission (USITC) and the World Input-Output Database (WIOD)), and in international

organizations (e.g. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and

World Trade Organization (WTO)). Research has shown that bilateral trade balances measured

using TiVA statistics can be very different from those based on gross trade flows, which is not

surprising since a sizeable share of trade is composed of intermediate goods that have crossed

borders multiple times (Johnson and Noguera (2012)). TiVA statistics may enhance trade policy

and trade theory by revealing differences in competitiveness and comparative advantage that

are not apparent from gross bilateral trade flows and by providing other insights about direct

and indirect interdependencies among international trading partners. 2


        As noted by Fetzer and Strassner (2015) and others, national statistical offices (NSOs)

have found direct measurement of TiVA to be impractical, and their efforts to measure TiVA

more accurately have focused on refining national-level SUTs that can be combined into a

global SUT to estimate TiVA indirectly. Since this approach to measuring TiVA for a given

country depends on the SUTs for the country itself as well as all its major trading partners, NSOs

have been engaged in cross-country efforts to build technical knowledge and capacity in the

NSOs of partner countries and to reconcile conceptual and measurement asymmetries among

national-level SUTs. For example, NSOs from Canada, Mexico, and the United States are

collaborating to produce regional North American SUTs and associated TiVA statistics in 2018,

and plan to introduce extended SUTs by 2020. Peluso et al. (2017) outlines the conceptual

methodology, data requirements, and technical issues associated with construction of these

tables and statistics, which will also be used in multilateral efforts by the OECD and Asia-Pacific

Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries to produce a consistent set of inter-country input-

output tables (IOTs).


       In this paper, we extend work by Fetzer et al. (2016) to estimate experimental extended

SUTs for the United States for 2011. The tables for 2005 and 2012 presented in this paper will

be used by the (APEC) TiVA initiative in the development of regional extended SUTs for these

two years. Similar to Fetzer et al. (2016), we build on SUTs for the United States published by

the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) (Young, Howells, Strassner, and Wasshausen 2015).

Unlike previous work, we use an unpublished decomposition of the purchaser value use table

into basic value, import, tax, trade margin, and transportation matrices in place of the

estimated matrices using a quadratic programming approach. We also disaggregate SUTs by

firm type based on the methodology of Fetzer and Strassner (2015) using BEA statistics on the

Activities of Multinational Enterprises (AMNE). However, in this paper we rely on

establishment-based data from BEA’s SUTs rather than relying directly on enterprise-based

Internal Revenue Service Statistics of Income data. We also derive symmetric industry-by-

industry extended IOTs from the extended SUTs along with associated TiVA statistics.

       TiVA estimates are most rigorously calculated using inter-country IOTs that account for

the production of all countries in the world. However, TiVA statistics have also been calculated

from single-country IOTs in research such as Ma, Wang, and Zhu (2015) and Tang, Wang, and


                                                     3
Wang (2014). Following their approach, we calculate implied domestic value added using the

Leontief inverse of the U.S. IOT to calculate single-country TiVA statistics. 3

       For comparison purposes, these statistics include measures based both on standard

SUTs as well as extended SUTs that incorporate information on firm-level heterogeneity. The

comparative analysis of these two sets of statistics allows us to understand better how firms

within industries engage in global value chains and to see more clearly how the incorporation of

firm heterogeneity provides a more accurate measure of TiVA.

       These tables are a precursor to more precise estimates of extended SUTs that will

eventually result from ongoing collaboration between the BEA and the U.S. Census Bureau on a

microdata linking project to improve the statistics related to global value chains. Linking the

BEA data to Census establishment level data will allow us to identify establishments that are

part of MNEs and other firm types rather than having to adjust discrepancies that arise when

we apportion the components of output based on enterprise-level MNE estimates that have

been converted to the establishment level. We also include early results from this project in

the form of a case study showing a partial extended SUT for the semiconductor industry.

Economy-wide totals for the case study come from establishment-level Census of Manufactures

data. Within these totals, we identify firm characteristics of ownership using the AMNE data

from BEA, firm size class from enterprise-level aggregations of the Longitudinal Business

Database, and data on export intensity from the Economic Census and the Annual Survey of

Manufacturers. While we are not able to report the actual extended SUTs for the

           The Leontief inverse is a matrix that shows the full requirements (both direct and indirect) of a sector.

                                                               4
semiconductor industry due to disclosure restrictions and the need to use data from other

industries outside of the case study, we are able to show the existence of firm heterogeneity

due to characteristics including ownership, firm size class, and export intensity.



2 Literature Review

       The extended SUTs in this paper expand on work done by Fetzer et al. (2016) to

estimate experimental extended SUTs for the United States for 2011, which decomposed

industry output by firm type, estimated extended IOTs, and estimated TiVA indicators using a

single-country IOT model.


       A growing literature has found evidence of heterogeneity in value added, trade, and

imported intermediates between foreign- and domestic-owned enterprises across a broad

group of countries including the United States, Japan, China, and many European countries

(Fetzer and Strassner (2015), Piacentini and Fortanier (2015), Ahmad, Araujo, Lo Turco, and

Maggioni (2013), and Ma et al. (2015)). Also, work by Ito, Deseatnicov, and Fukao (2017) has

found heterogeneity in production destined for export versus production destined for domestic

consumption. These patterns are consistent with the productivity sorting hypothesis of Melitz

(2003) and Helpman, Melitz, and Yeaple (2004), which explains how a firm’s level of global

engagement tends to be positively associated with its level of productivity. Zeile (1998) also

found that valued added as a share of gross output was smaller for U.S. affiliates than U.S.

parent firms for most manufacturing industries in 1989 and 1994.




                                                     5
       Research that estimates IOTs by type of firm have used a variety of methodologies.

Koopman, Wang, and Wei (2012) and Ma et al. (2015) use constrained optimization to extend

IOTs to include both processing and normal trade and to separate foreign-owned enterprises

from Chinese-owned enterprises. Ito et al. (2017) use matched employer-employee data for

Japan to split Japanese output in the OECD Inter-Country IOT into exports and domestic sales.

Cadestin et al. (2017) split the WIOD database by firm type using the OECD AMNE database and

national source data. Saborío and Torres-Mora (2018) create ESUTs for Costa Rica using data on

firms operating in free trade zones where over one-half of foreign direct investment in Costa

Rica is concentrated. Bernhard, Hambÿe, and Hertveldt (2018) use firm-level data on exporters

to disaggregate manufacturing industries in the Belgian SUTs by exporters and non-exporters.

Ahmad (2018) suggests that breaking out ownership by foreign- and domestic-owned MNEs is

in ESUTs is useful because of their considerable presence in economic activity and trade.


        Most researchers, such as Ito, Deseatnicov, and Fukao (2017) and Cadestin et al. (2017),

calculate TiVA estimates based on inter-country IOTs, but some generate TiVA estimates using

single-country tables, such as Fetzer et al. (2016). As noted by Ma et al. (2015), single-country

models are limited to estimating the domestic content of exports, a measure that excludes

domestic value added that has been re-imported. Los, Timmer, and de Vries (2016) indicate

that domestic value added in gross exports can be estimated from the difference in reported

gross domestic product (GDP) and hypothetical GDP estimated from a single country IOT

assuming the country does not export. However, they indicate that global IOTs are required to

decompose domestic value added by end use including the extent to which it is absorbed


                                                    6
abroad. Johnson (2018) indicates that single country IOTs can be used to estimate the domestic

value added and import content in exports, but that a multicountry IOT is needed to

decompose import content into foreign value added.



3 Data

         We used data from two main sources: 1) a time series of SUTs published as part of BEA’s

industry accounts and 2) AMNE data and trade in services data collected and published as part

of BEA’s international accounts. In addition to these two primary datasets, we also made direct

use of several datasets from the Census Bureau. Estimates were prepared for 2005 and 2012 to

align with the years chosen by APEC for the ongoing regional APEC TiVA initiative.


3.1 Supply-Use Tables

         The SUTs for the United States are the foundation on which the experimental extended

SUTs were constructed. The supply-use framework comprises two tables. The supply table

presents the total domestic supply of goods and services from both domestic and foreign

producers that are available for use in the domestic economy. The cells in the main part of the

supply table, referred to as the make matrix, show domestic production and indicate the

amount of each commodity (row) produced by each industry (column). The make matrix plus an

additional column showing the amount of each commodity that was imported give the total

supply of each commodity at basic prices (i.e. market prices at the factory door less taxes and

subsidies). The remaining columns are valuation adjustments, including trade margins,




                                                   7
transportation costs, taxes, and subsidies, that transform total supply for each commodity from

basic prices to purchasers’ prices.


        The use table shows how the supply of each commodity from the supply table is used by

domestic industries as intermediate inputs and by final users. The cells in the primary section

of the use table indicate the amount of a commodity (row) purchased by an industry (column)

as an intermediate input in the industry’s production process. The cells in the remaining

columns of the table show the flow of each commodity to different components of final

demand, including personal consumption, private investment, government consumption and

investment, inventory change, and exports. The cells in the remaining rows indicate how the

components of value added in an industry are allocated and capture the value of labor and

capital inputs used in an industry’s production process. 4


        The tables presented here are part of a time series of SUTs, now covering the period

1997-2016, that were first released by BEA in September of 2015.5 These data are updated and

released on an annual basis, consistent with the annual revision of the Industry Economic

Accounts.6 The release of these tables is part of BEA’s long-term plan to make U.S. data on

output, intermediate inputs, and value added available in a format that is well suited for

preparation of TiVA statistics.

        Starting with the September 2015 release, data previously presented only in the make-

use format were presented in the more internationally recognized supply-use format.

Presentation in this format helps to facilitate ongoing efforts to link U.S. data with SUTs from

other countries, a step necessary to derive the full suite of TiVA-related statistics. In addition,

the SUTs incorporate important valuation changes that bring the tables into better alignment

with international standards and enhance the suitability of the tables for use in TiVA analysis. 7


        BEA has recently conducted additional research allowing the breakdown of the use

tables valued at purchaser prices into subcomponent matrices necessary for calculating TiVA

statistics. This decomposition includes separate matrices for domestically-produced inputs

valued at basic prices, imported inputs at cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) prices, trade

margins, transportation costs, taxes on products, duties on imports, and subsidies on products.

Developing these matrices for the use table is more resource intensive than bringing the supply

table up to purchasers’ prices where only an additional six columns need to be added. In

addition to their importance for preparing TiVA statistics, another reason to undertake this task

is to facilitate compiling a supply and use table in volume terms. While each of the

decomposed matrices is not currently published, these additions were available for purposes of

this paper. 8 The availability of these matrices is a significant improvement as the decomposed




        7
           Beginning with the comprehensive update of the industry accounts scheduled for publication on
November 1, 2018, BEA will begin featuring supply-use tables as the primary format for publishing input-output
data. Make-use tables will continue to be published, but will be released as a supplementary product rather than
as the featured set of tables.
         8
           BEA is currently investigating options for making these tables available to the public.

component matrices did not need to be approximated as previously using a quadratic

programming constrained optimization model on data from the published BEA SUTs.


3.2 Activities of Multinational Enterprises

       Firm heterogeneity is introduced into the SUTs through the incorporation of BEA AMNE

statistics; this addition is partly what distinguishes them as extended SUTs. These statistics

cover the financial and operating characteristics of U.S. parent companies (domestic-owned

MNEs) and U.S. affiliates that are majority-owned by foreign MNEs (foreign-owned MNEs). They

are based on legally mandated surveys conducted by BEA and are used in a wide variety of

studies to estimate the impact of MNEs on the domestic (U.S.) economy and on foreign host

economies.


       We use data from the inward AMNE surveys to measure the presence of foreign-owned

MNEs and data from the outward AMNE surveys for domestic-owned MNEs for 2005 and 2012.

The data include components of value added, sales, and trade in goods for both domestic-

owned MNEs and foreign-owned MNEs for 31 industries for which the relevant data were

published for both surveys. Because AMNE data points are sometimes suppressed to avoid

disclosure of firm-level data, we use distributions from non-suppressed data items as a basis for

estimating suppressed values.


       For domestic-owned MNEs, we exclude those that are majority-foreign-owned from the

published outward AMNE data. These companies appear in both the inward and the outward

AMNE datasets. Because the extent of the overlap is not published and because directly

removing the overlapping companies could lead to implicit disclosure of firm-level data, we first
                                                    10
remove the overlap at the all-industry level and then estimate industry-level overlaps based on

distributions of published inward AMNE statistics by industry. That is, we assume that the

extent of the overlap is proportional to the size of inward AMNE data by industry. We remove

the industry-level estimates of the overlap from the domestic-owned MNE data set, leaving

strictly domestic-owned MNEs that can be used to create extended SUTs and calculate TiVA

statistics.


         We also allocate BEA trade in services data by firm type. Trade in services data collected

on BEA’s BE-125 (selected services and intellectual property), BE-45 (insurance services), and

BE-185 (financial services) surveys for 2012 were matched to the firms’ responses on the BEA

AMNE surveys to identify services exported and imported by domestic-owned MNEs and

foreign-owned MNEs. The matches are made based on firm-level bridges between the three

surveys and the AMNE data for 2011. The remaining trade that is not matched with an MNE is

assumed to be exported or imported by a non-MNE. Since the trade in services data for 2005

are estimated from a greater number of surveys for which there are no existing ID bridges with

the AMNE data, we apply the 2012 allocations by service type to the trade in services data for

2005.9


         Trade in transport, travel, and government goods and services could not be matched

directly to firms in the AMNE data. Transport data could not be matched because there is not

currently an ID bridge between BEA’s transportation surveys and the AMNE surveys. Travel



         9
           In addition to the BEA surveys of selected services and intellectual property, insurance services, and
financial services, BEA also conducts surveys of trade in services covering air transport and ocean transport.

                                                              11
data could not be matched because the source data are classified based on the buyer not the

seller. Data for firms supplying goods and services to the government could not be matched

because they are based on data sources that are aggregated above the firm level. The

ownership type for these trade in services are based on the types of firms that we believe to be

primarily engaged in this type of trade and on data for gross output by ownership type from the

extended SUTs. Exports of travel services are allocated based on 2012 data from BEA’s Travel

and Tourism Satellite Account, 2013 data from the Survey of International Air Travelers, and

2012 data on gross output by ownership type from the extended SUTs. Since imports of travel

services and imports of passenger fares for personal travel are typically not made by firms, but

by individual consumers, we allocated these imports to “final demand” rather than to a firm

type.


3.3 U.S. Census Bureau Datasets

        For experimental tables, we use BEA’s SUTs as a starting point. Construction of the SUTs

relies heavily on data from the quinquennial economic census as well as annual and quarterly

surveys administered by the Census Bureau. In addition, Census employment data at the

enterprise and establishment levels from the 2007 and 2012 Economic Censuses are used to

convert BEA’s multinational data from an enterprise to an establishment basis.


        For the microdata linking project, we identify multinational enterprises by linking the

establishment level 2012 Census of Manufactures data with the 2012 BEA outward and inward

AMNE surveys (BE-11 and BE-12). We identify firm size class for the establishments in the

4 Methodology

       Our overall methodology is similar to that of Fetzer et al. (2016) and Fetzer and

Strassner (2015). Estimates of activity by industry for domestic and foreign-owned MNEs are

derived directly from BEA’s AMNE datasets as outlined below, and non-MNE activity is derived

residually as total activity less the MNE data. Previous work by Fetzer et al. (2016) and Fetzer

and Strassner (2015) relied on company-based IRS data to derive estimates of total activity. In

this paper, we make direct use of establishment-based data from BEA’s published SUTs as our

estimates of total activity. BEA’s AMNE data are collected on an enterprise-basis and were

adjusted to an establishment basis using an enterprise-to-establishment transformation matrix

based on Census employment data. Once all components were estimated, we constructed an

extended SUT by firm ownership and calculated TiVA statistics.


4.1 Enterprise-to-Establishment Adjustment

       The Census employment data are taken from the 2007 and 2012 Economic Censuses.

Census provides total employment both by enterprise industry and by establishment industry

at the 4-digit NAICS level. Census employment data for 2012 were used to convert the AMNE

data for 2012 while Census data for 2007 were used to convert the AMNE data for 2005.


       We first aggregated the data up to the 31 industries estimated for this paper. At the 31-

industry level, we created an enterprise-by-establishment matrix of employment levels, that


                                                   13
provided the weights for our conversion matrix. Because the matrix is based on employment

levels, a key assumption in creating and using this conversion matrix is that the relationship

between employees and the variable to be converted is the same by type of establishment

regardless of the industry of the parent enterprise. For example, we assume that employees

across all types of retail establishments are equally productive, whether those employees work

for a retail establishment that is part of a consumer electronics enterprise or a retail

establishment that is part of a furniture enterprise. It is important to note that no output is

created or lost in converting from an enterprise to an establishment basis, rather the

conversion process is simply one of redistribution.


4.2 Decomposing the Purchasers’ Price Use Table into Component Matrices

       According to the international accounting standards, use table intermediate inputs are

valued at purchaser prices. However, a domestic basic price valuation is preferred for purposes

of calculating TiVA statistics because it ensures more homogenous valuation across different

products, more accurately reflects a country’s input-output relationships, and allows separate

identification of the effects of import tariffs, production taxes, and subsidies.


       The purchaser price reflects the price paid by the buyer to take delivery of the good or

service and includes the value of the underlying product plus taxes, wholesale and retail

markups, and transportation costs. This is the value that matters for decision making by the

buyer. The basic price reflects the price ultimately received by the producer and includes the

price at which the underlying good or service is sold plus any subsidies received. In addition, the




                                                      14
total value of purchased inputs in a standard use table combines both domestically-produced

and imported goods and services.


       Conceptually, the process of converting use table intermediate inputs from purchaser

prices to domestic basic prices involves removing taxes less subsidies, wholesale and retail

markups, and transportations costs from each cell and separating imported and domestically-

produced inputs. Taxes less subsidies are moved to the value-added row while wholesale,

retail, and transportation costs are moved to rows that show their purchase explicitly in the

table rather than implicitly embedded in the value of goods purchases. Finally, the resulting

basic price values are separated into domestically-produced and imported components. This

process is often subdivided to provide additional information. For example, it is common to

show trade and transportation margins separately rather than grouped as distributive services.

Likewise, taxes are often identified separately from subsidies, and within taxes, tariffs and

duties are often shown separately from domestic taxes on production. This additional detail

can be useful for policy studies using computable general equilibrium models that are based on

SUTs. The number of ways in which to subdivide the transformation of purchaser to basic

prices ultimately depends on data availability and the needs of the project.


       The adjustments to transform use table intermediates from purchasers’ prices to basic

prices are depicted as matrices. The taxes less subsidies matrix is constructed in such a way

that subtracting this matrix from the use table leaves total output by industry unchanged. This

matrix shifts taxes collected on purchased intermediate inputs out of intermediate inputs and

into value added. Similarly, the matrix shifts subsidies away from value added and into the

                                                    15
value of the intermediate inputs purchased. The purpose of this transformation is to have

intermediate inputs more accurately reflect production costs.


       The distributive services matrix is similarly constructed such that subtracting it from

intermediate inputs leaves total intermediate inputs unchanged. The transformation alters the

composition of intermediate inputs to reflect lower values in merchandise purchases and larger

values in trade and transport purchases. The purpose of this transformation is to show margins

being purchased explicitly, as opposed to being purchased implicitly in purchasers’ prices.

Showing margins explicitly allows for better evaluation of each industry's input structure for

TiVA analysis.


       The import matrix shows the purchase of imported inputs by industry and final use

category. The import matrix allows the partitioning of intermediate inputs between

domestically-sourced and imported inputs. Imports are estimated in two stages. First, in the

development of BEA’s conventional SUTs, they are allocated by industry using the import

proportionality assumption wherein industries are assumed to use imported intermediate

inputs in the proportion to the import share of total domestic supply. Samuels, Howells, Russell,

and Strassner (2015) provide a complete description of the BEA import use methodology.

Second, to account for firm heterogeneity in the use of imports, these first approximations are

adjusted using imports of goods reported on the AMNE surveys and microdata from BEA’s trade

in services surveys linked to the AMNE data. This technique, however, could bias downward

the import shares of MNEs because the AMNE surveys collect only direct imports by the firm

themselves, whereas the import proportionality assumption implicitly captures imports

                                                   16
purchased by the firm itself and those purchased through other domestic businesses, such as a

broker or a wholesaler.


       We mitigated this bias by reallocating imports from MNEs in industries reporting

imports that were greater than the imports in our published SUTs. The reallocation was

particularly large for reported imports by MNEs in wholesale trade. We expect that the bulk of

imports by MNEs in wholesale trade are used as inputs by establishments in different

industries. Distinguishing between imported and domestically-sourced inputs is necessary for

the proper identification of input structures for TiVA analysis.


       The use table for the United States is computed such that intermediate inputs can be

converted in a straightforward way between purchasers’ and basic prices. Most of the

components for preparing these two matrices and the transformation matrices that link them

are generated in the normal course of statistical production.


       Providing trade and transportation matrices for TiVA analysis largely entails aggregating

this underlying data to an appropriate level of detail. The underlying U.S. data also include an

import use table which allows import-specific prices to be applied during the calculation of

inflation-adjusted industry estimates. This import matrix is used to differentiate between

changes in relative prices between domestic and foreign inputs. The import use table valuation

includes import tariffs and duties, which for multi-country TiVA analysis needs to be shown

separately from imports in basic prices. The data underlying the U.S. use tables also allow for

an explicit identification of product-related domestic taxes. Subsidies, however, are not easily



                                                    17
identified based on the underlying level of detail. Thus, the two main challenges in developing

domestic intermediate input estimates at basic prices for the United States are calculating the

tariff and duties matrix and the subsidies matrix.


       Calculating the tariffs and duties matrix requires coupling the underlying use table

import data with customs data to determine appropriate estimates by product category. These

product estimates are then apportioned to purchasing industries proportionately and

aggregated to the desired level. Subsidies are first estimated by product based on the product

mix produced by the industry receiving the subsidies. These estimates of product subsidies are

then apportioned to intermediate inputs proportionately.


4.3 Estimating Firm Type Shares

       Following the decomposition of the purchaser price use table, we break out the industry

columns in the resulting component matrices into foreign-owned MNEs, domestic-owned

MNEs, and non-MNEs. The MNE components are calculated using the AMNE data while the

non-MNE component is calculated as the residual of the total value less the MNE pieces. The

resulting distribution is used to generate firm type shares for each industry.


       Shares are prepared by industry for gross output, intermediate inputs, employee

compensation, capital compensation (gross operating surplus plus taxes on products), exports,

imports, and employment. For each of these variables, an establishment-based industry

distribution is drawn from the supply-use framework. The establishment-based distributions

for foreign- and domestic-owned multinational enterprises created from the AMNE and Census



                                                     18
employment data are subtracted from the SUT-based totals to create a residual estimate of

non-multinational activity by industry.


          In some instances, multinational activity is larger than total activity from the SUTs.

These discrepancies are likely the result of limitations in the enterprise-to-establishment

adjustment process. We adjusted the data to address these negatives and other implausible

values.


          Firm type shares are applied to all industry columns of the SUT matrices. The shares are

estimated so that the resulting extended SUT remained fully balanced and consistent, so the

table does not need to be rebalanced.


4.4 Input-Output Tables

          We use a similar methodology for estimating the TiVA statistics as Fetzer et al. (2016).

Once the extended SUTs are constructed, we derive a symmetric industry-by-industry extended

IOT from the extended SUTs. First, we generate a commodity-by-commodity IOT using the

industry technology assumption that each industry has its own specific method of production,

irrespective of its product mix. We derive an industry-by-industry IOT using the fixed product

sales structure approach from this table, in which each product has its own specific sales

structure, irrespective of the industry in which it is produced.10 Dietzenbacher, Los, Stehrer,

Timmer, and de Vries (2013) indicate that this approach is also used to construct the world IOTs

for the World Input-Output Database Project. They indicate that practitioners prefer the fixed



          10
               See Eurostat (2008) for a more detailed explanation of these approaches.

                                                               19
product sales structure approach to the fixed industry sales structure where each industry has

its own sales structure. This is because it is more plausible that products have the same sales

structure than industries having the same sales structure. It also does not yield negative values

in cells that were not negative in the original SUT.


       In the extended SUT, export data appear only on a commodity basis; however, the IOT

resulting from the above process includes a distribution of exports by industry and firm type.

The shares for exports are applied at this stage of the process, and offsetting adjustments are

made to non-export activity to keep totals for each row unchanged. TiVA statistics can then be

calculated from this “export adjusted” IOT.


4.5 TiVA estimates

       While TiVA estimates are most rigorously calculated using international IOTs that

account for the production of all countries in the world, TiVA statistics can be calculated using

single country IOTs. We follow the approach of Ma et al. (2015) and Tang et al. (2014) and

assume that domestic content in gross exports is the same as value added in gross exports.

Because part of domestic content in gross exports is re-imported goods, our measure of

domestic value added is overstated.


       We calculate TiVA measures using a methodology that is typically used for international

IOTs. A key to calculating TiVA statistics is the Leontief inverse of the IOT. The matrix depends

on both the direct input requirements from the same industry and the indirect input

requirements from other industries. Domestic value added embodied in gross exports for an

industry depends on both these direct and indirect requirements. Following Ma et al. (2015)
                                                       20
and Tang et al. (2014), we calculate domestic value added as the product of the vector of the

domestic value added share of output for each industry, the Leontief inverse of the U.S. IOT

matrix, and the value of gross exports for each industry. Likewise, the direct domestic value

added content of gross exports is calculated as the vector of domestic value added shares of

output multiplied by the value of gross exports for each industry. Indirect domestic content of

gross exports is calculated as the difference between total and direct domestic value added.

Imported content of gross exports is calculated as the difference between gross exports and

domestic value added content of exports. We refer to this as “imported content” instead of the

more commonly used term “foreign value added” since it might also include domestic content

that had previously been exported.



5 Results

        In this section we describe the TiVA indicators that measure the contribution of U.S.

production in both domestic and global value chains. In our experimental tables, we find that

the imported content of exports is concentrated in a few industries. We also find that the

majority of content of exports in goods producing industries is from MNEs and that the majority

of content of exports in services industries is from non-MNEs. 11 The indicators suggest that

domestic value added embodied in imports from upstream foreign affiliates makes a significant

contribution to the content of exports in several industries. For example, a U.S. car


        11
            The content of exports is measured by our TiVA indicators which mainly depend on the input
requirements (including imported inputs) from our extended IOTs and the level of exports from each industry by
firm type. The result that the majority of content of exports in service industries is from non-MNEs is consistent
with the relatively high share of value added contributed by non-MNEs in services industries and the relatively
large share that own industry inputs contribute to value added.

manufacturer might export components to a subsidiary in Mexico that assembles cars for its

parent and then ships the finished cars back to its parent for sale in the United States.

Estimates from the microdata linking project suggest that the three firm types each display firm

heterogeneity to some extent.


       Powers (2012) points out that TiVA indicators typically focus on either a decomposition

of the value added content of goods where they are consumed or a decomposition of gross

trade. He shows that examining trade on a value added basis shows a different picture of

bilateral trade balances than gross trade flows. However, the total trade deficit of a country

summed across all partner countries is identical for both TiVA and gross trade flows. One core

measure of TiVA is decomposing the value added content of gross exports into domestic and

foreign components. Other things being equal, the higher the foreign value added share of

exports, the more the industry is integrated in global value chains. This could mean that the

current level of exports depends on foreign content. It is also possible that the foreign content is

substituting for potential additional domestic content.


       According to the OECD TiVA database, foreign value added content as a share of exports

for the United States has been stable, fluctuating slightly between 11 and 15 percent between

2000 and 2011. The share gradually increased from 12 percent in 2000 to 15 percent in 2011.

Foreign value added is a relatively small share of exports for the United States compared with

other major economies. Foreign value added as a share of exports in 2011 for the United States

is similar to the share of foreign value added in exports for Australia, Japan, and Russia, but is

about 10 percentage points lower than the share for most major European countries and

                                                     22
Canada, about 17 percentage points lower than the share for China and Mexico, and about 27

percentage points lower than the share of foreign value in exports for Korea. 12


5.1 Imported Content of Exports as a Share of Gross Exports

        Using our experimental extended IOT, we calculate the imported content of exports as a

share of exports for 2005 and 2012 (figure 1). Other things being equal, the higher the imported

content share of exports, the more the industry is integrated into global value chains. The

import content share across industries have a similar pattern to that observed in data from 2011

by Fetzer et al. (2016). Imported content as a share of exports is largest for petroleum

manufacturing, likely due to foreign crude oil and coal used to produce refined petroleum for

export. Imported content tends to be a small share of exports of services.


        Imported content as a share of exports in 2012 is typically either higher or very similar to

the level in 2005 (Figure 1). This is consistent with the trends in the foreign value added share of

U.S. exports calculated by the OECD. One notable exception is computers and electronics where

imported content decreased from 15 to 10 percent of exports between 2005 and 2012. The

annual OECD estimates suggest that most of the decrease in computers occurred between 2008

and 2009 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. We will analyze this change more thoroughly

by decomposing domestic and imported content by firm types.


        As noted earlier, our TiVA estimates of imported content might overstate the importance

of imported inputs since they may include domestic content that had previously been exported

from the United States. We may also understate imported inputs by MNEs because some

imports in the wholesale trade industry may be used as inputs in other industries. Our

estimates of imported content as a share of gross exports across all industries of 12.7 percent in

2005 and 14.4 percent in 2012 are smaller than the OECD’s estimates of foreign value added as

a share of gross exports of 13.0 percent in 2005 and the “nowcast” estimate of 15.5 percent in

2012. As seen in figure 2 for 2005, the OECD estimates are larger for most industries that are

comparable between the two data sets with the notable exceptions of petroleum

manufacturing, paper, and transportation.


       As shown in figures 3, 4, and 5, imported content as a share of exports varies by type of

ownership for all industries and for individual industries in both 2005 and 2012. Imported

content tends to be a larger share of exports for foreign-owned MNEs during 2012, but non-

MNEs have the highest share in several manufacturing industries in 2012 and most of

manufacturing industries in 2005. However, non-MNEs consistently have the smallest share of

imported content in services industries. As noted in section 4.2, however, at this stage, the

estimates of imports by MNEs may be understated.


       Much of imports and exports by both U.S. and foreign MNEs is trade within the MNE.

Intrafirm trade in goods is more prevalent for foreign MNEs, comprising more than 80 percent

of their imports and more than 60 percent of their exports in 2005 and 2012, while intrafirm

trade in goods by U.S. MNEs accounted for close to one-half of their trade in the same




                                                   24
periods. 13 Intrafirm trade in services made up about 20 to 30 percent of imports and exports of

trade in services by all firm types in 2005 and 2012. Intrafirm trade by U.S. parents with their

affiliates made up about 80 percent of affiliated exports and about 60 percent of affiliated

imports in 2012. 14


         Intrafirm trade in goods by foreign MNEs during 2005 and 2012 was most prevalent

among U.S. affiliates in wholesale trade and followed by U.S. affiliates in the transportation

equipment industry (mostly motor vehicle affiliates in 2005). More than one-half of U.S. MNE

imports from their foreign affiliates are by U.S. MNEs in the motor vehicle, computers and

electronics, chemicals, and petroleum manufacturing industries in 2005 and 2012. A slightly

smaller share of U.S. MNE exports to their foreign affiliates is by U.S. MNEs in these industries.


5.2 Decomposition of Value Added

         We also used the experimental tables to decompose domestic value added embodied in

exports by ownership type to get a sense of the contribution of different firm types and

imported content in exports. As shown in figure 6, close to half of the content in exports by

goods-related industries is value added by U.S. MNEs and close to two-thirds of the content of

exports in service industries is value added by non-MNEs. The remainder of content in exports

in goods related industries is distributed similarly among foreign MNEs, non-MNEs, and

imported content while the bulk of the remaining content in services-related industries is value

added by U.S. MNEs.


       Value added by U.S. MNEs is larger than the other sources in most goods-producing

industries with about one-half of the content of exports concentrated in computers and

electronics, chemicals, and other transportation industries in 2005 and 2012 (figures 7 and 8).

Two of these industries, computers and electronics and chemicals, are also among industries

with the largest share of intrafirm trade in goods by U.S. MNEs. Value added by non-MNEs is by

far the largest source of the content of exports for service industries, making up more than one-

half of value added in all service industries except for telecommunications (figure 9). Most of

the rest of the content of exports in service industries is from U.S. MNEs.


       Value added by foreign MNEs is no more than 10 percent of the content in exports in all

industries except wholesale trade, where it made up 20 percent of the content in exports in

2005 and 16 percent of content in 2012. Foreign-owned domestic value added was more

prevalent in the content of exports by goods- producing industries than service industries in

2005 and 2012. More than half of foreign-owned domestic value added content of exports was

in chemicals, motor vehicles, wholesale trade, and machinery. A majority of the intrafirm trade

in goods by U.S. affiliates is concentrated in wholesale trade and transportation equipment,

which includes motor vehicles.


       While these numbers indicate that foreign-owned MNEs contribute significant amounts

of domestic value added content of exports for some industries, some foreign-owned MNEs



                                                    26
may not be very integrated into a domestic value chain. Estimating the indirect or upstream

contribution of foreign-owned MNEs and the other firm types to the domestic value added

content of exports helps us understand to what degree value added by foreign-owned MNEs is

an input in other U.S. industries. From figures 10 and 11, we can see that most contributions of

indirect domestic value added are significant. About three-fourths of the foreign-owned

domestic value added is upstream, although this varies widely by industry.


       Non-MNEs are the largest source of value added in final demand for both goods and

service producing industries in 2012 (figure 12). Value added by non-MNEs made up three-

fourths of final demand for service industries in 2012 while it contributed slightly more to final

demand in goods producing industries than the one-third contribution by U.S. MNEs. The

difference between the contributions to final demand and exports is due to the composition of

industries contributing most to final demand compared to exports. Government services,

finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE), and health care are the largest components of final

demand and their value added primarily comes from non-MNEs. Therefore foreign-owned value

added only made up about 5 percent of final demand in 2012 compared to 13 percent of

exports. The five-percent share of final demand is slightly less than the share of value added

created by non-EU-owned enterprises in the median EU country Stapel-Weber et al. (2018).


       We can also use this decomposition to better understand the decrease in the imported

content of exports as a share of exports for the computer and electronics industry. Figure 13

shows that we can now see the changes in content export for each firm type. There does not

appear to be a significant substitution of domestic value added for imported content within a

                                                    27
firm type between 2005 and 2012. The decline in imported content as a share of exports

between 2005 and 2012 is mostly due to an increase in direct domestic value added by non-

MNEs with small decreases in imported content and indirect domestic value added. U.S. MNEs

used less imported content in their exports, but their domestic value added also decreases.


5.3 Labor Productivity

       Our results also indicate that MNEs are more productive than non-MNEs overall and in

many key industries. This is consistent with Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen (2012) who find

that U.S. and other multinationals in the UK were more productive than domestic firms from

1995 to 2003.


       Consistent with the productivity sorting hypothesis of Melitz (2003) and Helpman et al.

(2004), we find that labor productivity measured by gross output per employee for both U.S.-

owned MNEs and foreign-owned MNEs is almost twice as large as that for non-MNEs in both

2005 and 2012 When measuring labor productivity by value added as a share of employment,

U.S.-owned MNEs and foreign-MNEs are almost 25 percent more productive than non-MNEs

across all industries. However, non-MNEs are more productive on a value added basis than

MNEs when the high productivity petroleum manufacturing industry is excluded. It is not

surprising that productivity is smaller for MNEs when based on value added rather than gross

output because value added doesn’t account for productivity associated with utilizing

intermediate inputs (Eldridge and Price (2016)). Consistent with the framework developed by

Bernard et al. (2018) on productivity of global firms, we expect that one source of high

productivity of MNEs is their ability to source inputs from domestic and foreign firms.

                                                   28
       Compared to non-MNEs, labor productivity on a gross output basis was higher for

foreign-owned MNEs in most industries, and higher for U.S. MNEs in about one-half of our

industries. Labor productivity was higher for both foreign-owned and domestic-owned MNEs

during 2005 and 2012 in several industries with significant amounts of MNE gross output and

employment including food, beverage, and tobacco; machinery; transportation; and utilities

and construction.


5.4 Analysis of Value Added and Exports for the Semiconductor Industry Using

Linked Microdata

       The quality of the estimates discussed so far is lessened by the necessity of

approximating establishment-level data for MNEs from enterprise-level AMNE data collected by

BEA combined with patterns in establishment-level data for all U.S. firms collected by the

Census Bureau. Ultimately, we hope to build more accurate extended SUTs using linked

enterprise-establishment microdata for all firms rather than converting the enterprise level BEA

MNE data to the establishment level and then imposing the MNE data on the published

establishment level SUTs. While the establishment level conversion is an accepted method of

converting the data, it is still necessary to reconcile remaining inconsistencies between the BEA

enterprise data and the establishment level Census data.


       As an initial exercise working with the linked microdata, we constructed these data for

U.S. establishments in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. We cannot provide tabular

results at this stage due to data disclosure constraints. Using the linked Census and BEA AMNE

microdata, we measure the components of value added, gross output, and employment for the

                                                   29
semiconductor industry by type of ownership, firm size, and export intensity. On an ownership

basis, value added as a share of output is highest for U.S. MNEs and lowest for foreign MNEs.

The low share for foreign MNEs is consistent with Zeile (1998) who found that, in the electronic

components and accessories industry in 1989, foreign-owned U.S. businesses had a domestic

content of 72 percent, compared with 87 percent for domestic-owned businesses. On a firm

size class basis, value added as a share of output is highest for medium-sized enterprises and is

lowest for small enterprises. On an export intensity basis, value added as a share of gross

output is higher for exporting firms than for non-exporters.


       All else equal, we would have expected value added as a share of gross output to be

smaller for large firms and exporters since they are more likely to be part of global value chains

than medium firms. This intuition is supported by Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2009). However,

it may be that the commodity mix of exports and imports differs among the different firm types

so that what we are interpreting as a quantity effect is really a price effect. We will be better

able to understand these patterns at a later stage when we have integrated product-level

goods trade data, including imported goods data, into our analysis. The ratio of exports to gross

output follows a more expected pattern with exports as a share of gross output highest for

MNEs and for larger firms.


       The ownership criteria accounts for more heterogeneity in value added and its

components than firm size class and export intensity criteria. The range between the smallest

and largest value added shares of output is almost 10 percentage points based on ownership

compared with a range of less than seven percentage points for both firm size class and export

                                                    30
intensity (see figure 14). Also, there is greater variance in the three value added to gross output

shares based on ownership than in the three shares based on firm size class.


       Firm size class accounts for more heterogeneity in exports as a share of gross output

than the ownership criteria with a range of 24 percentage points compared to range of 20

percentage points for the ownership criteria (see figure 15). This supports our expectation that

export intensity of the two types of MNEs are similar, and the difference between export

intensities of small and large firms capture a great degree of heterogeneity.


       Direct comparisons between the experimental ESUT and the semiconductor estimates

are difficult for several reasons. First, we are unable to disaggregate the industries in our

experimental ESUT down to the 3344 NAICS semiconductor industry for a direct comparison.

Semiconductors are a subset of the computer and electronics industry, making up only about

one-fourth of the value added and less than one-third of sales in 2012 for the industry. Second,

due to the preliminary nature of the data linking work we are not able to disclose TiVA

measures such as the value added share of exports and final demand due to data needed from

other industries outside of the scope of our case study. We are limited to estimating metrics

that can be calculated using the establishment-level data for the semiconductor industry such

as the value added and export shares of output by firm type that used in work such as Fetzer

and Strassner (2015).


       While these results are experimental and only for one industry, they suggest that the

three firm types (by ownership, size, and export intensity) account for some heterogeneity in



                                                    31
production patterns and that different types of heterogeneity may be more important for

different measures of economic activity. Some unexpected results suggest that more work is

needed at the microdata level to ensure that components of output and inputs are being

measured and classified properly.



6 Conclusion

       In this paper we construct experimental extended SUTs and TiVA estimates for the

United States for 2005 and 2012. We find that the imported content of exports is concentrated

in a few industries such as petroleum and motor vehicle manufacturing. Most of the content of

exports by firms in goods-producing industries is from U.S. MNEs and most of the content of

exports in services industries is from non-MNEs. However, domestic value added embodied in

inputs from upstream foreign affiliates makes a significant contribution to the content of

exports in several industries. We also find that value added to the content by MNEs is

concentrated in several industries in which their intrafirm trade in goods is concentrated. More

refined estimates for the semiconductor industry based on the Census-BEA microdata linking

project suggest that while the ownership criteria most accounts for heterogeneity in the value

added share of output, firm size class accounts for more heterogeneity in export intensity.


       Our results provide further evidence that accounting for firm heterogeneity matters in

measuring production. It allows us to better understand the role of global value chains in the

U.S. economy. Even though our analysis using a single country IOT doesn’t account for

imported content that was originally exported from the United States, we are able to show how


                                                   32
U.S. production relies on inputs from both domestic and global supply chains. Our results also

inform us about the degree to which foreign ownership contributes to U.S. production.


        Looking ahead, BEA is participating in statistical initiatives with the OECD and with the

APEC where work continues to develop the framework for extended SUTs and APEC regional

SUTs and IOTs and associated TiVA estimates. The aim of this work is to incorporate the APEC

database into the OECD database in the next year. Additionally, BEA and the USITC are

collaborating with Statistics Canada and Mexico’s Instituto Nacional de Estadistíca y Geografía

to develop North American regional SUTs and TiVA statistics with a goal to complete the

regional SUT and TiVA statistics in the next year and extended tables and TiVA measures around

2020.


        Lastly, much work remains to improve the statistical infrastructure to support efforts to

measure the role of global value chains in the U.S. economy. This work includes enhancing the

international comparability of BEA’s SUTs and continuing to expand the detail BEA publishes on

exports and imports by type of service and by country. In addition, a critical goal is to extend

the analysis done on semiconductors to produce official extended SUTs under the microdata

linking project with the Census Bureau. This project will link BEA’s AMNE and trade in services

data with data from Census Bureau economic surveys and Census data on trade in goods across

all industries. The output of this linking project, expected to be completed in 2021, will identify

firm-level heterogeneity tabulations that, ideally, will be made available for use on a recurring

basis to construct official statistics.
