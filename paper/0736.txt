     This empirical study stresses the underlying macroeconomic forces

which determine foreign trade flows in CPEs. The general specification

includes a planners' demand equation for the volume of imports, a planners'

supply equation for the volume of exports, and a rest—of—world demand

equation for the export price level. The planners' behavioural equations

include variables for activity levels, trade balance constraints, prices,

and domestic excess demand. The import price is exogenous. This simul-

taneous equation model is estimated on annual data from the mid—1950s

to the mid—1970s, for Czechoslovakia, the GDR, Hungary, and Poland. Maximum

likelihood estimation in a nested hypothesis testing framework allows

selection of restricted versions of the general model for each country.

Estimated price elasticities accord with the underlying theory, and the

excess demand variables perform well.

 1. Introduction
In this paper we study empirically how the foreign trade flows

of centrally planned economies (CPEs) ,      considered as macro-
economic variables, are related to other macroeconomic

variables. We do not disaggregate imports or exports either
geographically or by commodity. Rather, we are concerned to

bring out as clearly as possible how foreign trade aggregates

respond to macro—level forces. In particular, we model how the

planners adjust import and export volumes in pursuit of

aggregate—level objectives subject to aggregate—level con-
straints and pressures.


This emphasis on seeking macroeconomic regularities in CPE
foreign trade runs counter to some themes in the literature.

First, there is Kornaits (1981) recent far—reaching critique
of the application of any form of strictly macroeconomic

analysis to CPEs. He maintains that in these economies relative
prices are so distorted, micro—level excess demands so wide-

spread, and "forced substitution" consequently so extensive
that the aggregation problem is qualitatively worse than for
market economies, indeed insurmountable. We argue here and
elsewhere, however, that macro—economic analysis and macro—
econometrics are in fact useful in understanding how CPEs

work (see Portes, 1980, 1981; Portes and Winter, 1980).

On the foreign trade side, the literature has quite naturally
stressed the specificity of CPE institutional structures, the

differences from market economy mechanisms, and a certain degree
of arbitrariness (even capriciousness) in "planned" foreign

trade (see Pryor, 1963; Nove, 1965; Levine, 1968). As Weiss
and Wolter (1979) suggest, as long as we see CPE imports and

exports simply as "closing" the material balances, filling
gaps and disposing of surpluses, we tend to regard their trade
as unstable and unpredictable. But this is a typically micro—
                            3




economic perspective, and as they point out, both their
own work and other recent empirical studies do not validate
it, even at the micro level (see also Rosefielde, 1973;

van Brabant,973; Brada, 1976; Vanous, 1978a, 1978b).



 The planners are concerned with maintaining both internal
 and external balance, and the two are necessarily related for

 any economy. Thus there will be some effect of domestic
 demand (and excess demand) on foreign trade.     With fixed
 domestic prices, the planners are the fundamental equilibrating

 mechanism in the economy (Portes 1979a, 1979b, l979c).
 Disaggregation would lose some aspects of this search for
macroeconomic equilibrium, however justified it might other-
wise be to take account of specific characteristics of intra-

CMEA as opposed to East-West trade, or of trade in machinery
as opposed to trade in agricultural goods, etc.




We treat four countries on a comparable basis: Czechoslovakia,

the GDR, Hungary, and Poland. The data are annual observations
from the mid-l950s to the rnid-1970s ( so the coverage is the

same as in Portes and Winter, 1980). It is part of our main-
tained hypothesis that the general macroeconomic framework
for foreign trade is similar across these four countries,
with some differences for which we can test within the same
                            4




general structure.1    We assume also that the central planners

exhibit stable behaviour which is rational in the sense of

maximisation subject to constraints.


We have several objectives. First, we wish to identify the
directions and magnitudes of the responses of trade flows to
domestic and foreign sector macro variables in these four

CPEs. Second, we shall test alternative hypotheses about
planners' foreign trade behaviour. Both these investigations
will yield comparisons across countries. We shall also
consider whether the overall structure has been stable over

time in individual countries, and in particular, whether
behaviour changed noticeably at the beginning of the l970s,

as is often claimed.


II   The Macroeconomic Framework of CPE Foreign Trade

We begin with the relevant institutional features of CPEs and
their consequences for foreign trade (for details, see Holzman,

1968; Wiles, 1968; Neuberger and Tyson, 1980; Wolf, 1980)
The "price equalisation account" completely separates domestic
prices from foreign prices. The foreign trade enterprises
buy imports and sell exports at foreign currency prices, which
for their internal accounts are converted to units of domestic

currency at an accounting exchange rate bearing no relation
to the domestic price level. They sell the imports to and buy
exports from domestic users and producers, respectively, at the

domestic prices, which are typically fixed (by the planners)
                            5



 for long periods. The accounting profit or loss on the
 aggregate of these transactions is directly appropriated
 by the state budget.


 Hence there is no functioning exchange rate, no link between
 domestic and foreign prices, and no link between trade and
 foreign exchange reserve flows on one hand and monetary assets
 held by households and firms on the other. The currency is

 inconvertible, there are no "autonomous" international capital

 flows (and those accommodating trade are directly controlled
 by the planners), and no real balance effects arise from the

  foreign sector. Furthermore, most of the endogeiious feedback
  mechanisms characteristic of macroeconomic relations
/\lfl market economies are broken (Portes, 1980). And the


planners can and normally do ensure full employment directly.

Thus the CPEs do not exhibit the "demand multiplier" effects

of Keynesian macroeconomics; in particular, exports have no

demand multiplier effects. They do however finance the imports
essential to production, so we may have a "bottleneck multiplier",
insofar as a fall in exports might force cuts in imports, hence

in production, hence in export supply ....   With the rigidities
of the physical planning system, we should also expect relatively
low price-elasticitje of import demand and export supply. The

domestic economy is substantially "insulated" from events in the
foreign sector, since many of the transmission and propagation
channels operating in market economies are not effective in

CPEs (see Neuberger, Portes, and Tyson, 1981).
                          6



On the other hand, all the standard national income identities
apply also to the CPEs. In particular, the balance of trade

(net exports) must equal output minus absorption (domestic

utilisation). If planned absorption cannot be met by
planned output plus net imports, there will be excess demand

domestically; if planned output exceeds planned absorption by
more than the economy can transfer abroad in net exports at
acceptable terms of trade, there will be excess supply domes-

tically. Either case can of course occur with markets for

both exports and imports in equilibrium.




Just as in a market economy, the planners must also consider both
internal and external balance as policy objectives, as well as
the potential conflict between them. Our underlying model of
theprocess of plan construction in an open CPE and the relations
between internal and external balance is set out in Portes

(l979c). The planners in plan construction (ex ante) maximise
a utility function defined on household consumption and govern-

ment expenditure, subject to constraints representing aggregate
balance between availability and utilization of output, equilibrium
on the consumption goods and labour markets, and a balance of
trade target depending on past balance of trade outcomes. In

plan implementation, planners' errors and exogenous shocks will
in general create disequilibria which will not be eliminated

by price changes.
                          7



In the present paper we relax two assumptions of the original

model: that export prices are exogenous, and that imports are
in fixed proportion to output. Here, we allow the demand
curve for exports to be downward sloping, and the ratio of

imports to output is determined endogenously. The model
thus modified suggests that current quantities of imports and

exports will depend on output, foreign trade prices, the
balance of trade target, and the requirements of internal
balance. We do assume that the typical CPE is a "small"

country        as an importer, though not as an exporter.

Thus imports are taken to be in infinitely elastic supply at

a price given by world market conditions.

The model has some interesting implications for the price elas-
ticities of import demand and export supply. Whereas Holzman
(1968) suggests the price elasticity of import demand for CPEs

is near zero and the price elasticity of export supply is near
—1, we expect the former to be less than zero and the latter

to be greater than —1. First, an improvement in the terms
of trade will permit an increase in real wages and (assuming

a positively sloped labour supply schedule) output. Thus a
fall in import prices is likely to lead to an increase in

imports even if imports are in fixed proportion to output.
Similarly, a rise in export prices is unlikely to lead to

a proportionate fall in export volume, given the trade balance

target. Second, an improvement in the terms of trade may bring an
                           8




increase in trade turnover relative to national income. Thus

a fall in import prices may lead to increased import (and
export) volume and a rise in export prices may cause an

increase in the quantity of exports (and imports).


Note finally a problem to which we return below: in principle,

depending on the lags actually operating in the processes of

plan construction and implementation, output might depend on
imports, as well as the converse. This relation might arise
not only from import "bottleneck effects" (the role of imported
intermediate goods in production), but also from the effects
of consumer goods imports on overall consumer goods supply,
hence on labour supply. But inventories might be sufficient
to make these effects operate with significant lags.



III Specification of_the Model

Our model has three equations and three endogenous variables,

exports (volume), imports (volume) and export price. The
behaviour of the planners determines the two quantities through

the demand for imports and the supply of exports relationships.
The various importing agencies in the rest of the world determine
export demand. We normalize this relationship on export
prices partly for convenience and partly on the grounds of
realism. Clearly any normalization is to some extent

arbitrary, and the FIML estimates we give below are independent
of normalization.
                            9



 Given the state monopoly of foreign trade, one may question
 the existence of an autonomous export supply schedule. Under

 a wide range of assumptions about planners' objectives, the

optimal volume of exports depends on the price elasticity of
demand. If this elasticity were variable there would be no

unique supply price, and attempts to estimate a supply schedule
would be meaningless. Fortunately the data are consistent
with the hypothesis that the price elasticity of demand is
constant. (Our tests of this hypothesis are described below.)


In the most general version, we specify import demand and export

supply completely symmetrically. The planners are considered
to fix the volumes of exports and imports in relation to four

different determinants: the general level of activity in the
economy, prices, balance of payments constraint, and excess
demand pressures within the economy. The general level of
activity is measured by net material product (NMP), prices
by the appropriate unit value indices (Px for exports, PM for

exports). The balance of payments constraint is measured by
last period's trade balance defined in ratio form (TB).

Two quite different variables were used to measure excess
demand inside the CPE. Excess demand can occur either in the

consumption goods market or in the investment goods market.
The occurrence of excess demand in the two markets may be

associated (see Kornai, 1981), but not necessarily. In any
case, we expect the reaction of the planners to excess demand
                             10



 in these markets to be different. The costs to the planners
 of excess demand for consumer goods and its possible reper-
 cussions on labour supply behaviour and political stability

 are quite different from those involved in the delay of an

 investment project. In the event, our measure of excess
demand for investment goods, the growth of gross investment
and defence expenditures, never had a significant role and was
dropped from the specification at an early stage of estimation.




Our measure of excess demand on the consumer good market
was taken from the disequilibrium estimates given in Portes
 and Winter (1980), updated where possible. The variable
was constructed from the demand and supply relationships
estimated in a model that did not assume market clearing.
Our excess demand variable here is the ratio of fitted
demand to fitted supply at constant prices.




The general forms of the import demand and export supply
equations are as follows:

Mt = a    + a1NMP + a2PX2 + a3PM + a4TB      1   + a5ED1 + u1       (1)
   =
       b0 + b1NMPt + b2Pxt + b3PMt + b4TBt   1   + bSEDt i   + u2   (2)
                               11



All variables are measured in natural logs, and

Mt
         =   the volume of imports
         =   the volume of exports

NMPt
         =   net   material product

PX       =   the price of exports

PMt
         =   the price of imports

TBt_i
         =   the ratio of the value of exports to the
             value of imports in the previous period

EDt1
         =   the ratio of estimated demand for consumption
             goods to estimated supply, lagqed one period
ulu2t =      random error

Note that the way in which the indices have been constructed

and the logarithmic specification imply the identity:

TBt=Xt+PXt_Mt_PMt                                            (3)


The above specification has been termed general, to distinguish
it from the more restricted models presented below. We are

aware, however, that the dynamic specification is not particu-
larly general.     But with our relatively small data samples,

it is not possible to estimate general lag structures which

could then be restricted along lines suggested by the data. Some
slightly different lag specifications were estimated and are
discussed below. It could also be argued along rational

expectations lines that TBt1 and EDt1 capture all relevant
past information on the economy.


So far, we have limited our discussion to two equations of our

three equation system. The third, the export demand equation,
                                   12



determines the price of exports. It is specified as follows:

  PX= C + c1X + c2WTt + c3PW + u3
where (as before) all variables are given in natural logs.

         =       a weighted aveage of CMEA and market economy
WTt
                 import values.
         =       a weighed average of CMEA and market economy export
PW               prices.
         =       a random error term

The two exogenous variables in equation (4) provide
identifying restrictions for the first two equations.
(At least one of the two exogenous variables in equation (4)
is required for identification.)


In practice, we could not reject the hypothesis that the export
demand equations for Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland were

homogeneous in prices. Therefore we estimated these equations
in the form

      PRt = C0 + c1X + c2WTDt + u3                         (5)


where PRt =                — PW
                 PXt
and    WTDt = WTt_

Furthermore, in the case of Czechoslovakia we could not reject
the restriction that c1 = —c2.          Hence we estimated the export

demand equation for Czechoslovakia in the form
      PR =   C    + c1XR + u3                              (6)


where XRt =
                 X     -
                           WTDt.
                                    13




Each of the above demand functions is log—linear, with the
assumption of a constant price elasticity of demand. This
assumption is required for the existence of an autonomous

export supply schedule. Because of the importance of the
constant elasticity specification we tested it against more

general functional forms, but found that the additional
coefficients were never significantly different from zero.


The equations (1), (2) and (4) form our three-equation system
in the most general specification for which we attempted to
estimate it. A number of variants which allowed for a different
dynamic structure were also estimated, and these are discussed

below. For our general specification we expect the coefficients
to take the following signs:

a1, a2, a4, a5 >      0;   a3 < 0        (import demand)

b1 >   0;   b, b5 < 0;     b, b3 0       (export supply)

c2, c3 >    0;   c1 < 0                  (export demand)


The one exception to conventional signs on income and price

elasticities might arise for b2 and b3, if the volume of exports
is determined so as to satisfy a balance of payments target,

given other variables (see Section II). The lagged balance of
trade term has a positive relation with current imports and a

negative one with current exports. The excess demand variable
                            14



has a positive coefficient for import demand and a negative

one for export supply, reflecting the planners' attempts to
achieve macroeconomic equilibrium. In the export demand
equation, world trade and world trade prices affect export

prices positively.


At an early stage in the estimation, more general lag speci-
fications were investigated. These included redefining the main
trending variables in first difference form, including a lagged

dependent variable, a lagged exports term in the export demand
equation, and time trends in each equation. In no case was

the more general specification unambiguously superior. It
should be noted that the expected signs of the lagged trade

balance terms imply negative implicit coefficients of the

lagged dependent variable in equations (1) and (2).

Another alternative specification is that instead of last year's
trade balance, a cumulative measure of trade performance would

provide a better measure of the effect of past performance on
the current perceived trade balance constraint. These countries

do not publish data on their foreign exchange reserves, so a
three—year sum of trade balance terms was tried. The preliminary
estimates using this term were not, however, superior to those
obtained with the one-year trade balance. The latter is clearly
less than satisfactory, and we should at least try to allow for
the recent rapid accumulation of convertible currency debt by
                             15



these countries, but reliable time series for this debt begin
only from 1971. Starting from these data, it may be possible
to develop an alternative measure for use in future work.



In view of our preliminary results, we preferred our general

specification in the form we have given. The hypothesis that
there is no first order serial correlation can be rejected in
all cases. But our preliminary search over more complicated
dynamic specifications indicated that this apparent serial
correlation could not be substantially reduced except at an
excessive cost in lost degrees of freedom.


At this stage, we also considered whether current NMP should
be treated as an endogenous variable. The volume of imports,
at least, could affect NMP. It is not our purpose here to
estimate a complete macroeconomic model of a CPE, in which

NMP is determined endogenously. Nevertheless, we investigated
the cost of assuming that NMP is exogenous, by replacing the
current value of NMP with an ad hoc instrument. The resulting
estimates all indicated a small negative bias arising from

ignoring the endogeneity of NMP. Since the coefficients changed
•by less than one estimated standard error, we decided that it was

simpler to treat the current value of NMP as exogenous.

IV   Results



The initial investigations of the robustness of our

general specification which we have been discussing were

based on two-stage least squares estimates (TSLS). However,
once we had adopted the general model we went over to
full information maximum         likelihood estimation and
based tests of restrictions on the general model on the
likelihood ratio criterion.



Our initial TSLS and FIML estimates indicated the presence
of serial correlation.       In order to obtain unbiased
estimates of the standard errors we adopted a technique
(ARFIML) which assumes a first—order vector autoregressive

error process.    Under this assumption the current error
of one equation may depend not only on its own lagged
value but also on the lag.ged values of the errors of the

other two equations.     Such a vector autoregressive
process is plausible whenever there may be both
contemporaneous correlation of errors across equations
and serial correlation of errors within equations.         The
technique and the package which implements it are described
in Hendry and Srba (1980).      Under the maintained

hypothesis of first-order vector autoregressive errors, we
conducted2 tests of restrictions on the ratrix of
autoregressive parameters.      The hypothesis that the
                           17




matrix is diagonal could be rejected for every country

but Hungary.     The preferred model for Hungary was

reestimated under the restrictions of a diagonal matrix,

using TSP's FIML routine.       The eigenvalues of the
matrices of autoregressive parameters were all within the

unit circle, indicating stability of the error processes.


Perhaps more interesting than the serial correlations

are the contemporaneous cross—equation correlations of
residuals.     If these correlations were large in absolute
value they might indicate that the same omitted variables
were exercising major influences on two or more of the

endogenous variables.       On the one hand one might suspect
that unobserved variables such as production bottlenecks,
labor unrest, bad weather, etc. would influence imports

positively and exports negatively.       On the other hand,
any omitted variable which increases imports and has no
direct influence on exports might be expected to have an

indirect positive effect on exports via the balance of
trade constraint.       Similarly any influence which
increases exports will relax the balance of trade

constraint and permit greater imports.


In practice, we found that the contemporaneou9 correlations
of the residuals of the export supply and import demand

equations were generally small, suggesting that the above—
mentioned factors were unimportant or mutually offsetting.
Only in the case of Poland was the contemporaneous
                          18




correlation of residuals from the export and import
equations above .5 for both the general and restricted

model.    A possible explanation is that Poland may have

been operating, at least for some part of the period,

with exceptionally small foreign exchange reserves and

unused borrowing capacity.       If Poland was operating

unusually close to a trade balance constraint, any
reduction in exports would have to be closely matched

by a contemporaneous reduction in imports, while any
increase in imports would need to be financed by an

increase in exports.

Starting from the general model we tested a number of

restrictions, seeking the most parsimoniously parameterised
model which could not be rejected.      In particular, we
tested the hypothesis that the import demand and export
supply schedules are homegeneous in prices (a2 =
                                                      -a3,
b2 =   -b3) and that certain coefficients are zero.          In
the tables which follow we present in the first column
the general model and in the second column the most

restricted acceptable model.       Restricted coefficients
are starred.       None of the restricted models presented
here can be rejected at the .10 level.



In the general model for Czechoslovakia, the estimated

import and export demand equations conform to expectations.
In contrast, the estimated export supply schedule looks
surprising.      The only estimated coefficients in this
equation which are significantly different from zero are
those of TB1 and ED1, and the latter has an unexpected
positive sign.


In the parsimonious model for Czechoslovakia, homogeneity

is imposed on the import demand equation and four

insignificant variables are excluded.     The ability of
only two variables (TB1 and ED_1) to explain well over
99% of the variance of X is due to the upward trend in
X and ED_1 and the downward trend in            The positive
                                        TB1.
estimated coefficients of both ED_1 terms may be ascribed

to the commodity composition of Czech trade.

Consumption goods comprise a larger percentage of Czech
imports than of Cz.ech exports.    As a consequence,

Czechoslovakia can increase the supply of consumption

goods by undertaking a balanced expansion of trade.
Thus excess demand for consumption goods need not be

countered by a reduction in exports.



In the case of the G.D.R., the general model contains
three estimated coefficients which are smaller than their
standard errors, namely, those of the price terms in the
export supply equation and that of X in the export demand

equation.    In the restricted model the price variables

are excluded from the export supply equation and the
estimated coefficient of X in the export demand equation

is significantly less than zero.       The only unexpected
sign in the restricted model is that of the estimated

coefficient of TB_1 in the export supply equation.
One might suspect that TB_1 is picking up the effects of

the lagged dependent variable.     But when we reestimated

the model with TB_1 broken up into its components

(X_1, PX1, M_1, PM1), we found that the estimated
coefficient of     was not significantly different from

zero.



The possibility of a negatively sloped export supply
schedule may raise doubts about the stability of the
                         25


export markets of the G.D.R.       If prices rise when there

is excess demand, the market is obviously stable because

the supply schedule is more steeply sloped than the demand

schedule. Under Marshallian quantity adjustment assumptions,
however, the export market is clearly unstable. But these
assumptions are not relevant to CPE export supply. Holzman

(1968) expected a negatively sloped export supply curve not
because he supposed economies of scale to be important, but
because he believed export quantity is adjusted to fulfil a
trade balance target despite demand price fluctuations.
                                           supplied falls when
Under Holzmafl'S assumptions, the quantity

demand price exceeds supply price.




The time series available for Hungary are shorter than

those for the other three countries.       This prevented us

from obtaining ARFIML estimates of the general model.
Ordinary FIML estimates of this model are presented in

column one of Table 4.        The reported standard errors

may be biased downwards by the presence of serial

correlation.    Nonetheless it is evident that estimated

coefficients of TB_1 are not significantly different from

zero and that the model is nearly homogeneous in prices.
By excluding TB1 from the model and imposing homogeneity
we obtained a restricted model which could be estimated

by ARFIML.     On the basis of these estimates we could not
                           26


reject the hypothesis that the matrix of autoregressive

parameters was diagonal.        Consequently we reestimated

the restricted model with a diagonal matrix.       The

estimated coeffients of this last model (as shown in

column two) all take the expected signs, and all except
that of ED_1 in the import equation differ significantly
from zero.



In the case of Poland all of the estimated coefficients
of the general model have the expected signs and all but

those of ED_1 and that of TB1 in the export supply
equation exceed their standard errors.        When ED_1 is

excluded, as in the restricted model, all of the remaining
estimated coefficients exceed their standard errors.
The sum of the estimated coefficients of X and WTD in the

export demand equation nearly vanished, so we estimated
a model in which PR depends only on (X - WTD).        This

restriction was rejected at the .10 level although not at

the .05 level.     The restriction made very little

difference to the estimated coefficients.


We wish to draw attention to the estimates of price
elasticities and the role of excess demand in our model.

Because import prices are exogenous, the price elasticity
of import demand is simply the coefficient of PM in the

import equation.     Estimates of these coefficients taken

from the restricted models are collected in the first column
of Table 6.      In each case except that of Hungary both

the general and the restricted models suggest a price
                           27




elasticity of import demand significantly less than zero.

For Hungary, the elasticity is weakly determined in the

general model but significantly negative in the restricted

model.

**   The product of the coefficient of PX in the export
     supply equation and the coefficient of PW in the e.xport

     demand equation. For Czechoslovakia and the G.D.R., the
     zero restrictions are accepted by the data.

Because export price is endogenous and there is a state

monopoly of foreign trade, the price elasticity of export
supply cannot simply be read off from the estimated

coefficients of PX in the export supply equation.        An

increase in export demand will have an effect on the
quantity supplied which will in turn, have an effect on
                        28




the demand price of exports.     To circumvent this problem
we have calculated the elasticity of export supply with

respect to world market prices by multiplying together
the estimated coefficients of PX in the export supply
equation and PW in the export demand equation.      These

products are reported in the second column of Table 6.

The elasticity of export supply with respect to world market
prices is zero for Czechoslovakia and the G.D.R. (restrictions

which are not rejected by the data) but positive for Hungary and
Poland.

The reported price elasticities of imports and exports
are short—run elasticities.     To work out the long run
elasticities one must take account of the presence of
the lagged dependent variables in the trade balance teim.
Where the estimated coefficients of TB_1 take the expected
signs the long-run elasticities will be smaller in absolute
value than their short—run analogs.      This relationship
between long- and short-run elasticities means that some

overshooting occurs in response to price changes.


The estimated elasticities of import demand and export

supply with respect to lagged excess demand can be read
off directly from Tables 2-5.    As expected, the estimated
elasticity of imports with respect to excess demand is

always positive, although for Hungary and Poland it is
not significantly different from zero.     The estimated

elasticity of exports is negative and significant, as
                            29



expected, for the GDR and Hungary.        It is negative but

insignificant for Poland.        Surprisingly, it is positive
and significant for Czechoslovakia.        As noted above,

the positive influence of lagged excess demand on both

Czech imports and exports may be explained by the lower
share of consumption goods in Czech exports than in

Czech imports.
     The lagged trade balance term did not perform as well
as the excess demand variable in the planners' behavioural

equations. We indicated above that it might be a poor proxy
for the determinants of the balance of trade constraint which

the planners perceive when they are formulating the plan.
That a trade balance constraint is actually perceived does

receive strong support, however, from the excellent perform-
ance of the export price in the import demand equation, where
it appears with a significant positive coefficient for all
four countries.

     The estimated first order serial correlation coefficients
do indicate significant autocorrelation in some instances. We
could not accept diagonality of the coefficient matrix for
three of the four countries; and considering only the diago-
nal elements, six out of twelve are significant. On the other
hand, only three exceed 0.35 (in the Czechoslovakian export
supply, East German export price, and Polish import demand

equations) .   We   were nonetheless concerned about the stability
of the estimates, especially in view of the limited number of
observations. We also thought the end of the 1950s and the
beginning of the 1970s might mark off qualitatively different
periods in foreign trade behaviour for these countries; and we
                         30



wanted in any case to identify any years which appeared
anomalous.

     We therefore carried out two types of tests. One was for
structural stability. The Chow test is inappropriate in a
simultaneous model of this kind, so we used dummy variables.

For each country in separate experiments we introduced into
all three equations a dummy variable, first for a shift in
1960, then for a shift in 1971. We could test for each of
these years whether the dummy variable should appear in any
individual equation and whether the likelihood ratio criter-
ion indicated it should appear for the model as a whole. For
the restricted models, only the 1960 shift in the Polish
export demand equation appeared significant, and that did not
hold for the Polish model as a whole. Otherwise, we could
accept the absence of any shift in individual equations and
in the entire model for each country for both years. This is
particularly interesting in that it does not confirm the view
that there were discrete, dramatic changes in the planners'
foreign trade behaviour, especially at the beginning of the
1970s. It is also very encouraging support for the overall
stability of the estimates.
     Second, we examined the performance of dynamic simula-
tions of the estimated restricted models and the outlying
observations in these simulations (where a simulation substan-
tially over— or under—predicted the actual value of the depen-
dent variable). The standard errors of the simulation residu-
als are given in Table 7 and may be compared with the structu-
ral standard errors shown in the second columns of Tables 2—5.

    These are for the general model for Hungary.


        The estimated models are clearly robust under simulation
and track rather well. For the twelve equations, there were
in total only ten observations lying two or more standard
errors away from the simulated paths. Of these, four were
from 1973 (under-predicting export prices for the G.D.R. and
Hungary, import volumes for the G.D.R. and Poland) and two
from 1974. The extraordinarily severe credit restrictions in

Hungary in 1969 (following the 1968 reforms) pushed imports
well below predicted levels, and actual Czechoslovakian exports
were much under their simulated level in 1968. This leaves
only two outliers without obvious explanations (under—predic-
tion of Polish imports in 1962 and export prices in 1957)
       The tests for structural stability and the dynamic simu—
lations may be regarded as additional diagnostics, which we
regard as important in view of the limitations of our data
in relation to the amount of information we have sought to
extract from them. The estimates stand up well, and we can
                                 32



add that they were all duplicated using alternative algo-
rithms. Finally, we stress the protection against data—
mining provided by estimating the same model, with similar
results, over time series for four different countries with

similar economic characteristics. This is a great benefit

from doing explicitly comparative macroeconomics.




V.       Conclusions



Starting from the general specification in equations
(1), (2) and (4) we have for each country been able to

select a plausible parsimonious model.          In the case of

Czechoslovakia, NMP, the terms of trade, and lagged
excess demand determine imports, while the lagged trade
balance and lagged excess demand determine export supply.

For the G.D.R., NMP, the export price, the import price,
the lagged trade balance and lagged excess demand all

influence imports, while only NMP, the lagged trade
balance, and lagged excess demand affect the supply of

exports.        In the case of   Hungary, NMP, the terms of

trade,   and   lagged excess demand have symmetrical effects

on imports and export supply.          For Poland, NMP, the

price of exports, the price of imports, and the lagged
trade balance have symmetrical effects on exports and

imports.       All four countries are found to face down-
ward sloping demand curves with constant price elasticities.
                        33



Perhaps the greatest novelties in our results are the

findings that the price elasticity of export supply is
non—negative, except possibly in the case of the G.D.R.,
and that lagged excess demand has a significant influence

on foreign trade, except in the case of Poland.



Overall, the evidence is consistent with our initial

hypothesis that central planners, seeking simultaneously
internal and external balance, adjust aggregate exports
and imports in response to identifiable macroeconomic
variables.

1. The lower foreign trade dependence of the USSR might

    suggest different relationships between foreign trade
    and macroeconomic adjustment than in other CPEs, but we

   do not deal with the Soviet Union here because of
   data limitations.



2. We ignore here the departures from this "standard
   system" made by Hungary in 1968 and Poland in the

   early l970s.


3. WT is n (.67 CMEA + .33 OTHER) where CMEA is total
   imports of COMECON countries, excluding the exporting
   country, and OTHER is imports of non-COMECON countries,
   both expressed in current US $; PW is

   th(XPCMEA +    (lA)PME) where X is the average of the 1958
   and 1975 shares of COMECON countries in the exporting
   country's exports; CMEA is a unit value index for
   intra—COMECON trade and P is a unit value index for
   trade among market economies. Exchange rates and the world
   and regional import aggregates are taken from UN Yearbook of
   International Trade Statistics and UN Statistical Yearbook.

   All other data are from Rudcenko (1978). For all but Hungary,
   PM and PX are unit value indices constructed from the value
   data and quantity indices in Rudcenko (1978), while for Hungary,
   M and X are constructed from value data and unit value indices.
