                                        ABSTRACT

Publishing takes a long time in economics. Consequently, many authors release "working"
versions of their papers. Using data on the NBER working paper series, we show that the
dissemination of economics research suffers from an overcrowding problem: An increase in the
number of weekly released working papers on average reduces downloads, abstract views, and
media attention for each paper. Subsequent publishing and citation outcomes are harmed as well.
Furthermore, descriptive evidence on viewership and downloads suggests working papers
significantly substitute for the dissemination function of publication. These results highlight
inefficiencies in the dissemination of economic research even among the most exclusive working
paper series and suggest large social losses due to the slow publication process.

1        Introduction

        Publishing in an economics journal takes a very long time (Hadavand et al., 2021). The mean time
from submission to a journal to its acceptance is over two years. The right tail of the distribution is even
more staggering, where one in 10 submissions take over three and a half years to acceptance (and over four
years to publication). These numbers stand in stark contrast to those from other social sciences (sociology,
psychology and political science) and the "hard" sciences, where the mean durations are 13 months and 6
months, respectively. Perhaps most concerning, top economics journals are extremely selective relative to
other fields,1 and these publication lag statistics ignore any rejections from prior journal submissions, and
so the true lifespan of a paper likely stretches across many years. With junior faculty facing tenure clocks
as short as five years, this publication lag has large implications for tenure and promotion (Conley et al.,
2013).2
        Such lengthy time to publication has obvious ramifications for the public dissemination of economic
research. In nearly all of academia outside of economics, results are not disseminated until after the comple-
tion of the peer review process. Economics, on the other hand, does not conform to this norm. Instead, many
economists release "working" versions of their papers, presenting preliminary findings to media outlets and
at research conferences. Junior faculty will often highlight working papers on their curriculum vitae, and
department's hiring and promoting decisions can hinge on a faculty's "pipeline" of working papers. Today,
econpapers.repec.org houses over 1 million working papers released across over 5,300 working
paper series. The widely-accepted practice of working papers in economics helps bypass its lengthy pub-
lication process, but comes with a potential drawback: With no barrier to entry or peer review, the field
of working papers could suffer from overcrowding, where each additional paper reduces the visibility and
viewership of "competing" research.3 Figure 1 suggests this potential issue could be especially pertinent
today, where the number of National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) working papers has steadily
increased since 2004, with a drastic increase in releases in 2020 during the pandemic. Despite their ubiquity
in economics, only a handful of studies have explicitly investigated the potential benefits and drawbacks of
working paper series.4
    1
      The average acceptance rate into the "Top Five" is six percent, whereas the average across three top social science journals and
two top natural science journals is 10 percent and 15 percent, respectively (Hadavand et al., 2021).
    2
      One reason for the substantial lags in economics reviewing is that journal editors often require multiple sequences of referee
reports. Many submissions require up to five revisions before acceptance (Ellison, 2002; McAfee, 2010). Hadavand et al. (2021)
provide a detailed exercise into potential culprits for publication lags, and their evidence largely points toward author dilatory
behavior in resubmitting revisions.
    3
      Several studies have investigated media competition for customer attention and the consequences of "information overload"
(e.g. Van Zandt, 2004; Anderson and De Palma, 2009, 2012).
    4
      These include Feenberg et al. (2017) who use nearly identical data as our study to investigate ordering effects in weekly releases



                                                                   2
    In this study, we investigate questions related to the efficiency of the dissemination of economic research
via working papers by focusing on the NBER working paper (WP) series. Focusing on the NBER WP series
is advantageous for several reasons. First, it is largely regarded as the premier WP series in economics,
producing what is likely the most important and impactful research via working papers in the profession.
Second, only NBER affiliates are allowed to release papers on the NBER WP series, and NBER affiliates
are a highly selected group of economists. Thus, the NBER WP series does possess a barrier to entry that
may serve as a substitute for peer review - NBER authors produce papers that are presumably more likely
to publish (in better regarded journals) than others. Therefore, any evidence of inefficiencies in the NBER
WP series is likely to understate potential inefficiencies in the profession overall.
    A final advantage to studying the NBER WP series comes from how the NBER disseminates papers.
Throughout the course of each week, NBER affiliates submit their working papers to the NBER without
knowing how many other papers have been submitted that week. Then, on Monday of the following week,
all submissions are released together and distributed to subscribers. Hence, these weekly releases generate
plausibly exogenous variation in the "crowdedness" of the working paper space. As such, any systematic
variation within the calendar year in both research productivity and quality can be accounted for in models
with higher dimensional time fixed effects (e.g. week-of-year fixed effects), with only idiosyncratic variation
remaining.
    Overall, our results show strong evidence that the NBER WP series suffers from overcrowding: An
increase in the number of weekly released working papers harms each individual paper's outcomes.5 In the
short run, papers experience significantly fewer abstract views and paper downloads as the number of weekly
released WPs increases. This effect is particularly sharp in the first several months of the paper's release.
Using data from Altmetric, a company that tracks academic papers across news outlets, blogs, and social
media (e.g. Twitter), we find that NBER WPs also receive less media attention when the number of weekly
NBER WPs increases. Doubling the number of weekly releases reduces a paper's probability of being
covered in the media by over 30%. Further highlighting the importance of these dissemination findings, we
find that the NBER WP version of eventually-published papers receives more downloads and abstract views
than their published counterpart. Thus, working versions of papers substitute for the dissemination function
of the publication process, yet suffer from idiosyncratic variation in the crowdedness of the working paper
of NBER working papers (e.g. papers listed first on the weekly release receive more attention than papers listed second). Novarese
and Wilson (2013) study similar hypotheses as Feenberg et al. (2017) but utilize data from Research Papers in Economics (RePEc).
A recent working paper from Ziegler (2021) also utilizes NBER working paper data to investigate the extent to which economic
research is covered in the media.
    5
      Our main sample focuses on working papers released through 2019 in order to avoid any confounding issues with the pandemic.
When focusing on publication and citation outcomes, we restrict our sample to papers released through 2017.



                                                                3
space.
        Perhaps most importantly, we also find that publication prospects and citations are harmed from over-
crowding. Doubling the number of weekly NBER WPs reduces a paper's probability of publishing by over
4%. Interestingly, we find no effects on the "quality" of the publishing journal, suggesting a net loss in
publishing outcomes for papers when released with a greater number of peer papers. Subsequent citations
drop as well: doubling the number of NBER releases reduces citations by approximately 7.5%. Despite the
highly selected sample of NBER papers, we find that 26% of NBER WPs never publish.
        Overall, our results highlight a major shortcoming to the profession's dependence on working paper se-
ries. Given the exclusivity of NBER, it is likely that non-NBER authors suffer from even steeper challenges
in dissemination and crowdedness of working papers.



2        Data and Institutional Setting

        Our study draws upon three data sets. The first comes from publicly available information on the Na-
tional Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) website. The NBER is a network of over 1,500 prominent
economists who hold academic appointments in North American institutions. These economists are admit-
ted into the NBER through a highly selective process.6 The central purpose of the NBER is to disseminate
recent, high quality, academic research conducted by economists. The primary method through which the
NBER disseminates research is through its working paper (WP) series. Each week, NBER affiliates sub-
mit their working papers to the NBER WP series for release on the following Monday. Importantly, when
an affiliate submits a paper, they have no knowledge of how many other papers have also been submitted
that same week. Each year, over 1,200 WPs are released to over 900 subscribing organizations and many
more subscribing individuals. NBER WPs are explicitly not (yet) peer reviewed when they are submitted
to the series. For our study, we collect information on the week that each paper was released, the NBER
program(s) the paper was submitted under, and a draft of the paper itself.
        Second, we match each NBER WP to its webpage on RePEc (Research Papers in Economics).7 While
the NBER is often regarded as the primary distributor of high quality working papers in economics, RePEc.
org is often regarded as the lead distributor of all research (working and published papers) in economics.
The website houses about 2.8 million research pieces from 3,200 journals and 5,000 working paper se-
ries with over 55,000 registered authors. We use data from RePEc to measure abstract views, downloads,
citations, and publication outcomes for each paper.

       Lastly, we use data from Altmetric.com to detect potential media attention for each NBER WP.
Altmetric is a company devoted to tracking how much online attention academic articles receive. Altmetric
records attention for individual papers across an array of media sources, including the news, blogs, and
social media (e.g. Twitter). Their measures additionally include how many people have been exposed to and
engage in individual papers. Each NBER WP is provided a public identifier that matches with Altmetric's
database. We use the Altmetric database to measure whether a paper received any media attention, how
many media sources discussed the paper, and Altmetrics overall "attention score". The attention score is a
weighted measure based on the volume of media attention, types of sources (e.g., newspaper vs. Twitter),
and the types of authors (e.g., other scholars vs. journal website).


2.1      Descriptive statistics

       Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for our sample of NBER WPs. In total we observe 16,403 WPs
released across 799 weeks from 2004 to 2019. The first panel of Table 1 presents our outcomes of interest.
On average, NBER WPs receive 43 abstract views and 35 downloads on RePEc within the first six months
of the paper's release. Our next set of outcomes use data from Altmetric. About 15% of NBER WPs receive
some media attention.8 When focusing on number of media outlets as an outcome, we see that the majority
of NBER WPs that receive media attention do so in only one outlet. We also see a mean and standard
deviation of 1.49 and 11.27, respectively, in Altmetric's Attention Score. Turning to publication and citation
outcomes, we see that 74% of NBER WPs subsequently publish, and on average they accumulate over 19
citations on RePEc.9
       The second panel of Table 1 describes our model covariates. The primary covariate of interest is pre-
sented in the first row, "# of (weekly) NBER WPs," which captures the total number of NBER WPs that
were released in a specific week. On average, the NBER WP series releases 23.5 papers every week during
our time frame. The data also include information on the authors' prior NBER WP submissions. Overall
NBER authors are highly productive: the average number of prior NBER WPs written across authors on a
paper's release is roughly 15.5. NBER WPs on average have 2.5 co-authors, and contain 16,195 words. Fi-
nally, each WP is submitted under at least one NBER program. The most popular NBER programs include
Economic Fluctuations and Growth (21%), Labor Studies (21%), and Public Economics (20%).
   8
      This percentage is similar to the media coverage of NBER WPs in Ziegler (2021), who estimates roughly one in 11 NBER
WPs receives some media attention within a month of its release.
    9
      We focus on papers released through 2017 when focusing on publication and citation outcomes in order to allow adequate time
for each NBER WP to publish and accumulate citations.




                                                               5
3    Econometric Specifications

    Our main specification estimates the following equation:


                     Ypwy =  +  [ln(Num NBER WP)]wy + w + y + Xp +                  pwy                   (1)


    where each NBER WP p is released on a specific week w (one through 53) in year y (2004-2019). We
consider several outcomes for Y including abstract viewership and paper downloads (within the first six
months of the paper's release), media attention, citations, and publication outcomes. Num NBER WPwy
measures the total number of NBER WPs that were released on week w in year y . w and y capture week
and year fixed effects, respectively, while our vector Xp include paper level controls such as the word count
of the paper, indicators for the NBER programs the paper was submitted under, the number of co-authors, the
average number of prior NBER WPs across the paper's authors, and the maximum number of prior NBER
WPs across the paper's authors. For ease of interpretation and comparison, we take the natural log of our
primary covariate Num NBER WPwy and all continuous outcomes (abstract views, downloads, number of
media outlets, Altmetric attention score, citations, and publication rank). Hence, if overcrowdedness harms
paper outcomes, then we'd expect a negative coefficient for  .
    This twoway fixed effect specification utilizes variation across week-years in the number of released
NBER WPs in order to isolate the effect of "crowdedness" on paper level outcomes. Year fixed effects
account for aggregate annual trends in the crowdedness of the NBER WP series and NBER WP quality.
Week fixed effects account for any weekly, across year trends in how many papers are released and paper
quality. This specification, paired with the institutional setting where NBER authors have no knowledge
of how crowded the WP space will be when their paper is released, effectively isolates the causal effect
of how the number of NBER WPs released each week affects each paper's outcomes. To illustrate the
randomness of our primary covariate, in Figure A1 we plot the residuals from a regression of the number
of weekly NBER WPs released on year and week fixed effects. We also later conduct several robustness
checks and placebo tests, including estimating models with and without paper level controls, replacing year
fixed effects with finer time fixed effects, testing various sample year cutoffs, and regressing future week
releases on present paper outcomes.

4         Results

4.1        Abstract views and downloads

         We begin with Table 2 which estimates two variants of specification (1) with the log of abstract views
and downloads within the first six months of the paper's release as outcomes. In the first column for each
outcome, we consider a model with only week and year fixed effects. In the second column for each
outcome, we test the robustness of the estimates to including paper level controls: word count of the paper,
indicators for the NBER programs the paper was submitted under, the number of co-authors, the average
number of prior NBER WPs across the paper's authors, and the maximum number of prior NBER WPs
across the paper's authors. Standard errors are clustered at the week-year level.
         Across both model specifications, we first find that an increase in the number of NBER WP weekly
releases reduces the number of abstract views for each paper. Estimates are precisely estimated at the 1%
level in the first model and at the 5% level in the second model. Focusing on the fully specified model
in column (2), we estimate that a doubling of the number of weekly releases leads to a nearly 5% drop in
abstract viewership for each paper. A similar pattern holds for paper downloads in columns three and four,
though estimates are slightly more noisy: A doubling of weekly releases decreases downloads by nearly 6%
(significant at the 10% level). Also worth noting are the coefficients on the paper controls: Papers written
by more productive authors (as proxied by author prior NBER history) tend to receive more abstract views
and downloads. In Figure A2, we estimate our full specification but break down the outcomes into two-
month time intervals to find that the effects of the size of the weekly NBER WP release dissipate over time,
disappearing after six months for abstract views and after two months for downloads.10


4.2        Media attention

         In this section, we utilize the Altmetric data to investigate media outcomes for each NBER WP. Table 3
presents the results for three outcomes of interest: 1) Whether the paper received any media attention, 2)
the log of the number of media outlets that covered the WP, and 3) the log of overall readership of the
WP as measured through Altmetric's Attention Score. The results across all three outcomes are large and
statistically significant at the 1% level, and paint a similar picture as our prior results: When the number of
weekly NBER WP releases increases, each paper experiences worsened outcomes. From column (2), we
    10
     As a heterogeneity test for whether different paper types are more or less likely to respond to the number of NBER WPs
released, in Table A1 we reproduce Table 2 but focus on the sample of papers which ex post published. The main estimates from
Table A1 are nearly identical to those in Table 2, suggesting the observed overcrowding effect equally harms higher and lower
quality papers (as proxied by ex post publication).



                                                             7
predict a 4.7 percentage point drop in the likelihood a paper receives any media attention in response to a
doubling of the number of weekly NBER WPs released. Given around 15% of NBER WPs receive media
attention, this translates to an over 30% drop in the probability of a paper receiving any media attention.
The corresponding drop from column (6) in the paper's Altmetric Attention Score, which aggregates overall
media attention, is 10.6%.


4.3      Publication and citations

       We finish our estimations of specification (1) by considering publication and citation outcomes for each
NBER WP. These results are presented in Table 4. Once again, we find consistent and robust evidence of
negative outcomes for papers when they were released with a higher number of peer NBER WPs. From
column (2), we estimate a 2.1 percentage point drop in the likelihood a paper publishes in response to a
doubling of the number of NBER WPs released. Given 74% of NBER WPs eventually publish, this effect
is equivalent to a nearly 3% decrease in publishing probability for each paper. The corresponding estimate
in column (4) suggests that citations drop by 7.5% when the number of weekly NBER WPs doubles. Both
of these estimates are precisely estimated at the 5% level.
       To test whether the quality of publication is also affected by overcrowding, we collected journal ranking
data from IDEAS aggregated all time journal rankings (ideas.repec.org/top/top.journals.
all.html). Approximately 88% of published papers did so in a "ranked" economics journal.11 In the
final two columns of Table 4, our outcome is the log of the published paper's journal rank. Across both
specifications, we find no evidence that the specific outlets of published journals differed in quality in re-
sponse to the number of NBER weekly releases. Thus, in total, increasing the crowdedness of the working
paper space reduces the likelihood a paper publishes without changing the quality of the journal outlet.12


4.4      Popularity of NBER working papers

       In this section, we provide several descriptive figures on NBER viewership in order to further highlight
the importance of the prior results. In Figure 2, we first take the sample of NBER WPs that ex post published.
We then plot average (a) abstract views and (b) downloads by month since the NBER WP's release (in red)
against the corresponding abstract views and downloads for the published version of the NBER WP since
publication (in blue). These results highlight two findings. First, abstract views for NBER WPs are slightly
  11
    The remaining 12% published as books, in conference journals, or in journals outside of economics.
  12
    In Table A2, We replicate Table 4 while dropping all papers that published in unranked economics journals (i.e. papers that
published in books, in conference journals, or in non-economics journals). Our results remain robust to this sample: Increasing the
number of weekly NBER WPs reduces each paper's likelihood of publishing and subsequent citations.



                                                                8
higher than their published counterpart. Second, NBER WP downloads drastically outpace downloads from
the published version, with twice the number within the first year of release.13
      These patterns first highlight how working papers have come to substitute for the dissemination function
of journal publication. This is perhaps unsurprising - working papers come out prior to the publication, and,
thus, carry more novelty with the findings. Moreover, working paper series typically have fewer barriers of
access, whereas most journals require some form of subscription or payment. These patterns additionally
highlight the importance of working papers overall - if a central purpose of academic research is to dissemi-
nate findings, then it is of great importance that we understand how working papers have come to substitute
for publications and how efficient working paper series are in reaching audiences.
      Another potential concern with a reliance on working papers is that they (typically) have not yet been
through a peer review process. Consequently, any academics, media, and policy makers basing their deci-
sions on working papers are doing so on unvetted, potentially less reliable findings. Similar to Figure 2, in
Figure 3 we plot a time series of abstract viewership statistics and downloads of NBER WPs by whether
the paper ex post published. Interestingly, as quickly as month two for abstract views and month three for
downloads, NBER WPs that ex post published receive a greater audience than those that never publish. As-
suming readers are more interested in higher quality (more likely to publish) papers, this reveals that prior
to publication, readers on average are able to identify higher quality studies. In other words, even though all
NBER WPs have equal audiences, those that eventually publish garner more attention. This suggests that
readers of the NBER WP series are vetting paper quality on their own, shifting viewership towards higher
quality, more likely to publish WPs. Thus, overall there is perhaps less of a concern that working papers
have yet to have gone through the peer review process.


4.5     Robustness checks and placebo tests

      In this section, we consider several robustness checks and placebo tests. First, our primary model es-
timates week fixed effects, which control for any seasonalities that vary at the week level across all years.
This control would not be adequate in situations where there are any season-year specific shocks that both
1) lead to a greater number of NBER WPs released and 2) produce lower quality papers (which inherently
experience worse outcomes). For example, from Figure 1 we can see a huge jump in NBER WP releases
soon after the outbreak of Covid - if these papers are also systematically lower quality, then week and year
  13
     One caveat to this juxtaposition is that we rely strictly on viewership within RePEc.org. It is possible that viewers attain
working papers from different sources from published papers. For instance, this juxtaposition will undersell viewership of published
versions of manuscripts if more people view published articles straight from the journal's website (or through printed versions)
compared to viewers of NBER manuscripts straight fromm the NBER website.



                                                                 9
fixed effects would not adequately control for this shock.14 A similar potential jump can be seen in the Fall
of 2007, just after the Great Recession. To account for these potential season-year shocks, in Table A3 and
Table A4 we re-estimate specification (1) but replace our year fixed effects with month-year and quarter-
year fixed effects, respectively. These models rely on variation in the NBER WP space across weeks within
each month-year and quarter-year, respectively, and thus account for any season-year specific shocks, so
long as the level of the shock is not finer than the month or quarter levels. The results from these models
confirm those from our main findings, and in fact generally produce more precise estimates (e.g. the effects
on publishing are significant at the 1% level from Table A3 and Table A4).
       Next, we test the sensitivity of the publishing and citation outcomes to different year cutoffs for our
sample. Recall that our primary analyses focused strictly on papers released through 2017 in order to allow
at least three years for each paper to be published and accumulate citations. In Table A5, we estimate our
full model but consider various year cutoffs, starting with 2015 and ending with the full sample (2019).
Our main estimates remain statistically significant across all sample selections. Moreover, estimates slowly
attenuate toward zero as the sample includes more recent years, further justifying a focus on earlier years
when investigating these outcomes.
       Since our data also include author identifiers for each paper, we can also estimate models with "author
fixed effects." However, since each paper observation can contain more than one author, and since not all
authors of NBER WPs have multiple NBER WPs, as a robustness check, we utilize author information by
estimating dummies for each author with two or more papers within our dataset. These dummy variables
switch on for each author of a single paper observation. For example, a paper with two authors who wrote
multiple NBER WPs will have two dummy variables switch on, one for each of the two authors. A total
of 5,574 authors of NBER WPs have written multiple NBER WPs, and so 5,573 dummy variables are
estimated. The results from this exercise are presented in Table A6. We find that our results remain robust to
this consideration, suggesting different types of authors are not any more or less likely to release their work
on weeks with more NBER WPs in total.
       As a placebo test, in Table A7 we estimate specification (1) but with the subsequent week's number
of NBER WPs released as the main covariate. Assuming no serial correlation, the future crowdedness of
the NBER WP space should have no impact on today's paper's outcomes. Indeed, across all seven of our
primary outcome variables, we fail to estimate a significant relationship between future NBER WP releases
and present NBER WP outcomes.
       Finally, an alternate potential explanation of our results is that a greater number of weekly NBER WP

                                                                10
releases may be correlated with some other week-level characteristic which itself is harming other paper's
outcomes. For example, it may be that on weeks when a superstar economist releases a NBER WP, readers
ignore the other NBER WPs (and weeks with a higher number of releases are more likely to contain a
superstar paper).15 In Table A8, we re-estimate specification (1) but replace our main covariate with a proxy
for this hypothesis - for each week, we calculate the maximum number of prior released NBER WPs across
that week's authors. The assumption then is that authors who release more NBER WPs tend to be more well-
known. Naturally, this measure will be correlated with our main covariate, the weekly number of NBER
WP releases. Still, across our seven outcomes, we only estimate statistical significance at the 10% level
for abstract views and downloads. Estimates for media attention and publication and citation outcomes are
precisely estimated zeroes. We thus conclude that our observed effects cannot be attributed to the presence
of a single superstar author, and are more likely driven by general crowdedness in the NBER WP space.



5         Conclusions

         This study examines the efficiency of the dissemination of economic research via working papers. To do
so, we utilize data from the NBER WP series, which is largely regarded the premier WP series in economics.
The NBER's dissemination process creates a natural experiment where weekly releases generate exogenous
variation in the "crowdedness" of the working paper space.
         Results show strong evidence that economics working papers suffer from overcrowding: Increases in the
number of weekly released NBER WPs harms individual paper outcomes. Papers receive significantly fewer
abstract views and downloads, particularly in the first several months of the paper's release. We also find
negative effects from overcrowding on media attention, publication prospects, and the number of citations .
Doubling the number of weekly NBER WPs reduces a paper's probability of receiving media coverage by
30%, while the chance of publishing decreases by nearly 3% and the number of citations decreases by 7.5%.
We find no effect on the "quality" of the publishing journal, suggesting a net loss in publishing outcomes
for papers when released with a greater number of peer papers.
         Overall, our results highlight a major shortcoming to the profession's dependence on working paper se-
ries. Given to the highly selected nature of NBER affiliates, which creates a barrier to entry to the NBER WP
series, our results likely understate the potential inefficiencies in the dissemination of economics research.
    15
     Such an effect is akin to that of Brown (2011), who finds that the mere presence of Tiger Woods in a golf tournament harms
the performance of other golfers. Of course, in our setting papers are not directly competing with each other, and authors have no
ability to know which other papers and authors they will be paired with ahead of time.

Notes: For each month since January 2004, we first calculate the average number of weekly NBER WPs released. The
figure then plots a simple three month moving average of this measure.

       Notes: Observations unique at the paper level. Table tests various sample restrictions by year to allow adequate time for publication
       and citation accumulation. The primary covariate of interest "# of NBER WPs" measures the total number of released NBER
       WPs during the week that an observed paper was released. All regressions additionally control for manuscript length (in number of
       words). Indicator for "Published" scaled to 0 or 100 for ease of interpretation; for example, from column (5), doubling the number of
       weekly NBER WPs reduces a paper's likelihood of publishing by 1.7 percentage points. Standard errors clustered at the week-year
       level.

       Notes: Observations unique at the paper level. For the placebo test, we take the subsequent week's "# of NBER WPs," which measures the total number
       of released NBER WPs during the subsequent week that an observed paper was released. All regressions additionally control for manuscript length (in
       number of words). Standard errors clustered at the week-year level.

       Notes: Observations unique at the paper level. The primary covariate of interest "Weekly max(# of prior NBER WPs)" measures the maximum number of previously
       released NBER WPs across that week's authors. All regressions additionally control for manuscript length (in number of words). Standard errors clustered at the
       week-year level.

Notes: Each point reflects a separate regression where the outcome differs by the time frame of accumulated abstract
views or downloads. For example, the first point in (a) comes from specification (1) where the outcome is the log of
abstract views within the first two months of the paper's release. The second point covers abstract views within four
months of the paper's release. 95% confidence intervals included.
